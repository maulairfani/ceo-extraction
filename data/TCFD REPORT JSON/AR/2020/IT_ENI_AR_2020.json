Eni aims to contribute, directly or indirectly, to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations 2030 Agenda, supporting a just energy transition, which responds with concrete and economically sustainable solutions to the challenges of combating climate change and giving access to energy in an efficient and sustainable way, for all.\n\nEni organically combines its business plan with the principles of environmental and social sustainability, extending its range of action along three pillars:\n\n- 1. operational excellence;\n- 2. carbon neutrality by 2050;\n- 3. alliances for development .\n- 1. First of all, Eni business is constantly focused on operational excellence . This translates into an ongoing commitment to valuing people, safeguarding both the health and safety of people and asset integrity, protecting the environment, integrity and respect for human rights,  resilience  and  diversification  of  activities  and  ensuring  sound  financial  discipline. These elements allow the company to seize the opportunities related to the possible evolutions of the energy market and to continue on the path of transformation.\n- 2. Second, Eni's business model envisages a decarbonization path towards carbon neutrality based on an approach oriented to emissions generated throughout the life cycle of energy products and on a set of actions that will lead to the total decarbonization of processes and products by 2050. This path, achieved through existing technologies, will allow Eni to totally reduce its carbon footprint, both in terms of net emissions and in terms of net carbon intensity.\n- 3. The third guideline refers to alliances for the promotion of development through the enhancement of the resources of the Countries where it operates, promoting access to electricity and promoting Local Development Programmes (LDPs) with a broad portfolio of initiatives in favour of communities. This distinctive approach, referred to as Dual Flag, is based on collaborations with other internationally recognized players in order to identify the needs of communities in line with the National Development Plans and the United Nations 2030 Agenda. Eni is also committed to creating job opportunities and transferring its knowhow and expertise to its local partners.\n\nEni's business model is developed along these three pillars by leveraging internal expertise, the development and application of innovative technologies and the digitalization process. A fundamental element of the business model is the Corporate Governance system, inspired by the principles of transparency and integrity, outlined further in the Governance section.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The COVID-19 pandemic affected everybody's lives, every activity and the energy industry with a magnitude that exceeded all previous crises. The trading environment in 2020 saw the largest oil demand drop in history, down by an estimated 9%.\n\nIn tackling COVID-19, we reacted fast, finding inside our Company the energy, resources and flexibility to overcome this crisis. First, we implemented effective measures to preserve the health of the 60,000 people who work within Eni and with Eni at all our offices and production hubs, as well as to ensure the continuity of our operations also through the involvement of our suppliers. Furthermore, in collaboration with local authorities, Eni has taken immediate action to reorient local development projects to better respond to the urgent needs of the most vulnerable populations.\n\nDuring the most acute phase of the downturn, we have taken decisive measures to strengthen the financial and capital resilience of the company, defining clear priorities in the cash allocation. Through the review of our short-medium term plans we have reduced the disbursements for  costs and capital expenditure by \u20ac8 billion in the period 2020-2021, thus reshaping the production growth profile. We have defined an innovative dividend policy, based on a fixed component, which will be reassessed going forward based on the achievement of Eni's industrial objectives, and a variable component linked to the scenario, in order to adapt the dividend to market volatility, while the buy-back has been suspended.\n\nThanks to these actions, we were able to generate an adjusted cash flow of \u20ac6.7 billion, able to fund 100% of our organic capital expenditure, which were revised to \u20ac5 billion, leaving a surplus of \u20ac1.7 billion despite the large impact of the crisis on our cash receipts which contracted by around \u20ac6 billion compared to the forecasts at the beginning of the year.\n\nThe Company, also leveraging the issuance of two hybrid bonds for a total amount of \u20ac3 billion, has successfully overcome the worst phase of the downturn, retaining the leverage within the management comfort zone at 0.3 as of December 31, 2020 and achieving to keeping our net debt flat versus last year. These actions, sustained from our credit standing, were clearly appreciated by the financial markets.\n\nDespite the crisis, we have improved and accelerated our decarbonization strategy and today we announce the even more ambitious goal of zeroing all our emissions (Scope 1, 2 and 3) linked to the entire life cycle of all the products traded by our organization by 2050.\n\nIn this context, in June 2020 we reshaped Eni's organization by setting up two new Business Groups: Natural Resources, which will maximize the value of Eni's Oil & Gas upstream portfolio from a sustainable perspective, with the objective of reducing its carbon footprint by scaling up energy efficiency and the development of projects for the capture and storage of carbon dioxide, and the Energy Evolution, which will focus on growing the businesses of power generation, transformation and marketing of products from fossil to bio, blue and green. The two Business Groups will work in synergy with the help of R&D and digitalization to implement Eni's plans and to achieve Eni's decarbonization goals by 2050.\n\nThe businesses of Natural Resources, together with traditional refining, were those most affected by the industry crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite a 35% drop in the Brent price, E&P generated a robust cash contribution thanks to the resilience of the asset portfolio characterized by low break-even and the flexibility of our development projects that allowed us to re-phase some activities and contain capex. Exploration, one of our main growth and value generation drivers, achieved excellent results in 2020. Despite the reduction in capital expenditure of about 50%, we discovered 400 mmboe of new resources, at a competitive\n\n<!-- image -->",

In this context, we made several near-field discoveries in Egypt, Tunisia, Norway, Algeria and Angola, in this latter the Agogo appraisal well has estimated 1 bboe in place, that will allow us to extend the useful life of the FPSO of operated Block 15/06.\n\nImportant results were also obtained in frontier exploration basins with the Mahani gas and condensates discovery in the onshore of the Emirate of Sharjah (UAE), where we made the FID at the beginning of 2021, just one year after the signing of the contract; the appraisal of the Ken Bau field offshore Vietnam, which allowed us to outline a giant field, and the discovery of Saasken offshore Mexico, which consolidates our position in the Country. The importance of these successes opens up opportunities to early monetization of the discovered resources through the deployment of our dual exploration model.\n\nOne of our competitive advantages is the ability to reduce the time-to-market of reserves, which together with efficient  exploration  helps  to  ensure  a  resilient  asset  portfolio  to  the  scenario.  Our  success  leverages  on  an original development model based on the parallelization of phases (appraisal, pre-development, engineering), a modular approach that provides for accelerated start-up in early production and subsequent ramp-up, minimization of financial exposure and insourcing of critical project phases (detailed engineering, production supervision, commissioning/hook-up) in order to apply our skills and know-how. Examples of this approach were the rapid production ramp-up of the Area 1 hub in Mexico in 2020 (from 4 kboe/day in 2019 to 14 kboe/day, up by 200%), the start-up of Agogo in Angola, just nine months from the discovery and the Berkine project in Algeria, carried out with a fast-track approach, allowing the monetization of proximity reserves.\n\nOther activities during the year concerned the optimization of the production plateau of assets in operation in order to counteract natural declines.\n\nOverall, discounting the reduction in capital expenditure of around \u20ac2 billion, E&P development helped to ensure a solid production level of 1.73 mmboe/day with the crisis cutting about 200 kboe, net of which we would have exceeded our initial expectations.\n\nThe emission intensity of the operated productions (100%) decreased in 2020 by about 25% compared to 2014, in line with the reduction target of 43% by 2025. The global emissions calculated on equity production were equal to approximately 14.4 million tonnes of CO 2 , which was reduced to 12.9 million thanks to the carbon sink obtained from our participation to the REDD+ Luangwa Community Forest Project in the Republic of Zambia, where Eni achieved its first generation of carbon credits that have been used to offset emissions equivalent to 1.5 million tonnes of CO 2 .\n\nThe ramp-up of the projects designed to valorize or manage routine gas otherwise sent to flaring allowed us to reduce the flaring volumes of the 2014 baseline by 37% at the end of 2020 and we confirm their zeroing by 2025, contributing to Eni's decarbonization objectives. Other drivers of our decarbonization process are the projects in the start-up phase for the CO 2 geological capture and sequestration using depleted fields. The first milestone of this kind of projects was achieved with the award by the British Oil & Gas authority of the license for the CO 2 storage project in the Liverpool Bay, which will contribute to the decarbonization of industrial areas of the north-west England and North Wales, as well as progress in the start-up of a pilot project, for which we expect to make shortly a final investment decision, to build a hub for the capture and sequestration of CO 2 at our depleted gas fields offshore Ravenna (Italy).\n\nFinally, we are developing an innovative approach in the capex evaluation process, systematizing information on the United Nations 17 Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs), in order to integrate these aspects into planning and strategies. After a first testing phase on a sample of investments in the upstream sector, the scope of analysis will be extended to other types of projects.\n\nThe Global Gas & LNG Portfolio (GGP) sector reported an adjusted EBIT of \u20ac0.33 billion, above our expectations despite the significant decline in European gas demand and the collapse in Asian LNG consumption during the peak of the crisis. The sustainability of the GGP result is due to the overall restructuring of long-term gas supply and transportation contracts, as well as to portfolio optimization activities by exploiting the flexibility and optionality of our gas assets.",

The result was supported by the increase in volumes processed (up by 130%) and margins of biodiesel thanks to the ramp-up of the Gela green refinery and the performance of the Venice one, as well as by the steady contribution from the retail marketing thanks to the efficiency of the network and customer care. The evolution process of the service station continues towards the expansion of mobility services in support of the results that will leverage the consolidation of agreements with Amazon, Poste and Telepass, the launch of the new Eni Caf\u00e8 Emporium format and the launch of the 'Eni Parking' project.\n\nThe Chemical business leaded by Versalis has overall withstood the impact of the significant contraction in consumption of plastics due to the economic crisis thanks to the restructuring carried out in recent years in the traditional business lines, while we progressed the expansion in the green and circular economy businesses, which going forward will lessen the exposure of Versalis to the oil cycle. An upgrade is ongoing at the Crescentino site, a strategic hub for the production of electricity and chemical feedstock entirely coming from residual biomass that does not compete with the food supply chain on the basis of one of the most advanced proprietary technologies in the industry, of which one of the first practical application was the production of a bioethanol-based disinfectant based on the WHO formulation for health emergency.\n\nInvestments continued to bring plastic waste recycling technologies to an industrial scale. Versalis is already active in the mechanical recycling of used plastic with the 'Revive' line of polyethylene/styrenics which in 2020 was expanded thanks to the alliance with Forever Plast to promote the development and marketing of a new range of compact polystyrene products made out of recycled packaging. For the non-recoverable part of plastic waste (Plasmix), processes of chemical recycling based on pyrolysis are in a developing stage, which will be applied in a pilot plant in Mantua for the production of chemical raw materials or, in synergy with refining, in synthesis gas transformation technologies for the production of hydrogen or other industrial feedstocks. Furthermore, thanks to the alliance with the British research company AlphaBio Control, we are developing products for agriculture from renewable sources, such as herbicides and biocides, in synergy with the production of active ingredients by our renewable chemistry platform in Porto Torres, Sardinia.\n\nEni gas e luce (EGL), Power & Renewables segment performed strongly. EGL reported a 17% growth in EBIT thanks to the retention of the customer base, which grew to 9.6 million delivery points (up by 150 thousand), the incremental contribution of non-commodity services/products, the efficiency of marketing and power optimization. The retail gas business is increasingly opening up to decarbonization and innovation with the acquisitions of Evolvere Group, in order to expand the offer of green products and partnerships with Tate in Italy and OVO in France for the enhancement of digital services.\n\nThe Renewables business reached a first milestone with 1 GW of generation capacity installed or under development. The growth took place both internally and by leveraging selective M&A transactions such as those in the USA market in partnership with Falck Renewables for the acquisition of 112.5 MW of renewable capacity (wind/ solar) and 57 MW of photovoltaic capacity taken over by Falck itself. The internal growth leverages on the original Eni development model which exploits the technical-operational synergies with existing assets, both active such as the E&P oil centers and dismissed sites reclaimed and cleaned by Eni Rewind which are revamped through the installation of green generation capacity. In this context, the photovoltaic units of Porto Torres and Volpiano were started up in 2020.\n\nThe growth of renewables will be supported in the medium-term by the realization of the opportunities associated with our strategic partnerships in the USA and with HitecVision (V\u00e5r Energi's Norwegian partner) and the newly established Vargron joint venture, which will target the offshore wind sector of Norway and the Nordic markets by leveraging V\u00e5r Energi's experience in the upstream sector and supporting its decarbonization process. Eni acquired a 20% of the Dogger Bank project (A and B) offshore UK, which will build and operate a 2.4 GW wind facility, which will be the largest of its kind, with first phase start-up expected in 2023; in Italy three projects have been authorized from Asja Environment for the construction of onshore wind farms with a total capacity of 35 MW.\n\nAnother medium-term development driver is the exploitation of renewable energy deriving from the wave motion of  the  sea  which,  starting  from  the  industrial  collaboration  with  Italian  companies such CDP, Fincantieri and Terna, is further strengthened with the entry as lead partner in Ocean Energy Europe, the largest European organization for energy development from the ocean.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Another field of great interest is research on green hydrogen: we are studying, in partnership with Enel, the construction of electrolyzers powered by renewable energy in synergy with our refineries. Pilot projects with electrolyzers of around 10 MW are expected to start generating green hydrogen in 2022-2023.\n\nIn conclusion, our company was able to withstand this global economic crisis of 2020, retaining a healthy balance between cash inflows and outflows and at the same time making strong progress on the path towards achieving carbon neutrality in the long term.\n\nOur performance in transitioning to a low carbon business model has been appreciated by well-established ESG ratings agencies on the marketplace which recognized us leading four international ratings: MSCI, Sustainalytics, Bloomberg ES and V.E Vigeo Eiris. We received high-scorings from CDP Climate Change, CDP Water Security and in the Transition Pathways Initiative rating. We have also been confirmed within the FTSE4Good Developed index and, starting from 2020, also in the ESG iTraxx index. Added to these is the recognition by specialized research institutes such as Carbon Tracker, which ranked Eni first among its peers for the competitiveness of the unsanctioned portfolio of projects, target of emissions reduction and the adoption of a medium-long term price scenario that is one of the most conservative among the peers. Finally, Eni confirms its leadership in the approach to human rights, ranking first among the 199 companies evaluated by the Corporate Human Rights Benchmark (CHRB) in 2020, ex aequo with only one other company.\n\n## Strategy and action plan 2021-2024\n\nOur strategy outlines a non-reversible path of business transformation, which will lead us to the 'zero net emissions' goal in our production processes and in the use of our products by end consumers (Scope 1, 2 and 3) by 2050, placing the most challenging ambitions of the Paris Agreement at the center of our action, in order to contribute to the achievement of the UN's 17 Sustainable Development Goals and to create sustainable value for all our stakeholders. The evolution of our industrial structure will leverage on the decarbonization of our products and industrial processes, on diversifying and expanding our presence in the retail and renewables businesses, which will be combined into a single entity to maximize synergies, in bioproducts and in circular economy. These actions coupled with financial and capital discipline will underpin the Company's resilience to the volatility of the scenario.\n\nConsidering the uncertainties and risks of the post-pandemic recovery, we defined a set of actions for the next four years aimed at further reducing our cash neutrality and growing in green, blue and bioproducts.\n\nThe operational program of Natural Resources is aimed at maximizing cash generation and reducing the carbon footprint of the business.\n\nThe exploration phase, with an annual expenditure ceiling of approximately \u20ac400 million over the next four years, will develop along the guidelines for the reduction of the discovery cycle with near-field/incremental initiatives with rapid return in mature super-basins and proven areas, selective renewal of the portfolio and alignment of resources replacement to the targeted long-term production mix. Frontier exploration will be carried out in selected areas according to the principles of operatorship and high working interest, in order to apply the dual exploration model in the event of substantial successes. The goal is to discover around 2 billion boe of reserves at competitive costs over the four-year period with activities concentrated in North Africa, West Africa, Norwegian offshore and border areas in the Middle East, East Africa, Southeast Asia and the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nThe development of hydrocarbon reserves with an average annual expenditure of about \u20ac4 billion, equally divided between support for plateaus and growth initiatives, will favor assets with high cash generation and low breakeven, achieving an average annual growth rate in the four-year period of around 4% to a plateau of 2 mmboe/day by 2024, of which around one third from new developments (ramp-ups, start-ups and near-field discoveries). The main drivers of growth will be the increase in gas volumes of the Zohr project in Egypt for which the relative capacity is already online, the start-up of Merakes in Indonesia and Coral LNG in Mozambique gas fields, the developments in the Norwegian offshore by our JV V\u00e5r Energi, the full-field development of Area 1 in Mexico and the Dalma Hub\n\n<!-- image -->",

The planned development actions, together with a constant focus on efficiency, will allow us to reach a Brent capex coverage of 28 $/bbl at the end of the plan, 10 $/bbl less than the current level, while maintaining an adequate level of flexibility in the event of further shocks considering that more than 55% of our investments in the last two years of the plan are uncommitted.\n\nThe GGP business is expected to ensure stable cash flow over the four-year period by leveraging the integration with upstream and the monetization of our long-term gas supplies marketed in Europe. The main driver will be the development of LNG sales in the Middle/Far-East Asian premium markets with the aim of leverage a portfolio of contracted volumes of 14 MTPA in 2024. A growing part of LNG supplies that will cover 70% of the portfolio by 2024 will be equity gas from our production hubs in Indonesia, Mozambique, Nigeria, as well as Egypt where, thanks to the restructuring agreement of Union Fenosa Gas, we acquired an interest in the strategic LNG terminal of Damietta.\n\nThe operational program of Energy Evolution is based on the strategic guidelines of the development of renewable energy and the customer portfolio as well as the optimization of the industrial footprint, with cumulative investments of \u20ac7.9 billion over the four-year period.\n\nR&M will gradually reduce exposure to the traditional oil scenario in Europe characterized by structural weaknesses due to excess capacity and decline in consumption and volatile margins. The main actions will be increasing the efficiency and flexibility of oil-based assets, maximizing the potential of the investment in ADNOC Refining thanks also to the new trading platform and the development of the green business.\n\nThe biorefining capacity is expected to double to 2 mmtonnes/year by 2024. The production of biofuels will be increasingly sustainable due to the progressive elimination of the palm oil feedstock to the benefit of second generation oils not in competition with the food chain and others innovative feedstock (waste/residues) that will cover approximately 80% of the input by 2024. Service stations will be upgraded to enhance mobility services and expand the low carbon offer (methane, hydrogen and charging stations for electric vehicles).\n\nVersalis will focus on a more sustainable chemistry, circular economy projects such as recycled plastics and niche products to reduce the portfolio's exposure to the volatility of the cost of oil-based feedstock and to commodities characterized by competitive pressure and unstable margins.\n\nThe combined-cycle gas-fired power generation plants will be managed to maximize their value by leveraging greater efficiency and flexibility and the decarbonization of production with targeted investments and in synergy with the Group's initiatives.\n\nEGL will promote the growth and enhancement of the customer portfolio, leveraging integration with renewables, with the aim of exceeding 11 million supply points in 2024 and 15 million in 2030 thanks to an increasingly green offer and improving the consumer experience through innovation and digitalization. The other result drivers will be the expansion of extra commodity services, distributed photovoltaic generation and a constant focus on maintaining the efficiency of the operations.\n\nThe development of power generation capacity from renewable sources will take place both internally in synergy with our assets, and by harvesting the investment opportunities associated with our strategic partnerships: the JV with Falck Renewables for expansion into the US market, the alliance with 'CDP per l'Italia', entry into Norwegian offshore wind and participation in the Dogger Bank wind project in the British North Sea. The goal is to reach 4 GW of installed capacity by 2024 and 15 GW by 2030.\n\nIn addition to the development of power generation capacity from renewable sources, our decarbonization strategy will leverage the drivers of energy efficiency, forestry projects and the deployment of our negative emission technologies. Investments in the enhancement of gas and the digitalization of operations allow us to confirm our medium-term objectives of decarbonization of the upstream with the elimination of routine gas sent to process flaring and a reduction of 43% of the emission intensity relative to fully-operated productions from 2025 onwards. We are convinced that forest conservation can make an important contribution to the climate objectives of the Paris Agreement as well as the UN SDGs.\n\nIn this context, a series of projects are currently being sanctioned in Africa, Central-South America and South-East Asia which, when fully operational over the next ten years, will guarantee a portfolio of emission credits that will offset more than 6 mmtonnes of CO 2 by 2024 and more than 20 mmtonnes by 2030, the latter target based on the need of zeroing the Scope 1 and 2 emissions of our upstream sector by 2030 (calculated referring to production based on Eni's working interest) and to contribute to offsetting the emissions from other sectors.\n\nThe projects at a pre-development stage related to geological carbon capture storage/reuse (CCS/CCU) are the fruit of our core expertise in geology and our research laboratory for innovative solutions for the benefit of\n\n<!-- image -->",

We estimate a potential for avoided emissions through geological capture or re-utilization corresponding to approximately 15 MTPA by 2030 (7 MTPA net to Eni) when our ongoing initiatives will be brought at scale, including the large operated projects such as CCS Adriatic Blue at Ravenna and Liverpool Bay in the UK where we will leverage our existing infrastructures and depleted fields, as well as the CO 2 biofixation and mineralization CCU projects, to obtain valuable products expected to be launched on a pilot scale respectively in 2022-2023 at our hubs in Gela and Ravenna.\n\nAnother driver of growth and improvement of our carbon footprint will be the circular economy projects in which we will invest a significant amount of resources. The main initiatives will concern the ramp-up of chemical production from mechanical recycling of used plastics, the construction of a pilot plant for the chemical recycling of Plasmix and the construction with start-up in 2024 in the Porto Marghera hub of an industrial plant for the treatment of solid urban waste with the obtainment of bio-oil for manufacturing green diesel, based on our proprietary Waste-to-Fuel technology. In addition, in Ravenna, in a depleted and cleaned-up site owned by the Company, we will build a supply chain in collaboration with Herambiente for the circular treatment of waste from environmental and industrial activities with ramp-up up to 60 ktonnes/year, with a clear improvement in sustainability and emissions.\n\nOverall, in the next four years we expect a capex program of approximately \u20ac27 billion, of which approximately 20% relating to the business of the future (renewables and decarbonization/circular economy projects). Given the conservative scenario of a subdued recovery in the price of Brent oil up to 60 $/barrel in 2023-2024, we expect to generate approximately \u20ac44 billion of operating cash flow before working capital to cover planned capex, working capital needs and the floor dividend, leaving a progressively wider margin of discretionary cash flow to support the variable component of the dividend and to retain a strong balance sheet.\n\nBased on the Company's outlook and profitability prospects, we are able to improve the remuneration policy which provides for a floor dividend of \u20ac0.36 per share conditioned upon a Brent average of at least 43 $/barrel in the reference year, compared to the previously set threshold of 45 $/barrel, while a variable dividend is expected to be paid as an increasing percentage from 30 to 45% of the free cash flow generated in a scenario between 43 and 65 $/barrel. In addition, a \u20ac300 million/year buy-back program will be reactivated with a Brent price between 56 and 60 $/barrel, a lower level than the previous activation threshold. The buy-back will rise to \u20ac400 million/ year from 61 $/barrel and to \u20ac800 million/year from 66 $/barrel, as already planned.\n\nIn conclusion, after having successfully managed the global crisis of the sector in 2020 thanks to the quality of our assets and the ability of the organization to adapt and react, Eni is now ready to face the challenges of the next decade, of the post-pandemic recovery and the energy transition, being able to count on a clear vision of the future evolution of the Company, robust emission targets consistent with the Paris agreements and a well-defined path of growth in decarbonized products, as well as a progressive reduction of the weight of fossil fuels in the production portfolio. Proprietary technologies, business integration, digitalization and our competences will be the driving force behind this evolution.\n\nFinally, we would like to express particular thanks to the women and men of Eni who, despite the challenges of a dramatic year, have demonstrated, working remotely or at our production hubs, great teamwork, sense of duty and ability to adapt, guaranteeing the stability of the operations and reliability in supplies to communities, our customers and civil society ensuring continuity in a time of great upheaval.\n\nMarch 18, 2021\n\nLucia Calvosa\n\nChairman\n\nClaudio Descalzi\n\nChief Executive Officer and General Manager\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

In the space of a few months after the outbreak of the pandemic we reduced capital spending and limited the impact of the sharp drop in crude oil prices on the cash flow, strengthening our liquidity and preserving the robustness of our balance sheet. The upstream business is strengthening its recovery, while our businesses in the production and sale of decarbonized products achieved excellent results in the year, driven by a 17% Ebit increase from Eni gas e luce, a 130% increase in biorefining processing and 1 GW of new solar and wind generation capacity already installed or sanctioned. We laid foundations for strong growth in renewables by entering two strategic markets, the US and the Dogger Bank wind project in the UK's North Sea offshore wind market, which will be the largest in the world in the sector. Through leveraging the actions we put in place, our 2020 adjusted cash flow of \u20ac6.7 billion was able to finance our capex, with a surplus of \u20ac1.7 billion.

Very quickly, smart working was adopted by 99% of Eni employees in the main offices and by 70% of people engaged in our operational sites. These measures allowed to ensure continuity, without operational interruptions and asset integrity.\n- \uf0da Robustness of balance sheet: during the pandemic peak, management took decisive actions to increase the financial resiliency and strengthen the balance sheet, defining clear priorities in cash allocation. The Company is set to resume growing once the macro backdrop normalizes. Revised the Company's strategy and plans for the short-to-medium term leveraging on a reduction of \u20ac8 billion in the outlays for expenses and capital expenditures in the two-year period 2020-2021, more exposed to the downturn, with the subsequent reshaping of the growth profile of production and the definition of a dividend policy based on a fixed component, subject to a continuous re-evaluation process, following the achievement of certain Eni's industrial targets and a variable component  indexed to  the scenario, in order to adapt the dividend to market volatility; the share buy-back program is temporarily suspended.\n- \uf0da Organizational structure: in June 2020, Eni created a new organizational setup by establishing two business groups: the Natural Resources business which has the task of valorizing the Oil & Gas portfolio in a sustainable way and of managing the energy efficiency activities, the projects of CO 2 capture; and the Energy Evolution business which has the task of managing the evolution of businesses of power generation, manufacturing and marketing of products from fossil to bio, blue and green. The two business groups will work in synergy with R&D and digitalization department to realize Eni's plans and achieve the decarbonization targets to 2050.\n\nThanks to these actions, notwithstanding the significant impact of pandemic crisis on Group's cash flow, in 2020 the adjusted cash flow of \u20ac6.7 billion was able to finance 100% of net organic capex lowered to \u20ac5 billion (down by 35% vs. the original budget at constant exchange rates) due to the implemented optimizations, with a surplus of \u20ac1.7 billion. Opex were reduced by \u20ac1.9 billion compared to the pre-COVID-19 level, of which about 30% is structural. As of December 31, 2020, leverage was confirmed at 0.3 and net borrowings were in line with the comparative period, also due to the issuance of two hybrid bonds for \u20ac3 billion.\n\n## 2020: FAST REACTION TO COVID-19 CRISIS\n\n## PEOPLE HEALTH AND BUSINESS CONTINUITY\n\n| COSTS                                            | PORTFOLIO                                     | FINANCIALS                                   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| >35%  capex reduction vs. original 2020 guidance | FID  rescheduling  on large upstream projects | Leverage* in the comfort zone at about  0.3  |\n| -\u20ac1,9 bln  cost savings vs. pre-COVID-19 level   | Increased  capex on green  project            | First issuance  of  hybrid bonds  of  \u20ac3 bln |\n| NEW COMPANY ORGANIZATION                         | NEW COMPANY ORGANIZATION                      | NEW COMPANY ORGANIZATION                     |\n\n.",

For Eni, openness to listening and mutual exchange, inclusion, understanding of stakeholders' points of view and expectations and the sharing of choices are fundamental elements for building relationships based on mutual trust, transparency and integrity. To improve the knowledge and understanding of the views and expectations of the multiple stakeholders, in the different operating sites, since 2018 Eni has been supported by an IT platform called Stakeholder Management System (SMS). Since 2020, the system has been in use in all Eni's-operated industrial activities sites, monitoring the relationship with about 4,000 stakeholders. The SMS allows to understand the specificities of the local contexts, the possible needs, critical issues and improvement areas,  the main topics of interest, also identifying the potential impacts on Human Rights and  the possible presence of vulnerable groups and areas listed as cultural and/or natural interest sites by UNESCO (WHS - World Heritage Sites).\n\n| STAKEHOLDERS CATEGORIES

        "page_content": "Following the deep transformation of the Group which allowed to develop and diversify its portfolio aiming\n\nat strengthening the financial structure, Eni entered a new evolutionary phase of its business model. Eni's organization has been reshaped by setting up two new Business Groups: Natural Resources, which will maximize the value of Eni's Oil & Gas upstream portfolio from a sustainable perspective and develop projects for forestry conservation (REDD+) and CO 2 capture, and the Energy Evolution which will focus on growing the businesses of power generation, transformation and marketing of products from fossil to bio, blue and green. This new organizational setup represents a fundamental step for the implementation of Eni's 2050 strategy which combines value creation, business sustainability and economic and financial robustness.\n\nThe defined strategy aims at facing a complex contest requiring a triple connected challenge:\n\n- i) energy transition in progress;\n- ii)  efficient and sustainable management of traditional businesses ensuring high cash flow and returns and restructuring loss-making sectors;\n- iii) increasing shareholders value.\n\nTo face this scenario, the strategy defined in Eni's industrial plan lays the foundation on three pillars:\n\n- \uf0da decarbonization of activities and products in line with the targets announced to the market;\n- \uf0da diversification and development of retail and renewable activities, bioproducts and circular economy;\n- \uf0da enhancement of resilience and flexibility of our asset portfolio to absorb price volatility through assets optimization, selective growth and overhead costs cut.\n\nThis strategy will be implemented by leveraging on know-how, proprietary technologies and innovation and will allow to seize new opportunities for development and efficiency, as well as to further improve safety at work and actively contribute to the achievement of the 17 SDGs, on which Eni's mission is founded.\n\nThe evolution of Eni's business portfolio will significantly impact on the reduction of the carbon footprint, whose targets have been relaunched targeting the achievement of carbon neutrality by 2050.\n\nIn particular, Eni will pursue a strategy aiming to:\n\n- \uf0da net zero emissions (Scope 1, 2 and 3) and net zero carbon Intensity by 2050, relating to the life cycle of sold energy products;\n- \uf0da strengthen its role as a global player in the energy market by leveraging the mix of portfolio activities increasingly balanced and integrated;\n- \uf0da maximize the flexibility of its business portfolio, able to react to external market factors and at the same time ready to maximize its opportunities;\n- \uf0da strengthen its proactive role in the energy supply chain by enhancing in the medium to long-term its low carbon technologies for the production of decarbonized energy carriers;\n- \uf0da create shareholders value through a progressive remuneration policy.\n\nConfirmed and further improved intermediate targets to reach the complete carbon neutrality:\n\n- \uf0da net zero emissions (Scope 1, 2 and 3): -25% at 2030 vs. 2018 and -65% at 2040;\n- \uf0da net zero carbon intensity per unit of energy product sold: -15% at 2030 vs. 2018 and -40% in 2040;\n- \uf0da\n- net zero carbon footprint (Scope 1 and 2) of upstream activities accounted on equity basis by 2030, set a new target to halve at 2024 vs. 2018;\n- \uf0da net zero carbon footprint by 2040 for Eni's Scope 1 and 2 emissions at 2040.\n\n## Breakdown by business segment Long-term plan to 2050 and 2021-2024 action plan\n\n## EXPLORATION & PRODUCTION\n\nEni's upstream strategy aims at maximizing returns and cash generation by leveraging on the enhancement of the current asset portfolio, exclusively conventional, with lower break even, phased projects, accelerated time-to-market and limited exposure beyond the medium term.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Scope 1 and 2 emissions of upstream assets, calculated on the basis of equity production, are expected to be zero in 2030 by leveraging not only energy efficiency but also primary and secondary forest conservation projects ensuring the compensation of CO 2 emissions for about 20 million tons by 2030 and about 40 million tons per year by 2050.\n\nThe Group decarbonization targets will be reached through certain projects for the capture and geological sequestration of CO 2 with a target of about 50 million tons per year by 2050.\n\nThe 2021-24 action plan targets:\n\ngrowing cash generation and progressive reducing cash neutrality reaching Brent prices lower than 30 $/ barrel by leveraging:\n\n- \uf0da 2020-2024 production growth: 4% average growth rate benefitting from projects already started up or expected to be started up in the four-year period;\n- \uf0da capital discipline: capex at approximately \u20ac4.5 billion on average in the next four-year period with high flexibility (being more than 55% uncommitted capex in the 2023-2024 period);\n- \uf0da further development of integrated initiatives with the Global Gas & LNG Portfolio segment to enhance gas equity volumes;\n- \uf0da maximizing efficiency and business continuity;\n- \uf0da enhancement and development of exploration, with the aim of discovering 2 billion boe of resources at a unit cost of 1.6 $/barrel; exploration will be focused on areas not far from \"near-field\" production fields and existing or upcoming infrastructures.\n\nFree cash flow generation will be enhanced by the transformation of the assets portfolio through the disposal of non-strategic assets or with a higher breakeven and the focalization on high cash-generating assets, the set-up of new business combinations like the V\u00e5r Energi one, to reduce financial indebtedness and allow a faster assets growth.\n\nThese actions will allow to reach a 2021-2024 cumulative organic free cash flow of more than \u20ac18 billion.\n\n## GLOBAL GAS & LNG PORTFOLIO\n\nThe Global Gas & LNG Portfolio (GGP) will be focused on marketing of all non-oil equity products of Eni Group: gas, biomethan, blue energy and hydrogen, progressively reducing the non-equity share.\n\nIn the plan period, GGP will progress on the renegotiation of long-term gas supply portfolio in order to align certain conditions to the even more market volatility, to optimize logistic by reducing costs and leveraging on assets flexibility to maximize sale margins.\n\nThe other driver supporting growth and value creation is the expansion in the LNG business through development in new premium and growing markets in the Middle East/Far East also exploiting the possible synergies with the legacy market in Europe and the increasing integration with the upstream business for the enhancement of gas equity.\n\nThe expected contracted LNG volume portfolio will be equal to 14 million tons/y in 2024 (up 45% vs. 2020) with a gas equity share higher than 70%.\n\nThe value creation will also leverage on the maximization of cash generation from international gas transport assets.\n\nThe aforementioned actions will allow to achieve a 2021-2024 cumulative free cash flow of \u20ac0.8 billion.\n\n## REFINING & MARKETING\n\nThe Refining & Marketing strategy is focused on the development of biorefinery capacity, expected to almost double to 2 million tonnes by 2024 and further grow to 5-6 million tonnes/y in 2050.\n\nBiorefineries will benefit of second and third generation palm oil free in 2023. In the marketing business Eni intends to evolve the product mix marketed to our retail customers, with the aim to reach 100% of decarbonized products by 2050.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Risk Governance attributes a central role to the Board of Directors (BoD) which defines the nature and level of risk in line with strategic targets, including in evaluation process all those risks that could be consistent for the sustainability of the business in the medium-long term. The BoD, with the support of the Control and Risk Committee, outlines the guidelines for risk management, so as to ensure that the main corporate risks are properly identified and adequately assessed, managed and monitored, determining the degree of compatibility with company management consistent with the strategic targets.\n\nBOARD OF DIRECTORS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- (a) Director in charge of the internal control and risk management system.\n- (b) Including objectives on the reliability of financial reporting.\n- (c) Director Internal Audit reports hierarchically to the Board of Directors, and on its behalf, to the Chairman, without prejudice to the provisions relating to its\n- appointment, termination, remuneration and resources and his functional reporting to the Control and Risk Committee and to the CEO, as Director in charge of\n\nthe internal control and risk management system.\n\nCHAIRMAN\n\n<!-- image -->",

The analysis is based on the scope of the work and risks specific of each business area and processes aiming at defining an integrated risk management policy; the CEO also ensures the evolution of the IRM process consistently with business dynamics and the regulatory environment. Furthermore, the Risk Committee, chaired by the CEO, holds the role of consulting body for the latter with regards to major risks. For this purpose, the Risk Committee evaluates and expresses opinions, at the instance of CEO, related to the main results of the IRM process.\n\n## Integrated Risk Management Process\n\nThe IRM process ensures the detection, consolidation and analysis of all Eni's risks and supports the BoD to verify the compatibility of the risk profile with the strategic targets, also in a medium-long term approach. The IRM supports management in the decision-making process by strengthening awareness of the risk profile and the associated mitigations. The process, regulated by the 'Management System Guideline (MSG) Integrated Risk Management' is continuous, dynamic and includes the following sub-processes: (i) risk governance, methodologies and tools (ii) risk strategy, (iii) integrated risk management, (iv) risk knowledge, training and communication.\n\nThe IRM process starts from the contribution to the definition of medium and long-term plans and Eni's Strategic Plan ( risk strategy )  through the analysis of the risk profile and business opportunities underlying the plan and the long-term development, as well as the identification of proposals for de-risking objectives and strategic treatment actions.\n\nThe ' Integrated Risk Management '  sub-process includes: periodic risk assessment and monitoring cycles (Integrated Risk Assessment) in order to understand the risks taken on the basis of the strategic and medium-long term targets and the initiatives defined to achieve them; contract risk management and analysis aimed at the best allocation of the contractual responsibilities with the supplier and their adequate management in the operational phase; integrated analysis of existing risks in the Countries of presence or potential interest (ICR) which represents a reference for risk strategy, risk assessment and project risk analysis activities; support to the decision-making process for the authorization of investment projects and main transactions (Integrated Project Risk Management and M&A).\n\nThe risks are assessed with quantitative and qualitative tools considering both the likelihood of occurrence and the impacts that would occur in a defined time horizon when the risk occurs.\n\nThe assessment is expressed following an inherent and a residual level (taking into account the effectiveness of the mitigation actions) and allows to measure the impact with respect to the achievement of the objectives of the Strategic Plan and for the whole life as regards the business. The risks are represented on the basis of the likelihood of occurrence and the impact on matrices that allow their comparison and classification by relevance.\n\nIn 2020, two assessment sessions were performed: the Annual Risk Profile Assessment performed in the first half of the year, involving 121 subsidiaries in 43 Countries and the Interim Top Risk Assessment performed in the second half of the year, relating to the update of the evaluation and treatment of Eni's top risks and the main business risks. A specific focus regarded the analysis of the biological risk - COVID-19 pandemic considered both as a risk to people's health and as a systemic risk able to influence the Eni's risks portfolio, in particular, market, country and operational risks.",

        "page_content": "## Governance\n\nIntegrity and transparency are the principles that have inspired Eni in designing its corporate governance system 1 , a key pillar of the Company's business model. The governance system, flanking our business strategy, is intended to support the relationship of trust between Eni and its stakeholders and to help achieve business goals, creating sustainable value for the long-term. Eni is committed to building a corporate governance system founded on excellence in our open dialogue with the market and all stakeholders.\n\nFurthermore, in line with the principles defined by the Board of Directors, Eni is committed to creating a Corporate Governance system inspired by criteria of excellence, also participating in initiatives to improve it. Among other initiatives, during 2020, Eni participated in initiatives supported by national and international bodies and associations, including the Enacting Purpose Initiative, promoted by the Sa\u00efd Business School of the University of Oxford, to explore the theme of the purpose of business in terms of sustainability (the 'purpose').\n\nOn December 23, 2020, Eni's Board of Directors decided to adopt the new Corporate Governance Code 2020, with recommendations applying from January 1, 2021.\n\nThe new Code identifies 'sustainable success' as the objective that must guide the action of the management\n\nbody and which takes the form of creating long-term value for shareholders, taking into account the interests of other relevant stakeholders. Eni, however, has been considering the interest of stakeholders other than shareholders as one of the necessary elements Directors must evaluate in making informed decisions since 2006. With this in mind, we consider ongoing, transparent communication with stakeholders an essential tool for better understanding their needs. It is part of our efforts to ensure the effective exercise of shareholders' rights.\n\nIn 2020 Eni continued to pursue a dialogue with the market on matters of governance and to seize the opportunities deriving from studies and experience at the international level, in spite of the complications associated with the health emergency which prevented more immediate contacts, in particular with reference to the shareholders' meeting. In any case, shareholders were granted all legal rights and additional information tools in order to allow the greatest possible involvement.\n\n## The Eni Corporate Governance\n\n## Eni Corporate Governance model\n\nEni's Corporate Governance structure is based on the traditional Italian model, which - without prejudice to the role of the Shareholders' Meeting - assigns the management of the Company to the Board of Directors, supervisory functions to the Board of Statutory Auditors and statutory auditing to the Audit Firm.\n\n## Appointment and composition of corporate bodies\n\nEni's Board of Directors and Board of Statutory Auditors, and their respective Chairmen, are elected by the Shareholders' Meeting. To ensure the presence of Directors and Statutory Auditors selected by non-controlling shareholders a slate voting mechanism is used.\n\nEni's Board of Directors and Board of Statutory Auditors, whose term runs from May 2020 until the Shareholders' Meeting called to approve the 2022 financial statements, are made up of 9 and 5 members, respectively. Three directors and two standing statutory auditors, including the Chairman of the Board of Statutory Auditors, are elected by non-controlling shareholders, thereby giving minority shareholders a larger number of representatives than that provided for under law. In deciding the composition of the Board of Directors, the Shareholders' Meeting was able to take account of the guidance provided to investors by the previous Board with regard to diversity, professionalism, experience and competence, also with reference to corporate strategies, the Compa-\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Board of Statutory Auditors also prepared new shareholders' advice providing indications on the composition of the body in relation to the tasks it is called upon to perform. The composition of the Board of Directors and of the Board of Statutory Auditors is also more diversified in gender terms, in accordance with the provisions of applicable law and the By-laws. The latter was promptly amended to be compliant with the law in February 2020 in view of the renewal of the corporate bodies. In particular, for 6 consecutive terms the management and control bodies shall be composed of at least 2/5 of the less represented gender. Furthermore, based on the assessments carried out on May 14, 2020 on the appointment of the new bodies, the number of independent directors on the Board of Directors (7 2 of the 9 serving directors, of whom 8 are non-executive directors) remains greater than the number provided for in the Bylaws and by corporate governance best practices.\n\n## COMPOSITION OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- (a) Independence as defined by applicable law.\n- (b) Figures at December 31, 2020.\n\n## The structure of the Board of Directors\n\nThe Board of Directors appointed a Chief Executive Officer on May 14, 2020 and established four internal committees with advisory and recommendation functions: the Control and Risk Committee 3 , the Remuneration Committee 4 ,  the Nomination Committee and the Sustainability and Scenarios Committee. The Committees report, through their Chairmen, on the main issues they address at each meeting of the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors also retained the Chairman's major role in internal controls, with specific regard to the Internal Audit unit. In agreement with the Chief Executive Officer, the Chairman proposes the appointment, revocation and remuneration of its Head and the resources available to it, without prejudice to the support to the Board of the Control and Risks Committee and the Nomination Committee, to the extent of their competences,\n\n- (2) Independence as defined by applicable law, to which the Eni By-laws refer. Under the Corporate Governance Code in force at the time, 5 of the 9 serving directors were independent.\n\n(4) In line with the Recommendation of the Corporate Governance Code 2018, confirmed by the new Corporate Governance Code, the Rules of the Remuneration Committee require that at least one member shall have adequate expertise and experience in finance or compensation policies. These qualifications are assessed by the Board of Directors at the time of appointment. In this regard, on May 14, 2020 the Eni Board of Directors determined that all three members of the Committee have the appropriate expertise and experience. The level of expertise and experience of the Committee members therefore exceeds that provided for in the Committee Rules and Corporate Governance Code.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Among the Board of Directors' most important duties is the appointment of people to key management and control positions in the Company, such as the officer in charge of preparing financial reports, the Head of Internal Audit, the members of the Watch Structure. In performing these duties, the Board of Directors is supported by the Nomination Committee.\n\n## Reporting flows\n\nIn order for the Board of Directors to perform its duties as effectively as possible, the directors must be in a position to assess the decisions they are called upon to make, possessing appropriate expertise and information. The current members of the Board of Directors, who have a diversified range of skills and experience, including on the international stage, are well qualified to conduct comprehensive assessments of the variety of issues they face from multiple perspectives. The directors also receive timely complete briefings on the issues on the agenda of the meetings of the Board of Directors. To ensure this operates smoothly, Board meetings are governed by specific procedures that establish deadlines for providing members with documentation and the Chairman ensures that each director can contribute effectively to Board discussions. The same documentation is provided to the Statutory Auditors. In addition to meeting to perform the duties assigned to the Board of Statutory Auditors by Italian law, including in its capacity as the 'Internal Control and Audit Committee', and by US law in its capacity as the 'Audit Committee', the Statutory Auditors also participate in the meetings of the Board of Directors and, also through individual members, at meetings of the Control and Risk Committee thus ensuring the timely exchange of key information for the performance of their respective duties.\n\nThe adequacy and timeliness of reporting flows towards the Board of Directors is subject to periodic review by the same Board as part of the annual self-assessment process (see next section).\n\n## Ongoing training and self-assessment\n\nOn an annual basis, the Board of Directors conducts a self-assessment (the Board Review) 7 , for which benchmarking against national and international best practices and an examination of Board dynamics are essential elements, also with a view to provide shareholders with guidance on the most appropriate professional profiles for members of the Board. Following the Board Review, the Board of Directors develops an action plan, if necessary, to improve the operation of the Board and its Committees. In addition, in determining the procedures for the performance of the Board Review, the Eni Board also assesses whether to perform a Peer Review of the Directors, in which each director expresses his or her view of the contribution made by the other Directors to the work of the Board. The Peer Review, which has been completed five times in the last nine years and started, most recently, in conjunction with the Board Review 2020, is a best practice among Italian listed companies. Eni was among the first Italian companies to perform one, starting in 2012. The Board of Statutory Auditors also conducted its own self-assessment in 2020. For a number of years now, Eni has supported the Board of Directors and the Board of Statutory Auditors with an induction programme, which involves the presentation of the activities and organization of Eni by top management. During 2020, following the appointment of the Board of Directors and the Board of Statutory Auditors, numerous induction sessions were held open to Directors and Statutory Auditors, in the context of meetings of both the Board and the Board of Statutory Auditors and the Board Committees, on issues under the remit of the Committees themselves. In particular, the issues addressed include those relating to the corporate structure and its business model, Eni's mission and decarbonization path, sustainability, governance, compliance, the internal control and risk management system, accounting and tax issues, remuneration policy and human capital.\n\n## The governance of sustainability\n\nEni's governance structure reflects the Company's willingness to integrate sustainability, including in the form of 'sustainable success' as outlined in the new Corporate Governance Code, into its business model. The Board of Directors has a central role in defining sustainability policies and strategies, acting upon proposal of the CEO, in the identification of annual, four-year and long-term objectives shared between functions and subsidiaries and in verifying the related results, which are also presented to the Shareholders' Meeting.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Board appeared to be fully aware of the impact of climate change on Eni's activities and confirmed in general that it was adequately informed on the main aspects, including regulatory ones. The Directors shared the Board's role in defining a governance oriented towards the goal of combating climate change, also with respect to monitoring the road map of the Group's commitments in this respect, and the constant assessment of associated risks and opportunities.\n\nAnother central theme that the Board of Directors oversees is the respect for Human Rights. Indeed, in\n\nDecember 2018, the Board of Directors of Eni SpA approved the Eni Statement on respect for human rights. This document renews the Company's commitment, aligning it with the main international standards on Human Rights and Business, starting from the United Nations Guiding Principles, highlighting also the priority areas on which this commitment is concentrated.\n\nFurthermore, continuing on the path of transformation, in September 2019 Eni's Board of Directors approved a new corporate mission, which takes inspiration from the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and highlights Eni's values related to climate, the environment, access to energy, cooperation and partnerships for development, respect for people and human rights. The mission highlights the principles that underpin the Company's business model aimed at integrating sustainability into all Company's activities, having regard not only for climate and environment but also for the development, enhancement and training of human resources, considering diversity as an opportunity.\n\n## THE MAIN SUSTAINABILITY ISSUES ADDRESSED BY THE BOARD IN 2020\n\n- \uf0da 2020 Financial sustainability strategy and sustainability reporting\n- \uf0da 2019 Sustainability Report: 'Eni For'\n- \uf0da Update of the UK Modern Slavery Act statement\n- \uf0da 2019 financial statements, including the consolidated Non-Financial Statement\n- \uf0da The Remuneration Report, including sustainability targets in the definition of performance plans\n- \uf0da 2019 HSE Report\n- \uf0da Four-year and long-term Plan (including non-financial targets)\n\nFurther issues were addressed in the context of the induction activities mentioned above: in particular, in addition to the issues already mentioned, among other things, issues relating to the anti-corruption compliance program, the Code of Ethics, succession plans, of technical professionalism and the evolution of skills in Eni.\n\n(8) For further information on the role of the Board of Directors in the process of energy transition and the pursuit of sustainable success, see the section of this Report relating to the Consolidated Non-Financial Statement, pursuant to Legislative Decree no. 254/2016.\n\n(9) On the basis of the results of the self-assessment process, the outgoing Board prepared an advice to the Shareholders on the composition of the future Board which highlighted the advisability of including members with, among other things, skills and experience to fully understand the decarbonization process as well as, with specific reference to the issue of the energy transition and its centrality in Eni's strategic plan, the importance of professionalism with experience in contexts of strategic change of similar complexity on a global scale, and 'Soft skills' such as the ability to integrate sustainability issues into the business vision.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

With this in mind, risk assessment methodologies were developed aimed at modulating controls, calibrating monitoring activities and planning training and communication activities based on the compliance risk underlying the various cases, to maximize their effectiveness and efficiency.\n\nThe Integrated Compliance process was designed to stimulate integration between those who work in the business activities and the corporate functions that oversee the various compliance risks, both internal or external to the Integrated Compliance unit.\n\nFurthermore, acting on the proposal of the Chief Executive Officer, having obtained a favourable opinion from the Control and Risk Committee, the Board of Directors of Eni approved the internal rules concerning the Market Information Abuse (Issuers). These, by updating the previous Eni rules for the aspects relating to  'issuers',  incorporate  the  amendments  introduced  by  Regulation  No.  596/2014/EU  of  April  16,  2014 and the associated implementing rules, as well as the national regulations, taking account of Italian and foreign institutional guidelines on the matter. The updated internal rules lay down principles of conduct for the protection of confidentiality of corporate information in general, to promote maximum compliance, as also required by Eni's Code of Ethics and corporate security measures. Eni recognizes that information is a strategic asset to be managed in such a way as to ensure the protection of the interests of the Company, shareholders and the market.\n\nAn integral part of the Eni internal control system is the internal control system for financial reporting, the objective of which is to provide reasonable certainty of the reliability of financial reporting and the ability of the financial report preparation process to generate such reporting in compliance with generally accepted international accounting standards. Eni's CEO, Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and Head of Accounting and Financial Statements and budget manager, in his capacity as officer in charge of preparing financial reports, are responsible for planning, establishing and maintaining the internal control system for financial reporting. A central role in the Company's internal control and risk management system is played by the Board of Statutory Auditors, which in addition to the supervisory and control functions provided for in the Consolidated Law on Financial Intermediation, also monitors the financial reporting process and the effectiveness of the internal control and risk management systems, consistent with the provisions of the Corporate Governance Code, including in its capacity as the 'Internal Control and Audit Committee' pursuant to Italian law and as the 'Audit Committee' under US law.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "- \uf0da Re-injected production water decreased from the full year of 2019 (down by 8.9%), due to the standstills occurred in Libya, as well as technical issues in Congo at the Loango and Zatchi fields and in Nigeria at the Ebocha field.\n- \uf0da In 2020, the E&P segment reported an adjusted operating profit of \u20ac1,547 million with a decrease of 82%, affected by a depressed scenario due to the COVID-19 pandemic which impacted both hydrocarbons realized prices and production. Particularly, lower sales volumes were driven by capex optimizations intended to preserve the Company's cash flows, from the production cuts implemented by the OPEC+ agreement and falling gas demand.\n- \uf0da Oil and natural gas production was 1.73 million of boe/d, down by 7% from 2019. Net of price effects, the decline was due to COVID-19 impacts and related OPEC+ production cuts, as well as lower gas demand, mainly in Egypt. Production start-ups/ramp-ups of 109 kboe/d and portfolio contributions in Norway were partly offset by lower volumes in Libya, driven mainly by an expected contractual trigger, as well as mature field declines.\n- \uf0da Net proved reserves at December 31, 2020 amounted to 6.9 bboe based on a reference Brent price of 41 $/barrel. The all-sources replacement ratio was 43%; 96% three-year average all sources replacement ratio. The reserves life index was 10.9 years (10.6 years in 2019).\n\n## Path to decarbonization\n\n- \uf0da Within the Eni's long-term target to reach carbon neutrality, the projects in the start-up phase for the CO 2 geological capture and sequestration using depleted fields as well as reusing in other production cycle are the main decarbonization drivers in the upstream and other business. In particular Eni was awarded by the UK Oil and Gas Authority a license for building a carbon storage project in the Liverpool Bay supporting the decarbonization process in the North-West England and North Wales industrial areas. In Italy, Eni has launched a plan to build a hub for the capture and storage of CO 2 in depleted fields off the coast of Ravenna which will be designed to store 500 mmtonnes. These projects are the fruit of Eni's core expertise and research for innovative solutions in order to tackle climate change. Leveraging on the development of CCS projects, the target is to reach a storage capacity of 7 mmtonnes/year in 2030.\n- \uf0da Launched initiatives focusing on the forest's protection, conservation and sustainable management, mainly in developing Countries, by means of the REDD+ projects, as a part of Eni's decarbonization process. In particular, in  November 2020, was achieved the first allowance of carbon credits by the REDD+ Luangwa Community Forest Project (LCFP) to offset GHG emissions equivalent to 1.5 million tonnes of CO 2 . Eni continues to evaluate further initiatives in different Countries by means of partnerships with governments and international players in Africa, Latin America and Asia. The long-term target is a progressive growth of these initiatives to support an annual carbon credit portfolio offsetting over 40 million tonnes of CO 2 by 2050.\n\n## Exploration activity\n\n- \uf0da Exploration activity achieved excellent results in 2020 despite the capex reduction of approximately 50% from 2019. Added 400 mmboe of new resources at a competitive cost of 1.6 $/barrel. Exploration is still a distinctive approach of Eni's upstream model, maintaining a solid track record of production replacement with resources discovered equal to over 6 bboe in the last seven years, well above than the cumulative production in the period, at a unit cost lower than 1.5 $/barrel.\n- \uf0da Achieved near-field exploration successes ensuring a fast contribution to cash flows. In this context, main near-field discoveries were in Egypt and then in Tunisia, Norway, Algeria and Angola, where the Agogo appraisal well estimated 1 billion boe in place. Significant results reached also in frontier exploration area with the Mahani gas and condensate discovery in the onshore of the Emirate of Sharjah (UAE), just one year since the signing of the contracts, the appraisal of the Ken Bau field offshore Vietnam, which allowed to outline a giant field, and the Saasken discovery, offshore Mexico, which strenght Eni's activity in the Country. These exploration successes create opportunities to early monetization fuelling the dual exploration model.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In addition, renewed exploration licenses in Kenya, as part of long-term partnership with the Country for access to energy and decarbonization.\n- \uf0da In 2020 exploration expenses were \u20ac510 million (\u20ac489 million in 2019) and included the write-off of unsuccessful wells amounting to \u20ac314 million (\u20ac214 million in 2019), which also related to the write-off of unproved exploration rights, if any, associated to projects with negative outcome. The write-off of expenses related to unsuccessful drilling activities mainly concerned projects in Libya, the United States, Angola, Egypt, Oman, Mexico and Lebanon. In addition, 86 exploratory drilled wells are in progress at year-end (46.0 net to Eni).\n\n## Development activity\n\n- \uf0da Achieved production start-up of the following projects:\n- \u00b7 in Algeria, with the gas project in the Berkine North area (Eni's interest 49%) levaraging on a fast-track development;\n- \u00b7 in Congo, with the Nen\u00e9 Marine phase 2B project in the Marine XII block (Eni operator with a 65% interest);\n- \u00b7 in Angola, with the Agogo oil field in the operated offshore Block 15/06, in just 9 months from discovery, leveraging on the synergies with the existing FPSOs in the area;\n- \u00b7 in January 2021, in the onshore Sharjah Emirate, with start-up of the Mahani gas and condensate discovery in the Area B concession (Eni's interest 50%), just two years after signing the concession agreement and one year since discovery.\n- \uf0da Development expenditure amounted to \u20ac3.1 billion, directed mainly outside Italy, in particular in Egypt, Indonesia, the United Arab Emirates, the United States, Angola, Mexico, Iraq and Kazakhstan.\n- \uf0da In the year marked by the COVID-19 pandemic crisis, Eni implemented effective measures in several areas to protect the health of its employees and contractors and to manage the pandemic impact on local communities in Italy and abroad. Eni operated in synergy with governments, institutions, United Nations agencies and local and international NGOs to prevent and tackle the expansion of the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, Eni provided protective and hygiene sanitary supplies, medical equipment for intensive care, activated awareness campaigns, sustained the logistics activities of the international Task Forces, as well as implemented initiatives in support of the most vulnerable populations. Furthermore, in the foreign Countries, Eni implemented different specific initiatives such as in the Luanda, Huila and Namibe area in Angola, in the Koilou department in Congo, at the Multi-Disciplinary Medical Center of Nur-Sultan in Kazakshtan, in the Maputo area in Mozambique and in the Tabasco area in Mexico.\n- \uf0da The Africa Program targets to contribute the local socio-economic development with initiatives to support economic diversification by means of training programs in the agricultural-food and agro-business areas and to facilitate access to the labor market in a path of economic growth, inclusive and sustainable at the same time, in line with the United Nations 2030 Agenda. In 2020, activities of the Pilot Project started up at the Okuafo Pa center, opened in 2019, in Ghana, in order to set-up the model to be replicated in other Countries. The project provides for defining to access micro-credit facilities and the use of funds, in cooperation with Cassa Depositi e Prestiti, and for the development of agricultural activities with the support of Bonifiche Ferraresi. During the year, 800 people benefited from the training program.\n- \uf0da In 2020, overall R&D expenditure amounted to \u20ac59 million (\u20ac71 million in 2019); a total of 8 new patents were filed. During the year the main technologies application concerned tools, software and hardware to improve and optimize energy and operational efficiency in production activities. In particular, technologies were applied to optimize the development and exploration drilling activities, such as in Mozambique, Mexico, Oman, Vietnam and Indonesia; application tools to enhance the efficiency of hydrocarbons production and transportation activities, such as in operated activities in Angola, Algeria and Egypt; technologies to guarantee efficient monitoring and asset integrity of plants, such as in Italy, Angola, Libya, Algeria, Egypt, Indonesia, Mexico and Ghana; as well as applications to reduce the exploration risk by means of tools to allow a better analysis of the subsoil, such as in Egypt, Vietnam, Mexico and Norway.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## RESERVES\n\n## OVERVIEW\n\nThe Company has adopted comprehensive classification criteria for the estimate of proved, proved developed and proved undeveloped oil and gas reserves in accordance with applicable US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations, as provided for in Regulation S-X, Rule 4-10. Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of liquids (including condensates and natural gas liquids) and natural gas which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain.\n\nOil and natural gas prices used in the estimate of proved reserves are obtained from the official survey published by Platt's Marketwire, except when their calculation derives from existing contractual conditions. Prices are calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the 12-month period prior to the end of the reporting period. Prices include consideration of changes in existing prices provided only by contractual arrangements.\n\nEngineering estimates of the Company's oil and gas reserves are inherently uncertain. Although authoritative guidelines exist regarding engineering criteria that have to be met before estimated oil and gas reserves can be designated as 'proved', the accuracy of any reserves estimate is a function of the quality of available data and engineering and geological interpretation and evaluation. Consequently, the estimated proved reserves of oil and natural gas may be subject to future revision and upward and downward revisions may be made to the initial booking of reserves due to analysis of new information. Proved reserves to which Eni is entitled under concession contracts are determined by applying Eni's equity interest to total proved reserves of the contractual area, until expiration of the relevant mineral right. Eni's proved reserves entitlements under PSAs are calculated so that the sale of production entitlements cover expenses incurred by the Group for field development (Cost Oil) and recognize a share of profit set contractually (Profit Oil). A similar scheme applies to service contracts.\n\n## RESERVES GOVERNANCE\n\nEni retains rigorous control over the process of booking proved reserves, through a centralized model of reserves governance. The Reserves Department of the Exploration & Production segment is in charge of: (i) ensuring the periodic certification process of proved reserves; (ii) updating the Company's guidelines on reserves evaluation and classification and the internal procedures; and (iii) providing training of staff involved in the process of reserves estimation. Company guidelines have been reviewed by DeGolyer and MacNaughton (D&M), an independent petroleum engineering company, which has stated that those guidelines comply with the SEC rules 1 . D&M has also stated that the Company guidelines provide reasonable interpretation of facts and circumstances in line with generally accepted practices in the industry whenever SEC rules may be less precise. When participating in exploration and production activities operated by other entities, Eni estimates its share of proved reserves on the basis of the above guidelines.\n\nThe process for estimating reserves, as described in the internal procedure, involves the following roles and responsibilities: (i)  the  business unit managers (geographic units) and Local Reserves Evaluators (LRE) are in charge with estimating and classifying gross reserves including assessing production profiles, capital expenditure, operating expenses and costs related to asset retirement obligations; (ii) the petroleum engineering department and the operations unit at the head office verify the production profiles of such properties where significant changes have occurred and operating expenses, respectively; (iii) geographic area managers verify the commercial conditions and the progress of the projects; (iv) the Planning and Control Department provides the economic evaluation of reserves; and (v) the Reserves Department, through the Headquarter Reserves Evaluators (HRE), provides independent reviews of fairness and correctness of classifications carried out by the above mentioned units and aggregates worldwide reserves data.\n\n<!-- image -->",

He has more than 20 years of experience in the oil and gas industry. Staff involved in the reserves evaluation process fulfil the professional qualifications requested by the role and comply with the required level of independence, objectivity and confidentiality in accordance with professional ethics. Reserves Evaluators qualifications comply with international standards defined by the Society of Petroleum Engineers.\n\n## RESERVES INDEPENDENT EVALUATION\n\nEni has its proved reserves audited on a rotational basis by independent oil engineering companies 2 . The description of qualifications of the persons primarily responsible for the reserves audit is included in the third-party audit report 3 . In the preparation of their reports, independent evaluators rely, upon information furnished by Eni without independent verification, with respect to property interests, production, current costs of operations and development, sales agreements, prices and other factual information and data that were accepted as represented by the independent evaluators. These data, equally used by Eni in its internal process, include logs, directional surveys, core and PVT (Pressure Volume Temperature) analysis, maps, oil/gas/water production/injection data of wells, reservoir studies, technical analysis relevant to field performance, development plans, future capital and operating costs.\n\nIn order to calculate the net present value of Eni's equity reserves, actual prices applicable to hydrocarbon sales, price adjustments required by applicable contractual arrangements and other pertinent information are provided by Eni to third party evaluators. In 2020 Ryder Scott Company and DeGolyer and MacNaughton provided an independent evaluation of approximately 36% 4 of Eni's total proved reserves at December 31, 2020 5 , confirming, as in previous years, the reasonableness of Eni internal evaluation 6 .\n\nIn the 2018-2020 three-year period, 92% of Eni total proved reserves were subject to an independent evaluation. As at December 31, 2020, Balder in Norway and Merakes in Indonesia were the main Eni property, which did not undergo an independent evaluation in the last three years.\n\n## MOVEMENTS IN NET PROVED RESERVES\n\nEni's net proved reserves were determined taking into account Eni's share of proved reserves of equity-accounted entities. Movements in Eni's 2020 proved reserves were as follows:\n\n|                                                                                                         | (mmboe)   | Consolidated  subsidiaries   | Equity-accounted  entities   | Total   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|------------------------------|------------------------------|---------|\n| Estimated net proved reserves at December 31, 2019                                                      |           | 6,287                        | 981                          | 7,268   |\n| Extensions, discoveries, revisions of previous estimates and  improved recovery, excluding price effect |           | 220                          | 57                           | 277     |\n| Price effect                                                                                            |           | 18                           | (24)                         | (6)     |\n| Reserve additions, total                                                                                |           | 238                          | 33                           | 271     |\n| Production of the year                                                                                  |           | (541)                        | (93)                         | (634)   |\n| Estimated net proved reserves at December 31, 2020                                                      |           | 5,984                        | 921                          | 6,905   |\n| Reserves replacement ratio, all sources                                                                 | (%)       |                              |                              | 43      |\n\nNet proved reserves as of December 31, 2020 were 6,905 mmboe, of which 5,984 mmboe of consolidated subsidiaries.

The decrease of Brent reference price used in the reserve estimation process (down to 41 $/barrel in 2020 compared to 63 $/barrel in 2019) leading to reduce proved reserves by 124 mmboe, due to the removal of volumes of reserves which have become uneconomical in this environment. There was also an offsetting positive addition due to net higher reserves entitlements under PSA contracts of 118 mmboe because of the cost recovery mechanism.\n\nThe organic and all sources reserves replacement ratio 7 was 43%.\n\nThe reserves life index was 10.9 years (10.6 years in 2019).\n\nFor further information, please see the additional information on Oil & Gas producing activities required by the SEC in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES\n\nProved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2020 totaled 2,005 mmboe, of which 1,064 mmbbl of liquids mainly concentrated in Africa and Asia and 4,992 bcf of natural gas mainly located in Africa. Proved undeveloped reserves of consolidated subsidiaries amounted to 837 mmbbl of liquids and 4,703 bcf of natural gas. Movements in Eni's 2020 proved undeveloped reserves were as follows:\n\n| (mmboe)                                             |       |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|-------|\n| Proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2019 | 2,114 |\n| Additions                                           | (206) |\n| Extensions and discoveries                          | 40    |\n| Revisions of previous estimates                     | 53    |\n| Improved recovery                                   | 4     |\n| Proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2020 | 2,005 |\n\nIn 2020, Eni matured 206 mmboe of proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves due to progress in development activities, production start-ups and project revisions. The main reclassifications to proved developed reserves are related to the following fields/projects: Zohr in Egypt, Zubair in Iraq, Area 1 in Mexico, Umm Shaif/Nasr concession in the United Arab Emirates and Karachaganak in Kazakhstan.\n\nFor further information, please see the additional information on Oil & Gas producing activities required by the SEC in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn 2020, capital expenditures amounted to approximately \u20ac4.2 billion.\n\nReserves that remain proved undeveloped for five or more years are a result of several factors that affect the timing of the projects development and execution, such as the complex nature of the development project in adverse and remote locations, physical limitations of infrastructures or plant capacity and contractual limitations that establish production levels. The Company estimates that 0.5 bboe of proved undeveloped reserves have remained undeveloped for five years or more at the balance sheet date and unchanged from 2019. The proved undeveloped reserves that have remained undeveloped for five years or more at the balance sheet date mainly related to:\n\n- (i) the Zubair field in Iraq (0.15 bboe), where development of PUDs has been conditioned by the drilling of additional production and injection wells to be linked to the production facilities, which were already completed to achieve the full field production plateau of 700 kboe/d;\n- (ii) certain Libyan gas fields (0.25 bboe) where development completion and production start-ups are planned according to the delivery obligations set forth in a long-term gas supply agreement currently in force;\n- (iii)  other fields in Italy and Egypt (0.1 bboe), where development activities are in progress.\n\n(7) Organic ratio of changes in proved reserves for the year resulting from revisions of previously reported reserves, improved recovery, extensions and discoveries, to production for the year. All sources ratio includes sales or purchases of minerals in place. A ratio higher than 100% indicates that more proved reserves were added than produced in a year. The Reserves Replacement Ratio is not an indicator of future production because the ultimate development and production of reserves is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. These include the risks associated with the successful completion of large-scale projects, including addressing ongoing regulatory issues and completion of infrastructure, as well as changes in oil and gas prices, political risks and geological and environmental risks..\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Some of these contracts, mostly relating to natural gas, specify the delivery of fixed and determinable quantities.\n\nEni is contractually committed under existing contracts or agreements to deliver in the next three years mainly natural gas to third parties for a total of approximately 623 mmboe from producing assets located mainly in Algeria, Australia, Egypt, Ghana, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Libya, Nigeria, Norway and Venezuela.\n\nThe sales contracts contain a mix of fixed and variable pricing formulas that are generally indexed to the market price for crude oil, natural gas or other petroleum products. Management believes it can satisfy these contracts from quantities available from production of the Company's proved developed reserves and supplies from third parties based on existing contracts. Production is expected to account for approximately 93% of delivery commitments. Eni has met all contractual delivery commitments as of December 31, 2020.\n\n## OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION\n\nIn 2020, oil and natural gas production averaged 1,733 kboe/d, down by 7% from 2019. Net of price effects, the decline was due to COVID-19 impacts and related OPEC+ production cuts, as well as lower gas demand, mainly in Egypt. This performance was driven by production start-up/ramp-up in Algeria and Mexico, better contribution of Kazakhstan, as well as portfolio contributions in Norway. These positives were partly offset by the lower volumes reported in Libya since during the year a contractual parameter already envisaged in the contract has been triggered and will be applied going forward, lower entitlements/spending and force majeure, as well as mature field declines.\n\nLiquids production amounted to 843 kbbl/d, down by 6% from 2019. The reduction in Libya, the COVID-19 impacts and related OPEC+ cuts, as well as the mature fields decline are partly offset by portfolio contributions and production growth in Mexico, due to the ramp-up of Area 1, Angola for the start-up of Agogo, Congo due to the Nen\u00e8 phase 2B start-up, Algeria and Kazakhstan.\n\nNatural gas production amounted to 4,729 mmcf/d, down by 11% from 2019. Lower production in Libya and lower natural gas demand impact in certain areas (mainly in Egypt), as well as LNG demand were partly offset by the growth in Algeria, due to the start-up of the Berkine gas project, and Kazakhstan.\n\nOil and gas production sold amounted to 575.2 mmboe. The 59.1 mmboe difference over production (634.3 mmboe in 2020) mainly reflected volumes of natural gas consumed in operations (45.4 mmboe), changes in  inventory levels and other variations. Approximately 67% of liquids production sold (300.1 mmbbl) was destined to Eni's Refining & Marketing business. About 19% of natural gas production sold (1,461 bcf) was destined to Eni's Global Gas & LNG Portfolio segment.\n\n<!-- image -->",

respectively).\n- (c) Effective January 1, 2020, the conversion rate of natural gas from cubic feet to boe has been updated to 1 barrel of oil = 5,310 cubic feet of gas (it was 1 barrel of oil = 5,408 cubic feet of\n\ngas). The effect of this update on production expressed in boe was approximately 6 mmboe for the full year of 2020. Other per-boe indicators were only marginally affected by the update\n\n- (e.g. realized prices, costs per boe) and also negligible was the impact on depletion charges. Other oil companies may use different conversion rates.",

As of December 31, 2020, Eni's mineral right portfolio consisted of 798 exclusive or shared rights of exploration and development activities for a total acreage of 336,449 square kilometers net to Eni (357,854 square kilometers net to Eni as of December 31, 2019). Developed acreage was 26,359 square kilometers and undeveloped acreage was 310,090 square kilometers net to Eni.\n\nIn 2020, main changes derived from: (i) the entry in Albania and new leases mainly in Oman, the United Arab Emirates, Angola, Indonesia, Norway and Egypt for a total acreage of approximately 23,600 square kilometers; (ii) the total relinquishment of licenses mainly to Somalia, Myanmar, Indonesia, Pakistan and Gabon covering an acreage of approximately 47,500 square kilometers; (iii) interest increase mainly in Myanmar and Australia for a total acreage of approximately 4,800 square kilometers; and (iv) partial relinquishment in Algeria, Cyprus and Egypt for approximately 2,300 square kilometers.\n\nEni's investment in developed and undeveloped acreage is comprised of numerous concessions, leases and blocks. The terms and conditions under which the Company maintains exploration and/or production rights to the acreage are property-specific, contractually defined and vary significantly from property to property. Work programs are designed to ensure that the exploration potential of any property is fully evaluated before expiration. In some instances, Eni may elect to relinquish acreage in advance of the contractual expiration date if the evaluation process is complete and there is not a business basis for extension. In cases where additional time may be required to fully evaluate acreage, Eni has generally been successful in obtaining extensions. The scheduled expiration of leases and concessions for undeveloped acreage over the next three years is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the Company.\n\nThe gross undeveloped acreages that will expire in the next three years are related to exploration leases, blocks, concessions in: (i) Rest of Asia, in particular in Oman, Russia, Vietnam and Myanmar; (ii) North Africa, in particular in Morocco and Libya; and (iii) Sub-Saharan Africa, in particular in Kenya, Mozambique and South Africa. In most cases extension or renewal options are contractually defined and may or may not be exercised in according on the results of the studies and the planned activities. Management believes that a significant amount of acreage will be maintained following extension or renewal.\n\n<!-- image -->",

These cover virtually all aspects of exploration and production activities, including matters such as license acquisition, production rates, royalties, pricing, environmental protection, export, taxes and foreign exchange. The terms and condition of the leases, licenses and contracts under which these Oil & Gas interests are held vary from Country to Country. These leases, licenses and contracts are generally granted by or entered into with a government entity or state company and are sometimes entered into with private property owners. These contractual arrangements usually take the form of concession agreements or production sharing agreements:\n\nConcessions contracts. Eni operates under concession contracts mainly in Western Countries. Concessions contracts regulate relationships between States and oil companies with regards to hydrocarbon exploration and production activity. Contractual clauses governing mineral concessions, licenses and exploration permits regulate the access of Eni to hydrocarbon reserves. The company holding the mining concession has an exclusive right on exploration, development and production activities, sustaining all the operational risks and costs related to the exploration and development activities, and it is entitled to the productions realized. As a compensation for mineral concessions, pays royalties on production (which may be in cash or in-kind) and taxes on oil revenues to the state in accordance with local tax legislation. Both exploration and production licenses are granted generally for a specified period of time (except for production licenses in the United States which remain in effect until production ceases): the term of Eni's licenses and the extent to which these licenses may be renewed vary by area. Proved reserves to which Eni is entitled are determined by applying Eni's share of production to total proved reserves of the contractual area, in respect of the duration of the relevant mineral right.\n\nProduction Sharing Agreement (PSA). Eni operates under PSA in several of the foreign jurisdictions mainly in African, Middle Eastern, Far Eastern Countries. The mineral right is awarded to the national oil company jointly with the foreign oil company that has an exclusive right to perform exploration, development and production activities and can enter into agreements with other local or international entities. In this type of contract, the national oil company assigns to the international contractor the task of performing exploration and production with the contractor's equipment (technologies) and financial resources. Exploration risks are borne by the contractor and production is divided into two portions: 'Cost Oil' is used to recover costs borne by the contractor and 'Profit Oil' is divided between the contractor and the national company according to variable  schemes and represents the profit deriving from exploration and production. Further terms and conditions of these contracts may vary from Country to Country. Pursuant to these contracts, Eni is entitled to a portion of a field's reserves, the sale of which is intended to cover expenditures incurred by the Company to develop and operate the field. The Company's share of production volumes and reserves representing the Profit Oil includes the share of hydrocarbons which corresponds to the taxes to be paid, according to the contractual agreement, by the national government on behalf of the Company. As a consequence, the Company has to recognize at the same time an increase in the taxable profit, through the increase of the revenues, and a tax expense. Proved reserves to which Eni is entitled under PSAs are calculated so that the sale of production entitlements should cover expenses incurred by the Group to develop a field (Cost Oil) and recognize the Profit Oil set contractually (Profit Oil). A similar scheme applies to some service contracts.\n\n## I TA LY\n\nIn December 2020, Eni signed with Saipem a Memorandum of Understanding to identify and develop jointly decarbonization initiatives and projects in the Country. In particular, the agreement provides for: (i) a collaboration in decarbonization projects in Italy focused on capture, transport, reuse and storage of CO 2 produced by the industrial activity; and (ii) initiatives related to Green Deal Strategy to tackle climate change and to achieve of CO 2 reduction targets at national, European and world level.\n\nWithin Eni's long-term strategy to minimize carbon footprint, a program was launched to build a hub for the capture and storage of CO 2 (Carbon Capture and Storage - CCS) in depleted fields off the coast of Ravenna which will be de-\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The decommissioning plan to plug & abandon non-productive wells and remove non-productive platforms progressed in the year in compliance with applicable Italian laws; a total of five offshore platforms are currently in the authorization process to be removed. In the circular economy initiatives, a program in collaboration with national research institutions was launched to redevelop asset in the decomissioning phase. In particular activities started up to convert an offshore platform into a marine science park. Within the VIII Agreement with the Municipality of Ravenna, activities progressed with: (i) environmental protection projects at the coastline areas; (ii) energy efficiency measures; (iii) programs to support employment, including mentoring and training initiatives; and (iv) completion of environmental monitoring studies.\n\nDuring the year, maintenance and production optimization activities project were completed at the Viggiano Oil Center in the Val d'Agri concession (Eni operator with a 61%). The concession expired in October 2019 and activities have continued since then in accordance with the prorogation regime. Applications have been timely filed with Italian administrative Authority to obtain a ten-year extension of the concession based on the same work program as in the original concession award.\n\nIn 2020 the Energy Valley project activities progressed and includes a number of initiatives relating to environmental sustainability, innovation and enhancement of the area: (i) Mini Blue Water project on circular economy, for treatment, recover and reuse of water production at the Viggiano Oil Center as well as installation of photovoltaic plants supporting oil production facilities; (ii) environmental and biodiversity monitoring plan. In particular, the opening of the Center of Environmental Monitoring to manage and spread data collected; and (iii) the CASF project to support the technological development and competence in the agro-food sector in the area. In 2020, upgrading of certain areas was completed and other initiatives was launched to support the agricultural, biomonitoring and teaching with a positive impact on local employment.\n\nIn addition, within the memorandum agreement with the Basilicata Region including environmental, social and sustainable development programs, initiatives progressed with defined activities of the Gas Agreement. Activities include a grant to support the gas consumption in 11 Municipalities of Val d'Agri and for energy efficiency programs. In Sicily, following the Memorandum of Understanding for the Gela area, signed with the Ministry of Economic Development in November 2014, progressed with: (i) development activities of the Cassiopea offshore gas fields (Eni's interest 60%). The project, through a significant reduction of the environmental impact, expects to achieve the carbon neutrality target. The activities provide the transportation of natural gas produced by offshore wells through a subsea pipeline to a new onshore treatment and compression plant, that will be realized in certain reclaimed area of the Gela Refinery; (ii) the sustainable development initiatives supported by local institutions. In particular, the Macchitella Lab project was launched to support youth employment and small and medium-sized local enterprises with the start-up of the redevelopment programs.\n\nIn addition, progressed the initiatives of the Memorandum of Understanding signed at the end of 2019 with the Ministry of Environment. Activities, which will be implemented in the next years, include the redevelopment programs of certain productive areas, environmental remediation projects as well as innovative projects developed by Eni's proprietary technologies to capture and reuse of CO 2 .\n\n## REST OF EUROPE\n\nNorway Exploration activity yielded positive results with: (i) the Tordis NE and Lomre oil discoveries in the PL089 block (Eni's interest 11.24%); (ii) the Enniberg oil and and gas discovery in the 971 license (Eni's interest 13.97%) in the North Sea, located near the Balder production field (Eni's interest 62.87%); and (iii) in March 2021, new oil discovery in the PL532 license (Eni's interest 21%) in the Barents Sea and in the PL 090/090I license (Eni's interest 17%), located in the northern North Sea, respectively.\n\nThe mineral interest portfolio increases were as follows: (i) in 2020 seven exploration licenses were acquired as operator and ten licenses in partnership.

The Balder project scheme provides for drilling additional productive wells, to be linked to an upgraded FPSO unit that will be relocated in the area. Production start-up is expected in 2022.\n\nIn 2020, the Breidablikk project was sanctioned with start-up expected in 2024. The development activities include the drilling of 23 productive wells that will be linked to existing facilities. Leveraging on high energy and operational efficiency technologies, the project development will minimize direct emissions.\n\nUnited Kingdom In January 2021, Eni was awarded a 100% interest in the exploration license P2511 in the North Sea.\n\nIn October 2020 Eni was awarded by the UK Oil & Gas Authority a license, lasting six years, for building a carbon storage project in the Liverpool Bay area. The project includes the reutilization and refurbishment of Eni's depleted fields with a target of storing 3 million tonnes per year of CO 2 . Activity start-up is expected in 2025. Eni is expected to coordinate the storage and transportation phase from existing industries and future hydrogen production sites in the area, within the HyNet North West integrated project. The project will contribute to the UK's carbon neutrality targets by 2050. In the year concept selection activities started up and signed CO 2 capture agreement with existing industries in the area. In addition, Eni signed a cooperation agreement with other upstream partners for the Net Zero Teeside (Eni's interest 20%) and North Endurance Partnership (Eni's interest 16.7%) projects. These integrated projects will allow to achieve the decarbonization target of the Teeside industrial area, in the north east UK, by means of the capture, transportation and storage of CO 2 . Start-up is expected in 2026 with a carbon capture and storage of 4 million tonnes per year.\n\nIn March 2021, the UK Research and Innovation (UKRI), Country's authority for research and innovation, will fund the CCS projects developed by Eni and other partners: (i) the HyNet North West integrated project with approximately \u00a333 million (\u00a321 million net to Eni); and (ii) the Net Zero Teeside and North Endurance Partnership projects with approximately overall \u00a352 million (\u00a39 million net to Eni). The grants will finance 50% of the ongoing design studies and accelerate the final investment decision for all projects, expected in 2023.\n\n## NORTH AFRICA\n\nAlgeria Exploration activities yielded positive results with the BKNES-1 near-field oil discovery well (Eni's interest 49%) in the Berkine North area.\n\nDuring the year, gas production was started at the Berkine North complex (Eni's interest 49%) leveraging a fast-track development intended to valorize the existing gas reserves. The development program included the drilling of four producing wells that were linked to the existing facilities, as well as the laying of a pipeline connecting the producing field to the MLE treatment plant in Block 405b (Eni's interest 75%).

The signed agreements target to define further projects improving the sustainable development in the areas close to Eni's activity in the Country.\n\n## FORESTRY PROJECTS\n\nIn the decarbonization path, one of the pillars and strategic guidelines of Eni include the forest protection, conservation and sustainable management projects, in particular in developing Countries. The forest projects are considered the most significant at internationally level within climate change mitigation strategies.\n\nThe  projects  including  the  REDD+  (Reducing  Emissions  from  Deforestation  and  forest  Degradation) scheme are a key lever in this context. The REDD+ scheme was designed by the United Nations (in particular within the UNFCCC - United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) and involves conservation forest activities to reduce emissions and improve the natural storage capacity of CO 2 , as well as supporting, with a different development model, the local communities through socio-economic projects, in line with sustainable management, forest protection and biodiversity conservation.\n\nIn this scheme, Eni's protection forest activities support national governments, local communities and UN agencies in the REDD+ strategies, in line with the NDCs (Nationally Determined Contributions) and National Development Plans and, mainly, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of UN.\n\nEni built solid partnerships over time with recognized international developers of REDD+ projects, like BioCarbon Partners, Terra Global, Peace Parks Foundation, First Climate and Carbonsink, which allows to oversee every phase of the projects, from the design to the implementation up to verify the reduction emissions, with an active role in the governance of the project. The Eni's role is essential also to allow the alignment with the highest standards for certification of the carbon emissions reduction and social and environmental effects (such as Verified Carbon Standard - VCS and Climate Community & Biodiversity Standards - CCB), internationally recognized and in line with the qualitative standards, target to be achieved by Eni.\n\nEni launched the forestry projects by means of the agreement with BioCarbon Partners to became active member in the governance of the Luangwa Community Forests Project (LCFP) in Zambia.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Thanks to these agreements, Eni will take over the contracts for the purchase of natural gas for the plant, receiving the corresponding liquefaction rights and will allow Eni to directly enter the Spanish gas market, strengthening its presence in the European gas.\n\nThe restart of the plant, with a capacity of 7.56 billion cubic meters per year, enables Eni to strengthen its strategic objectives in terms of growth of its LNG portfolio and presence in the Eastern Mediterranean region.\n\n## NATURAL GAS\n\n## SUPPLY OF NATURAL GAS\n\nIn 2020, Eni's consolidated subsidiaries supplied 62.16 bcm of natural gas, down by 8.26 bcm or by 11.7% from the full year 2019.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The produced energy is addressed in part to the local industrial activities, allowing to avoid emissions of approximately 26 ktonnes per year of CO 2 . During the year, another area was identified for the construction of a 34 MW photovoltaic park, in the design phase.\n\nIn addition, the activities related to the project 'Ravenna Ponticelle' were carried on and provide, through an environmental intervention of permanent safety and subsequent redevelopment, the construction of: (i) a photovoltaic plant; (ii) a bio-remediation and land recovery plant with a biological laboratory; and (iii) a multipurpose platform created with another local player for the management of up to 60 ktonnes per year of special waste deriving from environmental and production activities in line with the European directives of the sector.\n\n## Water & Waste Management\n\nThe activity is developed by Eni Rewind and is focused on treatment of water at the Eni's sites, through an integrated system of interception and conveying of groundwater to treatment plants for their purification. Currently, 42 water treatment plants are in operation and managed in Italy, with approximately 36 million cubic meters of treated water in 2020. During the year, the automation and digitization of groundwater treatment plants were finalized, through the completion of remote control for the main plants. Initiatives of recovery and reuse of treated water were carried on aimed at the production of demineralized water for industrial use and relating to the operational plans of reclamation of contaminated sites. In 2020, after treatment, approximately 6 million cubic meter of water were reused.\n\nActivities for the application of Blue Water technology continue at the Val d'Agri Oil Center in Viggiano. The project is finalized to the treatment and recovery of production water extracted from the oil field for an industrial reuse. The project is under authorization. In addition, almost the overall waste are managed, from both environmental rehabilitation activities and the Group's production activities in Italy, through the application of the best technologies to minimize environmental impacts. In 2020, about 1.7 million tons of waste were managed, with a share of recovered waste compared to the effective recoverable waste, amounting to approximately 78%. In the year, initiatives were also implemented outside Italy, including training and knowledge sharing programs, particularly in Iraq, Nigeria, Egypt, Tunisia, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Angola to support the ongoing upstream activities in these countries. Furthermore, in January 2021 was signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the National Authority for oil and the gas of the Kingdom of Bahrain with the target of identifying and promoting joint initiatives for management, recovery and reuse of the country's water, soil and waste resources.\n\n## Waste to Fuel\n\nThe target of recovery and reuse of resources is realized also through the development of the proprietary technology Waste to Fuel, which permits to transform FORSU (Organic fraction of municipal solid waste) in water and bio oil. Bio oil can be addressed to maritime transport, considering its low-sulphur content, or to help the production of advanced biofuels, while the recovered water can be used for industrial uses. The first application of this technology is ongoing at Gela plant, through a pilot plant started in 2018.\n\nThe construction of a plant with industrial scale is planned at Porto Marghera, in a reclaimed property's area. The plan includes the realization of a system with a treatment capacity up to 150 ktons/year of FORSU. During the year, were started the procedures to obtain the authorizations of the project which includes collaboration with local industrial and productive players in a perspective of synergy with the local context..",

The ramp-up of the plant is a step forward along the path to decarbonization of Eni's activities thanks to the Ecofining TM proprietary technology. In March 2021, started the Biomass Treatment Unit to expand the range of charges to be processed by the plant, allowing the replacement of palm oil with other sustainable sources.\n\n## Circular economy and green chemicals\n\n- \uf0da Implemented on an industrial scale the technologies of plastic waste recycling thanks to the alliance with Forever Plast in order to develop and market a new range of solid polystyrene products made from reused packaging.\n- \uf0da Signed an agreement with AGR, an Italian company owner of a proprietary technology to treat used elastomers, to develop and market new products and applications in recycled rubber, in collaboration with the EcoTyre Consortium, which manages a national network for the collection and processing of ELTs (End-ofLife Tyres).\n- \uf0da Signed an agreement with COREPLA (National Consortium for the Collection, Recycling and Recovery of Plastic Packaging) to develop effective solutions to reutilize plastics, applying Eni's expertise in the fields of gasification and chemical recycling by means of pyrolysis.\n- \uf0da In 2020, Versalis joined the Circular Plastics Alliance (CPA) to contribute to the European target of using 10 million tonnes of recycled plastic in new products by 2025. The mission of this alliance, promoted by the European Commission, is to promote the recycling of plastic in Europe and at the same time to develop the market of second raw materials.\n- \uf0da Versalis entered the market of agricultural protection, thanks to the alliance with AlphaBio Control, a research and development company engaged in the production of natural formulations for the protection of crops, aimed at the production of herbicides and biocides for the disinfection of plant-based and biodegradable surfaces, using the active ingredients produced from the chemistry from the renewable sources platform of Porto Torres.\n\n## Business developments\n\n- \uf0da Crescentino plant is being upgraded. This strategic hub for the production of electricity and chemical feedstocks from residual biomass, is not in competition with the food supply chain and is based on an advanced proprietary technology. First application of this technology was the production of a bioethanol disinfectant from corn glucose syrup, based on the formulation provided by the WHO for medical applications; restarted the biomass power plant for renewable electricity generation. Studies are ongoing to develop the production process of second-generation sugar bioplastics.\n- \uf0da In July 2020, Versalis finalized the acquisition of a 40% interest in Finproject, a company engaged in the production of high-performance polymers, increasing exposure to products more resilient to the volatility of the chemical. This initiative allows Eni to exploit value from the integration of Finproject's positioning in the market of high value added applications with the industrial and technological leadership of Versalis.\n\n## Proprietary technologies\n\nIn 2021, Versalis has licensed to Enter Engineering Pte Ltd a low density polyethylene/ethyl vinyl acetate (LDPE/EVA) swing unit to be built as part of a new gas to chemical complex based on MTO-methanol to\n\n<!-- image -->",

Average unit prices decreased by 23.3%, in particular aromatics (down by 36.4%), olefins (down by 25.4%) and derivatives (down by 5.9%). Intermediates production (5,861 ktonnes) registered an increase of 0.7% from 2019.

The styrenics business benefitted of the increase of volumes sold (up by 4.0%) for higher product availability; decrease of sale prices (down by 16.0%). Polyethylene volumes increased (up by 2.0%) for higher demand. Average prices decreased by 13.4%. In the elastomers business, a decrease of sold volumes (down by 4.6%) was attributable to lattices (down by 8.4%), EPR (down by 6.5%), TPR (down by 4.8%), SBR rubbers (down by 4.6%) and BR (down by 3.0%).

        "page_content": "## Financial review\n\n## Eni's new organizational structure and segment reporting\n\nEffective July 1, 2020, Eni's management has redesigned the macro-organizational structure of the Group, in line with its new long-term strategy, disclosed on February 2020 to the market and aimed at transforming the Company into a leader in the production and marketing of decarbonized energy products.\n\nThe new organization is based on two new Business Groups:\n\n- \uf0da Natural  Resources,  to  build  up  the  value  of  Eni's  Oil  &  Gas upstream portfolio, with the objective of reducing its carbon footprint  by  scaling  up  energy  efficiency  and  expanding  production in the natural gas business, and its position in the wholesale market. Furthermore, it will focus its actions on the development of carbon capture and compensation projects. The Business Group will incorporate the Company's Oil & Gas exploration, development and production activities, natural gas wholesale via pipeline and LNG. In addition, it will include forests conservation (REDD+) and carbon storage projects. The company  Eni  Rewind  (environmental  activities),  will  also  be consolidated in this Business Group.\n- \uf0da Energy Evolution, will focus on the evolution of the businesses of power generation, transformation and marketing of products from fossil to bio, blue and green. In particular, it will focus on growing power generation from renewable energy and biomethane, it will coordinate the bio and circular evolution of the Company's refining system and chemical business, and it will further develop Eni's retail portfolio, providing increasingly more decarbonized products for mobility, household consumption and small enterprises. The Business Group will incorporate the activities of power generation from natural gas and renewables, the Refining and Chemicals businesses, Retail Gas & Power and mobility Marketing. The companies Versalis (chemical products) and Eni gas e luce will also be consolidated in this Business Group.\n\nThe new organization represents a fundamental step to implement Eni's strategy to become leader in the supply of decarbonized products by 2050 combining value creation, sustainability and financial resilience.\n\nIn re-designing the Group's segment information for financial reporting purposes, the management evaluated that the com-\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nponents of the Company whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CEO) to make decisions  about  the  allocation  of  resources  and  to  assess performances would continue being the single business units which  are  comprised  in  the  two  newly-established  Business Groups, rather than the two groups themselves. Therefore, in order to comply with the provisions of the international reporting standard that regulates the segment reporting (IFRS 8), the new reportable segments of Eni, substantially confirming the pre-existing setup, are identified as follows:\n\n- \uf0da Exploration & Production: research, development and production of oil, condensates and natural gas, forestry conservation (REDD+) and CO 2 capture and storage projects.\n- \uf0da Global Gas & LNG Portfolio: supply and sale of wholesale natural gas by pipeline, international transport and purchase and marketing of LNG. It includes gas trading activities finalized to hedging and stabilizing the trade margins, as well as optimising the gas asset portfolio.\n- \uf0da Refining &  Marketing  and  Chemicals: supply, processing, distribution and marketing of fuels and chemicals. The results of the  Chemicals  segment  were  aggregated  with  the  Refining  & Marketing performance in a single reportable segment, because these two operating segments have similar economic returns. It comprises the activities of trading oil and products with the aim to execute the transactions on the market in order to balance the supply and stabilize and cover the commercial margins.\n- \uf0da Eni gas e luce, Power & Renewables: retail sales of gas, electricity and related services, production and wholesale sales of electricity from thermoelectric and renewable plants. It includes trading activities of CO 2 emission certificates and forward sale of electricity with a view to hedging/optimising the margins of the electricity.\n- \uf0da Corporate and Other activities: includes the main business support functions, in particular holding, central treasury, IT, human resources, real estate services, captive insurance activities, research and development, new technologies, business digitalization and the environmental activity developed by the subsidiary Eni Rewind.\n\nAccording to the requirements of IFRS 8, 2019 and 2018 comparative  periods  have  been  restated  to  adjust  them  to  the change of the segment information, as follows:\n\n|                                                                                        | 2019         | 2019        | 2018         | 2018        |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|\n| (\u20ac million)                                                                            | As published | As restated | As published | As restated |\n| Adjusted net profit (loss)                                                             | 8,597        | 8,597       | 11,240       | 11,240      |\n| Exploration & Production                                                               | 8,640        | 8,640       | 10,850       | 10,850      |\n| Gas & Power                                                                            | 585          |             | 543          |             |\n| Global Gas & LNG Portfolio                                                             |              | 193         |              | 278         |\n| Refining & Marketing and Chemicals                                                     | 21           | 21          | 380          | 360         |\n| EGL, Power & Renewables                                                                |              | 370         |              | 262         |\n| Corporate and other activities                                                         | (624)        | (602)       | (606)        | (583)       |\n| Impact of unrealized intragroup profit elimination and other consolidation adjustments | (25)         | (25)        | 73           | 73          |",

The producing Countries of the cartel decided against maintaining the existing quotas and as a result the market was inundated with production while demand was crumbling. Those developments led to a collapse in commodity prices.\n\nAt the peak of the downturn, between March and April, the Brent marker price fell to about 15 $/barrel, the lowest level in over twenty years. The oversupply drove oil markets into contango, a situation when prices for prompt delivery quote below prices for future deliveries, while both land and floating storages reached the highest technical filling levels.\n\nSince May, oil prices have been staging a turnaround thanks to a  comprehensive agreement reached within OPEC+ on implementing record production cuts as well as an ongoing recovery in the world economy and oil consumption following an ease in restrictive measures and driven in large part by a strong rebound of activity in China. Brent prices recovered to almost 45 $/barrel in summer months.\n\nHowever,  during  the  autumn  months  the  macroeconomic  rebound hit a standstill in the USA and in Europe due to a resurgence in virus cases, which forced the governments and local authorities  in  those  Countries  to  reinstate  partial  or  full  lock-\n\ndowns and other restrictive measures that weighted heavily on oil and products demands as millions of people continued living in partial isolation.\n\nIn this period, crude oil prices were supported by strict production discipline on part of OPEC+ members and the market was able  to  accommodate  the  return  of  Libya's  production  by  the end of September, which quickly ramped to the plateau of 1.2 million boe/d as a result of an internal peace agreements which resolved the force majeure which had blocked export terminals. A barometer of the weakness of the fundamentals in the energy sector in the third and fourth quarter was the trend in the refining margins which dropped to historic lows due to weak demand for fuels and the crisis in the airline sector, which prevented refiners from passing the cost of the crude oil feedstock to the final prices of products. To make things worse, OPEC+ production cuts impacted  the  availability  of  medium-heavy  crudes,  narrowing the price differentials with light-medium qualities like the Brent crude and squeezing the refiners' conversion advantage.\n\nHowever, since mid-November a few market and macroeconomic developments triggered a rally in oil prices, which reached 50 $/ bbl at the end of the year rebounding from the still depressed level of October and then rose to an average of 60 $/barrel in the first quarter of 2021. First, several effective vaccines against the virus were approved. Second, the OPEC+ members resolved at a meeting in early December to slowdown the pace of easing the production curtailments scheduled to begin at the onset of 2021. Then in a subsequent meeting in early January 2021, Saudi Arabia surprised markets by announcing a unilateral cut to its production quota of 1 million barrels/d in February and March in relation to the uncertainties to the recovery in demand caused by the ongoing rise in new virus case.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Meanwhile, the pace of the economic recovery accelerated in Asia, where China and India drove a surge oil consumption. The inventory overhang began to ease due to market being better balanced. Finally, exceptional cold weather conditions hit the Far East which caused a mini energy crisis due to the sudden spike in the demand for heating products which led to a substantial increase in the JKM benchmark spot prices of LNG spot which climbed to all-time highs, up to 30-40 $/mmBTU (an increase more than 1000% compared to the values recorded in April 2020 during the peak of the crisis).\n\nThe Brent price closes the year at 50 $/barrel and the recovery accelerates at the beginning of 2021 with the psychological threshold of 60 $/barrel and an average of almost 58 $/barrel in the first two months of the year.\n\nDespite these positive developments, we believe the outlook for 2021 to remain subdued due to an ongoing slowdown in economic activity and in oil consumption in Europe and in the USA, with possible downside risks related to the evolution of the pandemic crisis and the discovery of new virus strains. Therefore, the trading environment for 2021 remains uncertainty and volatile.\n\nIn 2020 due to macroeconomic and market developments described above, the average price of the Brent benchmark crude oil decreased by 35% compared to the previous year, with an annual average of 42 $/barrel, the price of natural gas at the Italian spot market 'PSV' declined on average by 35%, and the Standard Eni Refining Margin - SERM recorded the worst performance (down by 60%). Considering the market trends, management revised the Company's outlook for hydrocarbons prices assuming a more conservative oil scenario with a LT Brent price at 60 $/barrel in 2023 real terms (compared to the previous projection of 70 $/barrel) to reflect the possible structural effects of the pandemic on oil demand and the risk that the energy transition will accelerate due to the fiscal policies adopted by governments to rebuild the economy on more sustainable basis. These developments had negative, material effects on Eni's results of operations and cash flow.\n\nIn 2020, Eni's Group reported a net loss of \u20ac8.6 billion due to the reduction in revenues driven by lower realized prices and margins for hydrocarbons with an estimated impact of \u20ac6.8 billion and lower production volumes and other business impacts caused by the COVID-19 pandemic for \u20ac1 billion, as well as the recognition of impairment losses of \u20ac3.2 billion taken at Oil & Gas assets and refineries due to a management's revised outlook on long-term oil and gas prices and lowered assumptions for the refining margins. A loss of approximately \u20ac1.3 billion was incurred in relation to the evaluation of inventories of oil and products, which were aligned to their net realizable values at period end.\n\nAll these trends caused the Group to incur an operating loss of \u20ac3.3 billion. Cost efficiencies and other management initiatives to counter the effects of the pandemic drove an improvement of \u20ac1.1 billion.\n\nFurthermore, the Group net loss for the year was also due to a \u20ac1.7\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nbillion loss taken at equity-accounted investments, \u20ac1.3 billion for the write-down of deferred tax assets due to the projections of lowered future taxable profits and the negative effects on the underlying tax rate of the recognition of non-deductible losses and charges, such as the lower intercompany marketing margins of non-equity gas entitlements, the inability to recognize deferred tax assets on losses for the year in jurisdictions with the projection of lower future taxable income and other non-deductible items.\n\nAdjusted cash flow declined to \u20ac6.7 billion with a reduction of 43% compared to 2019, due to lower prices of hydrocarbons and other scenario effects for \u20ac6 billion and the negative impact on operations associated with the COVID-19 for \u20ac1.3 billion due to lower production as a result of the curtailments of expenditures, lower demand for fuel and chemicals, longer maintenance standstills in response to the COVID-19 emergency, lower LNG offtakes and lower gas demand and higher provisions for impairment losses at trade receivables.\n\nThese negatives were partially offset by cost savings and other initiatives in response to the pandemic crisis for an amount of \u20ac2.3 billion.\n\nIn order to respond to a shortfall of such magnitude, management has taken several decisive actions to preserve the Company's liquidity, the ability to cover maturing financial obligations and to mitigate the impact of the crisis on the Group's net financial position, as follows:\n\n- \uf0da Rescheduled and optimized the capital expenditures for 20202021 years; in 2020 Eni reduced capex by approximately \u20ac2.6 billion,  around  35%  lower  than  the  initial  capital  budget  at constant exchange rates; incurring expenditures of \u20ac5 billion. Those capex reductions mainly related to upstream activities, targeting production optimization activities and the rephasing of certain development projects. The delayed or re-phased activities can be recovered once the scenario normalizes, determining a recovery of related production.\n- \uf0da Implemented widespread cost reduction initiatives across all businesses with achieved savings of about \u20ac1.9 billion in 2020, of which about 30% are of structural nature; reductions of similar amount are expected in 2021.\n- \uf0da In May 2020, a \u20ac2 billion bond was issued. Then, in October 2020 two hybrid bonds were issued for a total amount of \u20ac3 billion; those latter bonds are classified among equity for balance sheet purposes.\n- \uf0da A share repurchase program approved before the start of the crisis was put on hold.\n- \uf0da Established a new dividend policy with the introduction of a variable component of the dividend in line with the volatility of the scenario. The new policy establishes a floor dividend currently set at 0.36 \u20ac/share under the assumption of a Brent scenario of at least 43 $/barrel and a growing variable component based on a recovery in the crude oil scenario up to 65 $/barrel. The floor amount will be revalued over time depending on the Company delivering on its industrial targets. For 2020, the dividend proposal is equal to the floor dividend.",

        "page_content": "The  Company,  leveraging  on  these  measures,  successfully overcame the worst phase of the downturn, limiting the increase in the net borrowings before IFRS 16 which closed the year at \u20ac11.6 billion (unchanged over 2019), while retaining the leverage within the management comfort zone at 0.31. The Company can count to fulfill the financial obligations coming due in the short-term on a liquidity reserve of \u20ac20.4 billion as of December 31, 2020, consisting of:\n\n- \uf0da cash and cash equivalents of \u20ac9.4 billion;\n- \uf0da \u20ac5.3 billion of undrawn committed borrowing facilities;\n- \uf0da \u20ac5.5 billion of readily disposable securities (mainly government  bonds  and  corporate  investment  grade  bonds)  and \u20ac0.2 billion of short-term financing receivables.\n\nThis reserve is considered adequate to cover the main financial obligations maturing in the next twelve months relating to:\n\n- \uf0da short-term debt of \u20ac2.9 billion;\n- \uf0da maturing bonds of \u20ac1.1 billion and other maturing long-term debt of \u20ac1.1 billion;\n- \uf0da committed investments of \u20ac4.3 billion;\n- \uf0da instalments of leasing contracts coming due of \u20ac1.1 billion;\n- \uf0da the payment of a floor dividend for approximately \u20ac1.5 billion (including the final 2020 dividend and the interim floor dividend for 2021 due to paid in September).\n\nThe evolution of Group's financial situation in 2021 will depend, in addition to management initiatives, on trends in oil prices, which will be closely correlated to the evolution of the pandemic  crisis.  Considering  the  current  Oil  &  Gas  assets  portfolio, management has estimated a change of cash flow of approximately \u20ac150 million for each one-dollar change in the price of\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthe Brent crude oil benchmark and proportional changes in gas prices,  applicable for variation of 5-10 $/barrel, compared to the considered scenario for 2021 at 50 $/barrel, before further corrective actions by management and has excluded the effects  on  the  dividends  from  investments. The  short-term  recovery of the crude oil and gas prices will greatly depend on how the current COVID-19 crisis unfolds and on how long it lasts.\n\nUnder adverse assumptions, the spread of the disease could dampen or further delay an economic recovery, which could materially hit demand for energy products and prices of energy commodities. This scenario could be further complicated in case of a faltering OPEC+ policy at supporting prices by continuing to roll over the ongoing production quotas. These trends could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flow, liquidity, and business prospects, including trends in Eni shares and shareholders' returns.\n\nIn addition to the current liquidity reserve, the Company can lev-\n\nerage on a solid business model and actions finalized or started in this year that have increased the resilience to the scenario. The main point of these actions was the gradual reduction of the average breakeven of the projects in execution at 23 $/barrel thanks to the successful exploration at competitive discovery costs, the deployment of an efficient model to develop hydrocarbon reserves based on a phased approach, reduction of time-tomarket and design-to-cost.\n\nThe following tables report the breakdown of the operating profit (loss) by business and the key scenario indicators for 2020:\n\n(\u20ac million)\n\n2020\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\nChange\n\n| Exploration & Production                           | (610)   | 7,417   | 10,214   | (8,027)   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|----------|-----------|\n| Global Gas & LNG Portfolio                         | (332)   | 431     | 387      | (763)     |\n| Refining & Marketing and Chemicals                 | (2,463) | (682)   | (501)    | (1,781)   |\n| EGL, Power & Renewables                            | 660     | 74      | 340      | 586       |\n| Corporate and other activities                     | (563)   | (688)   | (668)    | 125       |\n| Impact of unrealized intragroup profit elimination | 33      | (120)   | 211      | 153       |\n| Operating profit (loss)                            | (3,275) | 6,432   | 9,983    | (9,707)   |\n\n2020\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\n% Ch.\n\n| Average price of Brent dated crude oil in U.S. dollars (a)   |   41.67 |   64.30 |   71.04 | (35.2)   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|----------|\n| Average EUR/USD exchange rate (b)                            |   1.142 |   1.119 |   1.181 | 2.0      |\n| Average price of Brent dated crude oil in euro               |  36.49  |  57.44  |  60.15  | (36.5)   |\n| Standard Eni Refining Margin (SERM) (c)                      |   1.7   |   4.3   |   3.7   | (60.5)   |\n| PSV (d)                                                      | 112     | 171     | 260     | (34.5)   |\n| TTF (d)                                                      | 100     | 142     | 243     | (29.6)   |",

Scenario effects were a loss of -\u20ac6.8 billion and the operational and volumes losses relating to the impacts associated with COVID-19 pandemic amounted to \u20ac1 billion, while the underlying performance was positive for \u20ac1.1 billion, thanks to the positive result reported in the GGP segment, leveraging on the optimizations of gas and LNG asset portfolio, which allow to exploit value from a volatile scenario , biorefineries and fuels marketing contribution and the solid and growing performance of the retail business, notwithstanding COVID-19 pandemic impacts on demand and counterparty risk.\n\nFor further information on the adjusted operating profit by business, see the paragraph 'Results by business segments'.\n\nIn 2020, the Group reported an adjusted net loss of \u20ac758 million due to the weaker operating performance, lower results reported by JV and other investments due to the deteriorated macroeconomic environment and tax rate.\n\n## Breakdown of special items\n\nAdjusted net loss includes special items consist of net charges of \u20ac6,940 million, relating to the following:\n\n- (i) net impairment losses recorded at Oil & Gas properties in production  or  under  development  (\u20ac1,888  million,  almost related  to  the  first  half),  driven  by  a  downward  revision  to management's expectations for crude oil prices in the longterm, which were reduced to 60 $/barrel and the associated curtailments  of  expenditures  in  the  years  2020-2021  with the re-phasing of a number of projects, in order to preserve cash generation, as well as negative revisions of reserves. The main impairment losses were recorded at CGUs in Italy, Algeria, Congo, the USA and Turkmenistan;\n- (ii) impairment losses at refineries driven by a lowered outlook for refining margins and expectations for a continuing narrowing in  spreads  between medium-sour crudes vs. lightsweet crude qualities, as well as the write-down of capital\n\nexpenditure relating to certain Cash Generating Units in the R&M business. These units were impaired in previous reporting periods and continued to lack any profitability prospects (for an overall impact of \u20ac1,225 million, almost related to the first half);\n\n- (iii)  the  impairment  of  Chemical  assets  due  to  a  deteriorated margin scenario (\u20ac46 million);\n- (iv)  the accounting effect of certain fair-valued commodity derivatives lacking the formal criteria to be classified as hedges, as well as the fair value of forward contracts to sell volumes of gas which were not accounted based on the own use exemption (charges of \u20ac440 million);\n- (v)  risk provisions mainly in the E&P business (\u20ac137 million);\n- (vi)  provisions for redundancy incentives (\u20ac123 million);\n- (vii) the reclassification to adjusted operating profit of the negative balance of \u20ac160 million related to derivative financial instruments used to manage margin exposure to foreign currency exchange rate movements and exchange translation differences of commercial payables and receivables;\n\n(viii) an allowance for doubtful accounts relating to receivables (\u20ac77 million) in the E&P business;\n\n- (ix)  charges relating to the JV V\u00e5r Energi, mainly driven by impairment losses recorded at Oil & Gas assets due to a revised  oil  price  outlook  and  downward  reserve  revisions, netted by the accrued currency translation differences at finance debt denominated in a currency other than the reporting  currency  for  which  the  reimbursement  cash  outflows are expected to be matched by highly probable cash inflows from the sale of production volumes, in the same currency as the finance debt as part of a natural hedge relationship (for overall charges of \u20ac1,111 million);\n- (x)  a loss of \u20ac124 million relating to the alignment of raw material and products inventories to their net realizable values at period end at ADNOC Refining;\n- (xi)  Eni's share of non current charges/impairments relating to Saipem (charges of \u20ac271 million) relating to Saipem;\n- (xii) tax effects relating to the aforementioned special items, as well as the write-down of deferred taxes due to a deteriorated profitability outlook (an overall effect of \u20ac1,278 million).\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Group tax rate was significantly and negatively affected by the following trends:\n\n- \uf0da the incurrence of non-deductible expenses and losses, because their tax recognition depends on the achievement of certain project milestones (such as a project FID) as in the case of explorations expenses or due to being related to in-\n\nrcompany losses as in the case of the one incurred in connection with the resale of the non-equity Libyan gas entitlements; those impacts under normal scenarios are strongly mitigated;\n\n- \uf0da the inability to recognize tax-losses carryforwards in certain jurisdictions  due  to  lack  of  sufficient  future  taxable  profits against which deferred tax assets are offset as required by IAS 12;\n- \uf0da the recognition of current income taxes on intercompany dividend distribution which created a mismatch due to absence of pre-tax profit at Group level (intercompany dividends are eliminated in the consolidation process).\n\nNet  of  these  transactions,  the  Group's  normalized  tax  rate would  come  at  70%  reflecting  the  high  impact  in  the  Eni's portfolio of PSA oil contracts that have tax rates less sensitive to oil prices.\n\nnon-deductible\n\nunrecognized\n\ntax accrued on\n\n| Pre-tax profit       | (\u20ac million)   | reported  (ex-special items)   | costs, losses and  exploration items   | deferred tax assets on  losses for the period   | intercompany  dividends   | normalized  tax rate   |\n|----------------------|---------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|\n| Accrued income taxes |               | 1,002                          | 741                                    |                                                 | (195)                     | 1,743                  |\n|                      |               | 1,753                          |                                        | (330)                                           |                           | 1,228                  |\n\n<!-- image -->",

The decrease was driven by a sharply deteriorated oil and natural gas pricing scenario in all the geographies, particularly in the second quarter which was the hardest hit by the downturn, as well as COVID-19 pandemic impacts (lower production volumes due to lower capital expenditures and operational impacts), OPEC+ production cuts and lower gas demand. Furthermore, the result of the period was affected by a loss incurred in reselling Libyan non-equity gas volumes, which were marketed in Europe. This resale price is excluded from the calculation of Eni's average realized gas prices be-\n\ne Eni's realized prices are calculated only with reference to equity production. Higher write-off expenses relating to unsuccessful exploration wells also negatively affected the full year performance and were partly offset by the optimization of operating expenses.\n\nAdjusted  operating  profit  excluded special charges of \u20ac2,157 million.\n\nAdjusted net profit of  \u20ac124  million  decreased  by  96.4%  from 2019 due to lower operating profit and lower results accrued by most of the equity-accounted entities driven by a significantly deteriorated  trading  environment,  except  for  V\u00e5r  Energi  which reported improving results in the fourth quarter.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

This improvement was due to the optimization of the gas and LNG assets portfolio, leveraging high price volatility and contracts'  flexibility,  as  well  as  to  a  favourable  outcome  of  an  LNG contract renegotiation closed in the third quarter. These positive trends more than offset the lower performance at the gas busi-\n\nss negatively affected by a contraction in gas demand at the main European markets due to the COVID-19 pandemic, mainly in the second quarter of 2020, being the height of the crisis. Adjusted operating profit excluded special charges of \u20ac658\n\nmillion.\n\nAdjusted  net  profit was \u20ac211 million, more than doubled from 2019 mainly due to increased operating profit.\n\n## REFINING & MARKETING AND CHEMICALS\n\n|                                                 | (\u20ac million)   | 2020    | 2019   | 2018   | Change   | % Ch.   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------|--------|--------|----------|---------|\n| Operating profit (loss)                         |               | (2,463) | (682)  | (501)  | (1,781)  | ..      |\n| Exclusion of inventory holding (gains) losses   |               | 1,290   | (318)  | 234    |          |         |\n| Exclusion of special items:                     |               | 1,179   | 1,021  | 627    |          |         |\n| - environmental charges                         |               | 85      | 244    | 193    |          |         |\n| - impairment losses (impairment reversals), net |               | 1,271   | 922    | 193    |          |         |\n| - net gains on disposal of assets               |               | (8)     | (5)    | (9)    |          |         |\n| - risk provisions                               |               | 5       | (2)    | 21     |          |         |\n| - provision for redundancy incentives           |               | 27      | 8      | 8      |          |         |\n| - commodity derivatives                         |               | (185)   | (118)  | 120    |          |         |\n| - exchange rate differences and derivatives     |               | 10      | (5)    | 5      |          |         |\n| - other                                         |               | (26)    | (23)   | 96     |          |         |\n| Adjusted operating profit (loss)                |               | 6       | 21     | 360    | (15)     | (71.4)  |\n| - Refining & Marketing                          |               | 235     | 289    | 370    | (54)     | (18.7)  |\n| - Chemicals                                     |               | (229)   | (268)  | (10)   | 39       | 14.6    |\n| Net finance (expense) income (a)                |               | (7)     | (36)   | 11     | 29       |         |\n| Net income (expense) from investments (a)       |               | (161)   | 37     | (2)    | (198)    |         |\n| of which: ADNOC Refining                        |               | (167)   | 23     |        |          |         |\n| Income taxes (a)                                |               | (84)    | (64)   | (145)  | (20)     |         |\n| Adjusted net profit (loss)                      |               | (246)   | (42)   | 224    | (204)    | ..      |\n\n(a) Excluding special items.\n\nThe Refining  &  Marketing business  reported  an adjusted operating  profit of \u20ac235 million, down by 18.7% compared to  2019.  The  oil-based  refining  business  reported  a  lower performance due to a sharply depressed scenario, negatively affected by the pandemic-induced crisis in fuels demand and by  a  worsening  conversion  premium  resulting  in  reduced refinery runs, against the backdrop of overcapacity, competitive\n\npressure and high levels of inventories. These impacts were partially offset by optimization actions of the industrial setup and  by  a  positive  performance  of  the  biorefineries  thanks to  higher  processed  volumes  and  margins.  The  marketing business reported steady results, despite a strong reduction of sales due to the pandemic effects, thanks to the optimization and efficiency initiatives.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Furthermore, lower sales volumes were negatively affected by reduced product availability due to longer maintenance standstills at the production hubs in  response  to  the  COVID-19  emergency  (particularly  at  the steam-cracking of Priolo and the Brindisi hub). Finally, these trends were more than offset in the fourth quarter by a margin recovery especially in the polyethylene business, supported the business recovery in the last part of the year.\n\nAdjusted operating profit of the R&M and Chemicals segment of \u20ac6 million, excluded special charges of \u20ac1,179 million and inventory holding losses of \u20ac1,290 million.

A lower balance between trade payables and trade receivables (+\u20ac369 million) and reduced provisions mainly due to  utilizations  with  respect  to  the  incurrence  of  expenses (+\u20ac668 million) were offset by a lower value of oil and products inventories due to the alignment of the book value to market prices at the period-end (-\u20ac841 million) and the writeoff of deferred tax assets due to a deteriorated profitability outlook.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n101",

Management periodically reviews leverage in order to assess the  soundness and efficiency of the Group balance sheet in terms of optimal mix between net borrowings and net equity, and to carry out benchmark analysis with industry standards.\n\n|                                                         | (\u20ac million)   | December 31, 2020   | December 31, 2019   | Change   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------------|---------------------|----------|\n| Total finance debt                                      |               | 26,686              | 24,518              | 2,168    |\n| -  Short-term debt                                      |               | 4,791               | 5,608               | (817)    |\n| -  Long-term debt                                       |               | 21,895              | 18,910              | 2,985    |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                               |               | (9,413)             | (5,994)             | (3,419)  |\n| Securities held for trading                             |               | (5,502)             | (6,760)             | 1,258    |\n| Financing receivables held for non-operating purposes   |               | (203)               | (287)               | 84       |\n| Net borrowings before lease liabilities ex IFRS 16      |               | 11,568              | 11,477              | 91       |\n| Lease Liabilities                                       |               | 5,018               | 5,648               | (630)    |\n| - of which Eni working interest                         |               | 3,366               | 3,672               | (306)    |\n| - of which Joint operators' working interest            |               | 1,652               | 1,976               | (324)    |\n| Net borrowings post lease liabilities ex IFRS 16        |               | 16,586              | 17,125              | (539)    |\n| Shareholders' equity including non-controlling interest |               | 37,493              | 47,900              | (10,407) |\n| Leverage before lease liability ex IFRS 16              |               | 0.31                | 0.24                | (0.07)   |\n| Leverage after lease liability ex IFRS 16               |               | 0.44                | 0.36                |          |\n\nNet borrowings as of December 31, 2020 were \u20ac16,586 million decreasing by \u20ac539 million from 2019.

Excluding the impact of IFRS 16 altogether, leverage would be 0.31.\n\n## SUMMARIZED GROUP CASH FLOW STATEMENT\n\nEni's  Summarized Group Cash Flow Statement derives from the statutory statement of cash flows. It enables investors to understand the connection existing between changes in cash and cash equivalents (deriving from the statutory cash flows statement)  and  in  net  borrowings  (deriving  from  the  summarized cash flow statement) that occurred in the reporting period. The measure which links the two statements is represented by the 'free cash flow' which is calculated as difference between the cash flow generated from operations and the net cash used in investing activities. Starting from free cash flow\n\nit is possible to determine either: (i) changes in cash and cash equivalents for the period by adding/deducting cash flows relating to financing debts/receivables (issuance/repayment of debt and receivables related to financing activities), shareholders' equity (dividends paid, net repurchase of own shares, capital issuance) and the effect of changes in consolidation and of exchange rate differences; and (ii) change in net borrowings for the period by adding/deducting cash flows relating to shareholders' equity and the effect of changes in consolidation and of exchange rate differences.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n103\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

statement of cash flow see the paragraph 'Reconciliation of Summarized Group Balance Sheet and Statement of Cash Flows to Statutory Schemes'.\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the full year 2020 was \u20ac4,822 million, 61% lower than 2019 due to a deteriorated scenario and the circumstance that the 2019 amount included higher dividends paid by the JV V\u00e5r Energi (\u20ac1,057 million in 2019 vs. \u20ac274 million in the current period).\n\nChanges in working capital in the full year of 2020 were mainly driven by a reduction in the book value of inventories due to the alignment to their net realizable values at period-end and despite a lower amount of trade receivables due in subsequent reporting periods divested to financing institutions compared to  the  fourth  quarter 2019 (-\u20ac1 billion), as well as the settlement of a contractual dispute with a first party in the E&P business (approximately -\u20ac0.4 billion).\n\nAdjusted cash flow was \u20ac6,726 million with a reduction of 43% compared to the previous year. This non-GAAP measure includes net cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital excluding inventory holding gains or losses and provisions for extraordinary credit losses and other charges, as well as the fair value of commodity derivatives lacking the formal criteria to be designated as hedges and the fair value of forward gas sale contracts with physical delivery which were not accounted in accordance with the own use exemption. The reduction from the full year of 2019 is due to scenario effects of approximately -\u20ac6.0 billion, including the impact of dividends from equity accounted entities, operational impacts associated with the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

From 2017, the recognition of the inventory holding (gains) losses has been revised in  the Gas & Power segment considering a recently-enacted, less restrictive regulatory framework relating the legal obligation on part of gas wholesalers to retain gas volumes in storage to ensure an adequate level of modulation to the retail segment. On this basis, management has progressively reduced gas quantities held in storage and has commenced to leverage those quantities to improve margins by seeking to capture the seasonality in gas prices existing between the phase of gas injection  (which  typically  occurs  in  summer  months)  vs.  the phase of gas off-take (which typically occurs during the winter months). Therefore, from the closure of the statutory period of gas injection, i.e. from the fourth quarter of 2017, the determination of the stock profit or loss in the Gas & Power segment has changed and currently gas off-takes from storage are valued at the average cost incurred during the injection period net of the effects of hedging derivatives, ensuring when the purchased volumes are matched by the corresponding sales (net of the effects of hedging derivatives) the proper measurement and accountability of the economic performances. The adjusted  operating  profit  of  each  business  segment  reports  gains and losses on derivative financial instruments entered into to manage exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates, which affect industrial margins and translation of commercial payables and receivables. Accordingly, also currency translation effects recorded through profit and loss are reported  within  business  segments'  adjusted  operating  profit.  The taxation effect of the items excluded from adjusted operating or net profit is determined based on the specific rate of taxes applicable to each of them. Management includes them in order to facilitate a comparison of base business performance across periods, and to allow financial analysts to evaluate Eni's trading performance on the basis of their forecasting models. Non-GAAP financial  measures  should  be  read  together  with information determined by applying IFRS and do not stand in for them. Other companies may adopt different methodologies to determine Non-GAAP measures. Follows the description of the main alternative performance measures adopted by Eni. The measures reported below refer to the performance of the reporting periods disclosed in this press release.\n\nAdjusted operating and net profit Adjusted operating and net profit are determined by excluding inventory holding gains or\n\nlosses, special items and, in determining the business segments' adjusted results, finance charges on finance debt and interest  income.  The  adjusted  operating  profit  of  each  business segment reports gains and losses on derivative financial instruments entered into to manage exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates which impact industrial margins and translation of commercial payables and receivables. Accordingly, also currency translation effects recorded through profit and loss are reported within business segments' adjusted operating profit. The taxation effect of the items excluded from adjusted operating or net profit is determined based on the specific rate of taxes applicable to each of them. Finance charges or income related to net borrowings excluded from the adjusted net profit of business segments are comprised of interest charges on finance debt and interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents not related to operations. Therefore, the adjusted net profit of business segments includes finance charges or income deriving from certain segment operated assets, i.e.,  interest income on certain receivable financing and securities related to operations and finance charge pertaining to the accretion of certain provisions recorded on a discounted basis (as in the case of the asset retirement obligations in the Exploration & Production segment).\n\nInventory holding gain or loss This is the difference between the cost of sales of the volumes sold in the period based on the cost of supplies of the same period and the cost of sales of the volumes sold calculated using the weighted average cost method of inventory accounting as required by IFRS.\n\nSpecial  items These  include  certain  significant  income  or charges pertaining to either: (i) infrequent or unusual events and transactions, being identified as non-recurring items under such circumstances; (ii) certain events or transactions which are not considered to be representative of the ordinary course of business, as in the case of environmental provisions, restructuring charges, asset impairments or write ups and gains or losses on divestments even though they occurred in past periods or are likely to occur in future ones. Exchange rate differences and derivatives relating to industrial activities and commercial payables and receivables, particularly exchange rate derivatives to manage commodity pricing formulas which are quoted in a currency other than the functional currency are reclassified in operating profit with a corresponding adjustment to net finance charges, notwithstanding the handling of foreign currency exchange risks is made centrally by netting off naturally-occurring opposite positions and then dealing with any residual risk exposure in the derivative market. Finally, special items include the accounting effects of fair-valued commodity derivatives relating to commercial exposures, in addition to\n\n<!-- image -->",

As provided for in  Decision No. 15519 of July 27, 2006 of the Italian market regulator (CONSOB), non-recurring material income or charges are to be clearly reported in the management's discussion and financial tables.\n\nLeverage Leverage is a Non-GAAP measure of the Company's financial condition, calculated as the ratio between net borrowings  and  shareholders'  equity,  including  non-controlling interest. Leverage is the reference ratio to assess the solidity and efficiency of the Group balance sheet in terms of incidence of funding sources including third-party funding and equity as well as to carry out benchmark analysis with industry standards.\n\nGearing Gearing is calculated as the ratio between net borrowings and capital employed net and measures how much of  capital  employed  net  is  financed  recurring  to  third-party funding.\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital at replacement cost Net cash provided from operating activities before changes in working capital and excluding inventory holding gain or loss.\n\nFree cash flow Free cash flow represents the link existing between changes in cash and cash equivalents (deriving from the  statutory  cash  flows  statement)  and  in  net  borrowings (deriving from the summarized cash flow statement) that occurred from the beginning of the period to the end of period. Free cash flow is the cash in excess of capital expenditure needs. Starting from free cash flow it is possible to determine either: (i) changes in cash and cash equivalents for the period by adding/deducting cash flows relating to financing debts/ receivables (issuance/repayment of debt and receivables related to financing activities), shareholders' equity (dividends paid,  net  repurchase  of  own  shares,  capital  issuance)  and the effect of changes in consolidation and of exchange rate differences; (ii) changes in net borrowings for the period by adding/deducting cash flows relating to shareholders' equity and the effect of changes in consolidation and of exchange rate differences.\n\nNet borrowings Net borrowings is calculated as total finance debt less cash, cash equivalents and certain very liquid investments not related to operations, including among others non-operating financing receivables and securities not related to operations. Financial activities are qualified as 'not related to\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n107\n\noperations' when these are not strictly related to the business operations.\n\nROACE (Return On Average Capital Employed) adjusted Is the return on average capital invested, calculated as the ratio between net income before minority interests, plus net financial charges on net financial debt, less the related tax effect and net average capital employed.\n\nCoverage Financial discipline ratio, calculated as the ratio between operating profit and net finance charges.\n\nCurrent ratio Measures the capability of the company to repay short-term debt, calculated as the ratio between current assets and current liabilities.\n\nDebt coverage Rating companies use the debt coverage ratio to evaluate debt sustainability. It is calculated as the ratio between net cash provided by operating activities and net borrowings,  less  cash  and  cash-equivalents,  securities  held  for non-operating purposes and financing receivables for non-operating purposes.\n\nNet Debt/EBITDA adjusted Net Debt/adjusted EBITDA is the ratio between the profit available to cover the debt before interest, taxes, amortizations and impairment. This index is a measure of the company's ability pay off its debt and gives an indication as to how long a company would need to operate at its current level to pay off all its debt.\n\nProfit per boe Measures the return per oil and natural gas barrel produced. It is calculated as the ratio between Results of operations from E&P activities (as defined by FASB Extractive Activities - Oil & Gas Topic 932) and production sold.\n\nOpex per boe Measures efficiency in the Oil & Gas development activities, calculated as the ratio between operating costs (as defined by FASB Extractive Activities - Oil and Gas Topic 932) and production sold.\n\nFinding & Development cost per boe Represents Finding & Development cost per boe of new proved or possible reserves. It is calculated as the overall amount of exploration and development expenditure, the consideration for the acquisition of possible and probable reserves as well as additions of proved reserves deriving from improved recovery, extensions, discoveries and revisions of previous estimates (as defined by FASB Extractive Activities - Oil and Gas Topic 932).\n\nThe  following  tables  report  the  group  operating  profit  and Group adjusted net profit and their breakdown by segment, as well as is represented the reconciliation with net profit attributable to Eni's shareholders of continuing operations.",

        "page_content": "## Risk factors and uncertainties\n\n## RISK FACTORS AND UNCERTAINTIES\n\nThe risks described below may have a material effect on our operational and financial performance. We invite our investors to consider these risks carefully.\n\n## Strategic risks and risks related to the business activities and industries of Eni and its consolidated subsidiaries\n\nThe Company's performance is affected by volatile prices of crude oil and produced natural gas and by fluctuating margins on the marketing of natural gas and on the integrated production and marketing of refined products and chemical products\n\nThe price of crude oil is the single, largest variable that affects the Company's operating performance and cash flow. The price of crude oil has a history of volatility because, like other commodities, it is cyclical and is influenced by several macro-factors that are beyond management's control. Crude oil prices are mainly driven by the balance between global oil supplies and demand and hence the global levels of inventories and spare capacity. In the short-term, worldwide demand for crude oil is highly correlated to the macroeconomic cycle. A downturn in economic activity normally triggers lower global demand for crude oil and possibly a supply build-up. Whenever global supplies of crude oil outstrip demand, crude oil prices weaken. Factors that can influence the global economic activity in the shortterm and demand for crude oil include several, unpredictable events, like trends in the economic growth in China, India, the United States and other large oil-consuming Countries, financial crisis, geo-political crisis, local conflicts and wars, social instability, pandemic diseases, the flows of international commerce, trade disputes and governments' fiscal policies, among others. All these events could influence demands for crude oil. In the long-term, factors which can influence demands for crude oil include on the positive side demographic growth, improving living standards and GDP expansion. Negative factors that may affect demand in the long-term comprise availability of alternative sources of energy (e.g., nuclear and renewables), technological advances  affecting  energy  efficiency,  measures  which  have been adopted or planned by governments all around the world to tackle climate change and to curb carbon-dioxide emissions (CO 2 emissions),  including  stricter  regulations  and  control  on production and consumption of crude oil, or a shift in consumer preferences. The civil society and several governments all over the world, with the EU leading the way, have announced plans to transition towards a low carbon model through various means and strategies, particularly by supporting  development of renewable energies and the replacement of internal combustion vehicles with electric vehicles, including the possible adoption\n\nof tougher regulations on the use of hydrocarbons such as the taxation of CO 2 emissions as a mitigation action of the climate change risk. The push to reduce worldwide greenhouse gas emissions and an ongoing energy transition towards a low carbon economy, which are widely considered to be irreversible trends, will represent in our view major trends in shaping global demand for crude oil over the long-term and may lead to structural lower crude oil demands and consumption. We also believe that the dramatic events of 2020 in relation to the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic could have possibly accelerated those trends. See the section dedicated to the discussion of climate-related risks below.\n\nGlobal production of crude oil is controlled to a large degree by the OPEC cartel, which has recently extended to include other important oil producers like Russia and Kazakhstan (so-called OPEC+). Saudi Arabia plays a crucial role within the cartel, because it is estimated to hold huge amounts of reserves and a vast majority of worldwide spare production capacity. This explains why geopolitical developments in the Middle East and particularly in the Gulf area, like regional conflicts, acts of war, strikes, attacks, sabotages and social and political tensions can have a big influence on crude oil prices. Also, sanctions imposed by the United States and the EU against certain producing Countries may influence trends in crude oil prices. However, we believe that the continued rise of crude oil production in the United States due to the technology-driven shale oil revolution has somewhat reduced the ability of the OPEC+ to control the global supply of oil. To a lesser extent, factors like adverse weather conditions such as, hurricanes in sensitive areas like the Gulf of Mexico, and operational issues at key petroleum infrastructure can influence crude oil prices.\n\nThe year 2020 was one of the worst on record for the Oil & Gas industry due to the far-reaching consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, the long-term impacts of which have yet to be understood and estimated. Almost all of the companies in the sector suffered material economic losses and cash flow shortfalls and saw their business fundamentals along with share prices significantly deteriorate due to a massive hit to global demand for crude oil and other energy products and to collapsing commodity prices as direct consequences of the lockdown measures imposed in the first months of the year by governments throughout the world to contain the spread of the pandemic, leading to the suppression of industrial activity, international commerce and travel as well as souring the moods of consumers. To make things worse, while demand was falling precipitously, in\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "March 2020 the OPEC+ failed to reach a deal for production cuts claimed by some members to counteract the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and Saudi Arabia decided to increase its output and reduce prices to gain market share. The concurrence of a material reduction in global crude oil demand and rising production on the part of the OPEC+ members triggered a collapse in crude oil prices. At the peak of the COVID-19 crisis and the price war, the value of the Brent crude benchmark had fallen to below 15 $/BBL, marking the lowest point over several decades on an inflation-adjusted basis. The situation of extreme oversupply in the month of April 2020 was signalled by ballooning global inventories, depletion of storage capacity and a strong contango structure in the prices of contracts for future deliveries. Subsequently, with the gradual easing of lockdown measures and the implementation from May 2020 of major output cuts by the members of the OPEC+ as well as major capex curtailments implemented by international Oil & Gas companies, Brent prices staged a significant comeback, recovering to  a  level  of  almost  45  $/BBL  in  July.  However,  this  recovery weakened at the end of the summer and in the autumn months due to a continuing rise in COVID-19 cases in western Countries,  particularly in the United States, continental Europe and the UK forcing national or local governments to re-impose new restrictive measures or full lockdowns to curb the spread of the virus, which negatively affected the pace of economic recovery and the consumption of fuels like gasoline and gasoil. On the other hand, an acceleration in the economic recovery in mainland China and other Asian Countries where the virus was more effectively contained helped sustain the price of crude oil and a reduction in global inventories. Finally, the recovery of crude oil prices gained strength in the final months of 2020 and in the first months of 2021 due to a favourable combination of market and macro developments, most notably: a break-through in the development  and  approval  of  effective  vaccines  against  COVID-19, further acceleration in the pace of economic activity in Asia, the outcome of the presidential election in the United States which fuelled expectations of large stimulus measures in favour of the U.S. economy, the continuing commitments on the part of OPEC+ to support the rebalancing of the oil market by slowing down the planned curtailments of the extra production quotas enacted in May 2020 and finally the surprising announcement by Saudi Arabia that it would implement a voluntary cut of its production quota of 1 million barrels/day in the months of February and March 2021 to compensate for any possible impact on demand due to recrudescence of the pandemic in western Countries. Unexpectedly, while oil companies' executives, traders and fund managers were weighing all these macro and market developments, a massive, unprecedented cold snap hit\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthe Northern-Eastern hemisphere, particularly Japan, South Korea and China, causing a spike in demand for oil-based heating fuels and LNG, which significantly boosted the market prices of  all  hydrocarbons.  Due  to  such  recent  developments,  Brent crude oil prices strengthened to 50 $/bbl at the end of 2020 and then rallied further in the first quarter of 2021 averaging about 60 $/bbl. Despite this improvement, we expect the trading environment for crude oil price to remain volatile and uncertain in 2021 due to the virus overhang, a weak macroeconomic backdrop in the United States and Europe and high inventory levels in OECD Countries, which remain above historical averages.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic negatively and materially affected a weak global natural gas market. As a result of the gas demand collapse recorded in the first half of 2020 due to the economic crisis resulting from COVID-19, gas prices fell to unprecedented lows in all the main geographies. Likewise, crude oil and natural gas prices recovered in the second half of the year supported by an improving economy and falling production levels due to capex constraints on global Oil & Gas companies. Overall, natural gas prices fell remarkably in 2020 (the  prices  at  the  Italian  spot  market  were  35%  lower  than in 2019). However, at the end of 2020 and in January 2021 natural gas prices staged a material comeback supported by record seasonal demand in the Northern-Eastern hemisphere driven by record low temperatures.\n\nLower hydrocarbon prices from one year to another negatively affect the Group's consolidated results of operations and cash flow. This is because lower prices translate into lower revenues  recognised  in  the  Company's  Exploration  &  Production segment at the time of the price change, whereas expenses in this segment are either fixed or less sensitive to changes in crude oil prices than revenues. In 2020, the Brent price averaged about 42 $/bbl, a decrease of 35% compared to 2019, which significantly and adversely affected Eni's results of operations and cash flow for the year. We estimated that lower equity crude oil realizations and other scenario effects (lower  equity  gas  prices,  lower  refining  margins  and  other declines as described below) reduced the Company's underlying operating profit and the net cash provided by operating activities by about \u20ac7 billion.\n\nConsidering the risks and uncertainties to the outlook for 2021, we are retaining a prudent financial framework and capital discipline in our investment decisions, while we are assuming a Brent price forecast of 50 $/bbl for the full year. Based on the current Oil & Gas assets portfolio of Eni, management estimates that the Company's cash flow from operations will vary by",

Lower oil and gas prices over prolonged periods of time may have material adverse effects on Eni's performance and business outlook, because such a scenario may limit the Group's ability to finance expansion  projects,  further  reducing  the  Company's  ability  to grow future production and revenues, and to meet contractual obligations. The Company may also need to review investment decisions and the viability of development projects and capex plans  and,  as  a  result  of  this  review,  the  Company  could  reschedule, postpone or curtail development projects. A structural decline in hydrocarbon prices could trigger a review of the carrying amounts of oil and gas properties and this could result in recording material asset impairments and in the de-booking of proved reserves, if they become uneconomic in this type of environment.\n\nIn the course of 2020 Eni's management revised its view of the oil market fundamentals to factor in certain emerging trends. Management considered that the lockdown measures in response to COVID-19 could result in a prolonged pe riod of weak oil demand. Furthermore, the massive actions in support of the economic recovery planned by governments in several Countries may have a strong environmental footprint and be supportive of the green economy, leading to a potential acceleration in the pace of energy transition and in the replacement of hydrocarbons in the energy mix in the long-term. Based on these considerations, in 2020 the Company revised its long-term forecast for hydrocarbon prices, which are the main driver of capital allocations decisions and of the recoverability assessment of the book values of our non-current assets. The revised scenario adopted by Eni foresees a long-term price of the marker Brent of 60 $/bbl in 2023 real terms compared to the previous assumption of 70 $/bbl. The price of natural gas at the Italian spot market 'PSV' is estimated at 5.5 $/mmBTU in real terms in 2023 as compared to the previous assumption of 7.8 $/mmBTU. This changed outlook for hydrocarbons prices drove the recognition of significant impairment losses relating to Oil & Gas assets (\u20ac1.9 billion, pre-tax). For further details, see the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Furthermore, given the decline in crude oil prices used in the estimation of proved reserves according to the SEC rules compared to 2019 (average of the first-of-the-day price of each month at 41 $/bbl in 2020 vs. 63 $/bbl in 2019), we were forced to debook 124 mmBOE of reserves that have become uneconomic in this environment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFinally, during a downturn like the one experienced in 2020, the Group's access to capital may be reduced and lead to a downgrade or other negative rating action with respect to the Group's credit rating by rating agencies. These downgrades may negatively affect the Group's cost of capital, increase the Group's financial expenses, and may limit the Group's ability to access capital markets and execute aspects of the Group's business plans.\n\nEni estimates that approximately 50% of its current production is exposed to fluctuations in hydrocarbons prices. Exposure to this strategic risk is not subject to economic hedging, except for  some  specific  market  conditions  or  transactions.  The  remaining portion of Eni's current production is largely unaffected by crude oil price movements considering that the Company's property portfolio is characterized by a sizeable presence of production sharing contracts, whereby the Company is entitled to a portion of a field's reserves, the sale of which is intended to cover expenditures incurred by the Company to develop and operate the field. The higher the reference prices for Brent crude oil used to estimate Eni's proved reserves, the lower the number of barrels necessary to recover the same amount of expenditure and hence production, and vice versa.\n\nAll these risks may adversely and materially impact the Group's results of operations, cash flow, liquidity, business prospects, financial condition, and shareholder returns, including dividends, the amount of funds available for stock repurchases and the price of Eni's share.\n\nMargins on the manufacturing and sale of fuels and other refined products, chemical commodities, and other energy commodities are driven by economic growth, global and regional dynamics in supplies and demand and other competitive factors. Generally speaking, the prices of products mirror that of oil-based feedstock, but they can also move independently. Margins for refined and chemical products depend upon the speed at which products' prices adjust to reflect movements in oil prices. Margins at our business of wholesale marketing of natural gas are driven by the spreads between spot prices at continental hubs to which our procurement costs are indexed and the spot prices at the Italian hub where a large part of our gas sales occur. These spreads can be very volatile.\n\nIn 2020, demand and margins for fuels and petrochemical products were materially hit by the economic downturn triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in lower demand for fuels and petrochemical commodities. The trading environment was particularly unfavourable in the refining business due to an unprecedented combination of negative market trends. During the peak of the pandemic crisis in the second quarter of 2020, the lockdown measures imposed by governments throughout the world to curb the spread of the pandemic resulted in the suppression of air travel and people's commuting by car leading to",

Furthermore, while those restrictive measures were eased in Asia and other parts of the world, they have continued or have been re-imposed in Italy and other European Countries, which are the main reference markets of our refining and marketing business. Although since the implementation of the production cuts by OPEC+ producers, crude oil prices have been moderately recovering throughout 2020, the increases in the cost of the feedstock did not translate into higher prices of fuels due to a depressed demand environment. Finally, the profitability of our business was also negatively affected by the appreciation of sour crude oils towards medium/light qualities such as the Brent, due to market dislocations and the effects of the production cuts implemented by the OPEC+, which reduced availability of sour crudes in the marketplace. This latter trend negatively affected the profitability of conversion plants, which are normally supported by the fact that heavy and sour crudes trade at a discount vs. the light qualities as the Brent. Due  to  all  those  market  trends,  the  Company's  own  internal performance measure to gauge the profitability of its refineries, the SERM (see glossary), fell to historic lows over the second half of 2020, plunging into negative territory at the end of 2020 and the beginning of 2021 in concomitance with the rally in crude oil prices, which has yet to be supported by a recovery of fuel demand in Europe. This trend will negatively affect the profitability of our refining business in 2021. The sales volumes at our network of service stations were significantly impacted by lower consumption due to the lockdown and anti-pandemic measures. The  deteriorated  outlook  for  refining  margins  and fuels consumption triggered a revision of the book value of the Company's oil-based refining assets leading to the recognition of \u20ac1.2 billion of impairment losses.\n\nThe chemical business of Eni was negatively affected by a significant reduction in demand in the segments most exposed to the COVID-19 crisis such as elastomers following the contraction in the automotive sector, while the polyethylene margins were supported both by the reduction in the cost of oil feedstock  and  by  strong  demand  for  single-use  plastics  and packaging as consequence of higher demand for goods related to 'stay-at-home economy'.\n\nThere is strong competition worldwide, both within the oil industry and with other industries, to supply energy and petroleum products  to  the  industrial,  commercial  and  residential  energy markets\n\nEni faces strong competition in each of its business segments.\n\nThe current competitive environment in which Eni operates is characterised by volatile prices and margins of energy commodities, limited product differentiation and complex relationships with  state-owned  companies  and  national  agencies  of  the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCountries where hydrocarbons reserves are located to obtain mineral rights. As commodity prices are beyond the Company's control, Eni's ability to remain competitive and profitable in this environment requires continuous focus on technological innovation,  the  achievement  of  efficiencies  in  operating  costs,  effective management of capital resources and the ability to provide valuable services to energy buyers. It also depends on Eni's ability to gain access to new investment opportunities. The economic crisis caused by the suppression of industrial activity and travel in response to the COVID-19 pandemic materially and negatively impacted demand for the Company's products, driving a strong increase in the level of competition across all sectors where we are operating. We believe that the pandemic will have enduring effects on the competition within the Oil & Gas sectors, including the refining and marketing of fuels and other energy commodities and the supply of energy products to the retail segment.\n\n- \uf0da In the Exploration & Production segment, Eni is facing competition from both international and state-owned oil companies for obtaining exploration and development rights and developing and applying new technologies to maximise hydrocarbon recovery. Because of its smaller size relative to other international oil companies, Eni may face a competitive disadvantage when bidding for large scale or capital intensive projects and it may be exposed to the risk of obtaining lower cost savings in a deflationary environment compared to its larger competitors given its potentially smaller market power with respect to suppliers. Due to those competitive pressures, Eni may fail to obtain new exploration and development acreage, to apply and develop new technologies and to control costs. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused exploration & production companies to significantly reduce their capital investment in response to lower cash flows from operations and  to  focus  on  the  more  profitable  and  scenario-resilient projects. We believe that this development will be long-lasting and likely drive increased competition among players to gain access to relatively cheaper reserves (onshore vs. offshore; proven areas vs. unexplored areas).\n- \uf0da In the Global Gas & LNG Portfolio business, Eni is facing strong competition in the European wholesale markets to sell gas to industrial customers, the thermoelectric sector and retail companies from other gas wholesalers, upstream companies, traders and other players. The results of our wholesale gas business are subject to global and regional dynamics of gas demand and supplies. The results of the LNG business are mainly influenced by the global balance between demand and supplies, considering the higher level of flexibility of LNG with respect to gas delivered via pipeline. In 2020, the economic crisis triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated the already weak fundamentals of the gas market. In fact, the lockdown of European economies resulted in sharply lower gas consumption leading to intensified competitive pressures. These developments caused lower sales volumes of gas",

        "page_content": "marketed via pipeline and by our LNG business and significantly lower prices. In 2020 Eni's gas and LNG sales declined by 11% due to the impact of the economic crisis triggered by the pandemic. Sales margins at our LNG business were put under pressure by collapsing demand due to the lockdown of Asian economies, which are the main outlet of global LNG production, as many buyers requested activation of the force majeure clauses for not lifting LNG contracted volumes. These developments led to increased competition in the global LNG market, dragging down sales margins. We expect continued competitive pressure in our wholesale gas and LNG businesses. However, in the first months of 2021 a colder-than normal winter in the Northern Hemisphere has supported the price of gas and LNG.\n\n- \uf0da In the Refining & Marketing segment, Eni is facing competition both in the refining business and in the retail marketing activity. Our Refining business has been negatively affected for years by structural headwinds due to muted trends in the European demand for fuels, refining overcapacity and continued competitive pressure from players in the Middle East, the United States and Far East Asia. Those competitors can leverage on larger plant scale and cost economies, availability of cheaper feedstock and lower energy expenses. This unfavourable competitive environment has been exacerbated by the effects of the 2020 economic crisis due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the consequent lockdown of entire economies and travel restrictions, which drove a collapse in the consumption of motor gasoline, jet fuels and other refined products. In the initial stages of the global energy downturn, refining  margins  were  supported  by  a  collapse  in  crude  oil prices. Subsequently, as crude oil prices found support in the production curtailments implemented by the OPEC+, refining margins were severely hit by the weakness in global demand for fuels due to low propensity of people for travelling, which squeezed relative prices of fuels vs. the oil feedstock cost. This trend became particularly unfavourable starting from the summer months when refining margins were much less profitable, until the last months of the year when they even recorded negative value. On average, in 2020, the refining margin (SERM) dropped materially, down by 60% as compared to the prior year. Furthermore, Eni's refining profitability was exposed to the volatility in the spreads between crudes with high sulphur content or sour crudes and the Brent crude benchmark, which is a low-content sulphur crude. Eni's complex refineries are able to process sour crudes, which typically trade at a discount over Brent crude. Historically, this discount has supported the profitability of complex refineries, like our plant at Sannazzaro in Italy. However, in the course of 2020, a shortfall in supplies of sour crudes due to the production cuts  implemented  by  OPEC+  in  response  to  the  COVID-19 pandemic, drove an appreciation of the relative prices of sour crudes as compared to Brent, which negatively affected the results of Eni's refining business by reducing the advantage\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nof processing sour crudes. Eni believes that the competitive environment  of  the  refining  sector  will  remain  challenging in the foreseeable future, considering ongoing uncertainties and risks relating to the strength of the economic recovery in Europe and worldwide, and risks of another round of lockdown measures in case of failure by governments to effectively contain the spread of the pandemic, which would weigh heavily on demand for fuels. Other risks factors include refining overcapacity in the European area and expectations of a new investment cycle driven by capacity expansion plans announced in Asia and the Middle East, potentially leading to global oversupplies of refinery products. Due to a reduced profitability outlook in the refining business, management recognized impairment charges of \u20ac1.2 billion to align the book value of refineries to their realizable values.\n\nThe business of marketing refined products to drivers at our network of service stations and to large account customers (airlines, public administrations, transport and industrial customers,  bulk  buyers  and  resellers)  is  facing  competition from other oil companies and newcomers such as low-scale and local operators, and un-branded networks with light cost structure. All of these operators compete with each other primarily in terms of pricing and, to a lesser extent, service quality. Against this backdrop, in 2020 the lockdown measures adopted to contain the spread of the pandemic resulted in the suppression of travel and road transportation which weighed heavily on throughput volumes at our network of service stations in Italy and other European markets which were down by 19.9% as compared to the prior year.\n\n- \uf0da Eni's Chemical business is in a highly-cyclical, very competitive sector. We have been facing for years strong competition from well-established international players and state-owned petrochemical companies, particularly in the most commoditised market segments such as the production of basic petrochemical products (like ethylene and polyethylene), where demand is a function of macroeconomic growth. Many of these competitors based in the Far East and the Middle East have been able to benefit from cost economies due to larger plant scale, wide geographic moat, availability of cheap feedstock and proximity to end-markets. Excess worldwide capacity of petrochemical commodities has also fuelled competition in this business. Furthermore, petrochemical producers based in the United States have regained market share, as their cost structure has become competitive due to the availability of cheap feedstock deriving from the production of domestic shale gas from which ethane is derived, which is a cheaper raw material for the production of ethylene than the oil-based feedstock utilised by Eni's petrochemical subsidiaries. Finally, rising public concern about climate change and the preservation of the environment has begun to negatively affect the consumption of single-use plastics. In 2020, these competitive dynamics were greatly amplified by the economic crisis triggered by the lockdown measures in response to the CO-",

        "page_content": "VID-19 pandemic, which negatively affected plant utilization rates and sales volumes, particularly in those segments more exposed to the recession of their customer segments, like in the case of sales volumes of elastomers to the automotive industry. However, other chemicals segments performed relatively  well,  because  the  'stay-at-home  economy'  boosted demands for certain products like polyethylene, that is utilized in the packaging of food and other consumer goods as well as in materials for the sanitary emergency. These trends supported polyethylene margins. Looking forward, management believes that the competitive environment in the Chemicals businesses will remain challenging due to uncertainties and risks relating to the strength of the economic recovery or another round of lockdown measures in case of by governments to effectively contain the spread of the pandemic.\n\n- \uf0da Eni's Retail gas and power business engages in the supply of gas and electricity to customers in the retail markets mainly in  Italy,  France  and  other  Countries  in  Europe.  Customers include  households,  large  residential  accounts  (hospitals, schools,  public  administration  buildings,  offices)  and  small and medium-sized businesses. The retail market is characterised by strong competition among selling companies which mainly compete in terms of pricing and the ability to bundle valuable services with the supply of the energy commodity. In this segment, competition has intensified in recent years due to the progressive liberalisation of the market and the ability of residential customers to switch smoothly from one supplier to another. In 2020, the performance of this business was negatively affected by the economic crisis caused by the lockdown measures imposed to contain the spread of COVID-19, which reduced energy demand particularly in the segments of medium and small businesses, increased credit risk and triggered increased credit losses. In 2020, sales volumes of natural gas to the retail market fell by 11%; however, this trend was partly offset by greater power requirements due to the 'stay-at-home economy' with sales volumes up by 13% for the year. We anticipate that competition will remain strong in this business due to the likelihood of a slow economic recovery and weak trends in energy consumption, as well as the potential risk of yet another downturn in case of new lockdown measures to contain the pandemic and rising sensitivity among households and businesses to reduce the cost of the energy bill.\n\nEni also engages in the business of producing gas-fired electricity that is largely sold at wholesale energy market and balancing market (so called MSD) in Italy. Margins on the sale of electricity have declined in recent years due to oversupplies, weak economic growth and inter-fuel competition. The pandemic-driven economic crisis has exacerbated those trends, causing a material reduction in power consumption due to the lockdowns of entire industrial sectors and producing activities. In 2020, power sales in the wholesale market in Italy fell by 10% due to lower\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n119\n\nconsumption by Italian businesses. Management believes that these factors will continue to negatively affect clean spark spread margins on electricity in the Italian wholesale markets.\n\nIn case the Company is unable to effectively manage the above described competitive risks, which may increase in case of a weaker-than-anticipated recovery in the post-pandemic economy or in a worst case scenario of the imposition by governments of new lockdown measures and other restrictions in response to the pandemic, the Group's future results of operations, cash flow, liquidity, business prospects, financial condition, shareholder returns, including dividends, the amount of funds available for stock repurchases and the price of Eni's shares may be adversely and significantly affected.\n\n## Safety, security, environmental and other operational risks\n\nThe Group engages in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas, processing, transportation and refining of crude oil, transport of natural gas, storage and distribution of petroleum products and the production of base chemicals, plastics and elastomers. By their nature, the Group's operations expose Eni to  a  wide  range  of  significant  health,  safety,  security  and  environmental risks. Technical faults, malfunctioning of plants, equipment and facilities, control systems failure, human errors, acts of sabotage, attacks, loss of containment and adverse weather events can trigger damaging consequences such as explosions,  blow-outs,  fires,  oil  and  gas  spills  from  wells,  pipeline and tankers, release of contaminants and pollutants in the air, the ground and in the water, toxic emissions and other negative events. The magnitude of these risks is influenced by the geographic range, operational diversity and technical complexity of Eni's activities. Eni's future results of operations and liquidity depend on its ability to identify and address the risks and hazards inherent to operating in those industries.\n\nIn the Exploration & Production segment, Eni faces natural hazards and other operational risks including those relating to the physical and geological characteristics of oil and natural gas fields.  These  include  the  risks  of  eruptions  of  crude  oil  or  of natural gas, discovery of hydrocarbon pockets with abnormal pressure, crumbling of well openings, leaks that can harm the environment  and  the  security  of  Eni's  personnel  and  risks  of blowout, fire or explosion.\n\nEni's activities in the Refining & Marketing and Chemical segment entail health, safety and environmental risks related to the handling, transformation and distribution of oil, oil products and certain petrochemical products. These risks can arise from the intrinsic characteristics and the overall lifecycle of the products manufactured and the raw materials used in the manufacturing process, such as oil-based feedstock, catalysts, additives and monomer feedstock. These risks comprise flammability, toxicity, long-term environmental impact such as greenhouse gas",

Risks  in  transportation activities depend on several factors and variables, including the hazardous nature of the products transported due to their flammability and toxicity, the transportation methods utilized (pipelines, shipping, river freight, rail, road and gas distribution networks),  the  volumes  involved  and  the  sensitivity  of  the  regions through which the transport passes (quality of infrastructure, population  density,  environmental  considerations).  All  modes of transportation of hydrocarbons are particularly susceptible to risks of blowout, fire and loss of containment and, given that normally high volumes are involved, could present significant risks to people, the environment and the property.\n\nEni has material offshore operations relating to the exploration and production of hydrocarbons. In 2020, approximately 65% of Eni's total oil and gas production for the year derived from offshore fields, mainly in Egypt, Libya, Angola, Norway, Congo, Indonesia,  the  United  Arab  Emirates,  Italy,  Ghana,  Venezuela, the  United  Kingdom,  Nigeria  and  the  United  States.  Offshore operations in the oil and gas industry are inherently riskier than onshore activities. Offshore accidents and spills could cause damage of catastrophic proportions to the ecosystem and to communities' health and security due to the apparent difficulties in handling hydrocarbons containment, pollution, poisoning of water and organisms, length and complexity of cleaning operations and other factors. Furthermore, offshore operations are subject to marine risks, including storms and other adverse weather conditions and perils of vessel collisions, which may cause material adverse effects on the Group's operations and the ecosystem.\n\nThe Company has invested and will continue to invest significant financial resources to continuously upgrade the methods and systems for safeguarding the reliability of its plants, production  facilities,  transport  and  storage  infrastructures,  the safety and the health of its employees, contractors, local communities and the environment, to prevent risks, to comply with applicable laws and policies and to respond to and learn from unforeseen incidents. Eni seeks to manage these operational risks by carefully designing and building facilities, including wells, industrial complexes, plants and equipment, pipelines, storage sites and other facilities, and managing its operations in a safe and reliable manner and in compliance with all applicable rules and regulations, as well as by applying the best available techniques in the marketplace. However, these measures may  ultimately  not  be  completely  successful  in  preventing and/or altogether eliminating risks of adverse events. Failure\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nto properly manage these risks as well as accidental events like human errors, unexpected system failure, sabotages or other unexpected drivers could cause oil spills, blowouts, fire, release of toxic gas and pollutants into the atmosphere or the environment or in underground water and other incidents, all of which could lead to loss of life, damage to properties, environmental pollution, legal liabilities and/or damage claims and consequently a disruption in operations and potential economic losses that could have a material and adverse effect on the Group's results of operations, cash flow, liquidity, business prospects, financial condition, and shareholder returns, including dividends, the amount of funds available for stock repurchases and the price of Eni's shares.\n\nEni's  operations  are  often  conducted  in  difficult  and/or  environmentally sensitive locations such as the Gulf of Mexico, the Caspian Sea and the Arctic. In such locations, the consequences of any incident could be greater than in other locations. Eni also faces risks once production is discontinued because Eni's activities require the decommissioning of productive infrastructures and environmental sites remediation and clean-up. Furthermore, in certain situations where Eni is not the operator, the Company may have limited influence and control over third parties, which may limit its ability to manage and control such risks. Eni retains worldwide third-party liability insurance coverage, which is designed to hedge part of the liabilities associated with damage to third parties, loss of value to the Group's assets related to unfavourable events and in connection with environmental clean-up and remediation. As of the date of this filing, maximum compensation allowed under such insurance coverage is equal to $1.2 billion in case of offshore incident and $1.4 billion in case of incident at onshore facilities (refineries). Additionally, the Company may also activate further insurance coverage in case of specific capital projects and other industrial initiatives. Management believes that its insurance coverage is in line with industry practice and is enough to cover normal risks in its operations. However, the Company is not insured against all potential risks. In the event of a major environmental disaster, such as the incident which occurred at the Macondo well in the Gulf of Mexico several years ago, for example, Eni's third-party liability insurance would not provide any material coverage and thus the Company's liability would far exceed the maximum coverage provided by its insurance. The loss Eni could suffer in case of a disaster of material proportions would depend on all the facts and circumstances of the event and would be subject to a whole range of uncertainties, including legal uncertainty as to the scope of liability for consequential damages, which may include economic damage not directly connected to the disaster. The Company cannot guarantee that it will not suffer any uninsured loss and there can be no guarantee, particularly in the case of a major environmental disaster or industrial accident, that such a loss would not have a material adverse effect on the Company.",

In colder years, demand for such products is higher. Accordingly, the results of operations of our businesses engaged in the marketing of natural gas and, to a lesser extent, the Refining & Marketing business, as well as the comparability of results over different periods may be affected by such changes in weather conditions. Over recent years, this pattern could have been possibly affected by the rising frequency of weather trends like milder winter or extreme weather events like heatwaves or unusually cold snaps, which are possible consequences of climate change. In 2020, our sales volumes of gas both at wholesale markets and at the retail sector particularly in Italy were negatively affected by lower seasonal sales in the first quarter.\n\n## Risks associated with the exploration and production of oil and natural gas\n\nThe exploration and production of oil and natural gas require high levels of capital expenditures and are subject to natural hazards and other uncertainties, including those relating to the physical  characteristics  of  oil  and  gas  fields.  The  exploration and production activities are subject to mining risk and the risks of cost overruns and delayed start-up at the projects to develop and produce hydrocarbons reserves. Those risks could have an adverse,  significant  impact  on  Eni's  future  growth  prospects, results  of  operations,  cash  flows,  liquidity  and  shareholders' returns.\n\nThe production of oil and natural gas is highly regulated and is subject to conditions imposed by governments throughout the world in matters such as the award of exploration and production leases, the imposition of specific drilling and other work obligations, higher-than-average rates of income taxes, additional royalties and taxes on production, environmental protection measures, control over the development and decommissioning of fields and installations, and restrictions on production. A description of the main risks facing the Company's business in the exploration and production of oil and gas is provided below.\n\nExploratory drilling efforts may be unsuccessful\n\nExploration  activities  are  mainly  subject  to  mining  risk,  i.e. the  risk  of  dry  holes  or  failure  to  find  commercial  quantities of hydrocarbons. The costs of drilling and completing wells\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n121\n\nhave margins of uncertainty, and drilling operations may be unsuccessful because of a large variety of factors, including geological failure, unexpected drilling conditions, pressure or heterogeneities in formations, equipment failures, well control (blowouts)  and  other  forms  of  accidents.  A  large  part  of  the Company exploratory drilling operations is located offshore, including in deep and ultra-deep waters, in remote areas and in environmentally-sensitive locations (such as the Barents Sea, the Gulf of Mexico, deep water prospect off West Africa, Indonesia, the Mediterranean Sea and the Caspian Sea). In these locations, the Company generally experiences higher operational risks and more challenging conditions and incurs higher exploration  costs  than  onshore.  Furthermore,  deep  and  ultra-deep water  operations  require  significant  time  before  commercial production of discovered reserves can commence, increasing both the operational and the financial risks associated with these activities. Because Eni plans to make significant investments in executing exploration projects, it is likely that the Company will incur significant amounts of dry hole expenses in future years. Unsuccessful exploration activities and failure to discover additional commercial reserves could reduce future production of oil and natural gas, which is highly dependent on the rate of success of exploration projects and could have an adverse impact on Eni's future performance and returns.\n\nDevelopment  projects  bear  significant  operational  risks  which may adversely affect actual returns\n\nEni is executing or is planning to execute several development projects to produce and market hydrocarbon reserves. Certain projects target the development of reserves in high-risk areas, particularly deep offshore and in remote and hostile environments or in environmentally sensitive locations. Eni's future results of operations and business prospects depend heavily on its ability to implement, develop and operate major projects as planned. Key factors that may affect the economics of these projects include:\n\n- \uf0da the  outcome  of  negotiations  with  joint  venture  partners, governments  and  state-owned  companies,  suppliers  and potential customers to define project terms and conditions, including,  for  example,  Eni's  ability  to  negotiate  favourable long-term contracts to market gas reserves;\n- \uf0da commercial arrangements and granting of all necessary administrative authorizations to build pipelines and related equipment to transport and market hydrocarbons;\n- \uf0da timely  issuance  of  permits  and  licenses  by  government agencies;\n- \uf0da the ability to carry out the front-end engineering design in order to prevent the occurrence of technical inconvenience during the execution phase; timely manufacturing and delivery of critical equipment by contractors, shortages in the availability of such equipment or lack of shipping yards where complex offshore units such as FPSO and platforms are built; delays in",

Those activities include the appraisal of a discovery to evaluate the technical and economic feasibility of the development project, obtaining the necessary authorizations from governments, state agencies or national oil companies, signing agreements with the first party regulating a project's contractual terms such as the production sharing, obtaining partners' approval, environmental permits and other conditions,  signing  long-term  gas  contracts,  carrying  out  the concept design and the front-end engineering and building and commissioning the related plants and facilities. All these activities normally can take years to perform. As a consequence, rates of return for such projects are exposed to the volatility of oil and gas prices and costs which may be substantially different from those estimated when the investment decision was made, thereby leading to lower return rates. Moreover, projects executed with partners and joint venture partners reduce the ability of the Company to manage risks and costs, and Eni could have limited influence over and control of the operations and performance of its partners. Furthermore, Eni may not have full operational control of the joint ventures in which it participates and may have exposure to counterparty credit risk and disruption of operations and strategic objectives due to the nature of its relationships.\n\nFinally, if the Company is unable to develop and operate major projects as planned, particularly if the Company fails to accomplish budgeted costs and time schedules, it could incur significant impairment losses of capitalised costs associated with reduced future cash flows of those projects.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nInability to replace oil and natural gas reserves could adversely impact results of operations and financial condition\n\nIn  case  the  Company's  exploration  efforts  are  unsuccessful  at replacing produced oil and natural gas, its reserves will decline. In addition to being a function of production, revisions and new discoveries, the Company's reserve replacement is also affected by the entitlement mechanism in its production sharing agreements ('PSAs'), whereby the Company is entitled to a portion of a field's reserves, the sale of which is intended to cover expenditures incurred by the Company to develop and operate the field. The higher the reference prices for Brent crude oil used to estimate Eni's proved reserves, the lower the number of barrels necessary to recover the same amount of expenditure, and vice versa. Based on the current portfolio of oil and gas assets, Eni's management estimates that production entitlements vary on average by approximately 330 barrels/d for each $1 change in oil prices based on current Eni's assumptions for oil prices. In 2020, production and year-end proved reserves benefitted from lower oil prices which translated into higher entitlements (approximately 12 kBOE/d of incremental production and 118 MBOE of reserves volumes). In case oil prices differ significantly from Eni's own forecasts, the result of the above-mentioned sensitivity of production to oil price changes may be significantly different.\n\nFuture oil and gas production is a function of the Company's ability to access new reserves through new discoveries, application of improved techniques, success in development activity, negotiations with national oil companies and other owners of known reserves and acquisitions.\n\nAn inability to replace produced reserves by discovering, acquiring and developing additional reserves could adversely impact future production levels and growth prospects. If Eni is unsuccessful in meeting its long-term targets of production growth and reserve replacement, Eni's future total proved reserves and production will decline.\n\nUncertainties in estimates of oil and natural gas reserves\n\nThe accuracy of proved reserve estimates and of projections of future rates of production and timing of development expenditures depends on a number of factors, assumptions and variables, including:\n\n- \uf0da the quality of available geological, technical and economic data and their interpretation and judgement;\n- \uf0da management's  assumptions  regarding  future  rates  of  production and costs and timing of operating and development expenditures. The projections of higher operating and development costs may impair the ability of the Company to economically produce reserves leading to downward reserve revisions;\n- \uf0da changes in the prevailing tax rules, other government regulations and contractual conditions;",

Lower oil prices may impair the ability of the Company to economically produce reserves leading to downward reserve revisions.\n\nMany of the factors, assumptions and variables underlying the estimation of proved reserves involve management's judgement or are outside management's control (prices, governmental  regulations)  and  may  change  over  time,  therefore affecting the estimates of oil and natural gas reserves from year-to-year.\n\nThe prices used in calculating Eni's estimated proved reserves are, in accordance with the SEC requirements, calculated by determining the unweighted arithmetic average of the first day-ofthe-month commodity prices for the preceding twelve months. For the 12-months ending at December 31, 2020, average prices were based on 41 $/BBL for the Brent crude oil, which was materially lower than the reference price of 63 $/BBL utilized in 2019 due to the effects of the pandemic-induced economic crisis on demand and prices of hydrocarbons. Also, the reference price of natural gas was markedly lower than in 2019. Those reductions resulted in Eni having to remove 124 MBOE of proved reserves because they have become uneconomical in this price environment.\n\nAccordingly, the estimated reserves reported as of the end of 2020 could be significantly different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that will be ultimately recovered. Any downward revision in Eni's estimated quantities of proved reserves would indicate lower future production volumes, which could adversely  impact  Eni's  business  prospects,  results  of  operations, cash flows and liquidity.\n\nAt the end of 2020 due to a combination of a slowdown in development expenditures because of the need to preserve the Group liquidity during the downturn and the removal of a significant amount of reserves that have become uneconomical in this environment, the Group reserves additions for the year of 271 MBOE fell significantly short of the volume produced of 634 MBOE, negatively affecting the replacement ratio of produced volumes and the total quantity of proved reserves at year-end compared to 2019 (down by 5%) which could negatively affect the Group's growth prospects going forward.\n\nThe development of the Group's proved undeveloped reserves may take longer and may require higher levels of capital expenditures than it currently anticipates or the Group's proved unde-\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n123\n\nveloped reserves may not ultimately be developed or produced At December 31, 2020, approximately 30% of the Group's total estimated proved reserves (by volume) were undeveloped and may not be ultimately developed or produced. Recovery of undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations. The Group's reserve estimates assume it can and will make these expenditures and conduct these operations successfully. These assumptions may not prove to be accurate and are subject to the risk of a structural decline in the prices of hydrocarbons due to possible long-lasting effects associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, including acceleration towards a low carbon economy and a shift in consumers' behaviour and preferences. In case of a continued decline in the prices of hydrocarbon the Group may not have enough financial resources to make the necessary expenditures to recover undeveloped reserves. The Group's reserve report  at  December  31,  2020  includes estimates of total future development and decommissioning costs associated with the Group's proved total reserves of approximately \u20ac27.7 billion (undiscounted, including consolidated subsidiaries and equity-accounted entities). It cannot be certain that estimated costs of the development of these reserves will prove correct, development will occur as scheduled, or the results of such development will be as estimated. In case of change in the Company's plans to develop those reserves, or if it is not otherwise able to successfully develop these reserves as a result of the Group's inability to fund necessary capital expenditures or otherwise, it will be required to remove the associated volumes from the Group's reported proved reserves.\n\nOil and gas activity may be subject to increasingly high levels of income taxes and royalties\n\nOil and gas operations are subject to the payment of royalties and income taxes, which tend to be higher than those payable in many other commercial activities. Furthermore, in recent years, Eni has experienced adverse changes in the tax regimes applicable to oil and gas operations in a number of Countries where the Company conducts its upstream operations. As a result of these trends, management estimates that the tax rate applicable to the Company's oil and gas operations is materially higher than the Italian statutory tax rate for corporate profit, which currently stands at 24%. Management believes that the marginal tax rate in the oil and gas industry tends to increase in correlation with higher oil prices, which could make it more difficult for Eni to translate higher oil prices into increased net profit. However, the Company does not expect that the marginal tax rate will decrease in response to falling oil prices. Adverse changes in the tax rate applicable to the Group's profit before income taxes in its oil and gas operations would have a negative impact on Eni's future results of operations and cash flows.",

In accordance with the SEC rules, Eni bases the estimated discounted future net revenues from proved reserves on the 12-month un-weighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month commodity prices for the preceding twelve months. Actual future prices may be materially higher or lower than the SEC pricing used in the calculations. Actual future net revenues from crude oil and natural gas properties will be affected by factors such as:\n\n- \uf0da the actual prices Eni receives for sales of crude oil and natural gas;\n- \uf0da the actual cost and timing of development and production expenditures;\n- \uf0da the timing and amount of actual production; and\n- \uf0da changes in governmental regulations or taxation.\n\nThe timing of both Eni's production and its incurrence of expenses in connection with the development and production of crude oil and natural gas properties will affect the timing and amount of actual future net revenues from proved reserves, and thus their actual present value. Additionally, the 10% discount factor Eni uses when calculating discounted future net revenues may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with Eni's reserves or the crude oil and natural gas industry in general. At December 31, 2020 the net present value of Eni's proved reserves totalled approximately \u20ac27.7 billion and was materially lower than at the end of 2019 because the average prices used to estimate Eni's proved reserves and the net present value at December 31, 2020, as calculated in accordance with the SEC rules, were 41 $/barrel for the Brent crude oil compared to 63 $/barrel utilized in 2019 due to the big fall recorded in hydrocarbons prices during the course of 2020 as a result of the demand contraction caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Actual future prices may materially differ from those used in our year-end estimates.\n\nOil  and  gas  activity  may  be  subject  to  increasingly  high  levels of regulations throughout the world, which may impact our extraction activities and the recoverability of reserves\n\nThe production of oil and natural gas is highly regulated and is subject to conditions imposed by governments throughout\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthe world in matters such as the award of exploration and production leases, the imposition of specific drilling and other work obligations, environmental protection measures, control over the development and abandonment of fields and installations, and restrictions on production. These risks can limit the Group's access to hydrocarbons reserves or may cause the Group to redesign, curtail or cease its Oil & Gas operations with significant effects on the Group's business prospects, results of operations and cash flow.\n\nIn Italy, the activities of hydrocarbon development and production are performed by oil companies in accordance to concessions  granted  by  the  Ministry  of  Economic  Development in agreement with the relevant Region territorially involved in the case of onshore concessions. Concessions are granted for an initial twenty-year term; the concessionaire is entitled to a ten-year extension and then to one or more five-year extensions to fully recover a field's reserves and investments on the condition that the concessionaire has fulfilled all obligations related to the work program agreed in the initial concession award. In case of delay in the award of an extension, the original concession remains fully effective until the administrative procedure to  grant  an  extension is finalized. These general rules are to be coordinated with a new law that was enacted in February 2019.  This  law  requires  certain  Italian  administrative  bodies to adopt by the end of 2021 a plan intended to identify areas that are suitable for carrying out exploration, development and production of hydrocarbons in the national territory, including the territorial seawaters. Until approval of such a plan, a moratorium on exploration activities, including the award of new exploration leases, is in effect. Following the plan approval, exploration permits will resume in areas that have been identified as suitable and new exploration permits can be awarded. However, in unsuitable areas, exploration permits will be repealed, applications for obtaining new exploration permits ongoing at the time of the law enactment will be rejected and no new permit applications can be filed. As far as development and production concessions are concerned, pending the national plan approval, ongoing concessions remain in effect and administrative procedures underway to grant extensions to expired concessions remain unaffected; however, no applications to obtain new concessions can be filed. Once the above mentioned national plan is adopted, development and production concessions that fall in suitable areas can be granted further extensions and applications for new concessions can be filed; however, development and production concessions in place as at the approval of the national plan that fall in unsuitable areas will be repealed at their expiration, no further extensions will be granted, and no new concession applications can be filed or awarded. According to the statute, areas that are suitable to the activities of exploring and developing hydrocarbons must conform to a number of criteria including morphological characteristics and social, urbanistic and industrial constraints,",

Development activities at the concession have continued since then in accordance with the 'prorogation regime' described above, within the limits of the work plan approved when the concession was first granted. The Company filed an application to obtain a ten-year extension of the concession in accordance to the terms set by the law and before the enactment of the new law on the national plan for hydrocarbons activity. In  this  application  the  Company  confirmed  the  same  work program as in the original concession award. Similarly, Company operations are underway in accordance to the ongoing prorogation regime at another 41 expired Italian concessions for  hydrocarbons  development  and  production.  The  Company has also filed requests for extensions within the terms of the law for those concessions.\n\nAs far as proven reserves estimates are concerned, management believes the criteria laid out in the new law to be high-level principles, which make it difficult to identify in a reliable and objective manner areas that might be suitable or unsuitable to hydrocarbons activities before the plan is adopted by Italian authorities. However, based on the review of all facts and circumstances and on the current knowledge of the matter, management does not expect any material impact on the Group's future performance.\n\nEni's future performance depends on its ability to identify and mitigate  the  above-mentioned  risks  and  hazards  which  are inherent to its Oil & Gas business. Failure to properly manage those risks,  the  Company's  underperformance at exploration, development and reserve replacement activities or the occurrence of unforeseen regulatory risks may adversely and materially impact the Group's results of operations, cash flow, liquidity,  business  prospects,  financial  condition,  and  shareholder returns, including dividends, the amount of funds available for stock repurchases and the price of Eni's shares.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, approximately 83% of Eni's proved hydrocarbon  reserves  were  located  in  non-OECD  Countries, mainly  in  Africa  and  central-south  East  Asia,  where  the  socio-political framework, the financial system and the macroeconomic outlook are less stable than in the OECD Countries. In those non-OECD Countries, Eni is exposed to a wide range of political risks and uncertainties, which may impair Eni's ability to continue operating economically on a temporary or perma-\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n125\n\nnent basis, and Eni's ability to access oil and gas reserves. Particularly, Eni faces risks in connection with the following potential issues and risks:\n\n- \uf0da socio-political instability leading to internal conflicts, revolutions,  establishment  of  non-democratic  regimes,  protests, attacks, strikes and other forms of civil disorder and unrest, such as strikes, riots, sabotage, acts of violence and similar events. These risks could result in disruptions to economic activity, loss of output, plant closures and shutdowns, project delays, loss of assets and threats to the security of personnel. They may disrupt financial and commercial markets, including the supply of and pricing for oil and natural gas, and generate greater political and economic instability in some of the geographical areas in which Eni operates. Additionally, any possible reprisals because of military or other action, such as acts of terrorism in Europe, the United States or elsewhere, could have a material adverse effect on the world economy and hence on the global demand for hydrocarbons;\n- \uf0da lack of well-established and reliable legal systems and uncertainties surrounding the enforcement of contractual rights;\n- \uf0da unfavourable  enforcement  of  laws,  regulations  and  contractual arrangements leading, for example, to expropriation, nationalisation or forced divestiture of assets and unilateral cancellation or modification of contractual terms;\n- \uf0da sovereign default or financial instability due to the fact that those  Countries  rely  heavily  on  petroleum  revenues  to  sustain  public  finance  and  petroleum revenues have dramatically contracted in 2020 due plunging hydrocarbons prices as a consequence of the global economic crisis caused by the  COVID-19  pandemic.  Financial  difficulties  at  Country level  often  translate  into  failure  by  state-owned  companies and agencies to fulfil their financial obligations towards Eni relating to funding capital commitments in projects operated by Eni or to timely paying for supplies of equity oil and gas volumes;\n- \uf0da restrictions on exploration, production, imports and exports;\n- \uf0da tax or royalty increases (including retroactive claims);\n- \uf0da difficulties in finding qualified international or local suppliers in critical operating environments; and\n- \uf0da complex processes of granting authorisations or licences affecting time-to-market of certain development projects.\n\nThe  financial  outlook  of  several,  non-OECD  Countries  where Eni is operating was significantly affected by the material contraction recorded in hydrocarbons revenues following the COVID-19 pandemic, which also increased the counterparty risk of a few state-owned or privately-held local companies that are Eni's partners in certain projects to develop Oil & Gas reserves.\n\nAreas where Eni operates and where the Company is particularly exposed to political risk include, but are not limited to Libya, Venezuela and Nigeria.",

The current situation of social and political instability dates back to the revolution of 2011 that brought a change of regime and a civil war, triggering an uninterrupted period of lack of well-established institutions and recurrent episodes of internal conflict, clashes, disorders and other forms of  civil  turmoil.  In  the  year  of  the  revolution,  Eni's  operations in Libya were materially affected by a full-scale war, which forced the Company to shut down its development and extractive activities for almost all of 2011, with a significant negative impact on the Group's results of operation and cash flow. In subsequent years Eni has experienced frequent disruptions to its operations, albeit on a smaller scale than in 2011, due to security threats to its installations and personnel. In April 2019, a resurgence of the socio-political instability and a failure by the opposed factions to establish a national government triggered the resumption of the civil war with armed clashes in the area of Tripoli and elsewhere in the Country. The situation continued to escalate also because international negotiations aimed at restoring a state of peace and stability proved elusive. At the beginning of 2020 oil export terminals in the eastern and southern parts of Libya were blocked, halting most of the Country's oil export terminals, and force majeure was declared at several Libyan production facilities. Production shutdowns also involved certain of the Company's profit centres (the El Feel oilfield and the Bu Attifel offshore platform). The Company repatriated its personnel and strengthened security measures at its plants and facilities still in operation. However, despite this difficult framework, the Company's largest assets in Libya - the Bahr Essalam offshore platform and the onshore Mellitah oil and gas production centre - have continued to produce regularly. Due to those developments, we estimated a loss of output in the range of 9 kBBL/d on average for the year 2020. In late September, the situation began to improve thanks to a temporary agreement between the conflicting factions, the blockade was lifted at the main ports for exporting crude oil and production resumed at the main fields, revoking force majeure.  Despite  this,  management  believes  that  Libya's  geopolitical situation will continue to represent a source of risk and uncertainty to Eni's operations in the Country and to the Group's results of operations and cash flow.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, Libya represented approximately 10% of  the  Group's  total  production;  this  percentage  is  forecasted to decrease in the medium term in line with the expected implementation of the Group's strategy intended to diversify the Group's geographical presence to better balance the geopolitical risk of the portfolio. In the event of major adverse events, such as the escalation of the internal conflict into a full-blown civil war, attacks, sabotage, social unrest, clashes and other forms of civil disorder, Eni could be forced to reduce or to shut down completely its production activities at its Libyan fields, which would significantly hit results of operations and cash flow.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nVenezuela  is  currently  experiencing  a  situation  of  financial stress, which has been exacerbated by the economic recession caused by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Lack of financial resources to support the development of the Country's hydrocarbons  reserves  has  negatively  affected  the  Country's production levels and hence fiscal revenues. The situation has been made worse by certain international sanctions targeting the  Country's  financial  system  and  its  ability  to  export  crude oil to U.S. markets, which is the main outlet of Venezuelan production (see also 'Sanctions targets' below).\n\nPresently, the Company retains only one valuable asset in Venezuela: the 50%-participated Card\u00f3n IV joint venture, which is operating a natural gas offshore project and is supplying its production to the national oil company, PDVSA, under a long-term supply agreement. We also hold an equity interest in other two oil projects: the PetroJunin oilfield and the Corocoro field, with respect to which in past years we have registered significant impairment losses and reserves de-bookings, with currently little value left to recover. The main risk to Eni's ability to recover its investment is the continued difficulty on the part of PDVSA to pay the receivables for the gas supplies of Card\u00f3n IV, resulting in a significant amount of overdue receivables. The joint-venture is systematically booking a loss provision on the revenues accrued. The expected credit loss was based on management's appreciation of the counterparty risk driven by the findings of a review of the past experience of sovereign defaults on which basis a deferral in the collection of the gas revenues was estimated. As of December 31, 2020, Eni's invested capital in Venezuela was approximately $1 billion. Despite the negative financial outlook of the Country and of PDVSA, during the course of 2020 the Company was able to collect a certain percentage of accrued revenues, in line with management's estimates of the expected credit losses. Eni expects the financial and political outlook of the Country to remain a risk factor to Eni's operations there for the foreseeable future.\n\nWe have significant credit exposure in Nigeria to state-owned and privately-held local companies, where the overall financial and economic outlook of the Country has been made worse by the contraction of petroleum revenues due to the crisis of the oil sector in 2020 caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our credit exposure is due to the fact that we are funding the share of capital expenditures pertaining to Nigerian joint operators at Eni-operated oil projects. We have incurred in the past and it is possible to continue incurring in the future significant credit losses because of the ongoing difficulties of our Nigerian counterparts to reimburse amounts past due.\n\nEni is closely monitoring political, social and economic risks of the Countries in which it has invested or intends to invest, in order to evaluate the economic and financial return of capital projects and to selectively evaluate projects.

Due to this decision, it is possible that in the future we may experience delays in moving our products and employees between the UK and EU.  Also, additional tariffs and taxes could impact the demand for some of our products and this, combined with the weak macroeconomic conditions in both the EU and UK due to the COVID-19 pandemic, could have a material adverse effect on energy demand.\n\n## Sanction targets\n\nThe most relevant sanction programs for Eni are those issued by the European Union and the United States of America and in particular, as of today, the restrictive measures adopted by such authorities in respect of Russia and Venezuela.\n\nIn response to the Russia-Ukraine crisis, the European Union and the United States have enacted sanctions targeting, inter alia, the financial and energy sectors in Russia by restricting the supply of certain oil and gas items and services to Russia and certain forms of financing. Eni has adapted its activities to the applicable sanctions and will further adapt its business to any subsequent restrictive measures that shall be adopted by the relevant authorities. In response to these restrictions, the Company has put on hold its projects in the upstream sectors in Russia and currently is not engaged in any Oil & Gas project in the Country. It is not possible to rule out the possibility that wider sanctions targeting the Russian energy, banking and/or finance industries may be implemented. Further sanctions imposed on Russia, Russian citizens or Russian companies by the international community, such as restrictions on purchases of Russian gas by European companies  or  measures  restricting  dealings  with  Russian counterparties, could adversely impact Eni's business, results of  operations and cash flow. Furthermore, an escalation of the international crisis, resulting in a tightening of sanctions, could entail a significant disruption of energy supply and trade flows globally, which could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, financial conditions, results of operations and prospects.\n\nStarting from 2017, the United States enacted a regime of economic and financial sanctions against Venezuela. The scope of the restrictions, initially targeting certain financial instruments issued or sold by the Government of Venezuela, was gradually expanded over 2017 and 2018 and then significantly broade-\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nned during the course of 2019 when Petroleos de Venezuela SA  ('PDVSA'),  the  main  national  state-owned  enterprise,  has been added to the 'Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List' and the Venezuelan governments and its controlled entities became subject to assets freeze in the United States. Even if such U.S. sanctions are substantially 'primary' and therefore dedicated in principle to U.S. persons only, retaliatory measures and other adverse consequences may also interest foreign entities which operate with Venezuelan listed entities and/or in the oil sector of the Country.\n\nThe U.S. sanction regime against Venezuela has been further tightened in the final part of 2020 by restricting any Venezuelan oil exports, including swap schemes utilized by foreign entities to recover trade and financing receivables from PDVSA and other Venezuelan counterparties. This latter tightening of the sanction regime could jeopardize our ability to collect the trade receivable owed to us for our activity in the Country.\n\nEni is carefully evaluating on a case by case basis the adoption of measures adequate to minimize its exposure to any sanctions risk which may affect its business operation. In any case, the U.S. sanctions add stress to the already complex financial, political and operating outlook of the country, which could further limit the ability of Eni to recover its investments in Venezuela.\n\n## RISKS SPECIFIC TO THE COMPANY'S GAS BUSINESS IN ITALY\n\nCurrent, negative trends in gas demands and supplies in Europe may impair the Company's ability to fulfil its minimum off-take obligations in connection with its take-or-pay, long-term gas supply contracts\n\nEni is currently party to a few long-term gas supply contracts with  state-owned  companies  of  key  producing  Countries, from where most of the gas supplies directed to Europe are sourced via pipeline (Russia, Algeria, Libya and Norway). These contracts which were intended to support Eni's sales plan in  Italy  and  in  other  European  markets,  provide  take-or-pay clauses whereby the Company has an obligation to lift minimum, pre-set volumes of gas in each year of the contractual term or, in case of failure, to pay the whole price, or a fraction of that price, up to a minimum contractual quantity. Similar considerations  apply  to  ship-or-pay  contractual  obligations which arise from contracts with pipeline owners, which the Company has entered into to secure long-term transport capacity. Long-term gas supply contracts with take-or-pay clauses expose the Company to a volume risk, as the Company is obligated to purchase an annual minimum volume of gas, or in case of failure, to pay the underlying price.

        "page_content": "of the Company's portfolio of gas supply contracts is a risk to  the  profitability  outlook  of  Eni's  wholesale  gas  business due to the current competitive dynamics in the European gas markets. In past downturns of the gas sector, the Company incurred significant cash outflows in response to its take-orpay obligations. Furthermore, the Company's wholesale business is exposed to volatile  spreads between the procurement costs of gas, which are linked to spot prices at European hubs or to the price of crude oil, and the selling prices of gas which are mainly indexed to spot prices at the Italian hub. A reduction of the spreads between Italian and European spot prices for gas could negatively affect the profitability of our business by reducing the total addressable market and by reducing the margin to cover the business's logistics costs and other fixed expenses.\n\nEni's  management  is  planning  to  continue  its  strategy  of  renegotiating the Company's long-term gas supply contracts in order to constantly align pricing terms to current market conditions as they evolve and to obtain greater operational flexibility to better manage the take-or-pay obligations (volumes and delivery points among others), considering the risk factors described above. The revision clauses included in these contracts state the right of each counterparty to renegotiate the economic terms and other contractual conditions periodically, in relation to ongoing changes in the gas scenario. Management believes that the outcome of those renegotiations is uncertain in respect of both the amount of the economic benefits that will be ultimately obtained and the timing of recognition of profit. Furthermore, in case Eni and the gas suppliers fail to agree on revised contractual terms, both parties can start an arbitration procedure to obtain revised contractual conditions. All these possible developments within the renegotiation process could increase the level of risks and uncertainties relating the outcome of those renegotiations.\n\n## Risks associated with the regulatory powers entrusted to the Italian Regulatory Authority for Energy, Networks and Environment in the matter of pricing to residential customers\n\nEni's wholesale gas and retail Gas & Power businesses are subject to regulatory risks mainly in our domestic market in Italy. The Italian Regulatory Authority for Energy, Networks and  Environment  (the  'Authority')  is  entrusted  with  certain powers in the matter of natural gas and power pricing. Specifically, the Authority retains a surveillance power on pricing in the natural gas market in Italy and the power to establish selling tariffs for the supply of natural gas to residential and commercial users until the market is fully opened. Developments in the regulatory framework intended to increase the level of market liquidity or of de-regulation or intended to reduce operators' ability to transfer to customers cost increases in raw materials may negatively affect future sales margins of gas and electricity, operating results and cash flow.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY REGULATIONS AND LEGAL RISKS\n\nEni has incurred in the past, and will continue incurring, material  operating  expenses  and  expenditures,  and  is  exposed  to business risk in relation to compliance with applicable environmental, health and safety regulations in future years, including compliance with any national or international regulation on GHG emissions\n\nEni is subject to numerous European Union, international, national, regional and local laws and regulations regarding the impact of its operations on the environment and on health and safety of employees, contractors, communities and on the value  of  properties.  We  believe  that  laws  and  regulations  intended to preserve the environment and to safeguard health and safety of workers and communities are particularly severe in our businesses due to their inherent nature because of flammability and toxicity of hydrocarbons and of industrial processes to develop, extract, refine and transport oil, gas and products. Generally, these laws and regulations require acquisition of a permit before drilling for hydrocarbons may commence, restrict the types, quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with exploration, drilling and production activities, including refinery and petrochemical plant operations, limit or prohibit drilling activities in certain protected areas, require to remove and dismantle drilling platforms and other equipment and well plug-in once oil and gas operations have terminated, provide for measures to be taken to protect the safety of the workplace and of plants and infrastructures, the health of employees, contractors and other Company collaborators and of communities involved by the Company's activities, and impose criminal or civil liabilities for polluting the environment or harming employees' or communities' health and safety as result from the Group's operations. These laws and regulations control the emission of scrap substances and pollutants, discipline the handling of hazardous materials and set limits to or prohibit the discharge of soil, water or groundwater contaminants, emissions of toxic gases and other air pollutants or can impose taxes on polluting air emissions, as in the case of the European Trading Scheme that requires the payment of a tax for each tonne of carbon dioxide emitted in the environment above a pre-set allowance, resulting from the operation of oil and natural gas extraction and processing  plants,  petrochemical  plants,  refineries,  service  stations, vessels, oil carriers, pipeline systems and other facilities owned or operated by Eni. In addition, Eni's operations are subject to laws and regulations relating to the production, handling, transportation, storage, disposal and treatment of waste.

Furthermore, in the case of violation of certain rules regarding the safeguard of the environment and the health of employees,  contractors  and  other  collaborators  of  the  Company, and of communities, the Company may incur liabilities in connection with the negligent or wilful violation of laws by its employees as per Italian Law Decree No. 231/2001.\n\nEnvironmental, health and safety laws and regulations have a substantial impact on Eni's operations. Management expects that the Group will continue to incur significant amounts of operating expenses and expenditures in the foreseeable future to comply with laws and regulations and to safeguard the environment and the health and safety of employees, contractors and communities involved by the Company operations, including:\n\n- \uf0da costs to prevent, control, eliminate or reduce certain types of air and water emissions and handle waste and other hazardous materials, including the costs incurred in connection with government action to address climate change (see the specific section below on climate-related risks);\n- \uf0da remedial  and  clean-up  measures  related  to  environmental contamination or accidents at various sites, including those owned by third parties (see discussion below);\n- \uf0da damage compensation claimed by individuals and entities, including local, regional or state administrations, should Eni cause any kind of accident, oil spill, well blowouts, pollution, contamination, emission of GHG and other air pollutants above permitted levels or of any other hazardous gases, water, ground or air contaminants or pollutants, as a result of its operations or if the Company is found guilty of violating environmental laws and regulations; and\n- \uf0da costs in connection with the decommissioning and removal of drilling platforms and other facilities, and well plugging at the end of Oil & Gas field production.\n\nAs a further consequence of any new laws and regulations or other factors, like the actual or alleged occurrence of environmental damage at Eni's plants and facilities, the Company may be forced to curtail, modify or cease certain operations or implement temporary shutdowns of facilities. For example, in Italy Eni has experienced in recent years a number of temporary plant shutdowns at our Val d'Agri oil treatment centre due to environmental issues and oil spillovers, causing loss of output and of revenues. The Italian judicial authorities have started legal proceedings to verify alleged environmental crimes or crimes against the public safety and other criminal allegations as described in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nIf any of the risks set out above materialise, they could adversely impact the Group's results of operations, cash flow, liquidity,  business  prospects,  financial  condition,  and  shareholder\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n129\n\nreturns, including dividends, the amount of funds available for stock repurchases and the price of Eni's shares.\n\n## CLIMATE-RELATED RISKS\n\nThe civil society and the national governments adhering to the 2015 COP 21 Paris Agreement are stepping up efforts to reduce the risks of climate change and to support an ongoing transition to a low carbon economy, which will likely lead to the adoption of national and international laws and regulations intended to curb carbon emissions, as well as to the implementation of fiscal measures which could possibly drive technological breakthrough in the use of hydrogen, exponential growth in the development of renewables energies and fast-growing adoption of electric vehicles, thus reducing the world's economy reliance on fossil fuels. These trends could materially affect demand for hydrocarbons in  the  long-term,  while  we  expect  increased  compliance  costs for the Company in the short-term. Eni is also exposed to risks of unpredictable extreme meteorological events linked to climate change. All these developments may adversely and materially affect the Group's profitability, businesses outlook and reputation\n\nThe civil society and the national governments adhering to the 2015 COP 21 Paris Agreement, with the EU playing a leading role, are advancing plans and initiatives intended to transition the economy towards a low carbon model in the long run, as the scientific community has been sounding alarms over the potential, catastrophic consequences for human life on the planet in connection with risks of climate change, based on the scientific relationship between global warming and increasing GHG concentration  in  the  atmosphere,  mainly  as  a  result  of burning fossil fuels. This push, as well as increasingly stricter regulations in this area, could adversely and materially affect the Group's business.\n\nThose risks may emerge in the short and medium-term, as well as over the long term.\n\nEni expects that the achievement of the Paris Agreement goal of  limiting  the  rise  in  temperature  to  well  below  2\u00b0  C  above pre-industrial  levels,  or  the  more  stringent  goal  advocated  by the  Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate  Change  (IPCC)  of  limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0 C, will strengthen the global response to the issue of climate change and spur governments to introduce measures and policies targeting the reduction of GHG emissions, which are expected to bring about a gradual reduction in the use of fossil fuels over the medium to longterm, notably through the diversification of the energy mix, likely reducing local demand for fossil fuels and negatively affecting global demand for oil and natural gas.\n\nRecently, governmental institutions have responded to the issue of climate change on two fronts: on the one side, governmen-",

This trend has been progressively gaining traction with an increasing number of governments adopting national agendas and strategies intended to reach the goals of the Paris Agreement and formally pledging to obtain net-zero emissions by 2050, like the  EU's Green Deal, which may lead to the enactment of various measure to constrain, limit or prohibit altogether the use of fossil fuels. This trend could increase both in breadth and severity if more governments follow suit.\n\nThe dramatic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic on economic activity  and  people's  lifestyle  could  possibly  result  in  a  breakthrough in the evolution towards a low carbon model of development. The unprecedented contraction in economic activity caused by the lockdown measures adopted throughout the world to contain the spread of the virus, which resulted in the suppression of demand for hydrocarbons, could have an enduring impact on the future role of hydrocarbons in satisfying global energy needs. This is because many governments and the EU have deployed massive amounts of resources to help rebuild entire economies and industrial sectors hit by the pandemic-induced crisis and a large part of this economic stimulus has been or is planned to be directed to help transitioning the economy and the energy mix towards a low carbon model, as in the case of the EU's recovery fund, which provides for huge investments in the sector of renewable energies and the green economy, including large-scale adoption of hydrogen as a new energy source. At the same time, the auto industry is ramping up production of electric vehicles (EVs) and boosting the EVs line-up, while large amounts of risk capital and financing is propelling the growth of an entire new industry of pure-EV players. The growing role of EVs in transportation is leveraging on state subsidies to incentivize the purchase of EVs and growing interest among consumers towards EVs. Other potentially disruptive technologies designated to produce energy without fossil fuels and to replace the combustion engine in the transport sector are emerging, driven by the development of hydrogen-based innovations. These trends could disrupt demand for hydrocarbons in the not so distant future, with many forecasters, both within the industry, or state agencies and independent observers predicting peak oil demand sometimes in the next ten years or earlier; some operators still consider 2019 as the peak year for oil demand. A large portion of Eni's business depends on the global demand for oil and natural gas. If existing or future laws, regulations, treaties, or international agreements related to GHG and climate change, including state incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources, technological breakthrough in the field of renewable energies or mass-adop-\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ntion of electric vehicles trigger a structural decline in worldwide demand for oil and natural gas, our results of operations and business prospects may be materially and adversely affected.\n\nWe expect our operating and compliance expenses to increase in the short-term due to the likely growing adoption of carbon tax mechanisms. Some governments have already introduced carbon pricing schemes, which can be an effective measure to reduce GHG emissions at the lowest overall cost to society. Today, about half of the direct GHG emissions coming from Eni's operated assets are included in national or supranational Carbon Pricing Mechanisms, such as the European Emission Trading Scheme (ETS), as a result of which the Company incurs operating expenses. For example, under the European ETS, Eni is obligated to purchase, on the open markets, emission allowances in case its GHG emissions exceed a pre-set amount of free emission allowances. In 2020 to comply with this carbon emissions scheme, Eni purchased on the open market allowances corresponding to 10.5 million tonnes of CO 2 emissions. Due to the likelihood of new regulations in this area and expectations of a reduction in free allowances under the European ETS and of the adoption of similar schemes by a rising number of governments, Eni is aware of the risk that a growing share of the Group's GHG emissions could be subject to carbon-pricing and other forms of climate regulation in the not so distant future, leading to additional compliance obligations with respect to the release, capture, and use of carbon dioxide that could result in increased investments and higher project costs for Eni. Eni also expects that governments will require companies to apply technical measures to reduce their GHG emissions.\n\nOur portfolio of oil and gas properties features a large weight of natural gas, the least GHG-emitting fossil energy source, which represented approximately 48% of Eni's production in 2020 on an available-for-sale basis; as of December 31, 2020, gas reserves represented approximately 49% of Eni's total proved reserves of its subsidiary undertakings and joint ventures. The other pillar of our resilient portfolio of Oil & Gas properties is the high incidence of conventional projects, developed through phases and with low CO 2 intensity. We estimate that Oil & Gas projects under execution, which will drive the expected production increase in the next four-year period and attract a large part of the projected development expenditures in the same period, have a price breakeven of around 23 $/bbl. We believe that those characteristics  of  our  portfolio  coupled  with  a  relatively  low  payback period will mitigate the risk of stranded reserves going forward,  should  risks  of  structurally  declining  hydrocarbons demands materialize because of stricter global environmental constraints and regulations and changing consumers' preferences resulting in trends like the mass adoption of electric vehicles or a lower weight of hydrocarbons in the energy mix.",

        "page_content": "Eni's  portfolio  exposure  to  those  risks  is  reviewed  annually against  changing  GHG  regulatory  regimes,  evolving  consumers' habits, technological developments and physical conditions to identify emerging risks. To test the resilience of new capital projects, Eni assesses potential costs associated with GHG emissions and their impact on projects' returns. New projects'  internal  rates  of  return  are  stress-tested  against two sets of assumptions: i) Eni's management estimation of a  cost  per  ton  of  carbon  dioxide  (CO 2 ),  which  is  applied  to the total GHG emissions of each capital project along its life cycle, while retaining the management scenario for hydrocarbons prices; and ii) the hydrocarbon prices and cost of CO 2 emissions adopted in the International Energy Agency (IEA) Sustainable  Development  Scenario  'IEA  SDS'  WEO  2020. This stress test is performed on a regular basis to monitor progress and risks associated with each project. The review performed at the end of 2020 indicated that the internal rates of return of Eni's ongoing projects in aggregate should not be substantially affected by a carbon pricing mechanism, also under the assumption that the costs for emission allowances are not recoverable in the cost oil or are not deductible from profit before taxes. This observation holds true also under the more severe CO 2 pricing assumptions of the IEA SDS scenario. The development process and internal authorization procedures of each E&P capital project feature several checks that may require additional and well detailed GHG and energy management plans to address potential risks of underperformance in relation to possible scenarios of global or regional adoption of regulations introducing mechanisms of carbon cap and trade or carbon pricing. These processes and internal authorization hurdles can lead to projects being stopped, designs being changed, and potential GHG mitigation investments being identified, in preparation for when the economic conditions imposed by new regulations would make these investments commercially compelling.\n\nFurthermore,  management  performed  a  sensitivity  analysis of  the  recoverability  of  the  book  values  of  the  Company's  Oil & Gas assets under the assumptions set forth in the IEA SDS WEO 2020 to evaluate the reasonableness of the outcome of impairment review of those assets under the base case management scenario as well as possible risks of stranded assets. This stress test covered all the Oil & Gas cash generating unit (CGUs) that are regularly tested for impairment in accordance to IAS 36. The IEA SDS sets out an energy pathway consistent with the goal of achieving universal energy access by 2030 and of  reducing energy-related CO 2 emissions and air pollution in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement which endorse effective action to combat climate change by holding the rise in global average temperature to well below 2\u00b0C with respect to the baseline before the Industrial Revolution and to pursuing efforts to limit it to 1.5\u00b0C.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe hydrocarbons pricing assumptions of the IEA SDS scenario are substantially aligned to the ones adopted by Eni in its base case impairment review made in accordance with IAS 36. CO 2 emissions costs under the IEA SDS show a strong uptrend consistent with the goal of encouraging the adoption of low carbon technologies. The IEA SDS projects CO 2 emissions costs in advanced economies to reach 140 $ per ton in real terms 2019 by 2040, which is higher than Eni's CO 2 pricing trends and assumptions for the medium-long term. The sensitivity test performed at Eni's Oil & Gas CGUs under the IEA SDS assumptions and applying the CO 2 cost estimated by the IEA for advanced economies to all of our oil and gas assets validated the resiliency of Eni's asset portfolio, determining a reduction of 11% in the total value-in-use of all of Eni's Oil & Gas CGUs compared to the result of the impairment review performed by the Company in the preparation of its 2020 financial statements using the management's base case scenario. That reduction falls to a 5% decline assuming the recoverability of CO 2 costs in the cost oil or the deductibility from the taxable income.\n\nFinally, management considered the following trends in the sector: the increased volatility of crude oil prices which have been increasingly exposed to macro and global risks; the continued oversupply in the oil markets which has determined a reset in hydrocarbons realized prices and cash flows of oil companies; growing uncertainty about long-term evolution of global oil demand in light of the rising commitment on the part of the international community at addressing climate change and speeding up the pace of the energy transition, the increase in energy alternatives to fossil fuels and changing consumer preferences, management has evaluated the recoverability of the book values of Eni's Oil & Gas properties under different stress-test scenarios, including the risk of stranded assets. Particularly, under the more conservative set of the assumptions which envisages a flat long-term Brent price of 50 $/bbl and at a flat Italian gas price of 5 $/mmBTU, management is estimating that approximately 81% of the volumes of the Company's proven and unproven reserves (latter being properly risked) will be produced within 2035 and 93% of their net present value will be realized. The net present value of those production volumes, valued at the most conservative of the scenarios evaluated, is substantially aligned with the book values of the net fixed assets of Eni's Oil & Gas properties, including Eni's share of the fixed assets of our joint ventures like V\u00e5r Energi AS, and including in the calculation the expected cash outflows committed to the Company's forestry projects.\n\nIn  October  2018  the  Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate Change (IPCC) stated that to reduce risks of irreversible changes to the ecosystem the world economy needs to limit the increase in global temperatures to 1.5\u00b0C. To meet this challenge, the world economy would need to undertake in the next",

Recognizing the IPCC position, the IEA has elaborated in its WEO 2020 a new detailed modelling called the Net Zero Emissions 2050 case (NZE2050) to examine what more would be needed compared to the SDS in next decade to put global CO 2 emissions on a pathway to net zero by 2050. The set of actions contemplated by the IEA NZE2050 case comprise a dramatic increase in investments in low-emission electricity, infrastructure and innovation as well as demanding behavioral changes on part of the consumers. Currently, this  scenario  like  the  one  outlined  by  the  IPCC  have  yet  to be complemented by a full set of pricing and other operating assumptions, which once available will be analyzed by the Company for the purpose of updating stress-testing models and methodologies.\n\nThe scientific  community  has  concluded  that  increasing  global average temperature produces significant physical effects, such as the increased frequency and severity of hurricanes, storms, droughts, floods or other extreme climatic events that could interfere with Eni's operations and damage Eni's facilities. Extreme and unpredictable weather phenomena can result in material  disruption  to  Eni's  operations,  and  consequent  loss of or damage to properties and facilities, as well as a loss of output, loss of revenues, increasing maintenance and repair expenses and cash flow shortfall.\n\nFinally, there is a reputational risk linked to the fact that oil companies  are  increasingly  perceived  by  institutions  and the general public as entities primarily responsible for global warming due to GHG emissions across the hydrocarbons value-chain, particularly related with the use of energy products. This could possibly make Eni's shares less attractive to investment funds and individual investors who have been more and  more  assessing  the  risk  profile  of  companies  against their carbon footprint when making investment decisions. Furthermore, a growing number of financing institutions, including insurance companies, appear to be considering limiting their exposure to fossil fuel projects, as witnessed by a pledge from the World Bank to stop financing upstream oil and gas projects and a proposal from the EU finance minister to reduce the financing granted to Oil & Gas projects via the European Investment Bank (EIB). This trend could have a material adverse effect on the price of our securities and our ability to access equity or other capital markets. Accordingly, our ability to obtain financing for future projects or to obtain it at competitive rates may be adversely impacted. Further, in  some  Countries,  governments  and  regulators  have  filed lawsuits seeking to hold fossil fuel companies, including Eni, liable for costs associated with climate change. Losing any of these lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs a result of these trends, climate-related risks could have a material and adverse effect the Group's results of operations, cash flow, liquidity, business prospects, financial condition, and shareholder returns, including dividends, the amount of funds available for stock repurchases and the price of Eni's shares.\n\n## Eni is exposed to the risk of material environmental liabilities in addition to the provisions already accrued in the consolidated financial statement\n\nEni has incurred in the past and may incur in the future material environmental liabilities in connection with the environmental impact of its past and present industrial activities. Eni is also exposed to claims under environmental requirements and, from time to time, such claims have been made against us. Furthermore, environmental regulations in Italy and elsewhere typically impose strict liability. Strict liability means that in some situations Eni could be exposed to liability for clean-up and remediation costs, environmental damage, and other damages as a result of Eni's conduct of operations that was lawful at the time it occurred or of the conduct of prior operators or other third parties. In addition, plaintiffs may seek to obtain compensation for damage resulting from events of contamination and pollution or in case the Company is found liable of violations of any environmental laws or regulations. In Italy, Eni is exposed to the risk of expenses and environmental liabilities in connection with the impact of its past activities at certain industrial hubs where the Group's products were produced, processed, stored, distributed or sold, such as chemical plants, mineral-metallurgic plants, refineries and other facilities, which were subsequently disposed of, liquidated, closed or shut down. At these industrial hubs, Eni has undertaken several initiatives to remediate and to clean-up proprietary or concession areas that were allegedly contaminated and polluted by the Group's industrial activities. State or local public administrations have sued Eni for environmental and other damages and for clean-up and remediation measures in addition to those which were performed by the Company, or which the Company has committed to perform. In some cases, Eni has been sued for alleged breach of criminal laws (for example for alleged environmental crimes such as failure to perform soil or groundwater reclamation, environmental disaster and contamination, discharge of toxic materials, amongst others). Although Eni believes that it may not be held liable for having exceeded in the past pollution thresholds that are unlawful according to current regulations but were allowed by laws then effective, or because the Group took over operations from third parties, it cannot be excluded that Eni could potentially  incur  such  environmental  liabilities.  Eni's  financial statements account for provisions relating to the costs to be incurred with respect to clean-ups and remediation of contaminated areas and groundwater for which a legal or constructive obligations exist and the associated costs can be reasonably estimated in a reliable manner, regardless of any previous liability attributable to other parties.

Management believes that it is possible that in the future Eni may incur significant or material environmental expenses and liabilities in addition to the amounts already accrued due to:  (i)  the  likelihood  of  as  yet  unknown  contamination; (ii) the results of ongoing surveys or surveys to be carried out on the environmental status of certain Eni's industrial sites as required by the applicable regulations on contaminated sites; (iii) unfavourable developments in ongoing litigation on the environmental status of certain of the Company's sites where a number of public administrations, the Italian Ministry of the Environment or third parties are claiming compensation for environmental or other damages such as damages to people's health and loss of  property  value;  (iv)  the  possibility  that  new  litigation  might arise;  (v)  the  probability  that  new  and  stricter  environmental laws might be implemented; and (vi) the circumstance that the extent and cost of environmental restoration and remediation programs are  often  inherently  difficult  to  estimate  leading  to underestimation of the future costs of remediation and restoration, as well as unforeseen adverse developments both in the final remediation costs and with respect to the final liability allocation among the various parties involved at the sites.

In future years Eni may incur significant  losses  due  to:  (i)  uncertainty  regarding  the  final outcome of each proceeding; (ii) the occurrence of new developments that management could not take into consideration when evaluating the likely outcome of each proceeding in order to accrue the risk provisions as of the date of the latest financial statements or to judge a negative outcome only as possible or to conclude that a contingency loss could not be estimated reliably;  (iii)  the  emergence  of  new  evidence  and  information; and (iv) underestimation of probable future losses due to circumstances that are often inherently difficult to estimate. Certain legal proceedings and investigations in which Eni or its subsidiaries or its officers and employees are defendants involve the alleged breach of anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws and regulations and other ethical misconduct. Such proceedings are described in the notes to the condensed consolidated interim financial  statements,  under  the  heading  'Legal  Proceedings'. Ethical misconduct and noncompliance with applicable laws and  regulations,  including  noncompliance  with  anti-bribery\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n133\n\nand anti-corruption laws, by Eni, its officers and employees, its partners, agents or others that act on the Group's behalf, could expose Eni and its employees to criminal and civil penalties and could be damaging to Eni's reputation and shareholder value.\n\n## INTERNAL CONTROL RISKS\n\n## Risks from acquisitions\n\nEni is constantly monitoring the oil and gas market in search of opportunities to acquire individual assets or companies with a view of achieving its growth targets or complementing its asset portfolio. Acquisitions entail an execution risk - the risk that the acquirer will not be able to effectively integrate the purchased assets so as to achieve expected synergies. In addition, acquisitions entail a financial risk - the risk of not being able to recover the purchase costs of acquired assets, in case a prolonged decline in the market prices of oil and natural gas occurs. Eni may also incur unanticipated costs or assume unexpected liabilities and losses in connection with companies or assets it acquires. If the integration and financial risks related to acquisitions materialise, expected synergies from acquisition may fall short of management's targets and Eni's financial performance and shareholders' returns may be adversely affected.\n\n## Eni's crisis management systems may be ineffective\n\nEni has developed contingency plans to continue or recover operations following a disruption or incident. An inability to restore or replace critical capacity to an agreed level within an agreed period could prolong the impact of any disruption and could severely affect business, operations and financial results. Eni has crisis management plans and the capability to deal with emergencies at every level of its operations. If Eni does not respond or is not seen to respond in an appropriate manner to either an external or internal crisis, this could adversely impact the Group's results of operations, cash flow, liquidity, business prospects,  financial  condition,  and  shareholder  returns,  including dividends, the amount of funds available for stock repurchases and the price of Eni's shares.\n\n## Disruption to or breaches of Eni's critical IT services or digital infrastructure and security systems could adversely affect the Group's business, increase costs and damage our reputation\n\nThe Group's activities depend heavily on the reliability and security of its information technology (IT) systems and digital security. The Group's IT systems, some of which are managed by third parties, are susceptible to being compromised, damaged, disrupted or shutdown due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components, power or network outages, hardware failures, cyber-attacks  (viruses,  computer  intrusions),  user  errors  or natural  disasters.  The  cyber  threat  is  constantly  evolving. The oil and gas industry is subject to fast-evolving risks from cyber threat actors, including nation states, criminals, terro-",

Attacks are becoming more sophisticated with regularly renewed techniques while the digital transformation amplifies exposure to these cyber threats. The adoption of new technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT) or the migration to the cloud, as well as the evolution of architectures for increasingly interconnected systems, are all areas where cyber security is a very important issue. The Group and its service providers may not be able to prevent third parties from breaking into the Group's IT systems, disrupting business operations or communications infrastructure  through  denial-of-service  attacks,  or  gaining access to confidential or sensitive information held in the system. The Group, like many companies, has been and expects to continue to be the target of attempted cybersecurity attacks. While the Group has not experienced any such attack that has had a material impact on its business, the Group cannot guarantee that its security measures will be sufficient to prevent a material disruption, breach or compromise in the future. As a result, the Group's activities and assets could sustain serious damage, services to clients could be interrupted, material intellectual property could be divulged and, in some cases, personal injury, property damage, environmental harm and regulatory violations could occur.\n\nIf any of the risks set out above materialise, they could adversely impact the Group's results of operations, cash flow, liquidity,  business  prospects,  financial  condition,  and  shareholder\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nreturns, including dividends, the amount of funds available for stock repurchases and the price of Eni's share.\n\n## Violations of data protection laws carry fines and expose us and/or our employees to criminal sanctions and civil suits\n\nData protection laws and regulations apply to Eni and its joint ventures and associates in the vast majority of Countries in which we do business. The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect in May 2018 and increased penalties up to a maximum of 4% of global annual turnover for breach of the regulation. The GDPR requires mandatory breach notification, a standard also followed outside of the EU (particularly in Asia). Non-compliance with data protection laws could expose us to regulatory investigations, which could result in fines and penalties as well as harm our reputation. In addition to imposing fines, regulators may also issue orders to stop processing personal data, which could disrupt operations. We could also be subject to litigation from persons or corporations allegedly affected by data protection violations. Violation of data protection laws is a criminal offence in some Countries, and individuals can be imprisoned or fined.\n\nIf any of the risks set out above materialise, they could adversely impact the Group's results of operations, cash flow, liquidity,  business  prospects,  financial  condition,  and  shareholder returns, including dividends, the amount of funds available for stock repurchases and the price of Eni's shares.",

In continuity with previous editions, the document is structured according to  the  three  levers  of  the  integrated  business  model,  Carbon Neutrality by 2050, Operational Excellence and Alliances for development, whose objective is the creation of long-term value for all stakeholders. The contents of the 'Carbon Neutrality by 2050' chapter have been organized according to the voluntary  recommendations  of  the  Task  Force  on  Climate-related Financial  Disclosures  (TCFD)  of  the  Financial  Stability  Board, of which Eni has been a member since its foundation, in order to provide even clearer and more in-depth disclosure on these issues. In addition, the main United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), that constitute an important reference for Eni in the conduct of its activities, have been mentioned in the various chapters.\n\nThe NFI is included in the Management Report in the Annual Report, to meet the information needs of Eni stakeholders in a clear and concise manner, further favouring the integrated disclosure of financial and non-financial information. In order to avoid duplication of information and ensure that disclosures are as concise as possible, the NFI provides integrated disclosures, which may include references to other sections of  the  Management  Report,  the  Corporate  Governance  and Shareholding Structure Report and the Report on remuneration policy and remuneration paid, when the issues required by Legislative Decree 254/2016 are already contained therein or for further details. Specifically, the Management Report describes the Eni business model and governance, the integrated risk management system and the risk and uncertainty factors in which the main risks, possible impacts and treatment actions are detailed, in line with the disclosure requirements\n\nof Italian regulations. Integration and conciseness are also some of the distinctive elements that allowed Eni to win the 2020 edition of the special award \"Oscar\" for the Non Financial Information promoted by FERPI - Federazione Relazioni Pubbliche Italiana (Italian Public Relations Federation) - in collaboration with Borsa Italiana and Bocconi University. The NFI contains detailed information on corporate policies, management and organizational models, an in-depth analysis of ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) risks, the strategy on the topics covered, the most important initiatives of the year, the main performances with related comments and the 2020 materiality analysis. In the 2020 NFI, the 'core' metrics defined by the World Economic Forum 2 (WEF) in its September 2020 White Paper 'Measuring Stakeholder Capitalism - Towards Common Metrics and Consistent Reporting of Sustainable Value Creation' were included for the first time. Eni announced its support for the initiative, which aims to define common metrics for long-term value creation and to further promote the convergence of ESG standards and principles.\n\nAs  in  previous  years,  on  the  occasion  of  the  Shareholders' Meeting, Eni will also publish Eni for, the voluntary sustainability report that aims to further enhance non-financial information. The 2020 edition of Eni for will also include the annex 'Carbon Neutrality by 2050', and a report dedicated to human rights (Eni for - Human Rights) 3 . On the occasion of the Shareholders' Meeting, Eni will publish a reconciliation table with the Exploration & Production standards of the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB).\n\nBelow is a reconciliation table showing the information content required by the Decree, the areas and relative positioning in  the  NFI,  the  Management  Report,  the  Corporate  Governance and Shareholding Structure Report and the Report on remuneration policy and remuneration paid.\n\n- (1) For further details, reference is made to the paragraph: 'Reporting principles and criteria'.\n- (3) The Eni for Human Rights report will be published subsequent to Eni for by June 2021.\n- (2) The reconciliation with the WEF core metrics is directly shown in the Content Index in a dedicated column, see pp. 175-178.",

        "page_content": "## The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nIn a year in which the world was turned upside down by the health emergency linked to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, Eni intervened on several fronts to manage the consequences by exploiting its expertise gained in a complex sector such as energy, in order to protect the health of its employees and contractors. Eni has also worked in synergy with governments, institutions and local and international NGOs with the aim of preventing and countering the spread of the pandemic and minimizing its impact on local communities, both in Italy and abroad.\n\nEmergency management of the pandemic - Despite the scope and speed with which the COVID-19 pandemic spread throughout the world, Eni intervened promptly, also by virtue of the experience gained managing past epidemics such as Sars-Cov-1 and Ebola, and thanks to the regulatory, organizational and operational tools it had already adopted in 2011 to be prepared for the management of epidemic and pandemic events, implementing its  own  risk  management  model  for  Health,  Safety, Environment, Security and Public Health and Safety. Since January 2020, there has been a constant flow of communication with the subsidiaries, both in Italy and abroad, with the aim of monitoring the evolution of the emergency and implementing the necessary preventive measures defined by the Company's regulatory instruments and in accordance with the provisions of national and international health authorities. Eni has therefore updated the epidemic and pandemic response plan within its medical emergency procedure.\n\nIn particular, Eni, through its Board of Directors, has defined the strategic and coordination guidelines also through the establishment of the Crisis Unit formed by all the competent central functions of Eni with the role of monitoring the regulations in force and, in application of this, taking into account the progress of the pandemic, to indicate the strategic guidelines for the transversal management of the health emergency, defining technical and organizational measures to be implement-\n\n## Company mission\n\nThe Eni mission - approved by the Board of Directors in September 2019 - shows the path that the Company has taken to face the main challenge of the energy sector: ensuring access to efficient and sustainable energy for all, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions, in order to counter climate change in line with the objectives of the Paris Agreement.\n\nDespite  the  complex  context  due  to  the  health  emergency, Eni has decided to accelerate its transformation path by committing to achieve total decarbonization of all products and processes by 2050 (for more details see the chapter Strategy pp. 20-25 and the chapter Carbon Neutrality by 2050 pp. 144-150). The mission, which is inspired by the 17 SDGs to the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ned for the containment of the spread of the infection in the workplace. On the basis of the indications of the Crisis Unit, each employer has put in place the appropriate measures and operational actions with respect to its own production unit, taking into account the specificities of the work environments, for the counter and containment of the spread of the virus, mainly with regard to: (i) communication, information and training; (ii)  hygiene and prevention; (iii) management and use of PPE (Personal Protective Equipment); (iv) sanitization of work environments; (v) reorganization of work arrangements and agile work;  (vi)  access  to  workplaces  and  aggregation  areas;  (vii) management of suspected and confirmed cases; (viii) health surveillance and protection of fragile workers; (ix) maintenance of essential services and business continuity plan.\n\nIn March 2020, all employees with duties that do not require physical presence in the workplace began to perform their professional activities remotely. Over a few days, Eni ensured that 99% of office personnel and, overall, about 87% of total non-shift personnel (almost 14,400 employees) were able to continue their activities through smart working, guaranteeing the maintenance of the IT infrastructure (for further details see Internal control risks, p. 134) and providing about 3,000 PCs, Hot Spots and monitors. At the same time, the return from foreign offices of approximately 500 expatriate colleagues was organized, ensuring the necessary logistical measures, including  dedicated  flights.  Additional  and  complementary  actions have been activated in support of health institutions and important initiatives have been put in place in favour of Eni's people (for more information see the sections on People and Health, pp. 151155) and in support of Community Health in line with the needs gathered and the evolution of national and territorial health plans (see the section on Alliances for promotion of local development, pp. 168-169). Finally, for more information on the impact of the pandemic on Eni operating performance, see pp. 89-91.\n\nachievement of which Eni intends to contribute by seizing new business opportunities, confirms the commitment of Eni to a just energy transition. This is possible thanks to Eni's people, the passion and drive towards continuous innovation, respect and promotion of human rights, considering diversity as a resource, integrity in business management and environmental protection. In addition, it must be considered that achieving the SDGs requires unprecedented collaboration between the public and private sectors, as announced at the 2015 Addis Ababa international conference on financing for development. Hence, the commitment of Eni in defining and building cooperations with locally rooted, internationally recognized partners.",

The Policies cut across all processes and are focused on a key element of business management; they apply to Eni SpA and, following the implementation process, to all subsidiaries;\n- \uf0da The Management System Guidelines ('MSGs') are the guidelines common to all Eni's companies and may be process or compliance/governance  guidelines  (the  latter  normally  approved by the Board of Directors) and include sustainability aspects. The individual MSGs issued by Eni SpA apply to subsidiaries, which ensure their implementation, unless a derogation is needed;\n- \uf0da The Procedures set out the operating procedures by which the companies'  activities  are  to  be  carried  out.  They  describe  the tasks  and responsibilities of the organizational contacts involved, management and control methods and communication flows.\n\nThey  also  regulate  operations  in  order  to  pursue  the objectives of compliance with local regulations. The content is  defined  in  compliance  with  the  Policies  and  MSGs  as implemented by the companies;\n\n- \uf0da The Operating Instruction define the details of the operating procedures  referring  to  a  specific  function/organizational unit/professional area or professional family, or to Eni's people and functions involved in the fulfilments regulated therein.\n\nThe  regulatory  instruments  are  published  on  the  Company's  Intranet site and, in some cases, on the Company's website. In addition, in 2020, Eni updated its Code of Ethics in which it renewed the corporate values that characterize the commitment of Eni people and all third parties working with the Company: integrity, respect and protection of human rights, transparency, promotion of development, operational excellence, innovation, teamwork and collaboration. In the first of the two following tables (p. 140), in addition to the Policies and the Code of Ethics, other Eni regulatory instruments approved by the CEO and/or the BoD are also considered. On the other hand, the second table (p. 141) shows management and organizational models, including management systems, multi-year plans, processes and cross-functional working groups.\n\n(4) Please note that on December 23 rd 2020, the Eni Board of Directors resolved to adhere to the new Code, the recommendations of which are applicable as of January 1 st 2021. Therefore, as from that date, roles, responsibilities and regulatory instruments must take into account the new recommendations on the subject provided for by the new Code, as well as the decisions taken by the Board of Directors on how to apply these recommendations.

Risks  are  assessed with quantitative and qualitative tools, taking into account environmental,  health  and  safety,  social  and  reputational impacts. The results of the risk assessment, including the main ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) risks, are submitted to the Board of Directors and the Control and Risk Committee on a half yearly basis. It should be noted that in  2020,  the  impact  of  the  Climate  Change  risk,  already  a top risk, increased due to the effects of the energy transi-\n\ntion on the Eni business model and management's subsequent commitment in the definition of the Long-Term Strategic Plan. In addition, it should be noted that due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, biological risk has become a top risk, assessed both as a risk to people's health and as a systemic risk capable of affecting Eni's risk portfolio as a whole and, in particular, market, Country and operational risks. The table below provides a summary view of Eni ESG risks classified according to the areas of Legislative Decree 254/2016. For each risk event, the type of risk - top risk and non-top risk - and the page references, where the main treatment actions are set out, are indicated.\n\n## RISK MANAGEMENT MODEL\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| SCOPES OF LEGISLATIVE  DECREE 254/2016             | RISK EVENT                                                    | TOP  RISK   | MAIN TREATMENT   ACTIONS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| CROSS   RISKS                                      |                                                               |             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| \uf0da                                                  | Risks associated with research   and development activities   |             | NFI  - Carbon neutrality by 2050,   pp. 144-150; Safety, pp. 156-157;  Respect for the environment,   pp. 157-162                                                                                                                                                    |\n| \uf0da                                                  | Cyber Security                                                | \uf0a2           | AR  - Integrated Risk Management,  pp. 26-31; Internal control risks,   pp. 133-134                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| \uf0da                                                  | Relations with stakeholders                                   | \uf0a2           | AR  - Integrated Risk Management,  pp. 26-31; Risks related to political  considerations, pp. 125-127; Risks  associated with the exploration  and production of oil and natural  gas, pp. 121-125 NFI  - Alliances for promotion of  local development, pp. 168-169 |\n|                                                    | \uf0da Political and social instability   and Global security risk | \uf0a2           | AR  - Integrated Risk Management,  pp. 26-31; Risks related to political  considerations, pp. 125-127                                                                                                                                                                |\n| T Y CLIMATE   CHANGE                               | \uf0da Climate Change  risk   and energy transition risks          | \uf0a2           | AR  - Integrated Risk Management,  pp. 26-31; Safety, security,  environmental and other  operational risks, pp. 119-121;                                                                                                                                            |\n| NEUTRALI Y  2050 Art. 3.2,   paragraphs a)  and b) |                                                               |             | Climate-related risks, pp. 129-132                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| CARBO N B                                          |                                                               |             | NFI  - Carbon Neutrality by 2050  (risk management), pp. 146-147                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Eni has long been committed to promoting comprehensive and effective climate change disclosure and in this respect confirms its commitment to implementing the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosure (TCFD) of the Financial Stability Board.\n\nLeadership in disclosure - Eni has been the only Oil & Gas Company involved in the TCFD since the beginning of its work and has contributed to the development of the voluntary recommendations for corporate climate change reporting. Transparency in climate change reporting and the strategy implemented by the Company have enabled Eni to be confirmed, once again in 2020, as a leading Company in the Climate Change disclosure program of the CDP 8 . The A-rating achieved by Eni was equalled only by few in the Oil & Gas industry and far exceeds the global average rating of C, in a scale ranging from D (minimum) to A (maximum). In 2020, the TPI 9 assessment awarded Eni, for the first time, the highest rating for management quality, due to the completeness of Eni's decarbonization strategy, and a high ranking for the emission performance of sold products (carbon performance). In the same period, Carbon Tracker 10 published an analysis of the potential risk of investment for the upstream sector of the main Oil & Gas companies in transition scenarios, in which Eni ranked first, distinguishing itself for the ambition of its GHG emission reduction targets, the competitiveness of future projects and for a medium-long term price scenario among the most conservative in the sector.\n\nCommitment to partnerships -  Among the many international climate initiatives that Eni participates in, Eni's CEO sits on the Steering Committee of the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(OGCI). Established in 2014 by 5 Oil & Gas companies, including Eni, OGCI now counts twelve companies, representing about one-third  of  global  hydrocarbon  production.  To  reinforce  its commitment to reduce operational emissions, OGCI has communicated in 2020 a new collective target for the reduction of the GHG emission intensity (Scope 1+2) of upstream operated assets 11 , consistent with the scenarios in line with the Paris Agreement. The target is in addition to the methane emission intensity reduction target announced in 2018 12 . Furthermore, the commitment to the joint investment in a fund of 1 billion dollars has continued, for the development of technologies to reduce GHG emissions throughout the energy value chain at a global scale and to promote, following the initiative started in 2019, (CCUS KickStarter) wide-scale marketing at global level of CCUS (CO 2 Capture, Utilisation and Storage) technology.\n\nEni promotes the need for alignment among the methodologies for GHG reporting in order to make the Oil & Gas sector performances and decarbonization targets comparable. In this sense, Eni collaborates in the Science Based Target Initiative (SBTi),  which  is  working  on  the  definition  of  guidelines  and standards applicable to the sector to define decarbonization targets in line with the objectives of the Paris Agreement. In December 2020, Eni, together with 7 other companies, joined the Energy Transition Principles initiative, committing to increase transparency and consistency in reporting on GHG emissions and  Net  Carbon  Intensity  targets.  Disclosure  on  long-term carbon neutrality is organized according to the four thematic areas  covered  by  TCFD  recommendations:  governance,  risk management, strategy and metrics and targets. The key elements of each area are presented below; please see Eni for 2020 - Carbon Neutrality by 2050 13 Report for a complete analysis; further details will be available through Eni's disclosure to CDP Climate Change questionnaire 2021.\n\n- (8) CDP (formerly Carbon Disclosure Project) is an organization recognized internationally as one of the reference institutions in performance assessment and for the climate strategy of listed companies.\n- (10) Financial indipendent think tank that for years has been conducting analyses to assess the impact of energy transition on financial markets.\n- (9) Transition Pathway Initiative, an investor-led global initiative that assesses companies' progress in the low-carbon transition.

Eni's decarbonization strategy is part of a structured  system  of  Corporate  Governance,  in  which  the BoD and the CEO play a central role in managing the main aspects linked to climate change. Based on the CEO's proposal, the BoD examines and approves the Strategic Plan, which sets out strategies and targets, including those related to climate change and energy transition. Since 2014, the BoD has been supported in performing its duties by the Sustainability and Scenarios Committee (SSC), with whom it examines, on a periodic basis, integration between strategy, future scenarios and the medium/long-term sustainability of the business. During 2020, the SSC discussed climate change issues at all meetings, including the outcomes of  the  2019  United  Nations  Climate  Change  Conference (COP25), energy scenarios, the state of the art in research and  development  for  energy  transition,  Eni's  decarbonization strategy, forestry activities, climate partnerships, Eni's responsible engagement on climate change within business associations, climate resolutions and assembly's disclosure\n\nof reference peers 14 . As from 2019, the BoD examines and approves  Eni's  Medium-Long  Term  Plan,  aiming  to  guarantee the sustainability of its business portfolio in a time frame up to 2050, in line with what is provided for in the Four-Year Strategic Plan. Several members of the new Board of Directors, in place since May 13, 2020, have experience with ESG issues 15 . Immediately after the appointment of the Board of Directors and the Board of Statutory Auditors, a board induction programme was implemented for directors and statutory auditors, which covered, among other topics, issues related to the decarbonization process and the environmental and social sustainability of Eni's activities. Eni's economic and financial exposure to the risk deriving from the introduction of new carbon pricing mechanisms is examined by the BoD both during preliminary approval of the investment and in the following half-year monitoring of the entire project portfolio.\n\nThe BoD is also informed annually on the results of the impairment test carried out on the main Cash Generating Units in the E&P sector and elaborated with the introduction of a carbon",

Finally, the BoD is informed on a quarterly basis on the results of the risk assessment and monitoring activities related to Eni's top risks, including climate change.\n\nRole of management. All corporate structures are involved in  the  definition  and implementation of the carbon neutrality strategy and in 2020, to foster its energy transition path, Eni launched a new organizational structure with two business groups: Natural Resources, active in the sustainable development of the upstream Oil & Gas portfolio, in marketing of wholesale natural gas, and in promoting forestry conservation (REDD+) and carbon storage projects, and Energy Evolution, to support the evolution of the production, transformation and marketing activities from fossil fuel based to bio, blue and green products, also through the merge of the retail and renewable businesses. As of 2019, climate strategy issues are part of long-term planning and managed by the CFO area through dedicated structures with the aim of overseeing the process of defining Eni's climate strategy and the related portfolio of initiatives, in line with international climate agreements. The strategic commitment in carbon footprint reduction is part of the essential goals of the Company and is therefore also reflected in the Variable Incentive Plans for the CEO and Company's management. In particular, the 2020-2022 Long-Term Stock-based Incentive Plan provides for a specific objective on issues of environmental sustainability and energy transition (total weight 35%), based on the targets related to decarbonization, energy transition and circular economy processes consistent with the objectives communicated to the market and with a view to aligning with the interests of all stakeholders. The Short-Term deferral Incentive Plan 2021 is closely linked to the Company's strategy, as it is aimed at measuring the achievement of annual objectives in line with Eni's new decarbonization targets. In particular, the upstream emission intensity on an equity basis is considered, which includes indirect emissions (so-called Scope  2)  and  non-operated  activities.  Starting  this  year,  the IBT Plan will also include the incremental renewable installed capacity KPI, replacing the one related with the exploration of resources, to support the energy transition strategy. Each of these targets is assigned to the CEO with a weighting of 12.5% and to all the Company's managers according to percentages in line with the attributed responsibilities.\n\n## RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nThe  process  for  identifying  and  assessing  climate-related risks  and  opportunities  is  part  of  Eni's  Integrated  Risk  Management Model developed to ensure that management makes decisions that take into account current and potential risks, including medium- and long-term risks, and with an integrated, comprehensive and prospective view. In light of the link\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nbetween risk  and  opportunity  management and Eni's  strategic objectives, the RMI process starts with a contribution in defining Eni's medium- and long-term plan and four-year plan (objectives and actions with de-risking value), and continues with supporting their implementation through periodic risk assessments and monitoring cycles. The IRM process ensures the detection, consolidation and analysis of all Eni's risks and supports the BoD in checking the compatibility of the risk profile with the strategic targets, including those that are medium to long-term. Risks are:\n\n- \u02db assessed with quantitative and qualitative tools considering both the probability of occurrence and the impacts that will be determined in a given time frame should the risk occur;\n- \u02db represented, based on the probability of occurrence and on the impact, by matrices that allow comparison and classification according to importance.\n\nMain risks and opportunities. Risks related to climate change are analysed, assessed and managed by considering energy transition aspects (market scenario, regulatory and technological evolution, reputation issues) and physical phenomena. The analysis is carried out using an integrated and cross-cutting approach that involves specialist departments and business lines and considers the related risks and opportunities. The main findings are shown below.\n\nMarket scenario. The International Energy Agency (IEA) identifies two main paths of possible evolution of the energy system: the Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS), which includes the policies implemented and planned by governments, and the Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS), which pursues the main energy objectives of sustainable development, including limiting the temperature increase in line with the Paris Agreement. In the SDS scenario, considered by Eni as the main reference for assessing the risks and opportunities associated with energy transition, fossil sources maintain a central role in the energy mix (Oil & Gas equal to 46% of the mix in 2040). Although in this scenario, the global energy demand by 2040 is expected to decrease compared to today (-9.6% vs. 2019, CAGR 17 20192040 -0.5%). In particular, natural gas maintains its portion in the energy mix (23%), and appears as the fossil fuel with the best future prospectives both for integration with renewable sources  and  for  replacement  of  other  sources  with  higher environmental impacts, especially in emerging Countries. Oil demand, on the other hand, is expected to peak immediately within the next two years and then gradually decline in almost all Countries (with the exception of India and Sub-Saharan Africa). Nevertheless, significant upstream investments are still needed to offset the decline in production from existing fields, although uncertainty remains on the influence that regulatory changes and technological breakthroughs could have on the scenario. Instead, renewable sources will gain growing importance in the progress towards decarbonization, succeeding",

Energy  demand in the NZE2050 decreases by 17% as early as 2030 (vs. -7% compared to SDS), reaching a level similar to 2006, but with an economy twice the size. This is made possible through an even more pronounced recourse (vs. SDS) to electrification, efficiency and changing consumer behaviours.\n\nRegulatory  developments. Adoption  of  policies  suitable  to sustain  the  energy  transition  towards  low  carbon  sources could have significant impacts on the evolution of Eni's business portfolio. In particular, all Parties of the Paris Agreement are called upon to review and strengthen their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) by COP26, to be held in November 2021 in Glasgow. At the same time, an increasing number of governments are announcing carbon neutrality targets by 2050 and some of them, including the EU, have already transposed this into law. In fact, the EU published in December 2019 the European Green Deal, a set of initiatives aimed at achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, a goal transposed into law with the Climate Law. In this context, the EU also intends to revise upwards its 2030 emission reduction target and update most of the related legislation accordingly (e.g. Renewable Directive, EU Emissions Trading Directive). Also with respect to this development, Eni has defined a medium to long-term plan designed to take full advantage of the opportunities offered by the energy transition and progressively reduce the carbon footprint of its activities, as explained in more detail in the Strategy and Targets section.\n\nTechnological developments. The need to build a final energy consumption model with a low carbon footprint will favour technologies for GHG emissions capture and reduction, production of hydrogen from gas as well as technologies that support methane emissions control along the Oil & Gas production chain. These elements will contribute to sustaining the role of hydrocarbons in the global energy mix. Furthermore, technological evolution in the field of energy production and storage from renewable sources and in the field of bio-based activities will be a key lever for the industrial transformation of Eni's business. Scientific and technological research is therefore one of the levers on which Eni's decarbonization strategy is based and the areas of action are described in the Strategy and Targets section.\n\nReputation. Awareness-raising campaigns by NGOs and other environmentalist organizations, media campaigns, campaigns to ban plastic, shareholder resolutions during meetings, disinvestments by some investors and class action by groups of\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n147\n\nstakeholders are increasingly more oriented towards greater transparency on the tangible commitments of Oil & Gas companies towards energy transition. Additionally, some public and private parties have begun proceedings, legal or otherwise, against the major Oil & Gas companies, including companies belonging  to  Eni's  Group,  deeming  them  responsible  for  the impacts related to climate change and human rights. Eni has long been committed to promoting a constant, open and transparent exchange of views on climate change and human rights issues which are an integral part of its strategy and therefore the subject of communications to all stakeholders. This commitment is part of a wider relationship that Eni has established with its stakeholders on important sustainability issues with initiatives on the subjects of governance, dialogue with investors and targeted communication campaigns, as well as participation in international initiatives and partnerships. In the early months of 2020, upholding requests from a number of investors, Eni published a Responsible Engagement policy on climate change within business associations, in which it committs to periodically check (update expected in the first half of 2021) consistency of its climate and energy advocacy positions and those of the trade associations to which it belongs.\n\nPhysical  risks. Intensification  of  extreme/chronic  weather phenomena in the medium-long term could cause damage to plants and infrastructures, resulting in an interruption to industrial activities and increased recovery and maintenance costs. With regard to extreme phenomena, such as hurricanes or typhoons, Eni's current portfolio of assets, designed in accordance with applicable regulations to withstand extreme environmental conditions, has a geographical distribution that does not result in concentrations of high risk. With regard to more gradual phenomena, such as sea level rise or coastal erosion, vulnerability  of  Eni's  assets  affected  by  the  phenomenon  is assessed through specific analysis, as in the case of Eni's assets in the Nile Delta area, where the impact is however limited and it is therefore possible to hypothesize and implement preventive mitigation interventions to counter the phenomenon. In parallel with its commitment to ensuring the integrity of its operations, Eni is active on Climate Change adaptation, also  with  regard  to  the  socio-economic  and  environmental impacts in the Countries where Eni operates. To this end, Eni has launched a project that will end in 2021, in collaboration with FEEM (Fondazione Eni Enrico Mattei) and Pisa Institute of Management (IDM), for the assessment of the main risks/ opportunities related to Climate Change and the development of appropriate guidelines and measures that will provide methodological support for the identification and implementation of adaptation actions in Countries of interest to Eni.\n\n## STRATEGY AND OBJECTIVES\n\nFollowing a phase of great transformation that has allowed the group to grow and diversify its portfolio, and at the same time strengthen its financial organization, Eni initiated a new phase",

Based on these principles, in 2021, the new strategy was defined to relaunch the short, medium and long-term operational objectives that outline  the  evolutionary  and  integrated  path  of  the  individual businesses and that will lead Eni to carbon neutrality by 2050, in line with the provisions of the scenarios compatible with maintaining global warming within the threshold of 1.5\u00b0C. The speed of the evolution and the related contribution of the businesses will depend on the market trend, the technological scenario and the reference regulations. Eni will pursue a strategy that aims to achieve by 2050 the net-zero target on GHG Lifecycle Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions, and the associated emission intensity (Net Carbon Intensity), referred to the entire life cycle of the energy products sold. In addition, the intermediate decarbonization targets were confirmed and further extended:\n\n- \u02db -25% of Net GHG Lifecycle Emissions @2030 vs. 2018 and -65% @2040;\n- \u02db -15% of Net Carbon Intensity of energy products sold @2030 vs. 2018 and -40% @2040;\n- \u02db Net-zero Carbon Footprint for Scope 1 and 2 emissions from upstream activities by 2030, with a new target of halving by 2024 vs. 2018;\n- \u02db Net-zero Carbon Footprint for Scope 1 and 2 emissions from all group operations by 2040.\n\nActions mostly already in place that will contributer to achieve these results are:\n\n- \u02db reduction of hydrocarbon production in the medium term, with gradual growth of the gas share, which will reach 90% by 2050;\n- \u02db gradual conversion of traditional refining using new technologies for the production of decarbonized products and recycling of waste materials;\n- \u02db increase of 'bio' refining capacity to 5/6 million tonnes, palm oil free starting from 2023;\n- \u02db growth in renewable energy capacity production to 60 GW by 2050;\n- \u02db progressive increase in the production of blue energy carriers (electricity and hydrogen) from gas, combined with CO 2 capture and storage projects;\n- \u02db increase in Eni gas e luce retail customers, with over 20 million by 2050;\n- \u02db forest  conservation  projects  totalling  around  40  million tonnes/year by 2050.\n\nAccurate accounting of emissions is ensured by the application of a reporting model based on a rigorous methodology for evaluating Scope 1+2+3 emissions associated with the value chain of energy products sold, including both those deriving from own production and those purchased from third parties. This distinctive approach exceeds the current standards for estimating emissions and provides an integral and concise\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nview of the carbon footprint associated with Eni activities. The methodology was developed with the collaboration of independent experts and the resulting indicators are published annually and certified by the financial auditor. Overall spending in  the  four-year  period  2021-24  for  decarbonization,  circular economy and renewables is approximately \u20ac5.7 billion, including scientific and technological research activities designed to support these themes.\n\n## PERFORMANCE METRICS AND COMMENTS\n\nStarting from 2016, Eni was among the first in the industry, to committ to targets aimed at improving the performance related to operational GHG emissions of the operated assets, with specific  indicators  showing  the  progress  achieved  so  far  in terms of reduction of GHG emissions into the atmosphere, use and consumption of energy resources from primary sources and production of energy from renewable sources. In addition to these, in 2020 new medium and long-term targets, accounted for on an equity basis, were defined and in 2021 they have been relaunched during the presentation of the strategy, in which Eni announced the target of net zero emissions (Scope 1, 2 and 3) by 2050. Below are Eni's main long-term objectives and the performance of the associated indicators:\n\nNet-zero  Carbon  Footprint  upstream  by  2030: the indicator considers Scope 1+2 emissions from all upstream assets, operated by Eni and by third parties, net of carbon sinks, which in 2020, was down by 23% compared to 2019 due to both the production declines occured in relation to the health emergency and the offsetting through forestry credits equal to 1.5 million tonnes of CO 2 eq.\n\nNet-zero  GHG  Lifecycle  Emissions  by  2050: the indicator refers to all Scope 1, 2 and Scope 3 emissions associated with Eni activities and products, along their value chain, net of carbon sinks and in 2020 it was down by 13% mainly due to the decrease in production and sales in all sectors related to the health emergency.\n\nZero Net Carbon Intensity by 2050: the indicator is calculated as the ratio between absolute net GHG emissions (Scope 1, 2 and 3) along the value chain of energy products and the amount of energy they contain. In 2020 it was essentially stable as the decrease in emissions across all sectors was accompanied by a proportional decrease in production related to the decline in activities due to the health emergency.\n\nWith specific reference to short-term decarbonization targets, defined on operated assets and accounted for on a 100% basis, the following is a summary of the results obtained in 2020 and the progress towards defined targets.",

        "page_content": "## Reduction of the upstream GHG emission intensity index\n\nby 43% by 2025 vs. 2014: the  upstream  GHG intensity  index, expressed as the ratio of direct emissions in tonnes of CO 2 eq. and the gross production in thousands of barrels of oil equivalent, in 2020 interrupted the progressive reduction trend, due to the drop in production ascribable to the health emergency and other causes, including the reduced production in onshore fields in Libya due to force majeure caused by the geo-political instability situation and the drop in gas demand in Egypt, whose productions are associated with a low emission impact. In 2020, the index recorded a value of 20.0 tonCO 2 eq./kboe, up by 2% compared to 2019. The overall reduction compared to 2014 is 26%.\n\nZero routine gas flaring by 2025: in 2020, the volumes of hydrocarbons sent to routine flaring, equal to 1.03 billion Sm 3 , fell by 14% compared to 2019 and by 39% compared to 2014, in relation to both the completion of projects to reduce flaring, in particular in Angola, and due to the decrease in activities related to the health emergency that also affected some fields with associated gas flaring.\n\nReduction of upstream methane fugitive emissions by 80% by 2025 vs. 2014: upstream methane fugitive emissions were 11.2 ktCH 4 in  2020,  down  by  approximately 50% from 2019, as a consequence of the decreased production related to the health emergency and thanks to monitoring and maintenance activities carried out as part of the Leak Detection And Repair (LDAR) campaigns that are conducted on a periodic basis and to date cover approximately 60 assets. The overall reduction compared to 2014 is 90%, confirming the achievement in advance of the 80% reduction target set for 2025.\n\nAn average improvement of 2% per year in 2021 compared to the 2014 carbon efficiency index : the target has extended the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n149\n\ncommitment of reducing GHG emissions (Scope 1 and Scope 2) to all business areas. This objective refers to the overall Eni's index, maintaining the appropriate flexibility in the trends of the individual businesses. In 2020, the index was 31.64 tonCO 2 eq./ kboe, substantially stable with respect to 2019 (31.41 tonCO 2 eq./ kboe) mainly due to the drop in production related to the health emergency, and in line with the trend in the upstream sector that weighs more on the overall index. The effect was partially offset by the energy efficiency projects launched or completed during the year. In 2020, in fact, Eni went ahead with its investment plan both in projects aiming directly at increasing energy efficiency in its  assets  (\u20ac10M)  and  in  development  and  revamping  projects with significant effects on the energy performance of operations. When fully  operational,  the  interventions  carried  out  during  the year will allow fuel savings of 287 ktoe/year (mostly upstream), with a benefit in terms of emissions reduction of approximately 0.7 million tonnes of CO 2 eq.\n\nOverall, direct GHG emissions from assets operated by Eni in 2020 amounted to 37.8 mln tonCO 2 eq., down by 8% compared to 2019, mainly due to the decrease in activities related to the health emergency, in the upstream, power and refining sectors.\n\nThe Energy Solutions business in 2020 grew significantly, reporting a 76% increase in renewables installed capacity compared to 2019 (307 MWp in 2020 vs. 174 in 2019) and bringing production to 339.6 GWh. For biofuels, the quantities produced in 2020 rose to 622 thousand tonnes, with a 143% increase with respect to the previous year. For 2020, the financial commitment of Eni in scientific research and technological development amounted to \u20ac157 million, of which approximately \u20ac74 million was spent on investments for decarbonization and circular economy projects. These investments are related to energy transition, bio-refinement, green chemistry, production from renewable sources, reduction of emissions and energy efficiency.\n\n## KPIS RELATED TO MEDIUM-LONG TERM TARGETS 18\n\n|                                                                 |                           |   2020 |   2019 |   2018 | Target                        |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|--------|--------|--------|-------------------------------|\n| Net Carbon Footprint upstream (Scope 1 + Scope 2 GHG emissions) | (million tonnes CO 2 eq.) |  11.4  |  14.8  |  14.8  | UPS Net zero 2030             |\n| Net GHG Lifecycle Emissions (Scope 1, 2 and 3) (a)              |                           | 439    | 501    | 505    | Net zero 2050                 |\n| Net Carbon Intensity (Scope 1, 2 and 3) (a)                     | (gCO 2 eq./MJ)            |  68    |  68    |  68    | Net zero 2050                 |\n| Renewable installed capacity                                    | MW                        | 307    | 174    |  40    | 60 GW 2050                    |\n| Capacity of biorefineries (b)                                   | (milion tonnes/year)      |   1.11 |   1.11 |   0.36 | 5/6 million tonnes/ year 2050 |\n\n- (a) The methodology for calculating Scope 1+2+3 emissions associated to the value chain of energy products sold, has been enhanced in order to better represent Scope 3 end-use  emissions; 2019 and 2018 data are updated accordingly.\n- (b) Installed capacity of Gela biorefinery has been updated to 750 ktonnes/y due to a review of KPI calculation method (2019 data updated accordingly).",

Planned evolution of business activities, strategic directions and the challenges posed by changes in technology and the labour market in general imply an important commitment to increase the value of human capital over time through upskilling and reskilling initiatives, aimed at enriching or redirecting the set of skills required.\n\n## A CULTURE OF PLURALITY AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF PEOPLE\n\nThe approach of Eni to Diversity & Inclusion has been developed in the wake of its cultural sensitivity and tradition, rooted in the international culture of plurality; it is based on the fundamental principles of non-discrimination, equal opportunity and inclusion of all forms of diversity, as well as integration and balancing work with people's personal and family needs. Eni is committed to creating a work environment in which different personal and cultural characteristics or orientations are considered a source of mutual enrichment and an indispensable element of business sustainability. At Eni, there are no differences in gender, religion, nationality, political opinion, sexual orientation, social status, physical abilities, medical conditions, family circumstances and age and any other irrelevant aspect; furthermore, Eni aims to establish working relationships free from any form of discrimination, requiring that similar values be adopted by all third parties working with Eni. Diversity is in fact a resource to be safeguarded and enhanced both within the Company and in all relations with external stakeholders, including suppliers, commercial and industrial partners, as underlined by its mission and Code of Ethics. Eni promotes cross professional exchange through a series of processes, including geographical mobility, as an important experience in the path of personal growth. The consolidation over the years of the processes of induction of new recruits, coaching, training and sharing of skills and best practices with local personnel has ensured continuity in op-\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n151\n\nand non-professional), and ensuring health and safety, environmental protection, respect and promotion of human rights and attention to transparency and anti-corruption.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nerating activities in 2020, a year characterized by a massive return of expatriate personnel to headquarters. With regard to gender diversity, Eni pays particular attention to the promotion of initiatives to attract female talents at a national and international level, and to the development of managerial and professional growth paths for the women in the Company. In this context, Eni organizes initiatives for high school students in  STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) subjects, with a focus on gender equality (Think About Tomorrow) and participates in national and international initiatives 19 with the aim of constantly enhancing its processes and operating practices with a view to gender equality. These activities have continued throughout the year through the 'dematerialization' of events and meetings that has allowed reaching places, people and realities inaccessible to date, breaking down language and geographical barriers.\n\nRemuneration policies for Eni employees are defined according to an integrated model at global level and promote salary progression linked exclusively to meritocratic criteria referring to the skills expressed in the role held, the performance achieved and the references of the local remuneration market. In order to verify the implementation of these policies, since 2011, Eni has annually monitored the remuneration gap between women and men, noting the substantial alignment of remuneration. In addition, in relation to ILO (International Labour Organization) standards, Eni performs annual analyses on the remuneration of local personnel in the main Countries in which it operates, which show minimum salary levels of Eni personnel significantly higher than both the minimum legal salaries and the minimum market remuneration levels, identified for each Country by international providers (for further information, see Report on remuneration policy and remuneration paid 2021, on p. 13).\n\nRelating  to  the  professional  management  of  its  resources, Eni  has  implemented  managerial  development  and  excellence pathways aimed at the core professional areas, which it supports through training activities, mobility initiatives, job rotation and development tools.

The year 2020 saw an inevitable downturn in mobility initiatives. However, internal growth and development continued, held remotely.\n\nIn 2020, the performance assessment and feedback process covered 97%, while potential assessment activities 20 95%  of  the  total  planned  with  an  overall  improving  trend (+10 p.p. vs. 2019); finally, 123 senior managers and middle managers were assessed using the Management Appraisal methodology.\n\n## TRAINING\n\nThe 2020 training programme was marked by an intense redesign of many distance learning courses, giving priority to health and safety issues, alongside courses to support people,  up  to  and  including  master's  degrees,  to  which  we wanted  to  give  continuity.  HSE  training  continued  where possible in presence, or in distance mode, and covered both mandatory and non-mandatory training content. In addition, a course was created for all Eni employees (Enicampus Live) to encourage greater awareness of individual behaviour in the emergency context and to acquire renewed responsibility  for  individual  and  team  results. The Diversity & Inclusion training offer was also expanded with new content, including a  course  dedicated  to  'gender  harassment  in  the  workplace', while the commitment for the contamination remained prevalent for many training initiatives on the emerging issues of Energy Transition, Circular Economy, Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS), Forestry, Renewable Energy, digitalization both of a technical nature and of Corporate Identity (for new hires, new managers, or managerial figures). Attention continued to be focused both on information security, through the provision of cyber security courses, and on training using innovative techniques such as Virtual Reality Training (for example in the HSE and Drilling field) or Augmented Reality (in the HSE field).\n\n## INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS\n\nThe energy transition path has determined the need to define a new model of industrial relations and for this reason, on December 3, 2020, Eni and the unions signed a new protocol called 'INSIEME, a model of industrial relations to support the energy transition path'. The protocol aims at sharing information on this path, updating and renewing professional skills in view of the new business challenges and proposing a clear and favourable regulatory framework for the development of a sustainable business model. At international level, the model of trade union relations is based\n\n<!-- image -->\n\non three pillars: two in Europe (the European Works Council and the European Observatory for the Health and Safety of Workers at Eni) and a global one, namely the Global Framework Agreement on International Industrial Relations and Corporate Social Responsibility (GFA), renewed in 2019 with the main Italian trade unions and IndustriALL Global Union 21 .  During 2020, a constant exchange of information was ensured between the Company and the unions, within the framework of competence provided for each agreement, on the main topics of attention (including emergency management, Company reorganizations and Brexit).\n\n## WELFARE INITIATIVES 22\n\nThe health emergency situation has impacted all personal services, making it necessary both to revise the ways in which initiatives are organized with a view to utmost safety (increased  attention  to  health  services,  support  for  summer  family  organization  and  employee  catering  services) and to identify innovative services capable of responding to emerging needs arising from family and social complexity and new ways of working. These new initiatives include an online training course dedicated to parents to help them cope in the new everyday life, addressing issues such as the impact of digital technologies, educational needs and building relationships.\n\n## HEALTH\n\nEni  considers  health  protection  an  essential  requirement and  promotes  the  physical,  psychological  and  social well-being of its people, their families and the communities of the Countries in which it operates. The extreme variability of working contexts requires a constant effort to update health risk matrices and makes it particularly challenging to guarantee health at every stage of the business cycle. To rise to this challenge, Eni has developed an operational platform that ensures services to its people, covering occupational health, industrial hygiene, traveller health, healthcare and medical emergency, as well as health promotion initiatives for Eni people and the communities in which it operates. The Eni strategy for health management is oriented, in addition to maintaining and continuously improving health services, to: (i) enhancing access to assistance for all Eni people, interventions in favour of communities and emergency provisions to support situations of fragility created or aggravated by the pandemic; (ii) spreading the culture of health through initiatives in favour of workers, their families  and  communities  identified  downstream  of  risk assessment and impacts in the health field; (iii) implementing occupational medicine activities also in consideration of\n\n(20) Potential assessments are conducted through the methodology of Development Center, Online Assessment, and Individual Assessment.\n\n- (22) Benefits are offered to all employees consistent with the regulations set forth in the Health Care, Supplemental Security and Other Funds.\n\n(21) Organization that represents more than 50 million workers distributed in 140 Countries, in the energy, manufacturing and mining sectors.",

In 2020, all of the Group companies continued the implementation of health management systems with the objective of promoting and maintaining the health and well-being of Eni people and ensuring adequate risk management in the workplace. In the critical global health context, Eni has implemented a series of prevention and assistance interventions in order to support those in the front line managing health emergencies and local health structures, also thanks to the numerous experiences in health projects gained in response to epidemic events around the world 23 . In fact, the Eni centre of competence for the management of health emergencies has supported  the  business  units  through:  (i)  epidemiological  updates and new guidelines issued by international bodies, (ii) hygiene measures for the prevention and containment of outbreaks and epidemics/pandemics, (iii) clinical and care flow management best practices, vaccinations and recommendations for travel medicine and (iv) support in defining technical specifications for services related to emergency response.\n\n## PERFORMANCE METRICS AND COMMENTS\n\n## EMPLOYMENT AND DIVERSITY\n\nOverview - Overall employment amounts to 30,775 people, of whom 21,170 in Italy (68.7% of Eni employees) and 9,605 abroad (31.2% of Eni employees). In 2020, employment at global  level  decreased  by  546  people  compared  to  2019, equal to -1.7%, with an increase in Italy (+92 employees) and a reduction abroad (-638 employees). The reduction in employment, due mainly to a business scenario affected by the health emergency, concerned both local and international employees. Despite the discontinuity of the energy market, Eni continued to pursue its diversity objectives: in 2020, permanent hires of female personnel stood at 34.6% of total hires compared to 32.3% in the previous year.\n\nHires - Overall, in 2020, 780 people were hired, 607 of whom with permanent contracts. About 76% involved employees under the age of 40. Of the total number of hires, approximately 23% in upstream business (total 183, of which 109 with permanent contracts and 74 with fixed-term contracts), 20% in Support Function, 10% the R&M area and 47% the other businesses.\n\nTerminations - Overall, 1,600 contracts were terminated (934 in  Italy  and  666  abroad),  1,323  of  which  were  permanent\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n153\n\ncontracts 24 , and 21.0% regarded female employees. In 2020, 22.1%  of  employees  with  permanent  contracts  who  ended their  employment  were  under  40  years  of  age.  Due  to  the negative business scenario generated mainly by the health emergency, the turnover rate decreased compared to previous years mainly due to a reduction in the number of hires.\n\nFemale  employment -  Of  the  permanent  hires  in  2020, 34.6% involved female personnel (up 2.3 percentage points vs.  2019).  In  2020,  the  percentage  of  female  employees stood at: 16.3% of executives, 27.7% of middle managers, 29.9% of white collar workers, 2.1% of blue collar workers. Compared to the past, the overall percentage of women on the boards of directors of subsidiaries decreased to 26% in 2020 (29% in 2019), while the overall percentage of women on the supervisory boards of subsidiaries remained substantially stable at 37%. In 2020, the percentage of women in  positions of responsibility rose to 26.64%, compared to 26.05% in 2019; in all, women accounted for 24.56% of the Eni total workforce. At Eni, 33% of the figures reporting directly to the CEO are women.\n\nEmployment in Italy - There were 379 hires in Italy, of which 346 were permanent contracts (37.6% women, an increase of about 5 percentage points compared to 2019). Despite an increase in employment in Italy of +0.4% compared to 2019, there was a slight decrease in the number of people employed in the youngest age group (18-29), -0.6% vs. 2019, while the 40-49 (+0.8%) and over 60 (+1.15%) age groups increased, partly due to the return of expatriate personnel. Again in Italy, in 2020, there were 934 terminations, 893 of whom were permanently employed (and 19.0% women).\n\nEmployment abroad - Average presence of local employees abroad is costant and around 84% in the last three years on average, that confirms Eni commitment to local content through the engagement of local communities in its business activities in the Countries. Use of expatriate personnel is limited to specific expertise and compentences hardly available  in  the  Country.  Abroad,  in  2020,  there  were  401 new  hires,  of  which  261  were  with  permanent  contracts (30.7% women) and 78.1% were employees under 40 years of age. The balance between hires and terminations abroad at the end of the year was -265 (+401 hires and -666 terminations) and this trend is also attributable to contractual terminations of international resources employed in the E&P business. There were 666 terminations, 430 of whom permanently  employed.  Of  these,  35.3%  regarded  employees under the age of 40, and 25.1% were women. Abroad, there",

Local personnel  remains  essentially  stable  compared  to  2019 (+0.08%). A total of 1,278 expatriates work abroad (of which 968 Italians and 310 international expatriates). In last years, approximately 20% of employees in positions of responsibility are non-italians, with an increase of 1.3 p.p. vs. 2019. Such an increase is part of professional development paths that include work periods in offices located in Italy or in Countries other than the one of origin. Specifically, percentage of local senior managers & middle managers abroad increased of 2.48 p.p. vs. 2019.\n\nEmployment by line of business -  About  55%  of  permanent hires were in the upstream business areas (mainly in Mozambique, the United Kingdom, Mexico and the United States), Retail G&P (France and Greece) and Support Functions, with the main objective of managing turnover to support the consolidation and evolution of skills. Terminations were  related  to  the  upstream  business  (31.8%),  Support Functions (25.3%) and R&M (14.2%).\n\nAverage age - The average age of Eni's people in the world is 45.8 years (46.7 in Italy and 43.7 abroad): 49.8 years (50.7 in Italy and 47.1 abroad) for senior and middle managers, 44.4 years (45.5 in Italy and 41.9 abroad) for employees, and 41.9 years (40.6 in Italy and 43.7 abroad) for workers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## TRAINING\n\nIn a year marked by the COVID-19 emergency, there was a 23.6% reduction in total hours of training provided in 2020 compared to 2019. However, it is important to highlight the significant increase in distance learning, which reached 67% of total hours in 2020 (vs. 28% in 2019).\n\nThe average expenditure compared to 2019 has a per capita decrease as it is affected by the reduction in overall training costs, which led to a decrease of 33%; however, it was possible to achieve this result also thanks to efficiency actions with reductions in external costs and greater use of internal teaching.\n\n## HEALTH\n\nIn 2020, the number of health services sustained by Eni was 354,192, of which 242,160 for employees, 39,840 for family members, 65,662 for contractors and 6,530 for others (e.g. visitors and external patients).\n\nThe number of participants in health promotion initiatives in  2020  was  222,708,  of  whom  99,758  were  employees, 86,357 contractors and 36,593 family members. As concerns occupational illnesses, claims fell during 2020 from 73 to 28, with an overall reduction of 61%, due to the reduction of illnesses reported, both by former employees (from 64 to 21 claims) and current employees (from 9 to 7 claims). Of the 28 occupational disease claims submitted in 2020, 10 were submitted by heirs (all relating to former employees).",

Several projects and initiatives on the theme of the 'Human Factor' were promoted in 2020, mainly concerning: (i) the creation of a behavioural analysis model in search of so-called 'weak signals'  that  provides  recommendations  for  reducing  human error, strengthening human 'barriers' to counter accident risks and assessing the influence of cultural elements in a given operational reality; (ii) the creation of an accident investigation methodology to highlight recurring causes; (iii) the preparation of a new behavioural training area with the aim of fostering greater awareness of HSE aspects in the field of behavioural safety and Non-Technical Skills.\n\nIn addition to these innovative activities, Eni continued to pay particular attention to reinforcing safety during activities at operating sites, further standardizing in special regulatory instruments, valid for all Eni entities, the minimum basic principles to be applied in the most critical activities already adopted at site level. In addition, with the continuation of smart working, the  'Safety  starts  @  home'  campaign  was  relaunched  and enhanced to promote safety at home starting with the 'Safety Golden Rules' 25 - the 10 golden rules for safety at work. In the foreign upstream subsidiaries, an initiative was also implemented with the aim of strengthening the leadership and commitment of management at all levels, both of Eni and its contractors.\n\nRegarding the management of contractors , the 130 people in the Safety Competence Center (SCC) 26 continued to proactively monitor and support the process of improvement of companies towards management models characterized by a safety culture that is more preventive than reactive, monitoring over 2,500 suppliers, equal to 70% of those with potential HSE criticalities in Italy, and managing the anomalies detected with immediate corrective actions and sharing innovative good practices. In addition, agreements (so-called 'Safety Pacts') were developed with various contractors operating in Ghana and Angola.\n\nIn 2020, the massive dissemination of the 10 shared operating rules on process safety (Process Safety Fundamentals - PSF) was launched, which transversally involved the various Eni businesses, covering about 80% of employees at operating sites.\n\nMoreover, Eni applies Asset Integrity process to its assets\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nand ensures they are well-designed, well-built and with the most appropriate materials, well run, and decommissioned properly, by managing residual risk with the aim of guaranteeing maximum reliability and, above all, safety of people and the environment. The Asset Integrity Management System develops from the initial design stage (Design Integrity), to procurement, construction, installation and testing (Technical Integrity) through to operational and decommissioning (Operating  Integrity).  In  2020  Eni  continued  the  initiatives launched in 2019 to further promote the Asset Integrity culture with a cross and widespread approach.\n\nWith regard to industrial hygiene , great attention was paid, in the context of the emergency, to the identification and management of suitable individual prevention devices (PPE) and initiatives were promoted to raise awareness of the effective management of risk factors.\n\nIn 2020, Eni continued to develop and implement digital initiatives to support safety, including: the creation of an app to increase HSE culture, initiatives to support issued work permits currently present at more than 60 sites and a project to identify recurring  hazardous  situations  with  artificial  intelligence  technologies.\n\nLastly, other initiatives were launched in the areas of emergency preparedness and response, use of chemical products, radiation protection with regard to the dangers of exposure to ionizing radiation and product safety. The main corporate  objectives  for  safety  and  industrial  hygiene  in 2021 are: (i) the improvement of the Severity Incident Rate (SIR), Eni's weighted internal index that measures the level of incident severity and is used in the short-term incentive plan of the CEO and senior managers with strategic responsibilities, in order to focus the commitment of Eni on reducing the most serious accidents; (ii) the consolidation of the Safety Culture Program, an indicator that monitors the level of proactivity through aspects of preventive safety management; (iii)  the  continuation of the dissemination of the 10 Process Safety Fundamentals; (iv) the extension to all Eni sites of projects that apply new technologies and new digital devices to support safety; (v) strengthening of oversight in specific areas of industrial hygiene.\n\n## PERFORMANCE METRICS AND COMMENTS\n\nIn 2020, the total recordable injury frequency ratio (TRIR) of the workforce increased compared to 2019 (+5%), particularly the employee ratio due to an increase in the number of injuries (30\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Particular attention is paid to the efficient use of natural resources, like water, to reducing oil spills, to managing waste, to managing the interaction with biodiversity and ecosystem services.\n\nFor Eni, environmental culture is an important lever for the correct management of environmental issues and for this reason in 2020, it involved its own people through various initiatives including the conduct of specific environmental cultural engagement sessions on the field, the provision of awareness 'briefs' on the correct management of environmental aspects and the creation of an environmental communication campaign dedicated to all employees, with interventions by internal and operational experts. At the same time, in renewing its environmental\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nculture, Eni has directly involved its suppliers, whose activities\n\nmust reflect Eni's values, commitment and standards. In 2020, the Safety Pact was extended to the environment as well, involving several suppliers who have committed to implement tangible improvement actions that can be measured through the Safety and Environment Performance Index, whose data are collected with specific tools called 'safetymeter' and 'environmentmeter'. The commitment of Eni in 2020 also concerned environmental  digitalization with particular reference to process optimization through the creation of IT tools for the management of environmental compliance, including international compliance, and site-specific technical-management assessment models. The transition path towards a circular economy represents for\n\nEni one of the main responses to the current environmental challenges, which is based on the revision of the Company's production processes and the management of its assets, reducing the withdrawal of natural resources in favour of mate-\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n157",

In this regard, starting in 2017, Eni began carrying out site-specific circularity analyses, moving from an initial qualitative approach, based on the 3R (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle) criterion, to quantitative assessments with a measurement model developed on the basis of internationally recognized principles and assessed by a third party. This model, through the monitoring of specific indicators, including HSE indicators, makes it possible to measure both the current state of circularity and the effect of the improvement opportunities identified, while at the same time anticipating the setting of future national and international regulations on the subject.\n\nEni's waste management pays particular attention to the traceability of the entire process and to the verification of the parties involved in the disposal/recovery chain, in order to ensure compliance with regulations and the environment. Nearly all of Eni waste in Italy is managed by Eni Rewind, which in 2020, launched a digitalization project for the efficiency and monitoring of its waste management process and implemented solutions to ensure its traceability up to its correct final disposal/ recovery, facing regulatory developments that have strengthened the responsibilities of companies in this area.\n\nWith reference to water resources, Eni operates efficient management by evaluating the use of water and the impacts of its activities on water resources for the benefit of the ecosystem, other users and the Company itself. Eni, especially in stressed areas, carries out the mapping and monitoring of water risks and drought scenarios to define long-term actions also aimed at preventing and mitigating the effects of climate change, involving  suppliers  as  well  during  the  qualification  process. Following its decision to endorse the CEO Water Mandate in 2019, Eni has launched a number of initiatives including, in line with the first of the core elements of the Mandate, a number of studies to evaluate options to increase the water resilience and efficiency of its assets. In terms of transparency, also in 2020, Eni gave a public response to the CDP Water Security questionnaire, confirming the score obtained last year (A-).\n\nWith regard to the management of risks related to oil spills, Eni is constantly engaged in every area of intervention: prevention, preparedness, followed by mitigation, response and recovery.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn the area of prevention, in Italy, on the pipeline network of the  Val  D'Agri  Oil  Centre,  completed  on  two  backbones  was the  installation  of  the  e-VPMS \u00ae technology  (Eni  Vibroacoustic Pipeline Monitoring System 27 - Proprietary Patent), which, among other things, obtained the recognition of Conformity to the Industry 4.0 Plan 28 by a third party, while in Nigeria, where the system is already operational on the Kwale-Akri and Ogboinbiri-Tebidaba pipelines,  installation  has  been  temporarily suspended on the Clough Creek-Tebidaba pipeline (52 km) due to the pandemic and is expected to be rescheduled in 2021. Lastly, regarding R&D, work continued on testing various technologies, including those that monitor the integrity of pipelines and tanks and early warning systems for water and pollution risks, both on upstream and downstream assets. In addition, on the retail network in Italy, the replacement of single-wall underground tanks with new double-wall tanks or resining continued, with completion expected in 2021.\n\nAs part of the preparation, in order to minimize intervention times, an analysis of the risk of natural events, such as landslides and river overflows, was carried out on the oil pipeline network in Italy, in order to identify the critical sections and the consequent priorities for defence interventions.\n\nAs part of the sustainable recovery of places that have been sabotaged, remediation work is also being carried out using a technology  that  makes  use  of  plant  species  (phyto-remediation). Lastly, collaborations continued with IPIECA and IOGP 29 in order to strengthen the capacity to respond to marine pollution, in terms of updating and disseminating good practices and regional initiatives such as GI-WACAF - Global Initiative for West, Central and Southern Africa 30 and OSPRI - Oil Spill Preparedness Regional Initiative 31 , together with local authorities.\n\nEni commitment to Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (BES) is an integral part of the Integrated HSE Management System, confirming  its  awareness  of  the  risks  for  the  natural  environment resulting from its sites and activities. Operating on a global scale in environmental contexts with different ecological sensitivities and regulatory systems, Eni has adopted a specific BES management model that has evolved over time thanks also to long-term  collaborations  with  recognized  international  organizations that are leaders in biodiversity conservation. The BES management model 32 is aligned with the strategic objectives of  the  Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) 33 and ensures that the interactions between environmental aspects (such as\n\n- (31) Founded by a group of oil and gas companies, including Eni, it aims to encourage and support industry and governments in adopting proven, credible, integrated and sustainable oil spill response capabilities at national, regional and international levels.\n\nhttps://www.eni.com/assets/documents/eng/just-transition/Eni-Biodiversity-and-Ecosystem-Services-Policy.pdf.\n\n(33) Rio de Janeiro, 1992.",

Through the application of the Mitigation Hierarchy, Eni gives priority to preventive measures over corrective ones with the primary objective of no net loss of biodiversity.\n\nThe active involvement of stakeholders is fundamental for the implementation and continuous improvement in the management of the BES issue and ensures the effective application of the Mitigation Hierarchy. Consultation and collaboration with local communities, indigenous peoples and other local stakeholders helps to understand their expectations and concerns, determine how ecosystem services and biodiversity are being used, and identify management options that include their needs. The involvement of key stakeholders is an inclusive and transparent process that takes place from the early stages of a project and continues throughout its life cycle. Eni biodiversity risk exposure is periodically assessed by mapping the geographical proximity to protected areas and areas important for biodiversity conservation. This mapping allows identifying priority sites where to take action with higher resolution inquiries to characterize the operational and environmental context and assess potential impacts to be mitigated through Action Plans, thus ensuring effective management of risk exposure. Moreover, since October 2019, Eni has committed not to conduct oil and gas exploration and development activities within the boundaries of Natural Sites included in the UNESCO World Heritage  List 34 .  This  commitment  confirms  the  Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services Policy that Eni has been following for a long time in its operations, in line with the corporate mission, and reaffirms both its approach to nature conservation in every area with a high biodiversity value and the spread of good management practices in joint ventures where Eni is not an operator. In 2020, Eni adhered to the 'Together with Nature' principles, committing, in addition to recognizing the close link between climate change and biodiversity loss, to minimizing risks and maximizing efforts to protect and conserve existing ecosystems  through  the  application  of  Nature-based  Solutions, based on rigorous ecological principles.\n\n## PERFORMANCE METRICS AND COMMENTS\n\nIn 2020, sea water withdrawals  increased  by  10%  overall, mainly due to the increase recorded at the Priolo petrochemical  plant  (where  activity  resumed  after  the  2019  maintenance shutdown and where, starting in the second half of\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n159\n\n2020, functionality tests were carried out on the seawater network  with  an  increase  in  the  related  withdrawals).  The increase  in  seawater  withdrawals  was  also  influenced  by upstream start-up activities in Angola. The increase in sea water withdrawals was partly offset by the lower quantity of raw materials processed at the Taranto refinery (-8 Mm 3 ). Freshwater  withdrawals,  accounting  for  about  7%  of  total water withdrawals and over 70% attributable to the R&MeC sector, declined by 11%. The trend is attributable to a reduction in surface water withdrawals of more than 19 Mm 3 at the Mantua (Italy) petrochemical plant due to both the cessation of maintenance activities carried out in 2019 and the individual user awareness and control activities put in place by the site during 2020. Freshwater reuse rate increased to  91% from 89% in 2019. The E&P sector's produced water re-injection rate stood at 53%, down from 2019 (when it stood at 58%) due to shutdowns in Libya, malfunctions of the re-injection systems at the Loango and Zatchi fields in Congo  and  the  Ebocha  field  in  Nigeria  (with  difficulties  in performing maintenance activities due to reduced staffing for the COVID-19 emergency) as well as deconsolidation of Eni  Ecuador  whose  performances  in  terms  of  re-injection rates were particularly solid. Analysis of the stress level of hydrographic basins 35 and further studies carried out locally shows that freshwater withdrawals from areas under stress account  for  1.5%  of  Eni  total  water  withdrawals.  In  2020, in  particular,  Eni  withdrew 113 million cubic meters (Mm 3 ) of freshwater, of which 26.5 Mm 3 from water-stressed areas (11.8 Mm 3 from superficial water bodies, 5.4 Mm 3 from groundwater, 4.6 Mm 3 from third parties, 3.2 Mm 3 from urban net and 1.5 Mm 3 from TAF). Onshore produced water in water-stressed areas was 20.7 Mm 3 . In 2020, Eni discharged 93.6 Mm 3 of freshwater, of which 18.3 Mm 3 in water-stressed areas (equal to 20%). Spilled barrels following operational oil spills decreased by 7% compared to 2019. The most significant events included a spill in Nigeria of almost 300 barrels at the Brass Terminal (almost all recovered) and a spill of 63 barrels at the Brindisi petrochemical plant (fully recovered). Overall, 64% of operational spill volumes were recovered. Of the barrels spilled, 73% are attributable to activities in Nigeria. With regard to sabotage events, in 2020, there was a decrease in both the number of spills and the quantities spilled. Of volumes spilled, 76% were from upstream operations in Nigeria, where spilled quantities were down 29% compared to 2019. Two events were recorded in Egypt, one of which caused the spill of 1,000 barrels from a crude oil line in the desert (70% already recovered). In Italy, there was a break-in\n\n(34) Natural Sites included in the UNESCO World Heritage List as of May 31, 2019.

Overall, 46% of oil spill volumes from sabotage were recovered. Volumes spilled as a result of chemical spills are mainly attributable to upstream activities in the UK and USA.\n\nWaste generated by Eni from production operations in 2020 decreased by 19% compared to 2019, due to the decline in both non-hazardous waste (76% of the total), and hazardous waste. The decrease in non-hazardous waste is mainly related to the E&P sector, where more than 350,000 tonnes less were generated compared to 2019 due to the slowdown of activities following the COVID-19 emergency and as a result of  the  cessation  of  Construction activities  in  Zohr  (Egypt). The reduction in hazardous waste is attributable to both the E&P sector (due to reduced drilling activities in Nigeria and Kazakhstan) and the R&MeC sector, where the Taranto and Sannazzaro  refineries  recorded  a  significant  drop  in  waste production due to the slowdown in operations following the health  emergency.  Eni's  share  of  recovered  and  recycled waste in 2020 was 13% of the total waste disposed 36 , up from 2019 thanks to the increase in non-hazardous waste recovered regarding both the E&P sector (Central Southern District) and the R&MeC sector (Gela and Taranto refineries). In 2020, a total of 4.2 million tonnes of waste was generated by remediation activities (of which 3.9 million tonnes by Eni Rewind), of which about 73% was groundwater treated at TAF plants, partly reused and partly returned to the environment. Expenditure on remediation activities amounted to \u20ac411 million.\n\nEmissions  of  pollutants into  the  atmosphere  decreased, with the exception of sulphur oxide (SO x ) emissions, which increased  slightly  compared  to  2019  (+0.1%),  particularly for upstream activities where the composition of the gas\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nsent to the emergency flares at the Val d'Agri Oil Center was updated, a gas that has a higher percentage of hydrogen sulphide (H 2 S).\n\nIn 2020, Eni updated the assessment of exposure to biodiversity risk to the R&M, Versalis and EniPower operational sites, and to the concessions under development or exploitation in the upstream sector, in order to identify where Eni activities fall, even only partially, within protected areas 37 or key biodiversity areas (KBA) 38 . An analysis of the mapping of the R&M, Versalis and EniPower operational sites showed that there is overlap, even partial, with protected areas or KBAs at 11 sites, all located in Italy; another 18 sites in 7 Countries (Italy, Austria, Hungary, France, Germany, Switzerland and the United Kingdom) border with protected areas or KBAs, i.e. located at a distance of less than 1 km. As regards the upstream sector, 74 concessions overlap partially with protected areas or  KBAs,  30  of  which  located  in  6  Countries  (Italy,  Nigeria, Pakistan, USA/Alaska, Egypt and the United Kingdom) have operations in the overlapping area. The number of sites and concessions overlapping protected areas/KBAs is in line with 2019 results. In addition, a similar mapping was carried out in 2020 for R&M pipelines in Italy, which showed that about 10% of  the  total  length  of  the  pipelines  crosses  (under  surface) protected areas and KBAs, for stretches with a total length of 118 km and 146 km respectively. In general, for all the Business Lines, the greatest exposure in Italy and Europe is to the protected areas of the Natura 2000 Network 39 , which is widespread across Europe. In no case, in Italy or abroad, there is any overlapping of operational activities with natural sites belonging to the UNESCO WHS 40 ; only one upstream site 41 is located near a WHS natural site (Mount Etna) but there are no operational activities within the protected area.\n\n(36) Specifically, in 2020, 10% of hazardous waste disposed of by Eni was recovered/recycled, 4% was subjected to chemical/physical/biological treatment, 29% was incinerated, 2% was disposed of in landfill and the remaining 55% was sent for other types of disposal (including transfer to temporary storage plants prior to final disposal). With regard to non-hazardous waste, 14% was recovered/recycled, 50% was subjected to chemical/physical/biological treatment, 3% was disposed of in landfills and the remaining 33% was sent for other types of disposal (including transfer to temporary storage plants prior to final disposal and incineration of small quantity).

It is a network of environmental habitats throughout the territory of the European Union, set up pursuant to Directive 79/409/EEC of April 2 1979 on conservation of wild birds and Directive 92/43/EEC \"Habitat\". (40) WHS, World Heritage Site.\n\n(38) Source: World Database of Key Biodiversity Areas. KBAs (Key Biodiversity Areas) are sites that contribute significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity, on land, in freshwater or in the seas. These are identified through national processes by local stakeholders using a set of globally agreed scientific criteria. The KBAs analyzed consist of two subsets: 1) Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas; 2) Alliance for Zero Extinction Sites.\n\n(41) Moreover, although it is not included among the consolidated entities, the Zubair field (Iraq) is located near the Ahwar site classified as a mixed WHS site (natural and cultural). In this case too, no operational infrastructure or activity falls within this protected area.",

This commitment, based on the dignity of each human being and on the responsibility of the Company to contribute to the well-being of individuals and communities in the Countries in which it operates, is set out in the Eni's Statement on Respect for Human Rights approved in December 2018 by Eni's Board of Directors (BoD). The document highlights the priority areas on which this commitment is focused and on which Eni exercises in-depth due diligence, according to an approach developed in line with the United Nations Guiding Principles on  Business  and  Human  Rights  (UNGPs) 42 and  pursuing continuous improvement. These aspects are described within  a  dedicated  report,  Eni  for  Human  Rights,  published  for the first time in December 2019, and updated during 2020 43 , which  provides  a  full  representation  of  the  management model adopted by Eni on the issue and the activities carried out in recent years, using the UNGP Reporting Framework to report commitments and results.\n\nHuman rights are one of the areas in which Eni's Sustainability and Scenarios Committee (SSC) performs consultative and advisory functions for the BoD. In 2020, the SSC reviewed the activities carried out during the year and analyzed the result\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nachieved in the fourth edition of the Corporate Human Rights Benchmark (CHRB), in which Eni confirmed its leadership position,  ranking  first  ex  aequo  with  only  one  other  Company among the 199 assessed.\n\nIn 2020, Eni further strengthened the process of awarding management incentives linked to human rights performance, assigning  specific  objectives  to  all  managers  reporting  directly  to  the CEO and  other  management  levels.  In  addition,  Eni  adopted  a new internal procedure outlining the human rights due diligence process as required by the UNGPs and updated its Code of Ethics. With regard to training, following on with the internal human rights awareness process launched in 2016, specific e-learning courses dedicated to the functions most in managing human rights issues were provided in 2020 in order to create a common and shared language and culture throughout the Company and to improve the understanding of the possible impacts of the business on human rights.\n\nMoreover, since 2006 an internal procedure has been in place, also  included  in  the  Anti-Corruption  Regulatory  Instruments, which regulates the process for receiving, analyzing and processing any whistleblowing reports, also related to human rights, sent by or transmitted from stakeholders, Eni's people and other third parties, even confidentially or anonymously.

The 'salient human rights issues' identified by Eni's are 13, grouped into 4 categories: human rights (i) in the workplace (see chapter People); (ii) in the communities hosting Eni activities; (iii) in business relations (with suppliers, contractors and other business partners); (iv) in security services.\n\nEni is committed to preventing possible negative impacts on the human rights of individuals and host communities resulting from the implementation of industrial projects. To this  end,  in  2018,  Eni  adopted  a  risk-based  model  that  uses elements related to the operating context, such as risk indices of the data provider Verisk Maplecroft, and project characteristics, in order to classify upstream business projects according to potential human rights risks and to identify appropriate management measures. Higher-risk  projects  are  specifically investigated  through  a  Human  Rights  Impact  Assessment (HRIA) to identify  measures to  prevent  potential  impacts  on human rights and manage the existing ones. Consistent with the evolution towards a just transition and its commitment to decarbonization, in 2020, Eni also conducted an in-depth assessment of the Energy Evolution business activities, aimed at identifying the most relevant human rights issues of the projects for the production of energy from renewable sources, following which a specific action plan was prepared. In some Countries, such as Norway, Australia and Alaska, Eni operates in areas where indigenous peoples are present, towards which it has adopted specific policies to protect their rights, culture and traditions and to promote their free, prior and informed consultation. During 2020, Eni approved and published a Policy dedicated to Indigenous Peoples in Alaska 44 , referring to the business activities carried out by Eni US Operating in that area. Respect  for  human  rights  in  the supply  chain is  ensured through the adoption of transparent, impartial, consistent and non-discriminatory conduct in the selection of suppliers, the evaluation of offers and the verification of contractual activities (see chapter Suppliers).\n\nIn 2020, the Supplier Code of Conduct was published, which sets out the principles contained in the Code of Ethics for suppliers that are required to sign it during the qualification or assignment of contracts, committing to respect Eni's values and to recognize and protect the value of people and prevent any type of discrimination.\n\nTo support human rights due diligence, Eni has also introduced a new risk-based model to segment qualified suppliers according to a potential risk of human rights violations in consideration of Country and product risk level. The assessment of these risks is based on the application of an objective and transpar-\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n163\n\nent methodology, which provides for the classification not only of the geographical context but also the evaluation of the peculiarities of the activity carried out, using information verified during  the  qualification  process,  which  ascertained  both  the complexity  (e.g.  skills  required,  workforce  employed,  equipment and materials used) and the relevance in HSE terms of the reference product sector. Suppliers assessed in the human rights area carry out activities directly related to Eni's needs, both  industrial  (including  electrical  and  instrumental  assembly) and civil (including cleaning services). The model makes it possible to apply control measures differentiated on the basis of the level of risk, using criteria inspired by international standards, such as the SA 8000 standard.\n\nFurther actions to counteract forms of modern slavery and human trafficking and to prevent the exploitation of minerals associated with human rights violations in the supply chain are discussed respectively in the 'Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement' 45 and in the 'Position on conflict minerals' 46 .\n\nWith reference to Business Partners in upstream contracts, Eni adopts ad hoc clauses for the respect of human rights. Eni  manages  its security  operations in  accordance  with international principles, including the Voluntary Principles on  Security  &  Human  Rights,  adhered  to  by  Eni  in  2020. In May 2020, Eni was admitted as an 'Engaged Corporate Participant' to the Voluntary Principles Initiative (VPI), the multi stakeholder initiative dedicated to the respect of human rights in the management of Security operations that involves governments, companies and NGOs. In line with its commitment, Eni has designed a coherent set of rules and tools to ensure that: (i) contractual terms comprise provisions on the respect for human rights; (ii) the providers of security forces are selected also according to human rights criteria; (iii) security operators and supervisors receive adequate  training  on  the  respect  for  human  rights;    (iv)  the events considered most at risk are managed in accordance with international standards. Moreover, in 2020, Eni launched the human rights due diligence model, aimed at identifying the risk of negative impacts on human rights in relation to security activities and evaluating the use of preventive and/ or mitigation measures. In this regard, the 'Security & Human Rights' action plan was drawn up, which envisaged: (i) sample review of the security contracts in place in the first 10 Countries resulting from the risk-based model, in order to verify the presence or absence of human rights clauses; (ii) verification of the allocation/use of security assets and services made available to the public and private security forces operating at Eni Pakistan sites; (iii) implementation of a training and information workshop on 'Security & Human Rights' in Angola.\n\n- (46) Compliance with US SEC regulations.\n- (45) In accordance with the English Modern Slavery Act 2015 and, from this year, the Australian Commonwealth Modern Slavery Act 2018.",

Eni meets this commitment by promoting its own values with its suppliers and involving them in the risk prevention process. For this purpose, as part of the procurement process, Eni: (i) subjects all  suppliers  to  qualification  and  due  diligence  processes  to verify  their  professionalism,  technical-operational  skills,  ethical, economic and financial reliability and to minimize the risks inherent in operating with third parties; (ii) requires all suppliers to sign the Supplier Code of Conduct with which they undertake to recognize and protect the value of people and prevent any type of discrimination; (iii) monitors compliance with these commitments, to ensure that suppliers maintain the qualification requirements over time; (iv) if critical issues arise, requires the implementation of improvement actions or, if they do not meet the minimum standards of acceptability, limits or inhibits the invitation  to  tender.  During  2020,  Eni  launched  the  JUST (Join Us in a Sustainable Transition) initiative, aimed at involving suppliers in the fair and sustainable energy transition path, enhancing the aspects of environmental protection, economic development and social growth. In particular, Eni has: (i) extended  to  all  qualification  processes  an  assessment  related to the respect of human rights; (ii) launched the 'Sustainable Transition and Supply Chain' observatory to collect suppliers' sustainability experiences; (iii) introduced sustainability criteria and rewarding mechanisms in tenders to encourage suppliers' best practices; (iv) launched an experimental workshop with qualified  companies  in  the  chemical,  physical  and  biological treatment of liquid waste sector to encourage the adoption of circular economy models and/or sustainability initiatives; (v)  supported  the  JUST  initiative  through  external  and  internal communication activities, conveying the main objectives through eniSpace, the platform for collaboration and communication between Eni and the supply market, with the aim of reaffirming Eni's commitment to the sustainability of its supply chain. In addition, Eni has started the development, in collaboration with Boston Consulting Group (BCG) and Google Cloud,\n\n## KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS\n\n| Suppliers subjected to assessment on social responsibility aspects   | (number)   |   5,655 |   5,906 | 5,184   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| of which: suppliers with criticalities/areas for improvement         |            |     828 |     898 | 1,008   |\n| of which: suppliers with whom Eni has terminated the relations       |            |     124 |      96 | 95      |\n| New suppliers assessed using social criteria                         | (%)        |     100 |     100 | 100     |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n165\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nof Open-es, an open digital platform dedicated to all suppliers in the energy sector with the aim of sharing and enhancing information, best practices and sustainability models along the supply chain and encouraging the entire supply chain towards the sector's energy transition. Finally, in the context of the COVID-19 health emergency, Eni has set up a task force to ensure the safe continuity of contractors' activities and at the same time, ensure the resilience of the supply chain during the crisis, so as to be able to guarantee a safe and timely restart after the emergency situation. Measures activated include: (i) the renegotiation of contracts, seeking mutual benefits such as the extension of their duration in exchange for greater flexibility and efficiency and identifying contractual forms capable of  sustaining,  where  possible,  employment  levels;  (ii)  measures to protect suppliers at greater financial risk, for example by  rebalancing  payment  terms;  (iii)  tendering  strategies  to encourage the opening of the market also to small and medium-sized enterprises or, where not feasible, favouring joint ventures between small/medium-sized enterprises.\n\n## PERFORMANCE METRICS AND COMMENTS\n\nDuring 2020, 5,655 suppliers (including all the new ones) were subject to checks and assessments with reference to environmental and social sustainability aspects (including health, safety, environment, human rights, anti-corruption and compliance). Potential critical issues and/or areas for improvement were identified for 15% of the suppliers audited (828). Of these, only a portion, equal to 124, received a negative evaluation during the qualification phase or was subject to new preventive measures (attention status with clearance, suspension or revocation of qualification) or confirmation of the pre-existing preventive  measures. The identified criticalities  (resulting  in  the request for the implementation of improvement plans) during the  qualification  process  or  Human  Rights  assessment  are related to HSE issues or violations of human rights, such as health and safety regulations, violation of the Code of Ethics, corruption, environmental crimes.\n\n2020\n\n2019\n\n2018",

        "page_content": "## Transparency, anti-corruption and tax strategy\n\nDemonstrating its commitment to the 10 United Nations Principles for Responsible Business, in 2020, Eni was confirmed in the Global Compact LEAD. These principles, including the repudiation of corruption, are reflected in Eni's Code of Ethics, which is distributed to all employees at the time of hiring, and in Model 231 of Eni SpA. Moreover, since 2009, Eni has designed and developed the Anti-Corruption Compliance Program, in compliance with the applicable provisions in force and international conventions and taking into account guidance and best practices, as well as the policies adopted by leading international organizations. It is an organic system of rules and controls to prevent corrupt practices. All Eni's subsidiaries, in Italy and abroad, must adopt, by resolution of their BoD 52 , all the anti-corruption regulatory instruments issued by Eni SpA. In addition, companies and entities in which it holds a non-controlling interest are encouraged to comply with the standards set forth in internal anti-corruption regulations by adopting and maintaining an adequate internal control system consistent with the requirements of the relevant laws.\n\nEni's  Anti-Corruption  Compliance  Program  has  evolved  over the years with the aim of continuous improvement; in January 2017, Eni SpA was the first Italian Company to achieve the ISO 37001:2016 'Anti-bribery Management Systems' certification. In order to maintain this certification, Eni cyclically undergoes surveillance and recertification audits, which have always ended with a positive outcome. In addition, in order to guarantee the effectiveness of the Anti-Corruption Compliance Program, Eni, through its anti-corruption unit, supports its subsidiaries in Italy and abroad, providing specialized assistance in the activity of assessing the reliability  of  potential  counterparties  at  risk  (due  diligence),  the management of any critical issues/red flags that emerge and the development of the related contractual safeguards. In particular, specific  anti-corruption  clauses  are  included  in  contracts  with counterparties, which also provide for a commitment to view and abide by the principles contained in Eni's Anti-Corruption regulations. The main anti-corruption activities and information on the related regulatory instruments issued during the reporting period are the subject of periodic reports addressed to Eni's internal control bodies and the Chief Financial Officer.\n\nEni also implements an anti-corruption training program, both through e-learning and with classroom events, general workshops and job specific training. The workshops offer an overview of the anti-corruption laws applicable to Eni, the risks that could result from their infringement for natural and legal persons and the Anti-Corruption Compliance Program adopted to address these risks. Generally, the workshops are accompanied by job specific training, or training for professional areas particularly at risk in terms of corruption.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn order to optimize the identification of the recipients of the various training initiatives, a methodology has been defined for the systematic segmentation of Eni's people based on specific corruption risk drivers such as Country, qualification, and professional area. In addition, periodic information and updating activities continued through the preparation of short information briefs on compliance, including any anti-corruption issues.\n\nIn 2020, on the occasion of their inauguration, the members of the Board of Directors of Eni SpA were shown the key elements of the Anti-Corruption  Compliance  Programme  for  training  purposes, also in terms of its consistency with international best practices. In  addition,  the  anti-corruption  training  program  continued  for some categories of Eni's third parties with the aim of making them aware of the issue of corruption and in particular, on how to recognize corrupt conduct and how to prevent the violation of anti-corruption laws, in the context of their professional activity. Eni's  experience  in  the  field  of  anti-corruption  also  matures through continuous participation in international conferences, events and working groups, which represent a tool for Eni to grow and promote and disseminate its values. In this regard, in 2020, Eni actively participated in the World Economic Forum's Partnering  Against  Corruption  Initiative  (PACI)  and  the  Oil  & Gas ABC Compliance Attorney Group (a discussion group on anti-corruption issues in the Oil & Gas sector).\n\nIn order to assess the adequacy and effective operation of the Anti-Corruption Compliance Program, as part of the integrated  audit  plan  approved  annually  by  the  BoD,  Eni  carries  out specific checks on relevant activities, with audits dedicated to analyses of processes and companies, identified based on the riskiness of the Country in which they operate and materiality, as well as third parties considered to be high risk, where required contractually.\n\nMoreover, since 2006 Eni has issued an internal procedure, aligned with national and international best practices as well as with the Italian law (L.179/2017), in order to manage the process of receiving, analyzing and processing whistleblowing reports received, even in confidential or anonymous form, by Eni SpA and its subsidiaries in Italy and abroad. This internal procedure allows anyone, employees and third parties, to report  facts  relating  to  the  Internal  Control  and  Risk  Management System and concerning behaviors in violation of the Code of Ethics, any laws, regulations, provisions of authorities, internal regulations, Model 231 or Compliance Models for foreign subsidiaries, that may cause damage or prejudice to Eni, even if only to its public image.

True to the commitment to better governance and greater transparency in the extraction sector, which is crucial to foster responsible use of resources and prevent corruption, Eni takes part in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) since 2005. In this context, Eni actively participates both at local level, through the Multi-Stakeholder Groups in the member Countries, and in the Board's initiatives at international level.\n\nIn accordance with Italian law no. 208/2015, Eni prepares the 'Country-by-Country Report' required by Action 13 of the 'Base erosion and profit shifting - BEPS' project, promoted by the OECD with the sponsorship of the G-20, whose objective is to have the profits of multinational companies declared in the jurisdictions where the economic activities that generate them are carried out, in proportion to the value generated. With a view to fostering fiscal transparency for the benefit of all interested stakeholders, this report is published voluntarily by Eni, although there are no regulatory obligations in this regard 55 .

Finally, anticipating by two years the reporting requirements on transparency of payments to States in the exercise of extraction activities introduced by the EU Directive  2013/34  EU  (Accounting  Directive),  Eni  had  begun  in 2015 to provide disclosure on a voluntary basis of a series of summary data on cash flows paid to States in which it conducts hydrocarbon exploration and production activities.\n\n## PERFORMANCE METRICS AND COMMENTS\n\nDuring 2020, 31 audits were carried out in 21 Countries, with anti-corruption checks that confirmed the overall adequacy and effective operation of the Anti-Corruption Compliance Program. In 2020, the ascertained cases of corruption 57 relating to Eni SpA amounted to 0; for ongoing proceedings see the section Legal Proceedings on pp. 264 and following.\n\nBeginning  in  March  2020,  due  to  the  emergency  related  to\n\nCOVID-19, planned classroom training events were conducted in distance mode. In addition, in 2020, the online training continued on anti-corruption issues according to the risk-based methodology started in 2019, aimed at the entire corporate's population. Regarding the commitment with EITI, Eni follows the activities conducted at international level and contributes annually to preparation of the Reports in member Countries; additionally, as a member, Eni takes part in the activities of the Multi Stakeholder Groups in Congo, Ghana, Timor Leste, and the United Kingdom. In Kazakhstan, Indonesia, Mozambique, Nigeria and Mexico,  Eni's  subsidiaries  interface  with  the  local  EITI  Multi Stakeholder Groups through the industry associations present in the Countries.\n\n2020\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\n- (53) Please see https://www.eni.com/assets/documents/Tax-strategy\\_ENG.pdf.\n- (55) For more details please see the most recent edition of Country-by-Country Report published in November 2020 related to 2019:\n- (54) Please see: http://www.oecd.org/daf/inv/mne/48004323.pdf.\n- https://www.eni.com/assets/documents/eng/just-transition/2019/Country-by-Country-2019-ENG.pdf\n- https://eiti.org/news/extractives-companies-champion-tax-transparency\n- (56) EITI pointed out Eni and Shell as companies pionerring Country-by-Country reporting among Oil and Gas majors, see:\n- (57) Data include investigations carried out on any whisteblowing reports.",

The unpredictable and rapid spread of the pandemic has destabilized health, social and economic systems all over the world. However, at the same time, it has shown how, when faced with great challenges, forces need to be joined and actions implemented together, making the most of common factors with the various partners involved in the areas of interest: from International Organizations to Development Banks, from National Institutions to the private sector, from Universities to Research Centres, from Cooperation Bodies  to  Civil  Society  Organizations  present  in  the  territories  in which Eni operates, with the common goal of fostering local sustainable development in the innate respect for the dignity of every person. Starting from the analysis of the local socio-economic  context,  which  accompanies  the  various  business project phases in order to ensure greater efficiency and systematicity in the decision-making approach, from the time of license acquisition to decommissioning, Eni adopts tools and methodologies consistent with the main international standards to meet the needs of local populations. These activities, defined in specific Local Development Programmes (LDPs) in line with the United Nations 2030 Agenda, the National Development Plans, the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs) and the commitments under the  Paris  Agreement  (Nationally  Determined  Contributions  NDCs), include five lines of action:\n\n- \uf0da Local development projects : contribution to the socio-economic development of local communities, in accordance with national legislation and development plans, also based on the knowledge acquired. These initiatives are aimed at improving access to off-grid energy and clean cooking, economic diversification (e.g. agricultural projects, micro-credit, infrastructure interventions) and forest protection and conservation, education and vocational training, access to water and sanitation and support of health services/systems, as well as improving the health status of vulnerable groups;\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \uf0da Local Content: generation of added value through the transfer  of  skills  and  know-how,  activation  of  labour  along  the local supply chain and the implementation of development projects;\n- \uf0da Land  management: optimal  land  management  starting from the assessment of the impacts deriving from the acquisition of land on which Eni's activities are carried out in order to find possible alternatives and mitigation measures; Eni undertakes to evaluate possible project alternatives with the aim of pursuing the well-being of local communities;\n- \uf0da Stakeholder engagement: enhancement of the relationship with stakeholders based on the sharing of values, mutual understanding and attention;\n- \uf0da Human Rights: assessment of potential or actual human rights impacts attributable - directly or indirectly - to Eni's activities through Human Rights Impact Assessments, definition of related prevention or mitigation measures, in line with the United Nations Guiding Principles (UNGPs) and promotion of human rights through the local development projects mentioned above.\n\nThe definition of Local Development Programme implies the commitment of Eni in the front line on site and alongside other development players to contribute to the sustainable development of Countries. Many of the partnerships developed by Eni with International Organizations and - more generally - of development cooperations move in this direction, such as the agreements signed in 2020: in Ghana with the local office of the World Bank and the Ghana Alliance for Clean Cookstoves and Fuels (GHACCO) to improve cooking systems and reduce forest exploitation, in Angola with USAID 58 as part of economic diversification with a focus on women's empowerment, and in Kenya with the E4Impact Foundation for the development of local entrepreneurship. In addition, cooperation agreements were  signed  in  2020  with  some  Civil  Society  Organizations such as AMREF, AVSI, CUAMM and VIS 59 .\n\nIn the various business design phases, in line with internationally  recognized  standard  principles/methodologies,  Eni  has developed:\n\n- \uf0da analysis tools to better understand the reference context and appropriately address local development projects, such as Social Context analysis\n\n<!-- image -->",

In Asia, approximately \u20ac28.2 million was spent, mainly on economic diversification, in particular for the development and maintenance of  infrastructures.  In  Italy,  \u20ac16.9  million  was  spent.  Overall, approximately \u20ac41.8 million was invested in infrastructure development activities, of which \u20ac20.8 million in Asia, \u20ac16.3 million in Africa, \u20ac4.4 million in Central and South America. Key projects implemented in 2020 include initiatives to encourage: (i)  access  to  water  through  desalination  plants  in  Iraq and wells fed by photovoltaic systems in North-East Nigeria; (ii)  access  to  electricity  in  Libya  and  Nigeria;  (iii)  economic diversification  both  in  the  agricultural  sector  in  Congo  and\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n169\n\nNigeria and to support local and youth entrepreneurship in Nigeria and Ghana; (iv) access to education with activities for both students and trainers in Angola, Mozambique, Ghana, Iraq and Mexico. As part of the interventions implemented in response to the health needs of the populations of the Countries in which it is present, in 2020, Eni supported 22 initiatives against the COVID-19 pandemic, in 14 foreign Countries, aimed in particular at local vulnerable groups, hospitals, health institutions and ministries of health, providing: ventilators and respirators; intensive care equipment and other medical equipment; personal protective equipment. In addition, the emergency response plan included: (i) implementation of community awareness campaigns and 'community engagement' actions aimed at preventing the spread of the virus; (ii)  creation of access points and distribution of safe water equipped with soap for hand washing; (iii) social protection and food assistance measures such as the distribution of meals for families, vulnerable groups and school canteens; (iv) measures to support the education system through the creation of widespread learning spaces and the distribution of educational materials. In addition to its support to fight the pandemic, Eni has carried out 29 initiatives in 13 Countries to improve the health status of the populations of partner Countries as an essential prerequisite for socio-economic development, through the strengthening of the skills of health personnel, the construction and rehabilitation of health facilities and their equipment, access to drinking water, information, education and awareness-raising on health issues among the populations involved.\n\nLastly, in 2020, with the aim of assessing the potential impact of projects on the health of the communities involved, Eni completed 4 HIAs (Health Impact Assessment), of which 3 were integrated  ESHIA  studies  (Environmental  and  Social  Health Impact Assessment).\n\nDuring  2020,  107  grievances 62 were  received,  of  which  53% were resolved and closed. The complaints mainly concerned: management of environmental aspects, employment development, land management.\n\n## KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS\n\n|                              |             | 2020   | 2020                                  | 2019 2018   | 2019 2018   |\n|------------------------------|-------------|--------|---------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n|                              |             | Total  | of which fully  consolidated entities | Total       | Total       |\n| Local development investment | (\u20ac million) | 96.1   | 80.4                                  | 95.3        | 94.8        |\n| of which: infrastructure     |             | 41.8   | 38.8                                  | 43.4        | 32.4        |\n\n(60) The ELCE (Eni Local Content Evaluation) Model was developed by Eni and validated by the Polytechnic of Milan to assess the direct, indirect and induced effects generated by Eni's activities at a local level in the areas in which it operates.

The material aspects include the priority issues relevant to all  of  Eni's  major  stakeholders,  whether  external  or  internal, through  the  multi-stakeholder  approach  and  identify  the  key challenges and opportunities of the entire chain of activities for creating value in the long term.\n\n## Identification of relevant aspects\n\nThe analysis has been updated from last year's material aspects to which the priorities reported by ESMA 63 on non-financial reporting have been added.\n\n## Analysis of internal and external priorities\n\nThe materiality of the topics identified is determined based on the priority analyses:\n\n- \uf0da the relevance of stakeholders and their requests, mapped and weighed both through a dedicated platform (Stakeholder  Management System - SMS), which supports the management of relations with local stakeholders, and through interviews with the departments responsible for managing\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nrelations with specific stakeholders at central level on an ongoing basis throughout the year, through meetings, consultations, initiatives, workshops, etc.;\n\n- \uf0da the ESG risks resulting from the Integrated Risk Management (IRM) process, which also takes into account the evidences provided by external providers, including RepRisk 64 . These risks are assessed considering also potential environmental, social, health and safety and reputational impacts;\n- \uf0da the  scenario  elements  -  determined  based  on  the  topics that were addressed during the Sustainability and Scenario Committee (SSC) meetings in 2020.\n\nThe combination of these analyses allows for the inclusion of priority issues for both relevant stakeholders and the Company itself.\n\n## Sharing and validation with the governing body\n\nThe management involved in the non-financial reporting process validated the material aspects, which, in turn, were presented to the SSC and the Board of Directors, together with the relevant analysis.\n\nBelow are the 2020 material topics associated with the SDGs on which Eni's activities have a direct or indirect impact.\n\n## 2020 MATERIAL TOPICS\n\n| CARBON NEUTRALITY BY 2050                              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                | SDGs                                                |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| COMBATING CLIMATE CHANGE                               | GHG emissions, Promotion of natural gas,  Renewables, Biofuels and Green Chemistry,  CO2 storage solutions                                                                                                     | 7 - 9 - 12 - 13 - 15 - 17                           |\n| OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                                                     |\n| PEOPLE                                                 | Employment, Diversity  & Inclusion and Training                                                                                                                                                                | 4 - 5 - 8 - 10                                      |\n| HEALTH                                                 | Health emergency management Occupational health and local communities' health                                                                                                                                  | 3 - 6 - 8                                           |\n| SAFETY                                                 | People safety and asset integrity                                                                                                                                                                              | 3 - 8                                               |\n| ENVIRONMENT                                            | Water resources, biodiversity, oil spill, air quality, remediation and waste                                                                                                                                   | 3 - 6 - 9 - 11 -12 - 14 - 15                        |\n| HUMAN RIGHTS                                           | Rights of workers and local communities  Supply chain and Security                                                                                                                                             | 1 - 4 - 8 - 10 - 16 - 17                            |\n| INTEGRITY IN BUSINESS MANAGEMENT                       | Transparency and Anti-Corruption                                                                                                                                                                               | 16 - 17                                             |\n| ALLIANCES FOR DEVELOPMENT                              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                                                     |\n| ACCESS TO ENERGY                                       | Access to energy                                                                                                                                                                                               | 7 - 17                                              |\n| LOCAL DEVELOPMENT THROUGH  PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS | Economic diversification;

The Consolidated Non-Financial Information was prepared in accordance with the Legislative Decree 254/2016 transposing the European Directive  on  Non-Financial  Information,  and  the  'Sustainability Reporting Standards', published by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI Standards), with a level of adherence 'in accordance Core' and has been subject to a limited review by the independent Company, which is also the auditor of Eni's Annual Report as of December 31, 2020. All GRI's indicators in the Content Index refer to the version of the GRI Standards published in 2016, with the exception of those of: (i) 'Standard 403: Occupational Health and Safety', (ii) 'Standard 303: Water and Effluents' - which refer to the 2018 edition - and (iii) 'Standard 207: Tax' of 2019. In addition, the recommendations  reported  by  ESMA  on  non-financial  statements  as well as the set of core metrics defined by WEF in the September 2020 White Paper 'Measuring Stakeholder Capitalism - Towards Common Metrics and Consistent Reporting of Sustainable Value Creation' were taken into account in drafting the document.\n\nKey Performance Indicators. KPIs are selected based on the the topics identified as most significant, are collected on an annual basis according to the consolidation scope of the reference year and refer to the period 2018-2020. In general, trends in data and performance indicators are also calculated using decimal places not shown in the document. The data for the year 2020 are the best possible estimate with the data available at the time of preparation of this report. In addition, some data published in previous years may be subject to restatement in this edition for  one  of  the  following  reasons:  refinement/change in estimation or calculation methods, significant changes in the consolidation scope, or if significant updated information becomes available. If a restatement is made, the\n\nreasons for it are appropriately disclosed in the text. Most of the KPIs presented are collected and aggregated automatically through the use of specific Company software.\n\nBoundary. The boundary of the key performance indicators is aligned with the objectives set by the Company and represents the potential impact of the activities Eni manages. In particular, for KPIs relating to safety, the environment and climate, the boundary is made up of companies with HSE impacts 65 and includes:  (i)  companies  in  joint  operations,  jointly  controlled or associated companies in which Eni has control over operations and (ii) Eni's subsidiaries with HSE risk 66 . With regard to health, the data consider the companies with health impacts and companies under joint operation or joint control or associates in which Eni has the control of the operations (with the sole exception of data relating to occupational illness reports, which refer to fully consolidated companies only). The boundary of data relating to anti-corruption training, local development investments and the number of Countries in which Eni supports EITI relates to the reporting companies in which these activities are conducted. The boundary of data referred to whistleblowing reports relate to Eni SpA and its subsidiaries. The boundary of data referred to audit actions on risk of corruption activities relate to: Eni SpA, subsidiaries controlled directly and indirectly (excluding listed subsidiaries that have their  own  internal  audit  department),  associated  companies, and  based  on  specific  agreements  third  parties  deemed  to have a higher risk, as provided for under the contracts entered with  Eni.  Comments  on  performance  relate  to  these  boundaries. In addition to these Key Performance Indicators, there is an additional view only for 2020 where the data of the fully consolidated companies are presented. Finally, the indicators relating to people, human rights and suppliers refer to the data of fully consolidated companies.\n\n(65) In addition to fully consolidated companies, the boundary includes the following non fully consolidated companies: Agiba Petroleum Co; Card\u00f3n IV SA; Costiero Gas Livorno SpA; Esacontrol SA; Eni Abu Dhabi Refining & Trading Services BV; Eni Gas Transport Services Srl; Eni Iran BV; Eni Ukraine LLC; EniProgetti Egypt Ltd; Groupment Sonatrach-Agip; Industria Siciliana Acido Fosforico - ISAF - SpA - in liquidation; Karachaganak Petroleum Operating BV; Mellitah Oil & Gas BV; Mozambique Rovuma Venture SpA; Oleodotto del Reno SA; OOO ''Eni-Nefto''; Ol\u00e8oduc du Rhone SA; Petrobel Belayim Petroleum Co; Servizi Fondo Bombole Metano SpA; Societ\u00e0 EniPower Ferrara Srl; Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Energies Renouvelables Eni-ETAP SA; Tecnoesa SA; Versalis Pacific (India) Private Limited; V\u00e5r Energi AS. (66) Based on the type of activity performed and the number of employees, Eni SpA subsidiaries with HSE impacts (significant and limited) are included in the scope of consolidation, while those with no HSE impacts are excluded.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The capacity is considered 'installed' once the power plants are in operation or the mechanical completion phase has been reached. The mechanical completion represents the final construction stage excluding the grid connection.\n\n## PEOPLE, HEALTH AND SAFETY\n\nINDUSTRIAL RELATIONS\n\nRegarding industrial relations, the minimum notice period for operational changes is in line with the provisions of the laws in force and the trade union agreements signed in the Countries in which Eni operates.\n\nSENIORITY\n\nAverage number of years worked by employees at Eni and its subsidiaries.\n\nTRAINING HOURS\n\nLOCAL SENIOR AND MIDDLE MANAGERS ABROAD\n\nHours provided to Eni's employees through training courses managed and carried out by Eni Corporate University (classroom and remote) and through activities carried out by the organizational units of Eni's Business areas/Companies independently, also through on-the-job training. Average training hours are calculated as total training hours divided by the average number of employees in the year.\n\nNumber of local senior managers + middle managers (employees born in the Country in which their main working activity is based) divided by total employment abroad.\n\nThe indicator refers to GHG Scope 1+2+3 emissions associated with the value chain of the energy products sold by Eni, including both those deriving from own productions and those purchased from third parties, accounted for on an equity basis, net of offset. Differently from Scope 3 end-use emissions, which Eni reports based on upstream production, the Net GHG Lifecycle Emissions indicator considers a much wider perimeter, including Scope 1, 2 and Scope 3 emissions referred to the whole value chain of energy products sold by Eni, thus including Scope 3 end-use emissions associated to gas purchased by third parties and petroleum products sold by Eni.\n\n- \uf0da R&M: indicator focused on emissions related to traditional and biorefineries. Denominator refers to refinery throughputs (raw and semi-finished materials).\n\nScope 1: direct GHG emissions are those deriving from sourcaes associated to the Company's assets (e.g. combustion, flaring, fugitive and venting), and include CO 2 , CH 4 e N 2 O; the Global Warming Potential used for conversion into CO 2 equivalent is 25 for CH 4 and 298 for N 2 O. Contributions of biogenic CO 2 emissions are not included.\n\nScope 2: are the indirect GHG emissions related to the generation of electricity, steam and heat purchased from third parties. Scope 3: indirect GHG emissions associated with the value chain of Eni's products, which involve an analysis by category of activity. In the Oil and Gas sector, the most significant category is that related to the use of energy products (end-use), which Eni calculates according to internationally consolidated methodologies (GHG Protocol and IPIECA), based on upstream production.\n\n- \uf0da Upstream: indicator focused on emissions associated to development and production of hydrocarbons. Denominator refers to gross operated production.\n- \uf0da EniPower: indicator focused on emissions related to electricity and steam production of thermoelectric plants. Denominator refers to equivalent electricity produced (excluding Bolgiano cogeneration plant).\n\nThe indicator represents GHG emissions (Scope 1 and Scope 2 in tonCO 2 eq.) of the main industrial activities operated by Eni divided by the productions (converted by homogeneity into barrels of oil equivalent using Eni's average conversion factors) of the single businesses of reference, thus measuring their degree of operating efficiency in a decarbonization scenario. In particular, the following specifications apply:\n\n- \uf0da R&M: inckudes only refiniries;\n- \uf0da Upstream: includes the hydrocarbon production and electricity plants;\n- \uf0da Chemicals: includes all plants;\n\nDifferently from the other emission intensity indicators, which refer to single businesses and consider only GHG Scope 1 emissions, the operating efficiency index effectively measures Eni's commitment for reducing its GHG emission intensity by including also Scope 2 emissions.\n\n- \uf0da EniPower: includes thermoelectric plants except for Bolgiano cogeneration plant.\n\nThe refining energy intensity index represents the total amount of energy actually used in the reference year among the various refinery processing plants, divided by the corresponding value of preset standard consumption values for each processing plant. To allow comparison over the years, 2009 data is taken as a reference (100%). For other sectors, the index represents the ratio between significant energy consumption associated to operated plants and the related production.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEmployees covered by collective bargaining: are those employees whose employment relationship is governed by collective agreements or contracts, whether national, industry, Company or site. This is the only KPI dedicated to people that considers role-based employees (Company with which the employee enters into the employment contract). All others, including indicators on training, are calculated according to the utilisation method (Company where the work is actually done). It should be noted that, using this second method, the two aspects (role companies and service) could coincide.",

The waste disposal method is communicated to Eni by the third party authorised for disposal.\n\nRatio between the number of new hires + resolutions of permanent contracts and permanent employment for the previous year.\n\nEni uses a large number of contractors to carry out the activities within its own sites.\n\nHigh-consequence work-related injuries rate: injuries at work with days of absence exceeding 180 days or resulting in total or permanent disability. Numerator: number of injuries at work with serious consequences; denominator: hours worked in the same period. Result of the ratio multiplied by 1,000,000.\n\nTRIR: total recordable injury rate (injuries leading to days of absence, medical treatments and cases of work limitations). Numerator: number of total recordable injuries; denominator: hours worked in the same period. Result of the ratio multiplied by 1,000,000.\n\nNear miss: an incidental event, the origin, execution and potential effect of which is accidental in nature, but which is however different from an accident only in that the result has not proved damaging, due to luck or favourable circumstances, or to the mitigating intervention of technical and/or organizational protection systems. Accidental events that do not turn into accidents or injuries are therefore considered to be near misses. The main hazards detected in 2020 in Eni concern:\n\n- \uf0da Load lifting;\n- \uf0da HGV maneuvers;\n- \uf0da Energized systems, in particular equipment containing high/low temperature fluids, exposed electrical parts or moving mechanical parts, the latter related to parts of drilling or cutting equipment.\n\nNumber of occupational disease claims filed by heirs: indicator used as a proxy for the number of deaths due to occupational diseases.\n\nRecordable cases of occupational diseases: number of occupational disease reports.\n\nMain types of diseases: reports of suspected occupational disease made known to the employer concern pathologies that may have a causal connection with the risk at work, as they may have been contracted in the course of work and due to prolonged exposure to risk agents present in the workplace. The risk may be caused by the processing carried out, or by the environment in which the processing takes place. The main risk agents whose prolonged exposure may lead to an occupational disease are: (i) chemical agents (example of disease: neoplasms, respiratory system diseases, blood diseases); (ii) biological agents (example of disease: malaria); (iii) physical agents (example of disease: hearing loss).\n\nWater withdrawals: sum of sea water, freshwater, and brackish water from subsoil or surface withdrawn. TAF (groundwater treatment plant) water represents the amount of polluted groundwater treated and reused in the production cycle. The limit for freshwater, which is more conservative than that indicated by the GRI reference standard (equal to 1,000 ppm), is 2,000 ppm TDS, as provided in the IPIECA/API/IOGP 2020 guidance.\n\nWater discharges: The internal procedures relating to the operational management of water discharges regulate the control of the minimum quality standards and the authorization limits prescribed for each operational site, ensuring that they are respected and promptly resolved if they are exceeded.\n\nNumber of sites overlapping with protected areas and Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs): R&M, Versalis and EniPower operational sites and pipelines in Italy and abroad, which are located within (or partially within) the boundaries of one or more protected areas or KBAs (December of each reference year).\n\nNumber of sites adjacent to protected areas or Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs): R&M, Versalis and EniPower operational sites in Italy and abroad which, although outside the boundaries of protected areas or KBA, are less than 1 km away (December of each reference year).\n\nNumber of upstream concessions overlapping protected areas and Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs), with activities in the overlapping area: active national and international concessions, operated, under development or in production, present in the Company's databases in June of each reference year that overlap one or more protected areas or KBAs, where development/production operations (wells, sealines, pipelines and onshore and offshore installations as documented in the Company's GIS geodatabase) are located within the intersection area.\n\nNumber of upstream concessions overlapping protected areas or Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs), without activities in the overlapping area: active national and international concessions, operated, under development or in production, present in the Company's databases in June of each reference year that overlap one or more protected areas or KBAs, where development/production operations (wells, sealines, pipelines and onshore and offshore installations as documented in the Company's GIS geodatabase) are located outside the intersection area.\n\n- \u02db it is globally recognized that there is an overlap between the different databases of protected areas and KBAs, which may have led to a certain degree of duplication in the analysis (some protected areas/KBAs could be counted several times);\n\nThe sources used for the census of protected areas and KBAs are the \"World Database on Protected Areas\" and the \"World Database of Key Biodiversity Areas\" respectively; the data was made available to Eni in the framework of its membership in the UNEP-WCMC Proteus Partnership. There are some limitations to consider when interpreting the results of this analysis:\n\n- \u02db the databases of protected or key biodiversity areas used for the analysis, while representing the most up-to-date information available at global level, may not be complete for each Country.\n\nSpills from primary or secondary containment into the environment of oil or petroleum derivative from refining or oil waste occurring during operation or as a result of sabotage, theft or vandalism. Specifically, in 2020, volumes spilled by operational spill impacted 95% soil and 5% water body, those due to sabotage impacted 93% soil and 7% water body.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n173\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

expenditure towards local suppliers is determined on the basis of the percentage  of ownership of the corporate structure (e.g. for a Joint Venture with 60% local components, 60% of total expenditure  towards the Joint Venture is considered as expenditure towards local suppliers); 2) \"Local currency method\" (Angola  and UK): the share paid in local currency is identified as expenditure towards local suppliers; 3) \"Country registration  method\" (Iraq and Nigeria): the expenditure towards suppliers registered in the Country and not belonging to  international groups/mega suppliers (e.g. suppliers of drilling services/auxiliary drilling services) is identified as local; 4)  \"Method of registration in the Country + local currency\" (Congo and Mexico): expenditure towards suppliers

        "page_content": "## Glossary\n\nThe glossary of oil and gas terms is available on Eni's web page at the address eni.com. Below is a selection of the most frequently used terms.\n\n2nd and 3rd generation feedstock Are feedstocks not in competition with the food supply chain as the first generation feedstock (vegetable oils). Second generation are mostly agricultural non-food and agro/urban waste (such as animal fats, used cooking oils and agricultural waste) and the third generation feedstocks  are  non-agricultural  high  innovation  feedstocks (deriving from algae or waste).\n\nAverage reserve life index Ratio between the amount of reserves at the end of the year and total production for the year.\n\nBarrel/bbl Volume unit corresponding to 159 liters. A barrel of oil corresponds to about 0.137 metric tonnes.\n\nBoe (Barrel of Oil Equivalent) Is used as a standard unit measure for oil and natural gas. Effective January 1, 2019, Eni has updated the conversion rate of gas produced to 5,310 cubic feet of gas equals 1 barrel of oil.\n\nConversion Refinery  process  allowing  the  transformation  of heavy  fractions  into  lighter  fractions.  Conversion  processes are  cracking,  visbreaking,  coking,  the  gasification  of  refinery residues, etc. The ration of overall treatment capacity of these plants and that of primary crude fractioning plants is the conversion rate of a refinery. Flexible refineries have higher rates and higher profitability.\n\nElastomers (or Rubber) Polymers, either natural or synthetic, which, unlike plastic, when stress is applied, return, to a certain degree, to their original shape, once the stress ceases to be applied. The main synthetic elastomers are polybutadiene (BR), styrene-butadiene  rubber  (SBR),  ethylenepropylene  rubber (EPR), thermoplastic rubber (TPR) and nitrylic rubber (NBR).\n\nEmissions of NO x (Nitrogen Oxides) Total direct emissions of nitrogen oxides deriving from combustion processes in air. They include NO x emissions from flaring activities, sulphur recovery processes, FCC regeneration, etc. They include NO and NO 2 emissions and exclude N 2 O emissions.\n\nEmissions of SO x (Sulphur Oxides) Total direct emissions of sulfur oxides including SO 2 and SO 3 emissions. Main sources are combustion plants, diesel engines (including maritime engines), gas flaring (if the gas contains H 2 S), sulphur recovery processes, FCC regeneration, etc.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n183\n\nEnhanced recovery Techniques used to increase or stretch over time the production of wells.\n\nEni  carbon  efficiency  index Ratio  between  GHG  emissions (Scope 1 and Scope 2 in tonnes CO 2 eq.)  of  the  main  industrial activities operated by Eni divided by the productions (converted by homogeneity into barrels of oil equivalent using Eni's average conversion factors) of the single businesses of reference.\n\nGreen House Gases (GHG) Gases in the atmosphere, transparent to solar radiation, that trap infrared radiation emitted by the earth's surface. The greenhouse gases relevant within Eni's activities are carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), methane (CH 4 ) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O). GHG emissions are commonly reported in CO 2 equivalent (CO 2 eq.) according to Global Warming Potential values in line with IPCC AR4, 4 th Assessment Report.\n\nInfilling wells Infilling wells are wells drilled in a producing area in order to improve the recovery of hydrocarbons from the field and to maintain and/or increase production levels.\n\nLNG Liquefied Natural Gas obtained through the cooling of natural gas to minus 160\u00b0C at normal pressure. The gas is liquefied to allow transportation from the place of extraction to the sites at which it is transformed and consumed. One ton of LNG corresponds to 1,400 cubic meters of gas.\n\nLPG Liquefied  Petroleum  Gas,  a  mix  of  light  petroleum  fractions, gaseous at normal pressure and easily liquefied at room temperature through limited compression.\n\nMineral  Potential  (potentially  recoverable  hydrocarbon volumes) Estimated recoverable volumes which cannot be defined as reserves due to a number of reasons, such as the temporary lack of viable markets, a possible commercial recovery dependent on the development of new technologies, or for their location in accumulations yet to be developed or where evaluation of known accumulations is still at an early stage.\n\nNatural gas liquids Liquid or liquefied hydrocarbons recovered from natural gas through separation equipment or natural gas treatment plants. Propane, normal-butane and isobutane, isopentane and pentane plus, that used to be defined natural gasoline, are natural gas liquids.\n\nNet Carbon Footprint Overall Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions  associated  with  Eni's  operations,  accounted  for  on  an equity basis, net of carbon sinks.",

Amounts different from the agreed ones determine temporary over/underlifting situations.\n\nPlasmix The collective name for the different plastics that currently have no use in the market of recycling and can be used as a feedstock in the new circular economy businesses of Eni.\n\nProduction Sharing Agreement (PSA) Contract in use in African, Middle Eastern, Far Eastern and Latin American Countries, among others, regulating relationships between states and oil companies with regard to the exploration and production of hydrocarbons. The mineral right is awarded to the national oil company jointly with the foreign oil company that has an exclusive right to perform exploration, development and production activities and can enter into agreements with other local or international entities. In this type of contract, the national oil company assigns to the international contractor the task of performing exploration and production with the  contractor's  equipment  and  financial  resources.  Exploration risks are borne by the contractor and production is divided into two portions: 'cost oil' is used to recover costs borne by the contractor and 'profit oil' is divided between the contractor and the national company according to variable schemes and represents the profit deriving from exploration and production. Further terms and conditions of these contracts may vary from Country to Country.\n\nProved reserves Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthe operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time.\n\nRenewable Installed Capacity Is measured as the maximun generating capacity of Eni's share of power plants that use renewable  energy  sources  (wind,  solar  and  wave,  and  any other non-fossil fuel source of generation deriving from natural resources, excluding, from the avoidance of doubt, nuclear energy) to produce electricity. The capacity is considered 'installed' once the power plants are in operation or the mechanical completion phase has been reached. The mechanical completion represents the final construction stage excluding the grid connection.\n\nReserves Quantities of oil and gas and related substances anticipated to be economically producible, as of a given date, by application of development projects to known accumulations. In addition, there must exist, or there must be a reasonable expectation that will exist, the legal right to produce or a revenue interest in the production, installed means of delivering oil and gas or related substances to market, and all permits and financing required to implement the project. Reserves can be: (i) developed reserves quantities of oil and gas anticipated to be through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate; (ii) undeveloped reserves: oil and gas expected to be recovered from new wells, facilities and operating methods.\n\nScope 1 GHG Emissions Direct  greenhouse  gas  emissions from company's operations, produced from sources that are owned or controlled by the company.\n\nScope 2 GHG Emissions Indirect greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the generation of electricity, steam and heat purchased from third parties.\n\nScope 3 GHG Emissions Indirect GHG emissions associated with the value chain of Eni's products.\n\nShip-or-pay Clause included in natural gas transportation contracts according to which the customer for which the transportation is carried out is bound to pay for the transportation of the gas also in case the gas is not transported.\n\nTake-or-pay Clause included in natural gas purchase contracts according to which the purchaser is bound to pay the contractual price or a fraction of such price for a minimum quantity of the gas set in the contract also in case it is not collected by the customer. The customer has the option of collecting the gas paid and not delivered at a price equal to the residual fraction of the price set in the contract in subsequent contract years.\n\nUN SDGs The Sustainable Development Goals  (SDGs) are the",

The producing countries of the cartel decided against  maintaining  the  existing  quotas  and  as  a  result the market was inundated with production while demand was crumbling. Those developments led to a collapse in commodity prices.\n\nAt the peak of the downturn, between March and April, the Brent marker price fell to about 15 $/barrel, the lowest level in  over  twenty  years.  The  oversupply  drove  oil  markets into contango, a situation when prices per prompt delivery quote below prices for future deliveries, while both land and floating storages reached the highest technical filling levels. Since  May,  oil  prices  have  been  staging  a  turnaround thanks  to  an  agreement  reached  within  OPEC+  which implemented production cuts and an ongoing recovery in the world economy and oil consumption following an ease to restrictive measures, which were driven in large part by a strong rebound of activity in China. Brent prices recovered to almost 45 $/barrel in the summer months.\n\nHowever,  during  the  autumn  months  the  macroeconomic rebound hit a standstill in the USA and in Europe due to a continuous  recrudescence  in  virus  cases,  which  forced the governments and local authorities in those countries to reinstate partial or full lockdowns and other restrictive measures  that  weighted  heavily  on  oil  and  products demands as millions of people continued living stranded. In  this  period,  crude  oil  prices  were  supported  by  strict production discipline on part of OPEC+ members and the market  was  able  to  accommodate  the  return  of  Libya's production by the end of September.\n\nBarometer  of  the  weakness  of  the  fundamentals  in  the energy  sector  in  the  third  quarter  was  the  trend  in  the\n\nrefining margins which dropped into negative territory due to weak demand for fuels and the crisis in the airline sector, which prevented refiners from passing the cost of the crude oil feedstock to the final prices of products. To make things worse, OPEC+ production cuts impacted the availability of medium-heavy crudes, narrowing the price differentials with light-medium qualities like  the  Brent  crude  and  squeezing the refiners' conversion advantage.\n\nHowever, since mid-November a few market and macroeconomic developments triggered a rally in oil prices, which reached 50 $/bbl at the end of the year rebounding from the still depressed level of October and then rose to an average of over 60 $/barrel in the first quarter of 2021.\n\nIn 2020 due to the macroeconomic and market developments caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the price of the Brent benchmark crude oil prices decreased by 35% compared to the previous year, with an annual average of 42 $/barrel, the price of natural gas at the Italian spot market 'PSV' declined on average by 35%, and the Standard Eni Refining Margin SERM decreased by 60%.\n\nConsidering  the  market  trends,  management  revised  the Company's  outlook  for  hydrocarbons  prices  assuming  a more conservative oil scenario with a Long Term Brent price at 60 $/barrel in 2023 real terms (compared to the previous projection of 70 $/barrel) to reflect the possible structural effects of the pandemic on oil demand and the risk that the energy transition will accelerate due to the fiscal policies adopted by governments to rebuild the economy on more sustainable  basis.  These  developments  had  negative, material effects on Eni's results of operations and cash flow. In 2020, Eni reported a net loss of \u20ac8.6 billion due to the reduction in revenues driven by lower realized prices and margins for hydrocarbons with an estimated impact of \u20ac6.8 billion and lower production volumes and other business impacts caused by the COVID-19 pandemic for \u20ac1 billion, as well as the recognition of impairment losses of \u20ac3.2 billion taken at Oil & Gas assets and refineries due to a revised management's  outlook  on  long-term  oil  and  gas  prices and lowered assumptions for the refining margins. A loss of approximately \u20ac1.3 billion was incurred in relation to the evaluation of inventories of oil and products, which were aligned to their net realizable values at period end, and a \u20ac1.7 billion loss taken at equity-accounted investments.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "All these trends caused the Group to incur an operating loss of \u20ac3.3 billion. These effects were partially offset by cost efficiencies and other management initiatives to counter the effects of the pandemic. Furthermore, the Group net loss for the year was also affected for \u20ac1.3 billion by the write-down of deferred tax assets.\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities declined to \u20ac4.8 billion  with  a  reduction  of  61%  compared  to  2019,  due  to lower prices of hydrocarbons and other scenario effects for \u20ac6 billion and the negative impact on operations associated with  the  COVID-19 for  \u20ac1.3  billion,  attributable  to  reduced expenditures, lower demand for fuel and chemicals, longer maintenance  standstills  in  response  to  the  COVID-19 emergency, lower LNG offtakes and lower gas demand and higher provisions for impairment losses at trade receivables. These negative impacts were partially offset by cost savings and other initiatives in response to the pandemic crisis.\n\nIn order to respond to this large-scale shortfall, management has taken several decisive actions to preserve the Company's liquidity, the ability to cover maturing financial obligations and to mitigate the impact of the crisis on the Group's net financial position, as follows:\n\n- \uf0da In 2020 Eni reduced capital expenditures by a significant amount.  Those  capex  reductions  mainly  related  to upstream  activities,  targeting  production  optimization activities  and  the  rephasing  of  certain  development projects.  The  delayed  or  re-phased  activities  can  be restarted  quickly  in  normal  conditions,  determining  a recovery of related production.\n- \uf0da Implemented widespread cost reduction initiatives across all businesses resulting in significant cost savings.\n- \uf0da In May 2020, a \u20ac2 billion bond was issued. Then, in October two hybrid bonds were issued for a total amount of \u20ac3 billion; those latter bonds are classified among equity for balance sheet purposes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n197\n\n- \uf0da A share repurchase program approved before the start of the crisis was put on hold.\n- \uf0da Established a new dividend policy with the introduction of a variable component of the dividend in line with the volatility of the scenario. The new policy establishes a floor dividend currently set at 0.36 \u20ac/share under the assumption of a Brent scenario of at least 43 $/barrel and a growing variable component based on a recovery in the crude oil scenario. The floor amount will be revalued over time depending on the Company delivering on its industrial targets. For 2020, the dividend proposal is equal to the floor dividend.\n\nThe Company limited the increase in net borrowings before IFRS 16 which closed the year at \u20ac11.6 billion (unchanged over 2019), while retaining leverage at 0.31. The Company can count to fulfill the financial obligations coming due in the next future on a liquidity reserve of \u20ac20.4 billion as of December 31, 2020, consisting of:\n\n- \uf0da cash and cash equivalents of \u20ac9.4 billion;\n- \uf0da \u20ac5.3 billion of undrawn committed borrowing facilities;\n- \uf0da \u20ac5.5  billion  of  readily  disposable  securities  (mainly government bonds and corporate investment grade bond) and \u20ac0.2 billion of short-term financing receivables.\n\nThis  reserve  is  considered  adequate  to  cover  the  main financial obligations maturing in the next twelve months relating to:\n\n- \uf0da short-term debt of \u20ac2.9 billion;\n- \uf0da maturing bonds of \u20ac1.1 billion and other maturing longterm debt of \u20ac1.1 billion\n- \uf0da committed investments of \u20ac4.3 billion;\n- \uf0da instalments  of  leasing  contracts  coming  due  of  \u20ac1.1 billion\n- \uf0da the payment of a floor dividend for approximately \u20ac1.5 billion (including the final 2020 dividend and the interim floor dividend for 2021 due to paid in September).",

The principles of consolidation and the significant accounting policies that follow have been consistently applied to all years presented, except where otherwise indicated.\n\nThe  2020  Consolidated  Financial  Statements,  approved by  the  Eni's  Board  of  Directors  on  March  18,  2021,  were audited  by  the  external  auditor  PricewaterhouseCoopers SpA. The external auditor of Eni SpA, as the main external auditor, is wholly in charge of the auditing activities of the Consolidated  Financial  Statements;  when  there  are  other external  auditors,  PricewaterhouseCoopers  SpA  takes  the responsibility of their work.\n\nThe  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  are  presented  in euros and all values are rounded to the nearest million euros (\u20ac million), except where otherwise indicated.\n\n## SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS\n\nThe preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the  assets,  liabilities,  revenues  and  expenses  recognised in the financial statements, as well as amounts included in  the  notes  thereto,  including  disclosure  of  contingent assets and contingent liabilities. Estimates made are based on  complex  judgements  and  past  experience  of  other assumptions  deemed  reasonable  in  consideration  of  the information available at the time. The accounting policies and areas that require the most significant judgements and estimates to be used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements are in relation to the accounting for oil\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nand natural gas activities, specifically in the determination of  reserves,  impairment  of  financial  and  non-financial assets, leases, decommissioning and restoration liabilities, environmental liabilities, business combinations, employee benefits, revenue from contracts with customers, fair value measurements and income taxes. Although the Company uses  its  best  estimates  and  judgements,  actual  results could  differ  from  the  estimates  and  assumptions  used. The accounting estimates and judgements relevant for the preparation  of  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statement  are described below.\n\n## PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION\n\n## SUBSIDIARIES\n\nThe  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  comprise  the financial  statements  of  the  parent  Company  Eni  SpA  and those of its subsidiaries, being those entities over which the Company has control, either directly or indirectly, through exposure or rights to their variable returns and the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investees. To have power over an investee, the investor must have existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee, i.e. the activities that significantly affect the investee's returns.\n\nSubsidiaries are consolidated, on the basis of consistent accounting  policies,  from  the  date  on  which  control  is obtained until the date that control ceases.\n\nAssets,  liabilities,  income  and  expenses  of  consolidated subsidiaries are fully recognised with those of the parent in the Consolidated Financial Statements, taking into account the  appropriate  eliminations  of  intragroup  transactions (see  the  accounting  policy  for  'Intragroup  transactions'); the  parent's  investment  in  each  subsidiary  is  eliminated against  the  corresponding  parent's  portion  of  equity  of each  subsidiary.  Non-controlling  interests  are  presented separately  on  the  balance  sheet  within  equity;  the  profit or  loss  and  comprehensive  income  attributable  to  noncontrolling  interests  are  presented  in  specific  line  items, respectively,  in  the  profit  and  loss  account  and  in  the statement of comprehensive income.\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements do not consolidate: (i) some subsidiaries being immaterial, either individually or in the aggregate; (ii) companies whose consolidation does not produce material impacts, that are subsidiaries acting as sole-operator in the management of oil and gas contracts on behalf of companies participating in a joint project. In the latter case, the activities are financed proportionally based\n\n- (1) With reference to the impacts of COVID-19, see information provided in the previous paragraph.\n\npreviously named International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) and initially Standing Interpretations Committee (SIC).\n\n(3) As applied to Eni, there are no differences between IFRSs as issued by the IASB and those adopted by the EU, effective for the year 2020.",

Costs  and  revenue  and  other  operating  data  (production, reserves,  etc.)  of  the  project,  as  well  as  the  related obligations arising from the project, are recognised directly in the financial statements of the companies involved based on their own share. The abovementioned exclusions do not produce material 4 impacts  on  the  Consolidated Financial Statements 5 .\n\nWhen the proportion of the equity held by non-controlling interests changes, any difference between the consideration paid/received  and  the  amount  by  which  the  related  noncontrolling interests are adjusted is attributed to Eni owners' equity. Conversely, the sale of equity interests with loss of control determines the recognition in the profit and loss account of: (i) any gain or loss calculated as the difference between the consideration received and the corresponding transferred net assets; (ii) any gain or loss recognised as a result of the remeasurement of any investment retained in the former subsidiary at its fair value; and (iii) any amount related to the former subsidiary previously recognised in other  comprehensive  income  which  may  be  reclassified subsequently to the profit and loss account 6 . Any investment retained in the former subsidiary is recognised at its fair value at the date when control is lost and shall be accounted for in accordance with the applicable measurement criteria.\n\n## INTERESTS IN JOINT ARRANGEMENTS\n\nJoint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.\n\nA joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. Investments in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method as described in the accounting policy for 'The equity method of accounting'. A joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have enforceable rights  to  the  assets,  and  enforceable  obligations  for  the liabilities,  relating to the arrangement; in the Consolidated Financial  Statements,  Eni  recognises  its  share  of  the assets/liabilities and revenue/expenses of joint operations on the basis of its rights and obligations relating to the arrangements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n199\n\nAfter the initial recognition, the assets/liabilities and revenue /expenses  of  the  joint  operations  are  measured  in accordance  with  the  applicable  measurement  criteria. Immaterial joint operations structured through a separate vehicle are accounted for using the equity method or, if this does  not  result  in  a  misrepresentation  of  the  Company's financial  position  and  performance,  at  cost  net  of  any impairment losses.\n\n## INVESTMENTS IN ASSOCIATES\n\nAn  associate  is  an  entity  over  which  Eni  has  significant influence, that is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee, but is not control or joint control of those policies. Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method as described in the accounting policy for 'The equity method of accounting'. Investments in subsidiaries, joint arrangements and associates as of December 31, 2020 are presented separately in  the  annex  'List  of  companies  owned  by  Eni  SpA  as  of December 31, 2020'. This annex includes also the changes in the scope of consolidation.\n\nConsolidated companies' financial statements are audited by external auditors who also audit the information required for the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING\n\nInvestments  in  joint  ventures,  associates  and  immaterial unconsolidated  subsidiaries,  are  accounted  for  using  the equity method 7 .\n\nUnder the equity method, investments are initially recognised at  cost,  allocating  it,  similarly  to  business  combinations procedures,  to  the  investee's  identifiable  assets/liabilities; any excess of the cost of the investment over the share of  the  net  fair  value  of  the  investee's  identifiable  assets and liabilities is accounted for as goodwill, not separately recognised  but  included  in  the  carrying  amount  of  the investment. If this allocation is provisionally recognised at initial recognition, it can be retrospectively adjusted within one year from the date of initial recognition, to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed at the date of initial recognition. Subsequently, the carrying  amount  is  adjusted  to  reflect:  (i)  the  investor's share of the profit or loss of the investee after the date of acquisition, adjusted  to  account  for  depreciation, amortization  and  any  impairment  losses  of  the  equity-\n\n(7) Joint ventures, associates and immaterial unconsolidated subsidiaries are accounted for at cost less any accumulated impairment losses, if this does not result in a misrepresentation of the Company's financial position and performance.",

Distributions  received  from an equity-accounted investee reduce the carrying amount of the investment. In applying the equity method, consolidation adjustments are considered (see also the accounting policy for  'Subsidiaries').  Losses  arising  from  the  application  of the equity method in excess of the carrying amount of the investment, recognised in the profit and loss account within 'Income (Expense) from investments', reduce the carrying amount,  net  of  the  related  expected  credit  losses  (see below),  of  any  financing  receivables  towards  the  investee for which settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future (the so-called long-term interests), which are, in substance, an extension of the investment in the investee. The investor's share of any losses of an equityaccounted investee that exceeds the carrying amount of the investment and any long-term interests (the  so-called  net investment), is recognised in a specific provision only to the extent that the investor has incurred legal or constructive\n\nobligations or made payments on behalf of the investee. Whenever  there  is  objective  evidence  of  impairment (e.g.  relevant  breaches  of  contracts,  significant  financial difficulty,  probable  default  of  the  counterparty,  etc.),  the carrying amount of the net investment, resulting from the application of the abovementioned measurement criteria, is tested for impairment by comparing it with the related recoverable  amount,  determined  by  adopting  the  criteria indicated in the accounting policy for 'Impairment of nonfinancial assets'. When an impairment loss no longer exists or has decreased, any reversal of the impairment loss is recognised  in  the  profit  and  loss  account  within  'Income (Expense) from investments'. The impairment reversal of the net investment shall not exceed the previously recognised impairment losses.\n\nThe  sale  of  equity  interests  with  loss  of  joint  control  or significant  influence  over  the  investee  determines  the recognition in the profit and loss account of: (i) any gain or loss calculated as the difference between the consideration received  and  the  corresponding  transferred  share;  (ii)  any gain or loss recognised as a result of the remeasurement of  any  investment  retained  in  the  former  joint  venture/ associate at its fair value 8 ;  and  (iii)  any  amount related to the  former  joint  venture/associate  previously  recognised in other comprehensive income which may be reclassified subsequently to the profit and loss account 9 . Any investment\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nretained in the former joint venture/associate is recognised at its fair value at the date when joint control or significant influence is lost and shall be accounted for in accordance with the applicable measurement criteria.\n\n## BUSINESS COMBINATIONS\n\nBusiness  combinations  are  accounted  for  by  applying  the acquisition method. The consideration transferred in a business combination is the sum of the acquisition-date fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the acquirer. The consideration transferred includes also the fair value of any assets or liabilities resulting from contingent considerations, contractually agreed and dependent upon  the  occurrence  of  specified  future  events.  Acquisitionrelated costs are accounted for as expenses when incurred.\n\nThe acquirer shall measure the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their acquisition-date fair values 10 , unless  another  measurement  basis  is  required  by  IFRSs. The excess of the consideration transferred over the Group's share  of  the  acquisition-date  fair  values  of  the  identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognised, on the balance sheet, as goodwill; conversely, a gain on a bargain purchase is recognised in the profit and loss account.\n\nAny non-controlling interests are measured as the proportionate  share  in  the  recognised  amounts  of  the acquiree's  identifiable  net  assets  at  the  acquisition  date excluding the portion of goodwill attributable to them (partial goodwill method) 11 .  In a business combination achieved in stages, the purchase price is determined by summing the acquisition-date fair value of previously held equity interests in the acquiree and the consideration transferred for obtaining control; the previously held equity interests are remeasured at  their  acquisition-date  fair  value  and  the  resulting  gain or loss, if  any,  is  recognised in the profit and loss account. Furthermore, on obtaining control, any amount recognised in other comprehensive income related to the previously held equity interests is reclassified to the profit and loss account, or in another item of equity when such amount may not be reclassified to the profit and loss account.\n\nIf the  initial  accounting  for  a  business  combination  is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, the provisional amounts recognised at the acquisition date shall be retrospectively adjusted within one year from the acquisition date, to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date.",

In this regard, if the entity obtains control over a business that was a joint operation, the previously held interest in the joint operation is remeasured at the acquisition-date fair value and the resulting gain or loss is recognized in the profit and loss account 12 .\n\n## Significant accounting estimates and judgements: investments and business combinations\n\nThe  assessment  of  the  existence  of  control,  joint  control, significant  influence  over  an  investee,  as  well  as  for  joint operations, the assessment of the existence of enforceable rights to the investee's assets and enforceable obligations for the  investee's  liabilities  imply  that  the  management  makes complex judgements on the basis of the characteristics of the  investee's  structure,  arrangements  between  parties  and other relevant facts and circumstances. Significant accounting estimates by management are required also for measuring the identifiable  assets  acquired  and  the  liabilities  assumed  in  a business combination at their acquisition-date fair values. For such measurement, to be performed also for the application of  the  equity  method,  Eni  adopts  the  valuation  techniques generally  used  by  market  participants  taking  into  account the  available  information;  for  the  most  significant  business combinations, Eni engages external independent evaluators.\n\n## INTRAGROUP TRANSACTIONS\n\nAll balances and transactions between consolidated companies, and not yet realised with third parties, including unrealised profits arising from such transactions have been eliminated.\n\nUnrealised profits arising from transactions between the Group and its equity-accounted entities are eliminated to the extent of the Group's interest in the equity-accounted entity. In both cases, unrealised  losses  are  not  eliminated  unless  the  transaction provides evidence of an impairment loss of the asset transferred.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION\n\nThe  financial  statements  of  foreign  operations  having  a functional  currency  other  than  the  euro,  that  represents the  parent's  functional  currency,  are  translated  into  euros using the spot exchange rates on the balance sheet date for assets and liabilities, historical exchange rates for equity and average exchange rates for the profit and loss account and the statement of cash flows.\n\nThe cumulative resulting exchange differences are presented in the separate component of Eni owners' equity 'Cumulative currency translation differences' 13 . Cumulative amount  of  exchange  differences  relating  to  a  foreign operation  are  reclassified  to  the  profit  and  loss  account when the entity disposes the entire interest in that foreign operation or when the partial disposal involves the loss of control, joint control or significant influence over the foreign operation. On a partial disposal that does not involve loss of control of a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation, the proportionate share of the cumulative exchange differences is  reattributed  to  the  non-controlling  interests  in  that foreign operation. On a partial disposal of interests in joint arrangements or in associates that does not involve loss of joint control or significant influence, the proportionate share of the cumulative exchange differences is reclassified to the profit and loss account. The repayment of share capital made by a subsidiary having a functional currency other than the euro, without a change in the ownership interest, implies  that  the  proportionate  share  of  the  cumulative amount of exchange differences relating to the subsidiary is reclassified to the profit and loss account.\n\nThe  financial  statements  of  foreign  operations  which  are translated into euros are denominated in the foreign operations' functional currencies which generally is the U.S. dollar.\n\nThe  main  foreign  exchange  rates  used  to  translate  the financial statements into the parent's functional currency are indicated below:\n\n|                           |   Annual average  exchange rate  Exchange rate  at December 31, |   Annual average  exchange rate  Exchange rate  at December 31, |   Annual average  exchange rate   Exchange rate  at December 31, |   Annual average  exchange rate   Exchange rate  at December 31, | Annual average  exchange rate   2018   |   Exchange rate  at December 31, |\n|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| (currency amount for 1 \u20ac) |                                                         2020    |                                                         2020    |                                                          2019    |                                                          2019    |                                        |                          2018    |\n| U.S. Dollar               |                                                            1.14 |                                                            1.23 |                                                             1.12 |                                                             1.12 | 1.18                                   |                             1.15 |\n| Pound Sterling            |                                                            0.89 |                                                            0.9  |                                                             0.88 |                                                             0.85 | 0.88                                   |                             0.89 |\n| Australian Dollar         |                                                            1.66 |                                                            1.59 |                                                             1.61 |                                                             1.6  | 1.58                                   |                             1.62 |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nThe  most  significant  accounting  policies  used  in  the preparation  of  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  are described below.\n\n## OIL AND NATURAL GAS EXPLORATION, APPRAISAL, DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES\n\nOil and natural gas exploration, appraisal and development activities  are  accounted  for  using  the  principles  of  the successful efforts method of accounting as described below.\n\n## ACQUISITION OF EXPLORATION RIGHTS\n\nCosts  incurred  for  the  acquisition  of  exploration  rights (or their extension) are initially capitalised within the line item 'Intangible assets' as 'exploration rights - unproved' pending  determination  of  whether  the  exploration  and appraisal activities in the reference areas are successful or not. Unproved exploration rights are not amortised, but reviewed to confirm that there is no indication that the carrying  amount  exceeds  the  recoverable  amount.  This review is based on the confirmation of the commitment of the Company to continue the exploration activities and on the analysis of facts and circumstances that indicate the absence of uncertainties related to the recoverability of the carrying amount. If no future activity is planned, the  carrying  amount  of  the  related  exploration  rights  is recognised in the profit and loss account as write-off. Lower value  exploration  rights  are  pooled  and  amortised  on  a straight-line basis over the estimated period of exploration. In  the  event  of  a  discovery  of  proved  reserves  (i.e.  upon recognition of proved reserves and internal approval for development), the carrying amount of the related unproved exploration  rights  is  reclassified  to  'proved  exploration rights',  within  the  line  item  'Intangible  assets'.  Upon reclassification, as well as whether there is any indication of impairment, the carrying amount of exploration rights to reclassify as proved is tested for impairment considering the higher of their value in use and their fair value less costs of disposal. From the commencement of production, proved exploration rights are amortised according to the unit  of  production  method  (the  so-called  UOP  method, described in the accounting policy for 'UOP depreciation, depletion and amortisation').\n\n## ACQUISITION OF MINERAL INTERESTS\n\nCosts  incurred  for  the  acquisition  of  mineral  interests  are capitalised in connection with the assets acquired (such as exploration  potential,  possible  and  probable  reserves  and proved  reserves).  When  the  acquisition  is  related  to  a  set\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nof exploration potential and reserves, the cost is allocated to  the  different  assets  acquired  based  on  their  expected discounted cash flows.\n\nAcquired exploration potential is measured in accordance with the criteria illustrated in the accounting policy for 'Acquisition of exploration rights'. Costs associated with proved reserves are amortised according to the UOP method (see the accounting policy  for  'UOP  depreciation,  depletion  and  amortisation'). Expenditure associated with possible and probable reserves (unproved mineral interests) is not amortised until classified as proved reserves; in case of a negative result of the subsequent appraisal activities, it is written off.\n\n## EXPLORATION AND APPRAISAL EXPENDITURE\n\nGeological and geophysical exploration costs are recognised as an expense as incurred.\n\nCosts  directly  associated  with  an  exploration  well  are initially recognised within tangible assets in progress, as 'exploration and appraisal costs - unproved' (exploration wells in progress) until the drilling of the well is completed and  can  continue  to  be  capitalised  in  the  following 12-month period pending the evaluation of drilling results (suspended exploration wells). If, at the end of this period, it is ascertained that the result is negative (no hydrocarbon found) or that the discovery is not sufficiently significant to  justify  the  development,  the  wells  are  declared  dry/ unsuccessful  and  the  related  costs  are  written-off. Conversely, these costs continue to be capitalised if and until: (i) the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to  justify  its  completion  as  a  producing  well,  and  (ii)  the entity is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project; on the contrary, the capitalised costs are recognised in the profit and loss account as write-off. Analogous recognition criteria are adopted for the costs related to the appraisal activity.  When  proved  reserves  of  oil  and/or  natural  gas are  determined,  the  relevant  expenditure  recognised as  unproved  is  reclassified  to  proved  exploration  and appraisal  costs  within  tangible  assets  in  progress. Upon reclassification,  or  when  there  is  any  indication  of impairment, the carrying amount of the costs to reclassify as proved is tested for impairment considering the higher of  their  value  in  use  and  their  fair  value  less  costs  of disposal. From the commencement of production, proved exploration and appraisal costs are depreciated according to  the  UOP  method  (see  the  accounting  policy  for  'UOP depreciation, depletion and amortisation').\n\n## DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURE\n\nDevelopment  expenditure,  including  the  costs  related to  unsuccessful  and  damaged  development  wells,  are capitalised  as  'Tangible  asset  in  progress  -  proved'. Development costs are incurred to obtain access to proved",

They are amortised, from  the  commencement  of  production,  generally  on  a UOP basis. When development projects are unfeasible/not carried on, the related costs are written off when it is decided to  abandon  the  project.  Development  costs  are  tested  for impairment in accordance with the criteria described in the accounting policy for 'Property, plant and equipment'.\n\n## UOP DEPRECIATION, DEPLETION AND AMORTISATION\n\nProved oil and gas assets are depreciated generally under the UOP method, as their useful life is closely related to the availability of proved oil and gas reserves, by applying, to the depreciable amounts at the end of each quarter a rate representing the ratio between the volumes extracted during the quarter and the reserves existing at the end of the  quarter,  increased  by  the  volumes  extracted  during the  quarter.  This  method  is  applied  with  reference  to the smallest aggregate representing a direct correlation between expenditures to be depreciated and oil and gas reserves. Proved exploration rights and acquired proved mineral  interests  are  amortised  over  proved  reserves; proved exploration and appraisal costs and development expenditure  are  depreciated  over  proved  developed reserves,  while  common  facilities  are  depreciated  over total  proved  reserves.  Proved  reserves  are  determined according to US SEC rules that require the use of the yearly average  oil  and  gas  prices  for  assessing  the  economic producibility; material changes in reference prices could result in depreciation charges not reflecting the pattern in which the assets' future economic benefits are expected to be consumed to the extent that, for example, certain non-current  assets  would  be  fully  depreciated  within  a short  term.  In  these  cases  the  reserves  considered  in determining  the  UOP  rate  are  estimated  on  the  basis  of economic viability parameters, reasonable and consistent with  management's  expectations  of  production,  in  order to recognise depreciation charges that more appropriately reflect the expected utilization of the assets concerned.\n\n## PRODUCTION COSTS\n\nProduction costs are those costs incurred to operate and maintain wells and field equipment and are recognised as an expense as incurred.\n\n## PRODUCTION  SHARING  AGREEMENTS  AND  SERVICE CONTRACTS\n\nOil and  gas  reserves  related  to  Production  Sharing Agreements  are  determined  on  the  basis  of  contractual terms  related  to  the  recovery  of  the  contractor's  costs to  undertake  and  finance  exploration,  development  and production  activities  at  its  own  risk  (Cost  Oil)  and  the Company's  stipulated  share  of  the  production  remaining\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n203\n\nafter such cost recovery (Profit Oil). Revenues from the sale of the lifted production, against both Cost Oil and Profit Oil, are accounted for on an accrual basis, whilst exploration, development  and  production  costs  are  accounted  for according  to  the  above-mentioned  accounting  policies. The Company's share of production volumes and reserves includes the share of hydrocarbons that corresponds to the taxes to be paid, according to the contractual agreement, by the national government on behalf of the Company. As a consequence, the Company has to recognise at the same time an increase in the taxable profit, through the increase of the revenue, and a tax expense.\n\nA similar scheme applies to service contracts.\n\n## PLUGGING AND ABANDONMENT OF WELLS\n\nCosts  expected  to  be  incurred  with  respect  to  the  plugging and abandonment of a well, dismantlement and removal of production facilities, as well as site restoration, are capitalised, consistent with the accounting policy described under 'Property, plant and equipment', and then depreciated on a UOP basis.\n\n## Significant accounting estimates and judgements: oil and natural gas activities\n\nEngineering  estimates  of  the  Company's  oil  and  gas reserves  are  inherently  uncertain.  Proved  reserves  are the estimated volumes of crude oil, natural gas and gas condensates,  liquids  and  associated  substances  which geological and engineering data demonstrate that can be economically  producible  with  reasonable  certainty  from known  reservoirs  under  existing  economic  conditions and operating methods. Although there are authoritative guidelines  regarding  the  engineering  and  geological criteria  that  must  be  met  before  estimated  oil  and  gas reserves  can  be  categorised  as  'proved',  the  accuracy of  reserve  estimates  depends  on  a  number  of  factors, assumptions  and  variables,  including:  (i)  the  quality  of available geological, technical and economic data and their interpretation  and  judgement;  (ii)  projections  regarding future  rates  of  production  and  operating  costs  as  well as  timing  and  amount  of  development  expenditures;  (iii) changes  in  the  prevailing  tax  rules,  other  government regulations  and  contractual  conditions;  (iv)  results  of drilling, testing and the actual production performance of Eni's reservoirs after the date of the estimates which may drive  substantial  upward  or  downward  revisions;  and  (v) changes in oil and natural gas prices which could affect expected  future  cash  flows  and  the  quantities  of  Eni's proved reserves since the estimates of reserves are based on prices and costs existing as of the date when these estimates are made. Lower oil prices or the projections of higher operating and development costs may impair the ability of the Company to economically produce reserves leading to downward reserve revisions.",

        "page_content": "204\n\nMany of the factors, assumptions and variables involved in\n\nestimating proved reserves are subject to change over time and therefore affect the estimates of oil and natural gas reserves. Similar uncertainties concern unproved reserves. The  determination  of  whether  potentially  economic oil  and  natural  gas  reserves  have  been  discovered  by an  exploration  well  is  made  within  a  year  after  well completion. The evaluation process of a discovery, which requires performing additional appraisal activities on the potential  oil  and  natural  gas  field  and  establishing  the optimum  development  plans,  can  take  longer,  in  most cases,  depending  on  the  complexity  of  the  project  and on  the  size  of  capital  expenditures  required.  During  this period, the costs related to these exploration wells remain suspended  on  the  balance  sheet.  In  any  case,  all  such capitalised costs are reviewed, at least, on an annual basis to confirm the continued intent to develop, or otherwise to extract value from the discovery.\n\nField  reserves  will  be  categorised  as  proved  only  when all the criteria for attribution of proved status have been met. Proved reserves can be classified as developed or undeveloped. Volumes are classified into proved developed reserves  as  a  consequence  of  development  activity. Generally, reserves are booked as proved developed at the start of production. Major development projects typically take one to four years from the time of initial booking to the start of production.\n\nEstimated  proved  reserves  are  used  in  determining depreciation,  amortisation  and  depletion  charges  and impairment  charges.  Assuming  all  other  variables  are held constant, an increase in estimated proved developed reserves for each field decreases depreciation, amortisation and depletion charge under the UOP method. Conversely, a  decrease  in  estimated  proved  developed  reserves increases depreciation, amortisation and depletion charge.\n\n## PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT\n\nProperty,  plant  and  equipment,  including  investment properties, are recognised using the cost model and stated at their purchase price or construction cost including any costs  directly  attributable  to  bringing  the  asset  to  the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating  in  the  manner  intended  by  management.  For assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use, the purchase price or construction cost comprises the borrowing costs incurred in the period to get the asset ready for use that would have been avoided if the expenditure had not been made.\n\nIn  the  case  of  a  present  obligation  for  dismantling and  removal  of  assets  and  restoration  of  sites,  the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ninitial carrying amount of an item of property, plant and equipment includes the estimated (discounted) costs to be incurred when the removal event occurs; a corresponding amount  is  recognised  as  part  of  a  specific  provision (see  the  accounting  policy  for  'Decommissioning  and restoration liabilities'). Analogous approach is adopted for present obligations to realise social projects in oil and gas development areas.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are not revalued for financial reporting purposes.\n\nExpenditures on upgrading, revamping and reconversion are recognised as items of property, plant and equipment when it is probable that they will increase the expected future  economic  benefits  of  the  asset.  Assets  acquired for safety or environmental reasons, although not directly increasing the future economic benefits of any particular existing item of property, plant and equipment, qualify for recognition as assets when they are necessary for running the business.\n\nDepreciation  of  tangible  assets  begins  when  they  are available for use, i.e. when they are in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating as planned. Property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a systematic basis over their useful life. The useful life is the period over which an asset is expected to be available for use by the Company. When tangible assets are composed of  more  than  one  significant  part  with  different  useful lives, each part is depreciated separately. The depreciable amount  is  the  asset's  carrying  amount  less  its  residual value at the end of its useful life, if it is significant and can be reasonably determined. Land is not depreciated, even when acquired together with a building. Tangible assets held for sale are not depreciated (see the accounting policy for  'Assets  held  for  sale  and  discontinued  operations'). Changes in the asset's useful life, in its residual value or in the pattern of consumption of the future economic benefits embodied in the asset, are accounted for prospectively.\n\nAssets  to  be  handed  over  for  no  consideration  are depreciated over the shorter term between the duration of the concession or the asset's useful life.\n\nReplacement costs of identifiable parts in complex assets are  capitalised  and  depreciated  over  their  useful  life; the  residual  carrying  amount  of  the  part  that  has  been substituted is charged to the profit and loss account. Nonremovable leasehold improvements are depreciated over the earlier of the useful life of the improvements and the lease  term.  Expenditures  for  ordinary  maintenance  and repairs are recognised as an expense as incurred.\n\nThe carrying amount of property, plant and equipment is derecognised  on  disposal  or  when  no  future  economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal; the arising gain or loss is recognised in the profit and loss account.",

The  lease  term  is  the  non-cancellable period  of  a  contract,  together  with,  if  reasonably  certain, periods covered by extension options or by the non-exercise of termination options.\n\nIn particular, the lease liability is initially recognised at the present value of the following lease payments 18 that are not  paid  at  the  commencement  date:  (i)  fixed  payments (including  in-substance  fixed  payments),  less  any  lease incentives  receivable;  (ii)  variable  lease  payments  that depend on an index or a rate 19 ;  (iii)  amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees; (iv)  the  exercise  price  of  a  purchase  option  if  the  lessee is  reasonably  certain  to  exercise  that  option;  and  (v) payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising an option to terminate the lease. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily  determined,  the  lessee's  incremental  borrowing rate. The latter is determined considering the term of the lease, the frequency and currency of the contractual lease\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n205\n\npayments, as well as the features of the lessee's economic environment  (reflected  in  the  country  risk  premium assigned to each country where Eni operates).\n\nAfter the initial recognition, the lease liability is measured on an amortised cost basis and is remeasured, normally, as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the related rightof-use asset, to reflect changes to the lease payments due, essentially,  to:  (i)  modifications  in  the  lease  contract  not accounted as a separate lease; (ii)  changes  in  indexes  or rates  (used  to  determine  the  variable  lease  payments);  or (iii) changes in the assessment of contractual options (e.g. options  to  purchase  the  underlying  asset,  extension  or termination options).\n\nThe right-of-use asset is initially  measured  at  cost,  which comprises:  (i)  the  amount  of  the  initial  measurement  of the lease liability; (ii) any initial direct costs incurred by the lessee 20 ;  (iii)  any  lease  payments  made  at  or  before  the commencement date, less any lease incentives received; and (iv) an estimate of costs to be incurred by the lessee in dismantling and removing the underlying asset, restoring the site on which it is located or restoring the underlying asset to the condition required by the terms and conditions of  the  lease.  After  the  initial  recognition,  the  right-of-use asset  is  adjusted  for  any  accumulated  depreciation 21 , any  accumulated  impairment  losses  (see  the  accounting policy  for  'Impairment  of  non-financial  assets')  and  any remeasurement of the lease liability.\n\nThe depreciation charges of the right-of-use asset and the interest expenses on the lease liability directly attributable to the construction of an asset are capitalised as part of the cost of such asset and subsequently recognised in the profit and loss account through depreciation/impairments or write-off, mainly in the case of exploration assets.\n\nIn the oil and gas activities, the operator of an unincorporated joint operation which enters into a lease contract as the\n\n- (14) The accounting policies related to leases have been defined on the basis of IFRS 16 'Leases' effective from January 1, 2019.

The previous accounting policies about leases required essentially that: (i) assets held under finance lease, or under arrangements that did not take the legal form of a finance lease but substantially transferred all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the leased asset, were recognised, at the commencement of the lease, at their fair value, net of grants attributable to the lessee or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments, within property, plant and equipment as a contra account to a financing payable to the lessor; and (ii) lease payments under an operating lease were recognised as an expense over the lease term.\n- (15) As expressly provided for in IFRS 16, this accounting policy does not apply to leases to explore for and extract resources such as those for oil and gas rights, leases of land and any rights of way related to oil and gas activities.\n- (16) The assessment of whether the contract is, or contains, a lease is performed at the inception date, that is the earlier of the date of a lease agreement and the date of commitment by the parties to the principal terms and conditions of the lease.\n- (17) Eni applies the recognition exemptions allowed for short-term leases (for certain classes of underlying assets) and low-value leases, by recognising the lease payments associated with those leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n- (18) Eni, in accordance with the practical expedient allowed by the accounting standard, does not separate non-lease components from lease components except for main contracts related to upstream activities (drilling rigs), which provide for single payments relating to both lease and non-lease components.\n- (19) Conversely, the other kinds of variable lease payments (e.g. payments that depend on the use of an underlying leased asset) are not included in the carrying amount of the lease liability, but are recognised in the profit and loss account as operating expenses over the lease term.\n- (20) Initial direct costs are incremental costs of obtaining a lease that would not have been incurred if the lease had not been obtained.\n- (21) Depreciation charges are recognised on a systematic basis from the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term. Nevertheless, if the lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the lessee by the end of the lease term, or if the cost of the right-of-use asset reflects that the lessee will exercise a purchase option, the right-of-use asset is depreciated from the commencement date to the end of the useful life of the underlying asset.",

Costs recovered from the followers are recognised as 'Other income and revenues' in the profit and loss account and as net cash provided by operating activities in the statement of cash flows.\n\nDifferently, if a lease contract is signed by all the partners, Eni recognises its share of the right-of-use asset and lease liability on the balance sheet based on its working interest. If Eni does not have primary responsibility for the lease liability,  it  does  not  recognise  any  right-of-use  asset  and lease liability related to the lease contract.\n\nWhen lease contracts are entered into by companies other than  subsidiaries  that  act  as  operators  on  behalf  of  the other  participating  companies  (the  so-called  operating companies), consistent with the provision to recover from the followers the costs related to the oil and gas activities, the  participating  companies  recognise  their  share  of  the right-of-use  assets  and  the  lease  liabilities  based  on  their working interest, defined according to the expected use, to the extent that it is reliably determinable, of the underlying assets.\n\n## Significant  accounting  estimates  and  judgements:  lease transactions\n\nWith  reference  to  lease  contracts,  management  makes significant  estimates  and  judgements  related  to:  (i) determining the lease term, making assumptions about the  exercise  of  extension  and/or  termination  options; (ii)  determining  the  lessee's  incremental  borrowing  rate; (iii)  identifying  and,  where  appropriate,  separating  nonlease  components  from  lease  components,  where  an observable stand-alone price is not readily available, taking into  account  also  the  analysis  performed  with  external experts;  (iv)  recognising  lease  contracts,  for  which  the underlying assets are used in oil and gas activities (mainly drilling  rigs  and  FPSOs),  entered  into  as  operator  within an  unincorporated  joint  operation,  considering  if  the operator has primary responsibility for the liability towards the  third-party  supplier  and  the  relationships  with  the followers; (v) identifying the variable lease payments and the related characteristics in order to include them in the measurement of the lease liability.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## INTANGIBLE ASSETS\n\nIntangible  assets  are  identifiable  non-monetary  assets without physical substance, controlled by the Company and able to produce future economic benefits, and goodwill. An asset is classified as intangible when management is able to distinguish it clearly from goodwill.\n\nIntangible  assets  are  initially  recognised  at  cost  as determined by the criteria used for tangible assets and they are not revalued for financial reporting purposes.\n\nIntangible  assets  with  finite  useful  lives  are  amortised  on a systematic basis over their useful life; the amount to be amortised and the recoverability of the carrying amount are determined in accordance with the criteria described in the accounting policy for 'Property, plant and equipment'.\n\nGoodwill  and  intangible  assets  with  indefinite  useful  lives are  not  amortised.  For  the  recoverability  of  the  carrying amounts of the goodwill and other intangible assets see the accounting policy 'Impairment of non-financial assets'.\n\nCosts of obtaining a contract with a customer are recognised on  the  balance  sheet  if  the  Company  expects  to  recover those costs. The intangible asset arising from those costs is amortised on a systematic basis, that is consistent with the transfer to the customer of the goods or services to which the asset relates, and is tested for impairment.\n\nCosts of technological development activities are capitalised when:  (i)  the  cost  attributable  to  the  development  activity can be measured reliably; (ii) there is the intention and the availability of financial and technical resources to make the asset available for use or sale; and (iii) it can be demonstrated that the asset is able to generate probable future economic benefits.\n\nThe carrying amount of intangible assets is derecognised on  disposal  or  when  no  future  economic  benefits  are expected from its use or disposal; any resulting gain or loss is recognised in the profit and loss account.\n\n## IMPAIRMENT OF NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS\n\nNon-financial assets (tangible assets, intangible assets and\n\nright-of-use  assets)  are  tested  for  impairment  whenever events  or  changes  in  circumstances  indicate  that  the carrying amounts for those assets may not be recoverable. The recoverability assessment is performed for each cashgenerating  unit  (hereinafter  also  CGU)  represented  by  the smallest  identifiable  group  of  assets  that  generate  cash inflows  that  are  largely  independent  of  the  cash  inflows from other assets or group of assets.\n\nCash-generating units may include corporate assets which do not generate cash inflows independently of other assets or group of assets, allocable on a reasonable and consistent",

Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually, and whenever there is any indication of impairment, at the lowest level within the entity at which it is monitored for internal management purposes. Right-of-use assets, which generally  do  not  generate  cash  inflows  independently  of other assets or groups of assets, are allocated to the CGU to which they belong; the right-of-use assets which cannot be fully attributed to a CGU are considered as corporate assets. The  recoverability  of  the  carrying  amount  of  common facilities within the E&P segment is assessed by considering the set of recoverable amounts of the CGUs benefiting from the common facility.\n\nThe recoverability of a CGU is assessed by comparing its carrying amount with the recoverable amount, which is the higher of the CGU's fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. Value in use is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from continuing use of the  CGU  and,  if  significant  and  reliably  measurable,  the cash flows expected to be obtained from its disposal at the end of its useful life, after deducting the costs of disposal. The expected cash flows are determined on the basis of reasonable  and  supportable  assumptions  that  represent management's  best  estimate  of  the  range  of  economic conditions that will exist over the remaining useful life of the cash-generating unit, giving greater weight to external evidence.\n\nThe value in use of CGUs which include material right-of-use assets is calculated, normally, by ignoring lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liabilities.\n\nWith  reference  to  commodity  prices,  management  uses the  price  scenario  adopted  for  economic  and  financial projections and for the evaluation of investments over their entire life. In particular, for the cash flows associated with oil,  natural gas and petroleum products prices (and prices derived from them), the price scenario is approved by the Board of Directors and is based on management's planning assumptions,  in  the  short  and  medium  term,  takes  into account the projections of market analysts and, if there is a sufficient liquidity and reliability level, on the forward prices prevailing in the marketplace.\n\nFor  impairment  test  purposes,  cash  outflows  expected to  be  incurred  to  guarantee  compliance  with  laws  and regulations regarding CO 2 emissions (e.g. Emission Trading Scheme) or on a voluntary basis (e.g. cash outflows related to forestry certificates acquired or produced consistent with the Company's decarbonization strategy - hereinafter also forestry) are taken into account.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn particular, in estimating value in use, the cash outflows for  forestry  projects 22 are  included,  consistent  with  the targets of the decarbonization strategy, within the expected operating  cash  outflows;  in  this  regard,  considering  that the forestry projects can be developed in countries where Eni does not carry out operating activities and given the difficulty to allocate such cash outflows, on a reasonable and consistent basis, to CGUs of the relevant segment, the related discounted cash outflows are treated as a reduction of the headroom of that specific segment.\n\nFor the determination of value in use, the estimated future cash  flows  are  discounted  using  a  rate  that  reflects  a current market assessment of the time value of money and of the risks specific to the asset that are not reflected in the estimated future cash flows. In particular, the discount rate used is the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) adjusted  for  the  specific  country  risk  of  the  CGU.  These adjustments are measured considering information from  external  parties.  WACC  differs  considering  the  risk associated with each operating segment/business where the asset operates. In particular, for the assets belonging to the Global Gas & LNG Portfolio (GGP) segment, the Chemical business and each business within the Eni gas e luce, Power & Renewables segment, taking into account their different risk  compared  to  Eni  as  a  whole,  specific  WACC  rates have been defined on the basis of a sample of comparable companies,  adjusted  to  take  into  account  the  specific country-risk premium. For the other segments/businesses, a single WACC is used considering that the risk is the same to that of Eni as a whole. Value in use is calculated net of the tax effect as this method results in values similar to those resulting from discounting pre-tax cash flows at a pre-tax discount rate derived, through an iteration process, from a post-tax valuation.\n\nWhen the carrying amount of the CGU, including goodwill allocated  thereto,  determined  taking  into  account  any impairment  loss  of  the  non-current  assets  belonging  to the  CGU,  exceeds  its  recoverable  amount,  the  excess  is recognised as an impairment loss. The impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of goodwill; any remaining excess is allocated to the other assets of the unit  pro-rata  on  the  basis  of  the  carrying  amount  of  each asset in the CGU, up to the recoverable amount of assets with finite useful lives.\n\nWhen an impairment loss no longer exists or has decreased, a reversal of the impairment loss is recognised in the profit and loss account. The impairment reversal shall not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for",

An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period 23 .\n\n## GRANTS RELATED TO ASSETS\n\nGovernment  grants  related  to  assets  are  recognised  by deducting them in calculating the carrying amount of the related assets when there is reasonable assurance that the Company will comply with the conditions attaching to them and the grants will be received.\n\n## INVENTORIES\n\nInventories, including compulsory stock, are measured at the lower of purchase or production cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale, or, with reference to inventories of crude oil and petroleum products already  included  in  binding  sale  contracts,  the  contractual selling price. Inventories which are principally acquired with the  purpose  of  selling  in  the  near  future  and  generating  a profit  from  fluctuations  in  price  are  measured  at  fair  value less costs to sell and any subsequent changes in fair value are recognised in the profit and loss account. Materials and other supplies held for use in production are not written down below cost if the finished products in which they will be incorporated are expected to be sold at or above cost.\n\nThe  cost  of  inventories  of  hydrocarbons  (crude  oil, condensates  and  natural  gas)  and  petroleum  products  is determined by applying the weighted average cost method on a three-month basis, or on a different time period (e.g. monthly), when it is justified by the use and the turnover of inventories of crude oil and petroleum products; the cost of  inventories  of  the  Chemical  business  is  determined  by applying the weighted average cost on an annual basis.\n\nWhen  take-or-pay  clauses  are  included  in  long-term  gas purchase  contracts,  pre-paid  gas  volumes  that  are  not withdrawn to fulfill minimum annual take obligations are measured using the pricing formulas contractually defined. They  are  recognised  under  'Other  assets'  as  'Deferred costs', as a contra to 'Trade and other payables' or, after settlement,  to  'Cash  and  cash  equivalents'. The  allocated deferred costs are charged to the profit and loss account: (i)  when  natural  gas  is  actually  withdrawn  -  the  related cost  is  included  in  the  determination  of  the  weighted average cost of  inventories;  and  (ii)  for  the  portion  which\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nis not recoverable, when it is not possible to withdraw the previously  pre-paid  gas,  within  the  contractually  defined deadlines.  Furthermore,  the  allocated  deferred  costs  are tested for economic recoverability by comparing the related carrying amount and their net realisable value, determined adopting the same criteria described for inventories.\n\n## Significant accounting estimates and judgements: impairment of non-financial assets\n\nThe  recoverability  of  non-financial  assets  is  assessed whenever  events  or  changes  in  circumstances  indicate that carrying amounts of the assets are not recoverable. Such impairment indicators include changes in the Group's business  plans,  changes  in  commodity  prices  leading  to unprofitable  performance,  a  reduced  capacity  utilisation of  plants  and,  for  oil  and  gas  properties,  significant downward revisions of estimated proved reserve quantities or significant increase of the estimated development and production  costs.  Determination  as  to  whether  and  how much an asset is impaired involves management estimates on highly uncertain and complex matters such as future commodity prices, future discount rates, future development expenditure and production costs, the effects of inflation and  technology  improvements  on  operating  expenses, production profiles and the outlook for global or regional market supply-and-demand conditions also with reference to the decarbonization process and the effects of changes in regulatory requirements. The definition of CGUs and the identification of their appropriate grouping for the purpose of testing for impairment the carrying amount of goodwill, corporate assets as well as common facilities within the E&P segment, require judgement by management. In particular, CGUs are identified considering, inter alia, how management monitors the entity's operations (such as by business lines) or how management makes decisions about continuing or disposing of the entity's assets and operations.\n\nSimilar  remarks  are  valid  for  assessing  the  physical\n\nrecoverability of assets recognised on the balance sheet (deferred  costs  -  see  also  the  accounting  policy  for 'Inventories') related to natural gas volumes not withdrawn under long-term supply contracts with take-or-pay clauses. The  expected  future  cash  flows  used  for  impairment analyses are based on judgemental assessments of future production volumes, prices and costs, considering available information at the date of review and are discounted by using a rate which considers the risks specific to the asset. For  oil  and  natural  gas  properties,  the  expected  future cash flows are estimated principally based on developed and undeveloped proved reserves including, among other",

The cash flows associated to oil and gas commodities are estimated on the basis of forward market information, if there is a sufficient liquidity and reliability level, on the consensus of independent specialised analysts and on management's forecasts about the evolution of the supply and demand fundamentals.\n\nMore  details  on  the  main  assumptions  underlying  the determination of the recoverable amount of tangible, intangible and right-of-use assets are set out in note 14 - Impairment review  of  tangible  and  intangible  assets  and  right-of-use assets.\n\n## FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\n\n## FINANCIAL ASSETS\n\nFinancial  assets  are  classified,  on  the  basis  of  both contractual  cash  flow  characteristics  and  the  entity's business  model  for  managing  them,  in  the  following categories: (i) financial assets measured at amortised cost; (ii)  financial  assets  measured  at  fair  value  through  other comprehensive income (hereinafter also OCI); (iii) financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nAt initial recognition, a financial asset is measured at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable; at initial recognition, trade receivables that do not have a significant financing component are measured at their transaction price.\n\nAfter  initial  recognition,  financial  assets  whose  contractual terms  give  rise  to  cash  flows  that  are  solely  payments  of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding are measured at amortised cost if they are held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets in order to collect  contractual  cash  flows  (the  so-called  hold  to  collect business model). For financial assets measured at amortised cost, interest income determined using the effective interest rate, foreign exchange differences and any impairment losses 24 (see the accounting policy for 'Impairment of financial assets') are recognised in the profit and loss account.\n\nConversely,  financial  assets  that  are  debt  instruments are  measured  at  fair  value  through  OCI  (hereinafter  also\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n209\n\nFVTOCI)  if  they  are  held  within  a  business  model  whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows  and  selling  financial  assets  (the  so-called  hold  to collect and sell business model). In these cases: (i) interest income determined using the effective interest rate, foreign exchange differences and any impairment losses (see the accounting policy for 'Impairment of financial assets') are recognised  in  the  profit  and  loss  account;  (ii)  changes  in fair value of the instruments are recognised in equity, within other comprehensive income. The accumulated changes in fair value, recognised in the equity reserve related to other comprehensive income, is reclassified to the profit and loss account when the financial asset is derecognised. Currently the Group does not have any financial assets measured at fair value through OCI.\n\nA  financial  asset  represented  by  a  debt  instrument  that is  neither  measured  at  amortised  cost  nor  at  FVTOCI,  is measured  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss  (hereinafter FVTPL); financial assets held for trading fall into this category. Interest income on assets held for trading contributes to the fair value measurement of the instrument and is recognised in 'Finance income (expense)', within 'Net finance income (expense) from financial assets held for trading'.\n\nWhen the purchase or sale of a financial asset is under a contract whose terms require delivery of the asset within the time frame established generally by regulation or convention in the marketplace concerned, the transaction is accounted for on the settlement date.\n\n## CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS\n\nCash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, demand deposits, as well as financial assets originally due, generally, up to three months, readily convertible to known amount of cash and subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.\n\n## IMPAIRMENT OF FINANCIAL ASSETS\n\nThe expected credit loss model is adopted for the impairment of financial assets that are debt instruments, but are not measured at FVTPL 25 .\n\nIn  particular,  the  expected  credit  losses  are  generally measured  by  multiplying: (i) the exposure to the counterparty's  credit  risk  net  of  any  collateral  held  and other credit enhancements (Exposure At Default, EAD); (ii) the probability that the default of the counterparty occurs (Probability of Default, PD); and (iii) the percentage estimate of the exposure that will not be recovered in case of default (Loss Given Default, LGD), considering the past experiences and the range of recovery tools that can be activated (e.g. extrajudicial and/or legal proceedings, etc.).\n\n(25) The expected credit loss model is also adopted for issued financial guarantee contracts not measured at FVTPL.

Considering  the  characteristics  of  the  reference  markets, financial  assets  with  more  than  180  days  past  due  or, in any  case,  with  counterparties  undergoing  litigation, restructuring or renegotiation, are considered to be in default. Counterparties  are  considered  undergoing  litigation  when judicial/legal  proceedings  aimed  to  recover  a  receivable have been activated or are going to be activated.

In limited circumstances, an investment in equity instruments can be measured at cost if it is an appropriate estimate of fair value.\n\n## FINANCIAL LIABILITIES\n\nAt initial recognition, financial liabilities, other than derivative financial instruments, are measured at their fair value, minus transaction  costs  that  are  directly  attributable,  and  are subsequently measured at amortised cost.\n\n## DERIVATIVE  FINANCIAL  INSTRUMENTS  AND  HEDGE ACCOUNTING\n\nDerivative financial instruments, including embedded derivatives  (see  below)  that  are  separated  from  the  host contract, are assets and liabilities measured at their fair value. With reference to the defined risk management objectives and strategy, the qualifying criteria for hedge accounting requires:  (i)  the  existence  of  an  economic  relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument in order to offset the related value changes and the effects of counterparty credit risk do not dominate the economic relationship  between  the  hedged  item  and  the  hedging instrument;  and  (ii)  the  definition  of  the  relationship between the quantity of the hedged item and the quantity of  the  hedging  instrument  (the  so-called  hedge  ratio) consistent  with  the  entity's  risk  management  objectives, under a defined risk management strategy; the hedge ratio is  adjusted,  where  appropriate,  after  taking  into  account any  adequate  rebalancing.  A  hedging  relationship  is discontinued prospectively, in its entirety or a part of it, when it no longer meets the risk management objectives on the basis of which it qualified for hedge accounting, it ceases to meet the other qualifying criteria or after rebalancing it.

In  particular,  the changes in the fair value of non-hedging derivatives on interest rates and exchange rates are recognised in the profit and loss account  line  item  'Finance  income  (expense)';  conversely, the  changes  in  the  fair  value  of  non-hedging  derivatives  on commodities  are  recognised  in  the  profit  and  loss  account line  item  'Other  operating  (expense)  income'.  Derivatives embedded in financial assets are not accounted for separately; in such circumstances, the entire hybrid instrument is classified depending on the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial instrument and the business model for managing it (see the accounting policy for 'Financial assets'). Derivatives embedded in financial liabilities and/or non-financial assets are separated if: (i) the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative are not closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract; (ii) a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative would  meet  the  definition  of  a  derivative;  and  (iii)  the  entire hybrid contract is not measured at FVTPL.\n\nEni  assesses  the  existence  of  embedded  derivatives  to be separated when it becomes party to the contract and, afterwards, when a change in the terms of the contract that modifies its cash flows occurs.\n\nContracts  to  buy  or  sell  commodities  entered  into  and continued  to  be  held  for  the  purpose  of  their  receipt  or delivery in accordance with the Group's expected purchase, sale or usage requirements are recognised on an accrual\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n211\n\nbasis  (the  so-called  normal  sale  and  normal  purchase exemption or own use exemption).\n\n## OFFSETTING OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES\n\nFinancial  assets  and  liabilities  are  set  off  on  the  balance sheet if the Group currently has a legally enforceable right to set off and intends to settle on a net basis (or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously).\n\n## DERECOGNITION OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES\n\nTransferred  financial  assets  are  derecognised  when  the contractual rights to receive the cash flows from the financial assets expire or are transferred to another party. Financial liabilities are derecognised when they are extinguished, or when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expired.\n\n## PROVISIONS, CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND CONTINGENT ASSETS\n\nA provision is a liability of uncertain timing or amount on the balance sheet date. Provisions are recognised when: (i)  there is a present obligation, legal or constructive, as a result of a past event; (ii) it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; and (iii) the amount of the obligation can  be  reliably  estimated.  The  amount  recognised  as  a provision is the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation or to transfer it to third parties at  the  balance  sheet  date.  The  amount  recognised  for onerous contracts is the lower of the cost necessary to fulfill the obligations, net of expected economic benefits deriving from  the  contracts,  and  any  compensation  or  penalties arising  from  failure  to  fulfill  these  obligations.  Where  the effect of the time value is material, and the payment date of the obligations can be reasonably estimated, provisions to  be  accrued  are  the  present  value  of  the  expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation at a discount rate  that  reflects  the  Company's  average  borrowing  rate taking into account the risks associated with the obligation. The  change  in  provisions  due  to  the  passage  of  time  is recognised within 'Finance income (expense)'.\n\nA provision for restructuring costs is recognised only when the Company has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring and has raised a valid expectation in the affected parties that it will carry out the restructuring.\n\nProvisions are periodically reviewed and adjusted to reflect changes  in  the  estimates  of  costs,  timing  and  discount rates.  Changes  in  provisions  are  recognised  in  the  same profit and loss account line item where the original provision was charged.",

Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the financial statements, but are disclosed.\n\nContingent assets, that are possible assets arising from past events  and  whose  existence  will  be  confirmed  only  by  the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Company, are not recognised  in  financial  statements  unless  the  realisation  of economic benefits is virtually  certain.  Contingent  assets  are disclosed  when  an  inflow  of  economic  benefits  is  probable. Contingent  assets  are  assessed  periodically  to  ensure  that developments  are  appropriately  reflected  in  the  financial statements.\n\n## DECOMMISSIONING AND RESTORATION LIABILITIES\n\nLiabilities  for  decommissioning  and  restoration  costs  are recognized, together with a corresponding amount as part of the related property, plant and equipment, when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation and when a reliable estimate can be made.\n\nConsidering the long time span between the recognition of the  obligation  and  its  settlement,  the  amount  recognised is the present value of the future expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation. Any change due to the unwinding  of  discount  on  provisions  is  recognised  within 'Finance income (expense)'.\n\nSuch liabilities are reviewed regularly to take into account the changes in the expected costs to be incurred, contractual obligations, regulatory requirements and practices in force in the countries where the tangible assets are located.\n\nThe effects of any changes in the estimate of the liability are recognised generally as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the related property, plant and equipment; however, if the resulting decrease in the liability exceeds the carrying amount of the related asset, the excess is recognised in the profit and loss account.\n\nAnalogous approach is adopted for present obligations to realise social projects related to operating activities carried out by the Company.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Significant accounting estimates and judgements: decommissioning  and  restoration  liabilities,  environmental liabilities and other provisions\n\nThe Group holds provisions for dismantling and removing items of property, plant and equipment, and restoring land or seabed at the end of the oil and gas production activity. Estimating  obligations  to  dismantle,  remove  and  restore items  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  is  complex.  It requires management to make estimates and judgements with respect to removal obligations that will come to term many years into the future and contracts and regulations are often unclear as to what constitutes removal. In addition, the  ultimate  financial  impact  of  environmental  laws  and regulations is not always clearly known as asset removal technologies and costs constantly evolve in the countries where Eni operates, as do political, environmental, safety and public expectations.\n\nThe discount rate used to determine the provision and the timing of future cash outflows, as well as any related update, are based on complex managerial judgements.\n\nDecommissioning  and  restoration  provisions,  recognised  in the financial statements, include, essentially, the present value of the expected costs for decommissioning oil and natural gas facilities at the end of the economic lives of fields, wellplugging, abandonment and site restoration of the Exploration & Production segment. Any decommissioning and restoration provisions  associated  with  the  other  segments'  assets  are generally  not  recognised,  as  the  obligations,  given  their indeterminate settlement dates, also considering the strategy to reconvert plants in order to produce low carbon products, cannot  be  reliably  measured.  In  this  regard,  Eni  performs periodic reviews for any changes in facts and circumstances that  might  require  recognition  of  a  decommissioning  and restoration provision.\n\nAs other oil and gas companies, Eni is subject to numerous EU,  national,  regional  and  local  environmental  laws  and regulations concerning its oil and gas operations, production and other activities. They include legislations that implement international conventions or protocols. Environmental liabilities are  recognised  when  it  becomes  probable  that  an  outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and such obligation can be reliably estimated 27 .\n\nManagement, considering the actions already taken, insurance policies obtained to cover environmental risks and provisions already recognised, does not expect any material adverse effect\n\n(27) With reference to the environmental liabilities assumed, the expected operating costs to be incurred for managing groundwater treatment plants are not included in the estimates of environmental liabilities because it is not possible to reliably define a time horizon within which the operations of the plant will be terminated. In this regard, Eni performs periodic reviews for any changes in facts and circumstances, including changes in regulatory framework and technology, that might require the recognition of the environmental liability.",

However, there can be no assurance that there will not be a material adverse impact on Eni's consolidated results of operations and financial position due to: (i) the possibility of an unknown contamination; (ii) the results of the ongoing surveys and other possible effects of statements required  by  applicable  laws;  (iii)  the  possible  effects  of  future environmental legislations and rules; (iv) the effects of possible technological  changes  relating  to  future  remediation;  and  (v) the possibility of litigation and the difficulty of determining Eni's liability, if any, against other potentially responsible parties with respect to such litigations and the possible reimbursements.\n\nIn addition to environmental and decommissioning and restoration liabilities, Eni recognises provisions primarily related to legal and trade proceedings. These provisions are estimated on the basis of complex managerial judgements related to the amounts to be recognised and the timing of future cash outflows. After the initial recognition, provisions are periodically reviewed and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate.\n\n## EMPLOYEE BENEFITS\n\nEmployee benefits are considerations given by the Group in exchange for service rendered by employees or for the termination of employment.\n\nPost-employment benefit plans, including informal arrangements, are classified as either defined contribution plans or defined benefit plans depending on the economic substance of the plan as derived from its principal terms and  conditions.  Under  defined  contribution  plans,  the Company's obligation, which consists in making payments to the State or to a trust or a fund, is determined on the basis of contributions due.\n\nThe liabilities related to defined benefit plans, net of any plan  assets,  are  determined  on  the  basis  of  actuarial assumptions and charged on an accrual basis during the employment period required to obtain the benefits.\n\nNet  interest  includes  the  return  on  plan  assets  and  the interest cost to be recognised in the profit and loss account. Net interest is measured by applying to the liability, net of any  plan  assets,  the  discount  rate  used  to  calculate  the present value of the liability; net interest of defined benefit plans is recognised in 'Finance income (expense)'.\n\nRemeasurements  of  the  net  defined  benefit  liability, comprising  actuarial  gains  and  losses,  resulting  from changes in the actuarial assumptions used or from changes arising  from  experience  adjustments,  and  the  return  on plan  assets  excluding  amounts  included  in  net  interest, are  recognised  within  the  statement  of  comprehensive income. Remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n213\n\nrecognised  within  other  comprehensive  income,  are  not reclassified subsequently to the profit and loss account. Obligations for long-term benefits are determined by adopting actuarial assumptions. The effects of remeasurements are taken to profit and loss account in their entirety.\n\n## SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS\n\nThe line item 'Payroll and related costs' includes the cost of the share-based incentive plan, consistent with its actual remunerative nature. The cost of the share-based incentive plan is measured by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments  granted  and  the  estimate  of  the  number  of shares that eventually vest; the cost is recognised on an accrual basis pro rata temporis over the vesting period, that is the period between the grant date and the settlement date. The fair value of the shares underlying the incentive plan is measured at the grant date, taking into account the estimate of achievement of market conditions (e.g. Total Shareholder  Return),  and  is  not  adjusted  in  subsequent periods;  when  the  achievement  is  linked  also  to  nonmarket conditions, the number of shares expected to vest is adjusted during the vesting period to reflect the updated estimate of these conditions. If, at the end of the vesting period, the incentive plan does not vest because of failure to satisfy the performance conditions, the portion of cost related to market conditions is not reversed to the profit and loss account\n\n## Significant accounting estimates and judgements: employee benefits and share-based payments\n\nDefined  benefit  plans  are  evaluated  with  reference  to uncertain  events  and  based  upon  actuarial  assumptions including,  among  others,  discount  rates,  expected  rates of  salary  increases,  mortality  rates,  estimated  retirement dates and medical cost trends. The significant assumptions used to account for defined benefit plans are determined as follows: (i) discount and inflation rates are based on the market  yields  on  high  quality  corporate  bonds  (or,  in  the absence of a deep market of these bonds, on the market yields on government bonds) and on the expected inflation rates  in  the  reference  currency  area;  (ii)  the  future  salary levels of the individual employees are determined including an  estimate  of  future  changes  attributed  to  general price  levels  (consistent  with  inflation  rate  assumptions), productivity,  seniority  and  promotion;  (iii)  healthcare  cost trend assumptions reflect an estimate of the actual future changes  in  the  cost  of  the  healthcare  related  benefits provided to the plan participants and are based on past and  current  healthcare  cost  trends,  including  healthcare",

Similar to the approach followed for the fair value measurement of financial instruments, the fair value of the shares underlying the incentive plans is measured by using complex  valuation  techniques  and  identifying,  through structured judgements, the assumptions to be adopted.\n\n## EQUITY INSTRUMENTS\n\n## TREASURY SHARES\n\nTreasury  shares,  including  shares  held  to  meet  the  future requirements of the share-based incentive plans, are recognised as deductions from equity at cost. Any gain or loss resulting from subsequent sales is recognised in equity.\n\n## HYBRID BONDS\n\nThe perpetual subordinated hybrid bonds are classified in the financial statements as equity instruments considering that the issuer has the unconditional right to defer, until the date of its own liquidation, the repayment of the principal amount and the payment of accrued interest 28 . Therefore, the issuer recognises the cash received from the bondholders, net of costs incurred in issuing the hybrid bonds, as an increase in Eni owners' equity; differently, the repayments of the principal amount  and  the  payments  of  accrued  interest  (upon  the arising  of  the  related  contractual  payment  obligation)  are accounted for as a decrease in Eni owners' equity.\n\n## REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS\n\nRevenue  from  contracts  with  customers  is  recognised on the basis of the following five steps: (i) identifying the contract with the customer; (ii) identifying the performance obligations,  that  are  promises  in  a  contract  to  transfer goods and/or services to a customer; (iii) determining the transaction  price;  (iv)  allocating  the  transaction  price  to each performance obligation on the basis of the relative stand-alone selling prices of each good or service; and (v)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nrecognising revenue when (or as) a performance obligation is  satisfied,  that  is  when  a  promised  good  or  service  is transferred to a customer. A promised good or service is transferred when (or as) the customer obtains control of it. Control can be transferred over time or at a point in time. With reference to the most important products sold by Eni, revenue is generally recognised for:\n\n- \uf0da crude oil, upon shipment;\n- \uf0da natural gas and electricity, upon delivery to the customer;\n- \uf0da petroleum  products  sold  to  retail  distribution  networks, upon delivery to the service stations, whereas all other sales of petroleum products are recognised upon shipment;\n- \uf0da chemical products and other products, upon shipment.\n\nRevenue from crude oil and natural gas production from properties in which Eni has an interest together with other producers  is  recognised  on  the  basis  of  the  quantities actually lifted and sold (sales method); costs are recognised on the basis of the quantities actually sold.\n\nRevenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for  transferring  promised  goods  and/or  services  to  a customer, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties. In determining the transaction price, the promised amount of consideration is adjusted for the effects of the time value of money if the timing of payments agreed to by the parties to the contract provides the customer or the entity with a significant benefit of financing the transfer of goods or services to the customer. The promised amount of consideration is not adjusted for the effect of the significant financing component if, at contract inception, it is expected that the period between the transfer of a promised good or service to a customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will be one year or less. If the consideration promised  in  a  contract  includes  a  variable  amount,  the Company estimates the amount of consideration to which it will be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised goods  and/or  services  to  a  customer;  in  particular,  the amount of consideration can vary because of discounts, refunds, incentives, price concessions, performance bonuses,  penalties  or  if  the  price  is  contingent  on  the occurrence or non-occurrence of future events.\n\nIf, in a contract, the Company grants a customer the option to acquire additional goods or services for free or at a discount (e.g. sales incentives, customer award points, etc.), this option gives rise to a separate performance obligation in the contract only if the option provides a material right to the customer that it would not receive without entering into that contract. When goods or services are exchanged for goods or services which are of a similar nature and value, the exchange is not regarded as a transaction which generates revenue.",

        "page_content": "## Significant accounting estimates and judgements: revenue from contracts with customers\n\nRevenue from sales of electricity and gas to retail customers includes the amount accrued for electricity and gas supplied between the date of the last invoiced meter reading (actual or estimated) of volumes consumed and the end of the year. These estimates consider mainly information provided by the grid managers about the volumes allocated among the customers of the secondary distribution network, about the actual  and  estimated  volumes  consumed  by  customers. Therefore,  revenue  is  accrued  as  a  result  of  a  complex estimate based on the volumes distributed and allocated, communicated  by  third  parties,  likely  to  be  adjusted, according  to  applicable  regulations,  within  the  fifth  year following  the  one  in  which  they  are  accrued.  Considering the contractual obligations on the supply delivery points, revenue from sales of electricity and gas to retail customers includes  costs  for  transportation  and  dispatching  and  in these cases the gross amount of consideration to which the Company is entitled is recognised.\n\n## COSTS\n\nCosts are recognised when the related goods and services are  sold  or  consumed  during  the  year,  when  they  are allocated  on  a  systematic  basis  or  when  their  future economic benefits cannot be identified.  Costs  associated with  emission  quotas,  incurred  to  meet  the  compliance requirements  (e.g.  Emission  Trading  Scheme)  determined on the basis of market prices, are recognised in relation to the amounts of the carbon dioxide emissions that exceed free  allowances.  Costs  related  to  the  purchase  of  the emission rights that exceed the amount necessary to meet regulatory obligations are recognised as intangible assets. Revenue  related  to  emission  quotas  is  recognised  when they are sold. The costs incurred on a voluntary basis for the acquisition or production of forestry certificates, also taking into account the absence of an active market, are recognised in the profit and loss account when incurred.\n\nThe  costs  for  the  acquisition  of  new  knowledge  or discoveries, the study of products or alternative processes, new techniques or models, the planning and construction of  prototypes  or,  in  any  case,  costs  incurred  for  other scientific research activities or technological development, which cannot be capitalised (see also the accounting policy for 'Intangible assets'), are included in the profit and loss account when they are incurred.\n\n## EXCHANGE DIFFERENCES\n\nRevenues and costs associated with transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency by applying the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n215\n\nand liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the spot exchange rate on the balance sheet date and any resulting exchange differences are included in the profit and loss account within 'Finance income (expense)'  or,  if  designated  as  hedging  instruments  for  the foreign currency risk, in the same line item in which the economic effects of the hedged item are recognised. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, measured at cost, are not retranslated subsequent to initial recognition. Nonmonetary items measured at fair value, recoverable amount or net realisable value are retranslated using the exchange rate at the date when the value is determined.\n\n## DIVIDENDS\n\nDividends are recognised when the right to receive payment of the dividend is established.\n\nDividends  and  interim  dividends  to  owners  are  shown  as changes  in  equity  when  the  dividends  are  declared  by, respectively,  the  shareholders'  meeting  and  the  Board  of Directors.\n\n## INCOME TAXES\n\nCurrent  income  taxes  are  determined  on  the  basis  of estimated  taxable  profit.  Current  income  tax  assets  and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be paid to (recovered from) the taxation authorities, using tax rates and the tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for temporary differences  arising  between  the  carrying  amounts  of  the assets and liabilities and their tax bases, based on tax rates and tax laws that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. Deferred tax assets are recognised when their recoverability is considered probable, i.e.  when  it  is  probable  that  sufficient  taxable  profit  will  be available in the same year as the reversal of the deductible temporary difference. Similarly, deferred tax assets for the carry-forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses are recognised to the extent that their recoverability is probable. The carrying amount of the deferred tax assets is reviewed, at least, on an annual basis.\n\nIf  there  is  uncertainty  over  income  tax  treatments,  if  the company concludes it is probable that the taxation authority will accept an uncertain tax treatment, it determines the (current and/or deferred) income taxes to be recognised in the financial statements consistent with the tax treatment used or planned to be used in its income tax filings. Conversely, if the company concludes it is not probable that the taxation authority will accept an uncertain tax treatment, the company reflects the effect of",

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are presented within non-current assets and liabilities and are offset at a single entity level if related to offsettable taxes. The balance of the offset, if positive, is recognised in  the line item 'Deferred tax assets' and, if negative, in the line item 'Deferred tax liabilities'. When the results of transactions are recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, the related current and deferred taxes are also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.\n\n## Significant accounting estimates and judgements: income taxes\n\nThe computation of income taxes involves the interpretation  of  applicable  tax  laws  and  regulations  in many jurisdictions throughout the world. Although Eni aims to  maintain  a  relationship  with  the  taxation  authorities characterised by transparency, dialogue and cooperation (e.g. by not using aggressive tax planning and by using, if available, procedures intended to eliminate or reduce tax litigations), there can be no assurance that there will not be a tax litigation with the taxation authorities where the legislation could be open to more than one interpretation. The resolution of tax disputes, through negotiations with relevant  taxation  authorities  or  through  litigation,  could take several years to complete. The estimate of liabilities related  to  uncertain  tax  treatments  requires  complex judgements by management. After the initial recognition, these liabilities are periodically reviewed for any changes in facts and circumstances.\n\nManagement makes complex judgements regarding mainly the assessment of the recoverability of deferred tax assets, related both to deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses, which requires estimates and evaluations about the amount and the timing of future taxable profits.\n\n## ASSETS HELD FOR SALE AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\n\nNon-current  assets  and  current  and  non-current  assets included  within  disposal  groups,  are  classified  as  held for  sale  if  their  carrying  amounts  will  be  recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through their  continuing  use.  This  condition  is  regarded  as  met only  when  the  sale  is  highly  probable  and  the  asset  or\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthe disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition. When there is a sale plan involving loss of control of a subsidiary, all the assets and liabilities of that subsidiary are classified as held for sale, regardless of whether a non-controlling interest in its former subsidiary will be retained after the sale.\n\nNon-current assets held for sale, current and non-current assets  included  within  disposal  groups  that  have  been classified  as  held  for  sale  and  the  liabilities  directly associated with them are recognised on the balance sheet separately from other assets and liabilities.\n\nImmediately  before  the  initial  classification  of  a  noncurrent asset and/or a disposal group as held for sale, the non-current  asset  and/or  the  assets  and  liabilities  in  the disposal group are measured in accordance with applicable IFRSs.  Subsequently,  non-current  assets  held  for  sale  are not depreciated or amortised and they are measured at the lower of the fair value less costs to sell and their carrying amount. If an equity-accounted investment, or a portion of that investment meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale, it is no longer accounted for using the equity method and it is measured at the lower of its carrying amount at the date the equity method is discontinued, and its fair value less costs to sell. Any retained portion of the equity-accounted investment that has not been classified as held for sale is accounted for using the equity method until disposal of the portion that is classified as held for sale takes place.\n\nAny difference between the carrying amount of the noncurrent assets and the fair value less costs to sell is taken to the profit and loss account as an impairment loss; any subsequent reversal is recognised up to the cumulative impairment  losses,  including  those  recognised  prior  to qualification  of  the  asset  as  held  for  sale.  Non-current assets classified as held for sale and disposal groups are considered a discontinued operation if they, alternatively: (i) represent a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations; (ii) are part of a disposal program of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations; or (iii) are a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale. The results of discontinued operations, as well as any gain or loss recognised on the disposal, are  indicated  in  a  separate  line  item  of  the  profit  and loss account, net of the related tax effects; the economic figures of discontinued operations are indicated also for prior periods presented in the financial statements.\n\nIf  events  or  circumstances  occur  that  no  longer  allow  to classify  a  non-current  asset  or  a  disposal  group  as  held for  sale,  the  non-current  asset  or  the  disposal  group  is reclassified into the original line items of the balance sheet and measured at the lower of: (i) its carrying amount at the date of classification as held for sale adjusted for any depreciation,",

Fair value measurement is based on the market conditions existing at the measurement date and on the assumptions of market participants  (market-based  measurement).  A  fair  value measurement assumes that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place in the principal market for the asset or liability, or in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market to which the entity has access, independently from the entity's intention to sell the asset or transfer the liability to be measured.\n\nA  fair  value  measurement  of  a  non-financial  asset  takes into  account  a  market  participant's  ability  to  generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use. Highest and best use is determined from the perspective of market participants, even if the entity intends a different use; an entity's current use of a non-financial asset is presumed to be its highest and best use, unless market or other factors suggest that a different use by market participants would maximise the value of the asset.\n\nThe fair value of a liability, both financial and non-financial, or of the Company's own equity instrument, in the absence of a quoted price, is measured from the perspective of a market participant that holds the identical item as an asset at the measurement date. The fair value of financial instruments  takes  into  account  the  counterparty's  credit risk  for  a  financial  asset  (Credit  Valuation  Adjustment, CVA)  and  the  Company's  own  credit  risk  for  a  financial liability (Debit Valuation Adjustment, DVA). In the absence of available market quotation, fair value is measured by using  valuation  techniques  that  are  appropriate  in  the circumstances, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.\n\n## Significant accounting estimates and judgements: fair value\n\nFair  value  measurement,  although  based  on  the  best available information and on the use of appropriate valuation techniques,  is  inherently  uncertain,  requires  the  use  of professional judgement and could result in expected values other than the actual ones.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n217\n\n## 2 PRIMARY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nAssets and liabilities on the balance sheet are classified as current and non-current. Items in the profit and loss account are presented by nature. Assets and liabilities are classified as current when: (i) they are expected to be realised/settled in the entity's normal operating cycle or within twelve months after  the  balance  sheet  date;  (ii)  they  are  cash  or  cash equivalents unless they are restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least twelve months after the balance sheet date; or (iii) they are held primarily for the purpose of trading. Derivative financial instruments held for trading are classified as current, apart from their maturity date. Non hedging derivative financial instruments, which are entered into to manage risk exposures but do not satisfy the formal requirements to be considered as hedging, and hedging derivative financial instruments are classified as current when they are expected to be realised/settled within twelve months after the balance sheet date; on the contrary they are classified as non-current.\n\nThe statement of comprehensive income (loss) shows net profit integrated with income and expenses that are not recognised directly in the profit and loss account according to IFRSs.\n\nThe  statement  of  changes  in  equity  includes  the  total comprehensive income (loss) for the year, transactions with owners in their capacity as owners and other changes in equity. The statement of cash flows is presented using the indirect method, whereby net profit (loss) is adjusted for the effects of non-cash transactions.\n\n## 3 CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nThe  amendments  to  IFRSs  effective  from  January  1, 2020 and adopted by Eni, did not have a material impact on  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements.  In  this  regard, the  amendments  to  IFRS  16  'COVID-19-Related  Rent Concessions', effective for 2020, were applied to immaterial cases.\n\n## 4 IFRSs NOT YET EFFECTIVE\n\n## IFRSs ISSUED BY THE IASB AND ADOPTED BY THE EU\n\nBy  the  Commission  Regulation  No.  2021/25  issued  by  the European Commission on January 13, 2021, the amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 'Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase 2' (hereinafter the amendments) were adopted. The amendments provide practical expedients and temporary exceptions from the application of some IFRS requirements  related  to  financial  instruments  measured  at amortised  cost  and/or  hedging  relationships  modified  as a consequence of the interest rate benchmark reform.

Because of further amendments issued on July 15, 2020 ('Classification  of  Liabilities  as  Current  or  Non-current -  Deferral  of  Effective  Date'),  the  amendments  shall  be applied for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023.\n\nOn May 14, 2020, the IASB issued:\n\n- \uf0da the amendments to IAS 37 'Onerous Contracts - Cost of Fulfilling a Contract' (hereinafter the amendments), aimed to  provide  clarifications  for  the  purpose  of  assessing whether a contract is onerous. The amendments shall be applied for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2022;\n- \uf0da the amendments  to  IAS  16  'Property,  Plant  and Equipment:  Proceeds  before  Intended  Use'  (hereinafter the amendments), aimed to state that the proceeds from selling items produced while the company is preparing the asset for its intended use shall be recognised in the profit\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nand loss account, together with the related production costs.  The  amendments  shall  be  applied  for  annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2022;\n\n- \uf0da the amendments to IFRS 3 'Reference to the Conceptual Framework' (hereinafter the amendments), aimed to: (i) replace all remaining references to the previous versions of  the  IFRS  Framework  with  references  to  the  new Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting included in IFRS 3; (ii) provide clarifications on the requirements for recognising, at the acquisition date, provisions, contingent liabilities and levies assumed in a business combination; (iii) state  explicitly  that  a  contingent  asset  acquired in  a  business  combination  cannot  be  recognised.  The amendments shall be applied for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2022;\n- \uf0da the  document 'Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2018-2020',  which  includes,  basically,  technical  and editorial changes to existing standards. The amendments to  the  standards  shall  be  applied  for  annual  reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2022.\n\nOn February 12, 2021, the IASB issued:\n\n- \uf0da the amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2  'Disclosure  of  Accounting  Policies'  (hereinafter  the amendments), aimed to provide clarifications on identifying the  material  accounting  policies  to  be  disclosed  in  the financial statements. The amendments shall be applied for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023;\n- \uf0da the  amendments  to  IAS  8  'Definition  of  Accounting Estimates' (hereinafter the amendments), which introduce the  definition  of  accounting  estimates  essentially  to clarify how to distinguish changes in accounting policies from changes in accounting estimates. The amendments shall be applied for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023.\n\nEni is currently reviewing the IFRSs not yet adopted in order to determine the likely impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.",

The  Nigerian  national  oil  company  NNPC  owed  an amount  to  Eni  of  \u20ac605  million  (\u20ac764  million  at  December 31, 2019), in relation to past investments. About half of this amount  is  subject  to  a  'Repayment  Agreement',  whereby Eni is to be reimbursed through the sale of the entitlement attributable to NNPC in certain rig-less petroleum initiatives with low mineral risk, with an expected completion of the reimbursement plan within the next two/three years based on Eni's Brent price scenario. The receivable is stated net of a discount factor equal to 8%, calculated based on the risk of the underlying mineral initiative. The amounts past due related to current investment activities were assessed based on more conservative assumptions than the ones adopted in  previous  reporting  periods  to  factor  in  an  increased counterparty risk due to COVID-19 developments. A privately held Nigerian oil company owed us \u20ac134 million (\u20ac113 million at December 31, 2019) which were past due at the reporting date. These amounts were stated net of a provision based on the loss given default (LGD) defined by Eni for international oil companies in a default state.\n\nReceivables from other counterparties comprised: (i) recoverable  amounts  for  \u20ac376  million  (\u20ac373  million  at December  31,  2019)  of  certain  overdue  trade  receivables\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ntowards the state-owned oil company of Venezuela, PDVSA, in relation to gas equity volumes supplied by the joint venture Card\u00f3n  IV,  equally  participated  by  Eni  and  Repsol.  Those trade receivables were divested by the joint venture to the two  shareholders.  The  receivables  were  stated  net  of  an allowance for doubtful accounts estimated on the basis of average  recovery  percentages  obtained  by  creditors  in  the context of sovereign defaults, adjusted to reflect the strategic value of the Oil & Gas sector, and also applied for assessing the recoverability of the carrying amount of the investment and the long-term interest in the initiative, as described in note 16 - Other financial assets. Risks associated with the complex financial outlook of the Country and the deteriorated operating environment were taken into account in the estimation of the expected loss by assuming a deferral in the timing of collection of future revenues and overdue credit amounts, which resulted in an expected credit loss rate of about 53%. During the year the percentages of collection of gas sales by the joint venture were in line with the estimated assumptions; (ii) amounts to be received from customers following the triggering of the takeor-pay clause of long-term supply contracts for \u20ac325 million (\u20ac104 million at December 31, 2019).\n\nTrade and other receivables stated in euro and U.S. dollars amounted to \u20ac5,553 million and \u20ac4,304 million, respectively.

With regard to customers of the Eni gas e luce business line, the recoverability assessments incorporate the most updated information relating to the performance in credit collection and the ageing of overdue amounts.\n\nThe exposure to credit risk and expected losses relating to customers of the Eni gas e luce business line was assessed based on a provision matrix as follows:\n\n|                                 |              | Ageing              | Ageing              | Ageing               | Ageing          |       |\n|---------------------------------|--------------|---------------------|---------------------|----------------------|-----------------|-------|\n| (\u20ac million)                     | Not-past due | from 0  to 3 months | from 3  to 6 months | from 6  to 12 months | over  12 months | Total |\n| December 31, 2020               |              |                     |                     |                      |                 |       |\n| Customers - Eni gas e luce:     |              |                     |                     |                      |                 |       |\n| - Retail                        | 1,155        | 105                 | 50                  | 102                  | 366             | 1,778 |\n| - Middle                        | 75           | 16                  | 3                   | 8                    | 232             | 334   |\n| - Other                         | 61           |                     |                     |                      |                 | 61    |\n| Gross amount                    | 1,291        | 121                 | 53                  | 110                  | 598             | 2,173 |\n| Allowance for doubtful accounts | (46)         | (23)                | (22)                | (57)                 | (498)           | (646) |\n| Net amount                      | 1,245        | 98                  | 31                  | 53                   | 100             | 1,527 |\n| Expected loss (%)               | 3.6          | 19.0                | 41.5                | 51.8                 | 83.3            | 29.7  |\n| December 31, 2019               |              |                     |                     |                      |                 |       |\n| Customers - Eni gas e luce:     |              |                     |                     |                      |                 |       |\n| - Retail                        | 991          | 105                 | 60                  | 86                   | 376             | 1,618 |\n| - Middle                        | 93           | 29                  | 4                   | 14                   | 263             | 403   |\n| - Other                         | 76           | 3                   | 1                   | 2                    | 2               | 84    |\n| Gross amount                    | 1,160        | 137                 | 65                  | 102                  | 641             | 2,105 |\n| Allowance for doubtful accounts | (16)         | (27)                | (26)                | (49)                 | (548)           | (666) |\n| Net amount                      | 1,144        | 110                 | 39                  | 53                   | 93              | 1,439 |\n| Expected loss (%)               | 1.4          | 19.7                | 40.0                | 48.0                 | 85.5            | 31.6  |\n\nTrade and other receivables are stated net of the allowance for doubtful accounts which has been determined considering the\n\ncounterpart risk mitigation factors amounting to \u20ac1,016 million (\u20ac2,914 million at December 31, 2019):\n\n| (\u20ac million)                                             | 2020   | 2019   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Allowance for doubtful accounts - beginning of the year | 3,246  | 3,150  |\n| Additions on trade and other performing receivables     | 112    | 95     |\n| Additions on trade and other defaulted receivables      | 231    | 525    |\n| Deductions on trade and other performing receivables    | (82)   | (119)  |\n| Deductions on trade and other defaulted receivables     | (275)  | (484)  |\n| Other changes                                           | (75)   | 79     |\n| Allowance for doubtful accounts - end of the year       | 3,157  | 3,246  |",

As of December 31, 2020, the net book value of the property amounted to \u20ac1,085 million,  including  capitalized  exploration  costs  and  predevelopment costs. The acquisition of OPL 245 is subject to judicial proceedings in Italy and in Nigeria for alleged corruption  and  money  laundering  in  respect  of  the Resolution Agreement signed on April 29, 2011, relating to the purchase of the license. This proceeding is disclosed in note 27 - Guarantees, Commitments and Risks - legal proceedings. The impairment test of the asset confirmed the book value. The impairment review was based on the assumption  that  the  exploration  licence  due  to  expire in May 2021 will be renewed or converted into a mining licence. Eni filed an application for renewal/conversion of the licence in compliance with the contractual terms. Considering  the  inaction  of  the  Nigerian  authorities  in charge of the matter towards the legitimate request of\n\nthe  Company  and  the  closeness  of  the  expiry  date  of\n\nthe licence, in September 2020 Eni started an arbitration at  ICSID,  the  international  centre  for  settlement  of investment disputes, to protect the value of its asset. Accumulated  provisions  for  impairments  amounted  to \u20ac20,343 million (\u20ac18,226 million at December 31, 2019). Property, plant and equipment include assets subject to operating leases for \u20ac358 million, essentially relating to service stations of the Refining & Marketing business line. At  December  31,  2020,  Eni  pledged  property,  plant  and equipment  for  \u20ac24  million  to  guarantee  payments  of excise duties (same amount as of December 31, 2019). Government grants recorded as a decrease of property, plant  and  equipment  amounted  to  \u20ac103  million  (\u20ac112 million at December 31, 2019).\n\nContractual  commitments  related  to  the  purchase  of property, plant and equipment are disclosed in note 27 Guarantees, commitments and risks - Liquidity risk.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment under concession arrangements  are  described  in  note  27  -  Guarantees, commitments  and  risks  -  Assets  under  concession arrangements.",

The acquired entity engaged in the retail sale of gas to the residential  sector  and  middle  and  small-sized  businesses in  Italy.  In  addition,  further  goodwill  amounts  have  been allocated over the years following business combinations with  small,  local  companies  selling  gas  to  residential customers  in  focused  territorial  reach  and  municipalities synergic  to  Eni's  activities,  the  latest  of  which  was  the acquisition  of  70%  of  Evolvere  group,  operating  in  the business of distributed generation from renewable sources, in line with the strategy of growing the market share in the retail sector through the diversification of the product mix by\n\noffering green electricity.

These cash flows were discounted by using the post-tax WACC of the retail business adjusted considering the specific country risk for Italy of 4.3%.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Goodwill  allocated  to  the  CGU  Foreign  market  related  for \u20ac95 million to Eni Gas & Power France SA (former Altergaz SA) operating in France and for \u20ac45 million to the acquisition in 2018 of the residual 51% interest in Gas Supply Company Thessaloniki-Thessalia  SA  operating  in  Greece,  previously participated with a 49% of the share capital. The impairment review  performed  at  the  balance  sheet  date  by  using  a method similar to the CGU Domestic market confirmed the recoverability of the carrying amount of these market CGUs, including the goodwill, by using a post-tax WACC adjusted considering a post-tax country risk for France of 4.6% and 4.8% for Greece.\n\nPost-tax  cash  flows  and  discount  rates  resulted  in  an assessment  that  substantially approximated  a  pre-tax assessment.\n\n## 14 IMPAIRMENT REVIEW OF TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND RIGHT-OF-USE ASSETS\n\nManagement has adopted a conservative stance in elaborating its view of the long-term oil price outlook, considering the risks and uncertainties associated with the post-pandemic recovery and the pace of the energy transition. With the long-term fallout of the pandemic still being evaluated, management sees the prospect of an enduring impact on the global economy, with the potential for weaker demand for energy for a sustained period, because differently from other recessions, the one caused by the pandemic has involved at the same time all cyclical sectors of the economy and the service sector as well with consequent extreme fluctuations in the economic activity.\n\nEni's  management  also  has  a  growing  expectation  that  the aftermath of the pandemic will accelerate the pace of transition to a lower carbon economy and energy system, as countries seek to 'build back better' so that their economies will be more resilient in the future.\n\nBased on these considerations, management reviewed on the downside the long-term outlook for oil prices, which is the main driver of investment appraisal and the evaluation of recoverability of the Group's tangible assets. The revised scenario adopted by Eni forecasts a long-term Brent price of 60 $/bbl in 2023 real terms, compared to a previous level of 70 $, used in the impairment test in 2019. In 2021 and 2022, Brent prices are set at 50 and 55 $/bbl, respectively.\n\nThe gas price of the Italian spot market has been projected at 5.5 $/mmBTU in 2023, down from the previous assumption of 7.8 $/mmBTU.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nManagement  also  revised  downwards  its  expectations of future refining margins considering the collapse in the consumption of fuels driven by the pandemic.\n\nThe discount rates of future cash flows associated with the use of the assets were estimated on the basis of Eni's weighted  average  cost  of  capital,  adjusted  to  discount the  specific  risks  of  the  operating  context  of  the  Group's countries of activity (WACC adjusted). Eni's WACC for 2020 of  6.7%  decreased compared to 2019 (7.4%),  mainly due to the decline in the yields of risk-free assets of benchmark countries, which turned negative. This trend was mitigated by the greater weight attributed to the short-term volatility of  Eni  stock  (beta  determined  from  independent  sources) which compared to the prior year  is affected by  a greater perceived risk of the Oil & Gas sector due to climate-related risks  and  structural  weaknesses  of  the  industry,  also amplified by the pandemic crisis.\n\nThe cash flows of the assets have been estimated based on the approved business plans and the residual useful life of the reserves or industrial plants as described in Note 1 Significant accounting policies, estimates and judgements - Impairment of non-financial assets.\n\nIn consideration of the generalized presence of impairment indicators in all Eni's business sectors, including the evidence that as of December 31, 2020, Eni's market capitalization was lower than the book value of the consolidated net assets, and the company policy to regularly test the recoverability of carrying amounts, an impairment test covering 100% of the CGUs  was performed.\n\nIn the Exploration & Production sector, impairment losses  of assets in production or development were recognized for \u20ac1,888 million,  mainly  due  to  the  revision  of  long-term  hydrocarbons prices and the reduced capital expenditures to develop reserves of investments, as well as downward revisions of reserves. The most significant amounts were recorded at properties in Italy (\u20ac566 million), Algeria (\u20ac409 million), Congo (\u20ac306 million), USA (\u20ac232  million)  and  Turkmenistan  (\u20ac202  million).  The  post-tax WACC used ranges from a minimum of about 6% for Italy/USA to a range of 7-8% for the other countries, which are  redetermined in a range of 6-14% pre-tax.\n\nIn the Refining & Marketing business, impairment losses of refining plants were recorded for \u20ac1,225 million, mainly related  to  the  Sannazzaro  Refinery,  driven  by    are  the weak  fundamentals  of  the  European  industry,  explained by: the crisis in fuel consumptions due to the pandemic; overcapacity, competitive pressure from Asian and Middle Eastern  producers  with  more  efficient  scale  and  cost structures; market dislocations, that have reduced the supply of medium/heavy crude oils, penalizing the profitability of conversion cycles. The pre-tax and post-tax discount rate relating to the Italian refineries is 6.3%.\n\nIn addition, the recoverability of the carrying amounts of Oil & Gas activities was assessed also taking into account",

        "page_content": "the  expected  expenditure  for  participating  to  forestry conservation projects, consistent with Eni's decarbonization targets, the achievement of which includes  participating in initiatives for the conservation and repopulation of primary and secondary forests to obtain carbon credits, certified according to international standards. Management expects a gradual ramp-up of these initiatives in the medium-long term with the aim of having a portfolio of forestry projects by 2030 from which to obtain an annual amount of carbon credits capable of covering the deficit of residual direct and indirect  emissions  ('Scope  1  and  2')  of  the  Exploration  & Production sector for the purposes of carbon neutrality of equity  production  from  2030  onwards.  The  expenditures for the purchase of carbon credits are considered part of the operating costs of the Exploration & Production sector with reference to the whole sector considered as a single CGU.  Net  of  these  projected  costs  until  the  end  of  the residual life of the reserves, the overall headroom of the Exploration & Production sector determined on the basis of the assumptions of the impairment test is reduced by 4.6%. The  reasonableness  of  the  outcome  of  the  impairment review made by Eni's at its Oil & Gas activities was assessed on the basis of a stress test analysis performed using the decarbonization  scenario  developed  by  the  International\n\nEnergy  Agency  (IEA)  in  its  Sustainable  Development Scenario  in  the  in  the  World  Energy  Outlook  (WEO)  2020 which  draws  a  pathway  and  a  set  of  actions  consistent with  the  goal  of  the  2015  COP21  Paris  Agreement  on climate. The IEA SDS scenario is a well-established set of assumptions available on the market place relating to the decarbonization  of  the  world  economy.  The  VIUs  of  Eni's reserves were reassessed  with the projections estimated by the IEA of hydrocarbon prices and the purchase cost of  emission  allowances  of  the  'advanced'  economies equal to $140 in 2040, in 2019 currency per ton. IEA price assumptions for hydrocarbons are substantially in line with those adopted by Eni, while the cost of CO 2 is significantly higher. This stress test indicates a loss in the value-in-use of  the  Exploration  &  Production  sector  equal  to  11%  with respect  to    the  base  case,  assuming  non-deductibility  or non-recoverability for cost oil purposes of the CO 2 charge (-5% otherwise). These sensitivity analyses do not, however, represent management's best estimate of any impairment losses  that  might  be  recognized  as  they  do  not  fully incorporate the consequential changes that management could implement such as changes to business plans, cost reduction, development reshaping, review of reserves and production volumes.\n\n## 15 INVESTMENTS\n\n## EQUITY-ACCOUNTED INVESTMENTS\n\n|                                                    | 2020                                                                                                | 2020                   | 2020              | 2020    | 2019                                                                                                | 2019                   | 2019              | 2019    |\n|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|-------------------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|-------------------|---------|\n| (\u20ac million)                                        | I n v e s t m e n t s i n  u n c o ns o l i d a t e d e n t i t i e s c o n t r o l l e d b y  E ni | Jo i nt  v e nt ur e s | A ss o c i at e s | T ot al | I n v e s t m e n t s i n  u n c o ns o l i d a t e d e n t i t i e s c o n t r o l l e d b y  E ni | Jo i nt  v e nt ur e s | A ss o c i at e s | T ot al |\n| Carrying amount -

The greatest exposure is towards the joint venture Card\u00f3n IV SA (Eni's interest 50%) in Venezuela, which is currently operating the Perla offshore gas field, for \u20ac383 million (\u20ac563 million at December 31, 2019).\n\nFinancing receivables held for operating purposes due beyond five years amounted to \u20ac771 million (\u20ac1,018 million at December 31, 2019).\n\nThe  fair  value  of  non-current  financing  receivables  held  for operating  purposes  of  \u20ac953  million  has  been  estimated  based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at rates ranging from -0.5% to 1.4% (-0.3% and 2.0% at December 31, 2019).\n\nIn addition to the expected credit loss model, the recoverability of the financial loan granted to the joint venture Card\u00f3n IV SA was assessed on the basis of the recoverability of the investment made by the JV for the development of the Perla field corresponding to the future cash flows of the project adjusted to price possible difficulties  in  converting  future  gas  sales  into  cash,  essentially\n\nassuming a deferral in the timing of revenues collection.\n\nThe  recoverability  of  other  long-term  financial  assets  was assessed by considering the expected probability default in the next twelve months only, as the creditworthiness suffered no significant deterioration in the reporting period.\n\nFinancing  receivables  held  for  non-operating  purposes  related to  bank  deposits  with  the  purpose  to  invest  cash  surpluses and restricted deposits in escrow to guarantee transactions on derivative contracts.\n\nFinancing receivables held for operating purposes  were denominated in euro and U.S. dollar for \u20ac178 million and \u20ac1,024 million, respectively.\n\nSecurities held for operating purposes related to listed bonds issued by sovereign states.\n\nSecurities  for  \u20ac20  million  (same  amount  as  of  December  31, 2019) were pledged as guarantee of the deposit for gas cylinders as provided for by the Italian law.\n\nThe following table analyses securities per issuing entity:\n\n|                        | A m o r t i z e d c o s t  ( \u20ac m i lli o n )   | N o mi nal  v al u e ( \u20ac m i lli o n )   | F a i r V a l u e  ( \u20ac m i lli o n )   | N o mi nal  r a t e o f  r e t ur n %   | M at u r i t y  d at e               | R a t ing  -

abandonment and social projects include the present value of the estimated costs that the Company expects to incur for dismantling oil and natural gas production facilities at the end of the producing lives of fields, well-plugging, site clean-up and restoration for \u20ac8,454 million. Initial recognitions and  changes  in  estimates  of  \u20ac955  million  were  driven  by  a decrease in the discount rates and the estimate of the costs for social projects to be incurred following the commitments between Eni SpA and the Basilicata region in relation to the oil development  program  in  the  Val  d'Agri  concession  area  (\u20ac439 million). The unwinding of discount recognized through profit and loss  for  \u20ac190  million  was  determined  based  on  discount  rates ranging  from  -0.2%  to  3.7%  (from  -0.1%  to  6.1%  at  December 31, 2019). Main expenditures associated with decommissioning\n\noperations are expected to be incurred over a fifty-year period. Provisions for environmental risks included the estimated costs for environmental clean-up and remediation of soil and groundwater in areas owned or under concession where the Group performed in the past industrial operations that were progressively divested, shut  down,  dismantled  or  restructured.  The  provision  was accrued because at the balance sheet date there is a legal or constructive obligation for Eni to carry out environmental cleanup and remediation and the expected costs can be estimated reliably. The provision included the expected charges associated with  strict  liability  related  to  obligations  of  cleaning  up  and remediating polluted areas that met the parameters set by the law at the time when the pollution occurred but presently are no more in compliance with current environmental laws and regulations, or because Eni assumed the liability borne by other operators  when  the  Company  acquired  or  otherwise  took  over site operations. Those environmental provisions are recognized when an environmental project is approved by or filed with the relevant administrative authorities or a constructive obligation has arisen whereby the Company commits itself to performing certain  cleaning-up  and  restoration  projects  and  a  reliable  cost\n\nestimation  is  available.  At  December  31,  2020,  environmental provision primarily related to Eni Rewind SpA for \u20ac1,647 million and to the Refining & Marketing business line for \u20ac359 million.\n\nLitigation  provisions  comprised  expected  liabilities  associated with legal proceedings and other matters arising from contractual claims, including arbitrations, fines and penalties due to antitrust proceedings  and  administrative  matters.  These  provisions represent  the  Company's  best  estimate  of  the  expected  and probable liabilities associated with ongoing litigation and related to the Exploration & Production segment for \u20ac250 million.\n\nReversals of utilized provisions related for \u20ac515 million to the Exploration & Production segment in relation to the settlement of contractual disputes.\n\nProvisions for uncertain taxes matters related to the estimated losses that the Company expects to incur to settle tax litigations and  tax  claims  pending  with  tax  authorities  in  relation  to uncertainties in applying rules in force were in respect of the Exploration & Production segment for \u20ac139 million.\n\nLoss  adjustments  and  actuarial  provisions  of  Eni's  insurance company Eni Insurance DAC represented the estimated liabilities accrued on the basis for third party claims. Against such liability was recorded receivables of \u20ac116 million recognized towards insurance companies for reinsurance contracts.\n\nProvisions  for  losses  on  investments  included  provisions relating to investments whose loss exceeds the equity and primarily related to Industria Siciliana Acido Fosforico - ISAF SpA (in liquidation) for \u20ac146 million.\n\nProvisions for the OIL mutual insurance scheme included the estimated future increase of insurance premiums which will be charged to Eni in the next five years and that were accrued at the reporting date because of the effective accident rate occurred in past reporting periods.\n\nProvisions for redundancy incentives were recognized mainly due to a restructuring program involving the Italian personnel related to past reporting periods.",

The obligations of the guarantor towards the Government of Mozambique are unlimited (non-quantifiable commitments), whereas they provide a  maximum liability of \u20ac1,223 million in respect of third-parties claims. This guarantee will be effective until the completion of any decommissioning activity related to both the development plan of Coral as well as any development plan to be executed within Area  4  (particularly  the  Mamba  project).  This  parent  company guarantee  issued  by  Eni  covering  100%  of  the  aforementioned obligations was taken over by the other concessionaires (Kogas, Galp and ENH) and by ExxonMobil and CNPC shareholders of the joint operation Mozambico Rovuma Venture SpA, in proportion to their respective participating interest in Area 4.\n\n## COMMITMENTS AND RISKS\n\n| (\u20ac million)   | December 31, 2020   | December 31, 2019   |\n|---------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Commitments   | 69,998              | 74,338              |\n| Risks         | 600                 | 676                 |\n|               | 70,598              | 75,014              |\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Commitments  related  to:  (i)  parent  company  guarantees that  were  issued  in  connection  with  certain  contractual commitments for hydrocarbon exploration and production activities and quantified, based on the capital expenditures to  be  incurred,  to  be  \u20ac64,294  million  (\u20ac65,374  million  at December 31, 2019). The decrease of \u20ac1,080 million was primarily determined by negative exchange rate differences; (ii)  a  parent  company guarantee of \u20ac3,260 million (\u20ac6,527 million at December 31, 2019) given on behalf of Eni Abu Dhabi Refining & Trading BV following the Share Purchase Agreement to acquire from Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) a 20% equity interest in ADNOC Refining and the set-up of ADNOC Global Trading Ltd dedicated to marketing petroleum products. The decrease of \u20ac3,267 million related to the extinction of the parent company guarantee, issued to  guarantee  the  obligations  under  the  Share  Purchase Agreement, following the payment  of the deferred consideration amounting to \u20ac73 million. The parent company guarantee still outstanding has been issued to guarantee the obligations set out in the Shareholders Agreements and will remain in force as long as the investment is maintained; (iii)  commitments assumed by Eni USA Gas Marketing Llc towards Angola LNG Supply Service Llc for the purchase of volumes of re-gasified gas at the Pascagoula plant (United States) over a twenty-year period (until 2031). The expected commitments  were  estimated  at  \u20ac1,672  million  (\u20ac1,978 million  at  December  31,  2019)  and  have  been  included  in off-balance  sheet  contractual  commitments  in  the  table 'Future  payments  under  contractual  obligations'  in  the paragraph Liquidity risk. However, since the project has been abandoned by the partners, Eni does not expect to make any payment under those contractual obligations. In 2018, the contractual commitment signed in December 2007 between Eni USA Gas Marketing Llc and Gulf LNG Energy Llc (GLE) and Gulf LNG Pipeline Llc (GLP) for the purchase of long-term regasification and transport services (until 2031) amounting at  December  31,  2017  to  \u20ac948  million  (undiscounted) ceased due to an arbitration ruling. The jurors established that the commitment was resolved by March 1, 2016 and recognized to the counterparty an equitable compensation of  \u20ac324 million. Despite the ruling of the arbitration court invalidating the contract, GLE and GLP filed a claim with the Supreme  Court  of  New  York  against  Eni  SpA  demanding the enforcement of the parent company guarantee issued by Eni for the payment of the regasification fees until the original  due  date  of  the  contract  (2031)  for  a  maximum amount  of  \u20ac757  million.  Eni  believes  that  the  claims  by GLE and GLP have no merit and is defending the action; (iv) the commitment to purchase of a 20% stake of the project relating  to  the  Dogger  Bank  (A  and  B)  wind  facility  in  the North Sea for \u20ac451 million; (v) the commitment to purchase the  remaining  60%  stake  of  Finproject  SpA,  a  company\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nengaged in the compounding sector for \u20ac150 million; (vi) a memorandum of intent signed with the Basilicata Region, whereby Eni has agreed to invest \u20ac108 million (\u20ac114 million at December 31, 2019) in the future, also on account of Shell Italia E&P SpA, in connection with Eni's development plan of oilfields  in  Val  d'Agri. The  commitment has been included in  the  off-balance  sheet  contractual  commitments  in  the following paragraph 'Liquidity risk'.\n\nRisks relate to potential risks associated with: (i) contractual assurances  given  to  acquirers  of  certain  investments  and businesses of Eni for \u20ac230 million (\u20ac248 million at December 31, 2019); (ii) assets of third parties under the custody of Eni for \u20ac370 million (\u20ac428 million at December 31, 2019).\n\n## OTHER COMMITMENTS AND RISKS\n\nA parent company guarantee was issued on behalf of Card\u00f3n IV SA (Eni's interest 50%), a joint venture operating the Perla gas field located in Venezuela, for the supply to PDVSA GAS of the volumes of gas produced by the field until the end of the concession agreement (2036). This guarantee cannot be  quantified  because  the  penalty  clause  for  unilateral anticipated resolution originally set for Eni and the relevant quantification became ineffective due to a revision of the contractual terms. In case of failure on part of the operator to deliver the contractual gas volumes out of production, the claim under the guarantee will be determined by applying the  local  legislation.  Eni's  share  (50%)  of  the  contractual volumes of gas to be delivered to PDVSA GAS amounted to a total of around \u20ac12 billion. Notwithstanding this amount does  not  properly  represent  the  guarantee  exposure, nonetheless such amount  represents  the  maximum financial exposure at risk for Eni. A similar guarantee was issued by PDVSA on behalf of Eni for the fulfillment of the purchase commitments of the gas volumes by PDVSA GAS. Other commitments include the agreements entered into for forestry initiatives, implemented within the low carbon strategy defined by the Company, concerning the commitments for the purchase, until 2038, of carbon credits produced and certified according to international standards by subjects specialized in forest conservation programs.\n\nEni  is  liable  for  certain  non-quantifiable  risks  related  to contractual  guarantees  given  to  acquirers  of  certain  Eni assets, including businesses  and  investments,  against certain contingent liabilities deriving from tax, social security contributions, environmental  issues  and  other  matters applicable to periods during which such assets were operated by  Eni.  Eni  believes  such  matters  will  not  have  a  material adverse effect on Eni's results of operations and cash flow.\n\n## RISK FACTORS\n\nThe  following  is  the  description  of  financial  risks  and  their management and control. With reference to the issues related",

Management has adopted all the necessary actions to protect the liquidity and the capital ratios of the Company by reducing costs and investments,  by  updating  the  shareholders'  remuneration policy and by recurring to capital market as described in the section Impact of COVID-19 pandemic of the Management Report, to which reference is made. As of December 31, 2020, the  Company  retains  liquidity  reserves  that  management deems enough to meet the financial obligations due in the next eighteen months.\n\nNo significant effects were reported on hedging transactions connected  to  the  impacts  of  COVID-19  on  the  economic context.\n\n## FINANCIAL RISKS\n\nFinancial risks are managed in respect of guidelines issued by the Board of Directors of Eni SpA in its role of directing and setting the risk limits, targeting to align and centrally coordinate  Group  companies'  policies  on  financial  risks ('Guidelines  on  financial  risks  management  and  control'). The  'Guidelines'  define  for  each  financial  risk  the  key components  of  the  management  and  control  process, such  as  the  aim  of  the  risk  management,  the  valuation methodology, the structure of limits, the relationship model and the hedging and mitigation instruments.\n\n## MARKET RISK\n\nMarket  risk  is  the  possibility  that  changes  in  currency exchange  rates,  interest  rates  or  commodity  prices  will adversely affect the value of the Group's financial assets, liabilities  or  expected  future  cash  flows.  The  Company actively manages market risk in accordance with a set of policies and guidelines that provide a centralized model of handling  finance,  treasury  and  risk  management transactions  based  on  the  Company's  departments  of operational finance: the parent company's (Eni SpA) finance department, Eni Finance International SA, Eni Finance USA Inc and Banque Eni SA, which is subject to certain bank regulatory restrictions preventing the Group's exposure to concentrations of credit risk, and Eni Trading & Shipping that is in charge to execute certain activities relating to commodity derivatives. In particular, Eni Corporate finance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ndepartment, Eni Finance International SA and Eni Finance USA  Inc  manage  subsidiaries'  financing  requirements in  and outside Italy and in the United States of America, respectively,  covering  funding  requirements  and  using available surpluses. All transactions concerning currencies and derivative contracts on interest rates and currencies different  from  commodities  are  managed  by  the  parent company, while Eni Trading & Shipping SpA executes the negotiation  of  commodity  derivatives  over  the  market. Eni SpA and Eni Trading & Shipping SpA (also through its subsidiary  Eni  Trading  &  Shipping  Inc)  perform  trading activities in financial derivatives on external trading venues, such  as  European  and  non-European  regulated  markets, Multilateral  Trading  Facility  (MTF),  Organized  Trading Facility  (OTF),  or  similar  and  brokerage  platforms  (i.e. SEF), and over the counter on a bilateral basis with external counterparties. Other legal entities belonging to Eni that require financial derivatives enter into these transactions through Eni Trading & Shipping and Eni SpA based on the relevant asset class expertise. Eni uses derivative financial instruments  (derivatives)  in  order  to  minimize  exposure to market risks related to fluctuations in exchange rates relating to those transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency (the euro) and interest rates, as well as to optimize exposure to commodity prices fluctuations  taking  into  account  the  currency  in  which commodities  are  quoted.  Eni  monitors  every  activity  in derivatives classified as risk-reducing (in particular, backto-back  activities,  flow  hedging  activities,  asset-backed hedging  activities  and  portfolio-management  activities) directly or indirectly related to covered industrial assets, so as to effectively optimize the risk profile to which Eni is exposed or could be exposed. If the result of the monitoring shows those derivatives should not be considered as risk reducing, these derivatives are reclassified in proprietary trading.  As  proprietary  trading  is  considered  separately from  the  other  activities  in  specific  portfolios  of  Eni Trading  &  Shipping,  its  exposure  is  subject  to  specific controls, both in terms of Value at Risk (VaR) and stop loss and in terms of nominal gross value. For Eni, the gross nominal value of proprietary trading activities is compared with the limits set by the relevant international standards. The  framework  defined  by  Eni's  policies  and  guidelines provides that the valuation and control of market risk is performed on the basis of maximum tolerable levels of risk  exposure  defined  in  terms  of:  (i)  limits  of  stop  loss, which  expresses  the  maximum  tolerable  amount  of losses associated with a certain portfolio of assets over a pre-defined time horizon; (ii) limits of revision strategy, which consist in the triggering of a revision process of the strategy in the event of exceeding the level of profit and loss  given;  and  (iii)  VaR  which  measures  the  maximum",

        "page_content": "potential loss of the portfolio, given a certain confidence level  and  holding  period,  assuming  adverse  changes  in market variables and taking into account the correlation among the different  positions  held  in  the  portfolio.  Eni's finance department defines the maximum tolerable levels of risk exposure to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates in terms of VaR, pooling Group companies'  risk  positions  maximizing,  when  possible, the  benefits  of  the  netting  activity.  Eni's  calculation  and valuation techniques for interest rate and foreign currency exchange  rate  risks  are  in  accordance  with  banking standards, as established by the Basel Committee for bank activities surveillance. Tolerable levels of risk are based on  a  conservative  approach,  considering  the  industrial nature of the Company. Eni's guidelines prescribe that Eni Group companies minimize such kinds of market risks by transferring risk exposure to the parent company finance department.  Eni's  guidelines  define  rules  to  manage the  commodity  risk  aiming  at  optimizing  core  activities and pursuing preset targets of stabilizing industrial and commercial  margins.  The  maximum  tolerable  level  of risk exposure is defined in terms of VaR, limits of revision strategy,  stop  loss  and  volumes  in  connection  with exposure deriving from commercial activities, as well as exposure  deriving  from  proprietary  trading,  exclusively managed  by  Eni  Trading  &  Shipping.  Internal  mandates to manage the commodity risk provide for a mechanism of allocation of the Group maximum tolerable risk level to each business unit. In this framework, Eni Trading & Shipping, in addition to managing risk exposure associated with its own commercial activity and proprietary trading, pools the requests for negotiating commodity derivatives and executes them in the marketplace. According to the targets of financial structure included in the financial plan approved by the Board of Directors, Eni decided to retain a cash reserve to face any extraordinary requirement. Eni's finance department, with the aim of optimizing the efficiency and  ensuring  maximum  protection  of  capital,  manages such reserve and its immediate liquidity within the limits assigned. The management of strategic cash is part of the asset management pursued through transactions on own risk in view of optimizing financial returns, while respecting authorized risk levels, safeguarding the Company's assets and retaining quick access to liquidity.\n\nThe  four  different  market  risks,  whose  management  and control have been summarized above, are described below.\n\n## MARKET RISK - EXCHANGE RATE\n\nExchange  rate  risk  derives  from  the  fact  that  Eni's operations  are  conducted  in  currencies  other  than  euro (mainly U.S. dollar). Revenues and expenses denominated in  foreign  currencies  may  be  significantly  affected  by\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nexchange rate fluctuations due to conversion differences on single transactions arising from the time lag existing between  execution  and  definition  of  relevant  contractual terms (economic risk) and conversion of foreign currencydenominated trade and financing payables and receivables (transactional  risk).  Exchange  rate  fluctuations  affect the  Group's  reported  results  and  net  equity  as  financial statements of subsidiaries denominated in currencies other than euro are translated from their functional currency into euro.  Generally,  an  appreciation  of  U.S.  dollar  versus  euro has  a  positive  impact  on  Eni's  results  of  operations,  and vice versa. Eni's foreign exchange risk management policy is to minimize transactional exposures arising from foreign currency movements and to optimize exposures arising from commodity risk. Eni does not undertake any hedging activity for risks deriving from the translation of foreign currency denominated profits or assets and liabilities of subsidiaries, which prepare financial statements in a currency other than euro, except for single transactions to be evaluated on a case-by-case  basis.  Effective  management  of  exchange rate  risk  is  performed  within  Eni's  finance  departments, which pool Group companies' positions, hedging the Group net exposure by using certain derivatives, such as currency swaps, forwards and options. Such derivatives are evaluated at fair value based on market prices provided by specialized info-providers. Changes in fair value of those derivatives are normally recognized through profit and loss, as they do not meet the formal criteria to be recognized as hedges. The VaR techniques  are  based  on  variance/covariance  simulation models and are used to monitor the risk exposure arising from possible future changes in market values over a 24hour  period  within  a  99%  confidence  level  and  a  20-day holding period.\n\n## MARKET RISK - INTEREST RATE\n\nChanges in interest rates affect the market value of financial assets and liabilities of the Company and the level of finance charges.  Eni's  interest  rate  risk  management  policy  is  to minimize  risk  with  the  aim  to  achieve  financial  structure objectives  defined  and  approved  in  management's  finance plans.  The  Group's  central  departments  pool  borrowing requirements of the Group companies in order to manage net  positions  and  fund  portfolio  developments  consistent with management plans, thereby maintaining a level of risk exposure within prescribed limits. Eni enters into interest rate derivative transactions, in particular interest rate swaps, to manage effectively  the  balance  between  fixed  and  floating rate debt. Such derivatives are evaluated at fair value based on  market  prices  provided  from  specialized  sources.  VaR deriving from interest rate exposure is measured daily based on a variance/covariance model, with a 99% confidence level and a 20-day holding period.",

        "page_content": "## MARKET RISK - COMMODITY\n\nEni's  results  of  operations  are  affected  by  changes  in  the prices of commodities. The commodity price risk arises in connection with the following exposures: (i) strategic exposure: exposures directly identified by the Board of Directors as a result of strategic investment decisions or outside the planning horizon of risk management. These exposures include those associated with the program for the production of proved and unproved Oil & Gas reserves, long-term gas supply contracts for the portion not balanced by ongoing or highly probable sale  contracts,  refining  margins  identified  by  the  Board  of Directors of strategic nature (the remaining volumes can be allocated to the active management of the margin or to assetbacked hedging activities) and minimum compulsory stocks; (ii)  commercial exposure: includes the exposures related to the  components  underlying  the  contractual  arrangements of  industrial  and  commercial  activities  and,  if  related  to take-or-pay  commitments  to  purchase  natural  gas,  to  the components related to the time horizon of the four-year plan and budget and the relevant activities of risk management. Commercial  exposures  are  characterized  by  a  systematic risk  management  activity  conducted  based  on  risk/return assumptions by implementing one or more strategies and subjected to specific risk limits (VaR, revision strategy limits and  stop  loss).  In  particular,  the  commercial  exposures include  exposures  subjected  to  asset-backed  hedging activities,  arising  from  the  flexibility/optionality  of  assets; and  (iii)  proprietary  trading  exposure:  includes  operations independently  conducted  for  profit  purposes  in  the  short term,  and  normally  not  for  the  purpose  of  delivery,  both within the commodity and financial markets, with the aim to obtain a profit upon the occurrence of a favorable result in the market, in accordance with specific limits of authorized risk (VaR, stop loss). Origination activities are included in the proprietary trading exposures, if not connected to contractual or physical assets.\n\nStrategic  risk  is  not  subject  to  systematic  activity  of management/coverage that is eventually carried out only in case of specific market or business conditions. Because of  the  extraordinary  nature,  hedging  activities  related  to strategic  risks  are  delegated  to  the  top  management. Strategic risk is subject to measuring and monitoring but is not subject to specific risk limits. If previously authorized by the Board of Directors, exposures related to strategic risk can be used in combination with other commercial exposures in order to exploit opportunities for natural compensation between the risks (natural hedge) and consequently reduce the  use  of  derivatives  (by  activating  logics  of  internal market).  Eni  manages  exposure  to  commodity  price  risk arising in normal trading and commercial activities in view of  achieving  stable  economic  results.  Eni  manages  the commodity risk through the trading unit of Eni Trading &\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nShipping  and the exposure to commodity prices through the Group's finance departments by using derivatives traded on the organized markets MTF, OTF and derivatives traded over the counter (swaps, forward, contracts for differences and options on commodities) with the underlying commodities being crude oil, gas, refined products, power or emission certificates. Such derivatives are valued at fair value based on  market  prices  provided  from  specialized  sources  or, absent market prices, on the basis of estimates provided by brokers or suitable valuation techniques. VaR deriving from commodity exposure is measured daily based on a historical simulation technique, with a 95% confidence level and a one-day holding period.\n\n## MARKET RISK - STRATEGIC LIQUIDITY\n\nMarket risk deriving from liquidity management is identified as  the  possibility  that  changes  in  prices  of  financial instruments (bonds, money market instruments and mutual funds)  would  affect  the  value  of  these  instruments  when valued  at  fair  value.  The  setting  up  and  maintenance  of the liquidity reserve is mainly aimed to guarantee a proper financial  flexibility.  Liquidity  should  allow  Eni  to  fund  any extraordinary  need  (such  as  difficulty  in  access  to  credit, exogenous shock, macroeconomic environment, as well as merger and acquisitions) and must be dimensioned to provide a coverage of short-term debts and a coverage of medium and long-term finance debts due within a time horizon of 24 months. In order to manage the investment activity of the strategic  liquidity,  Eni  defined  a  specific  investment  policy with aims and constraints in terms of financial activities and operational  boundaries,  as  well  as  governance  guidelines regulating management and control systems. In particular, strategic liquidity management is regulated in terms of VaR (measured based on a parametrical methodology with a oneday  holding  period  and  a  99%  confidence  level),  stop  loss and other operating limits in terms of concentration, issuing entity,  business  segment,  country  of  emission,  duration, ratings and type of investing instruments in portfolio, aimed to minimize market and liquidity risks. Financial leverage or short selling is not allowed. Activities in terms of strategic liquidity management started in the second half of the year 2013 (Euro portfolio) and throughout the course of the year 2017  (U.S.  dollar  portfolio).  In  2020,  the  Euro  investment portfolio has maintained an average credit rating of A-/BBB+, whereas  the  USD  investment  portfolio  has  maintained  an average credit rating of A+/A, both in line with the year 2019. The following tables show amounts in terms of VaR, recorded in  2020  (compared  with  2019)  relating  to  interest  rate  and exchange  rate  risks  in  the  first  section  and  commodity risk.  Regarding  the  management  of  strategic  liquidity,  the sensitivity to changes of interest rate is expressed by values of 'Dollar value per Basis Point' (DVBP).",

Eni  defined  credit  risk  management  policies  consistent with the nature and characteristics of the counterparties of commercial  and  financial  transactions  regarding the  centralized  finance  model.  The  Company  adopted a model to quantify and control the credit risk based on the evaluation of the expected loss which represents the probability of default and the capacity to recover credits in default that is estimated through the so-called Loss Given Default. In the credit risk management and control model, credit exposures are distinguished by commercial nature, in relation to sales contracts on commodities related to\n\nEni's  businesses,  and  by  financial  nature,  in  relation  to the financial instruments used by Eni, such as deposits, derivatives and securities.\n\n## CREDIT RISK FOR COMMERCIAL EXPOSURES\n\nCredit  risk  arising  from  commercial  counterparties  is managed  by  the  business  units  and  by  the  specialized corporate finance and dedicated administration departments and is operated based on formal procedures for  the  assessment  of  commercial  counterparties,  the monitoring  of  credit  exposures,  credit  recovery  activities and disputes. The credit worthiness of businesses and large clients is assessed through an internal rating model that combines different default factors deriving from economic",

The probability of default related to State Entities or their closely related counterparties (e.g. National Oil Company), essentially represented by the probability of late payments, is determined by using the country risk premiums adopted for  the  purposes  of  the  determination  of  the  WACCs  for the  impairment  of  non-financial  assets.  Furthermore,  for retail positions without specific ratings, risk is determined by distinguishing customers in homogeneous risk clusters based  on  historical  series  of  data  relating  to  payments, periodically updated.\n\n## CREDIT RISK FOR FINANCIAL EXPOSURES\n\nWith regard to credit risk arising from financial counterparties deriving from current and strategic use of liquidity, derivative contracts  and  transactions  with  underlying  financial  assets valued  at  fair  value,  Eni  has  established  internal  policies providing exposure control and concentration through maximum credit risk limits corresponding to different classes of financial counterparties defined by the Company's Board of Directors and based on ratings provided for by primary credit rating agencies. Credit risk arising from financial counterparties is  managed  by  the  Eni's  operating  finance  departments  and Eni's  subsidiary  Eni  Trading  &  Shipping  which  specifically engages in commodity derivatives transactions and by Group companies and business units, only in the case of physical transactions with financial counterparties consistently with  the  Group  centralized  finance  model.  Eligible  financial counterparties  are  closely  monitored  by  each  counterpart and by group of belonging to check exposures against the limits assigned daily and the expected loss analysis and the concentration periodically.\n\n## LIQUIDITY RISK\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk that suitable sources of funding for the Group may not be available, or the Group is unable to sell its assets in the marketplace in order to meet shortterm finance requirements and to settle obligations. Such a situation would negatively affect Group results, as it would result in the Company incurring higher borrowing expenses to meet its obligations or under the worst of conditions  the  inability  of  the  Company  to  continue  as a going concern. Eni's risk management targets include the maintaining of an adequate level of liquidity readily\n\n<!-- image -->\n\navailable  to  deal  with  external  shocks  (drastic  changes in the scenario, restrictions on access to capital markets, etc.)  or  to  ensure  an  adequate  level  of  operational flexibility for the development programs of the Company. The strategic liquidity reserve is employed in short-term marketable  financial  assets,  favoring  investments  with very low risk profile.\n\nAt present, the Group believes to have access to sufficient funding  to  meet  the  current  foreseeable  borrowing requirements  due  to  available  cash  on  hand  financial assets and lines of credit and the access to a wide range of funding opportunities which we believe we can activate at competitive costs through the credit system and the capital markets.\n\nEni has in place a program for the issuance of Euro Medium Term Notes up to \u20ac20 billion, of which about \u20ac16.3 billion were drawn as of December 31, 2020 (\u20ac13.9 billion by Eni SpA).\n\nThe Group has credit ratings of A-  outlook  negative  and A-2,  respectively,  for  long  and  short-term  debt,  assigned by  Standard  &  Poor's;  Baa1  outlook  stable  and  P-2, respectively,  for  long  and  short-term  debt,  assigned  by Moody's;  A-  outlook  stable  and  F1,  respectively  for  long and short-term debt, assigned by Fitch. Eni's credit rating is linked in addition to the Company's industrial fundamentals and  trends  in  the  trading  environment  to  the  sovereign credit  rating  of  Italy.  Based  on  the  methodologies  used by the credit rating agencies, a downgrade of Italy's credit rating may trigger a potential knock-on effect on the credit rating of Italian issuers such as Eni.\n\nDuring 2020, the rating of Eni remained unchanged.\n\nAs part of the Euro Medium Term Notes program, in 2020 the Company issued bonds for \u20ac3.5 billion (\u20ac3.0 billion by Eni SpA). In October 2020, Eni placed two euro-denominated perpetual subordinated hybrid bond issues for an aggregate nominal amount  of  \u20ac3  billion.  These  are  perpetual  instruments with an early repayment option in favor of the issuer and classified as equity items. The rating agencies assigned to the bonds the following ratings Baa3 / BBB / BBB (Moody's / S&P / Fitch) and an 'equity credit' of 50%.\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2020,  Eni  maintained  short-term uncommitted unused borrowing facilities of \u20ac7,183 million. Committed unused borrowing facilities amounted to \u20ac5,295 million, of which \u20ac4,750 million due beyond 12 months. These  facilities  bore  interest  rates  and  fees  for  unused facilities that reflected prevailing market conditions.",

Based on information available to date, and taking into account the existing risk provisions disclosed in  note  20  -  Provisions  and  that  in  some  instances  it  is  not possible to make a reliable estimate of contingency losses, Eni believes that the foregoing will likely not have a material adverse effect on the Group Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition to proceedings arising in the ordinary course of\n\nbusiness referred to above, Eni is party to other proceedings, and a description of the most significant proceedings currently pending is provided in the following paragraphs. Generally and unless otherwise indicated, these legal proceedings have not been provisioned because Eni believes a negative outcome to be unlikely or because the amount of the provision cannot be estimated reliably.\n\n## 1. Environment, health and safety\n\n- 1.1 Criminal proceedings in the matters of environment, health and safety\n\n(i)\n\nEni  Rewind  SpA  (company  incorporating  EniChem\n\nAgricoltura  SpA  -  Agricoltura  SpA    in  liquidation\n\n- - EniChem Augusta Industriale Srl - Fosfotec Srl) - Proceeding about the industrial site of Crotone. In  2010  a  criminal  proceeding  started  before  the Public  Prosecutor  of  Crotone  relating  to  allegations of  environmental  disaster,  poisoning  of  substances used  in  the  food  chain  and  omitted  clean-up  due  to the  activity  at  a  landfill  site  which  was  taken  over  by Eni in 1991. Subsequently to Eni's takeover, any activity for waste conferral was stopped. The defendants are certain managers of Eni Group companies, that have managed the  landfill  since  1991.  The  Municipality  of Crotone is acting as plaintiff. In March 2019, the public prosecutor requested the acquittal of all defendants. The proceeding is ongoing. In April 2017, the Public Prosecutor of Crotone started another criminal proceeding concerning the clean-up of the area called 'Farina  Trappeto'.  Despite  the  prosecuting  PM  asked the  acquittal  of  all  the  defendants,  on  January  17, 2020, the GUP asked the PM to modify the charges in order to better specify modalities and timing of each disputed conduct. At the preliminary hearing on July 1, 2020, the GUP acquitted all the defendants, some for not having committed the alleged crime and others for prescription. The Company therefore decided to appeal against the sentence, in order to obtain an acquittal on the merits also in relation to the positions of the former managers of the Eni Group acquitted due to prescription.\n\n(ii)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Eni  Rewind  SpA  -  Crotone omitted  clean-up . In April  2017,  a  further  criminal  case  was  opened  by the  Crotone  prosecutor's  office  on  the  reclamation activities of the Crotone site as a whole. Meanwhile, in  the  first  half  of  2018,  the  new  clean-up  project presented  by  the  Company  was  deemed  feasible by  the  Ministry  of  the  Environment.  Pending  the decisions  of  the  Public  Prosecutor,  a  defense  brief was filed to summarize the activity carried out by the subsidiary Eni Rewind (former Syndial SpA) in terms of reclamation, pointing to willingness of executing a decisive plan of action, and to obtain the dismissal of the criminal proceedings. On March 3, 2020, the Ministerial  Decree  approving  the  POB  Phase  2  was issued.\n- (iii) Eni Rewind SpA and Versalis SpA - Porto Torres Prosecuting  body:  Public  Prosecutor  of  Sassari. In  2011,  the  Public  Prosecutor  of  Sassari  (Sardinia) determined  that  a  manager  responsible  for  plant operations at the site of Porto Torres should stand trial for alleged environmental disaster and poisoning of water and substances destined for food. The Province of Sassari, the Municipality of Porto Torres and other entities have been involved in the proceedings as civil parties  seeking  damages.  In  2013,  the  Prosecutor of Sassari requested a new indictment for negligent behavior, replacing the previous allegation of willful conduct. The Third Instance Court has denied a motion to terminate the proceedings. The Public Prosecutor has re-submitted a request that the defendants would stand trial. Eni's subsidiary Eni Rewind SpA has been summoned  for  third-party  liability.  The  preliminary hearing is still ongoing.\n- (iv) Eni  Rewind  SpA  and  Versalis  SpA  -  Porto  Torres dock. In  2012,  following  a  request  of  the  Public Prosecutor  of  Sassari,  an  Italian  court  ordered presentation of evidence relating to the functioning of the  hydraulic  barrier  of  Porto Torres  site  (ran  by  Eni Rewind SpA) and its capacity to avoid the dispersion of contamination released by the site into the nearby sea. Eni Rewind SpA and Versalis SpA were notified that  its  chief  executive  officers  and  certain  other managers  were  being  investigated.  The  Public Prosecutor of the Municipality of Sassari requested that these individuals stand trial. The plaintiffs, the Ministry  for  Environment  and  the  Sardinia  Region claimed environmental damage in an amount of \u20ac1.5 billion. Other parties referred to the judge's equitable assessment.  At  a  hearing  in  July  2016,  the  court acquitted all defendants of Eni Rewind and Versalis with respect to the crimes of environmental disaster.",

        "page_content": "Three  Eni  Rewind  managers  were  found  guilty  of environmental disaster relating to the period limited to August 2010 - January 2011 and sentenced to oneyear prison, with a suspended sentence. Eni Rewind filed an appeal against this decision. The proceeding is ongoing.\n\n## (v) Eni Rewind SpA - The illegal landfill in Minciaredda\n\n- area,  Porto  Torres  site. The  Court  of  Sassari, on  request  of  the  Public  Prosecutor,  seized  the Minciaredda  landfill  area,  near  the  western  border of  the  Porto  Torres  site  (Minciaredda  area).  All  the indicted have been served a notice of investigation for alleged crimes of carrying out illegal waste disposal and environmental disaster. The seizure order involved also  Eni  Rewind  pursuant  to  Legislative  Decree  No. 231/01, whereby companies are liable for the crimes committed by their employees when performing their duties. The court determined that Eni Rewind can be sued for civil liability and resolved that all defendants and the Eni subsidiary be put on trial before the Court of Sassari. The assessment for the admissibility of a civil claim is ongoing.\n\n## (vi) Eni Rewind SpA - The Phosphate deposit at Porto\n\nTorres site. In 2015, the Court of Sassari, accepting a request of the Public Prosecutor of Sassari, seized - as a preventive measure - the area of 'Palte Fosfatiche' (phosphates  deposit)  located  on  the  territory  of Porto  Torres  site,  in  relation  to  alleged  crimes  of environmental disaster, carrying out of unauthorized disposal of hazardous wastes and other environmental crimes. Eni Rewind SpA is being investigated pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 231/01. In November 2019, a request for referral to trial was served on the Eni subsidiary.  The  preliminary  hearing  will  be  held  on September 9, 2020. At the outcome of the preliminary hearing,  the  Judge  pronounced  against  all  the defendants a sentence of no place to proceed due to the statute of limitation in relation to the crimes of unauthorized management of landfills and disposal of hazardous wastes as well as against Eni Rewind SpA in relation to the liability pursuant to Legislative Decree 231/01. The Judge also ordered the indictment of the defendants before the Court of Sassari, at the hearing on  May  28,  2021,  limited  to  the  alleged  crime  of environmental disaster.\n\n- (vii) Eni Rewind SpA - Proceeding relating to the asbestos at the Ravenna site. A criminal proceeding is pending before the Tribunal of Ravenna relating to the crimes of culpable manslaughter, injuries and environmental disaster,  which  have  been  allegedly  committed  by\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n265\n\nformer Eni Rewind employees at the site of Ravenna. The site was acquired by Eni Rewind following a number of corporate mergers and acquisitions. The alleged crimes  date  back  to  1991.  In  the  proceeding  there are 75 alleged victims. The plaintiffs include relatives of the alleged victims, various local administrations, and  other  institutional  bodies,  including  local  trade unions. Eni Rewind asserted the statute of limitation as a defense to the instance of environmental disaster for  certain  instances  of  diseases  and  deaths.  The court at Ravenna decided that all defendants would stand  trial  and  held  that  the  statute  of  limitation only  applied  with  reference  to  certain  instances  of crime of culpable injury. Eni Rewind reached some settlements. In November 2016, the Judge acquitted the defendants in all the contested cases except for one, an asbestos case, for which a conviction was handed  down.  The  defendants,  the  Prosecutor  and the plaintiffs appealed the decision; a second instance judge ordered a complex appraisal, believing that they could  not  decide  on  the  state  of  the  proceedings, appointing three well-known experts. Eni's defenders rejected one of them, believing that he had an interest in  the  matter;  the  Court  rejected  the  request  for recusal  but  the  Third  Instance  Court,  accepting  the appeal of the defendants of the accused, canceled the order by postponement. On the referral, at the request of Eni's lawyers, the Court of Appeal of Bologna, given the different composition of the judging panel, ordered the renewal of the appeal judgment and, consequently, the subsequent revocation of the order with which it had initially prepared the appraisal. On May 25, 2020, at the outcome of the discussion of the parties, the Court acquitted the defendants, and the person sued for damages in relation to 74 cases of mesothelioma, lung cancer, pleural plaques and asbestosis, took note of the res judicata of the acquittal for the disaster complaint  and  confirmed  the  conviction  for  a  case of  asbestosis.  He  also  declared  inadmissible  the appeals of several claimants. The Company appealed to  a  Third  Instance  Court  against  the  conviction  for asbestosis; some claimants challenged the acquittal for other pathologies.\n\n- (viii) Raffineria di Gela  SpA  and  Eni  Mediterranea Idrocarburi  SpA  -  Alleged  environmental  disaster. A  criminal  proceeding  is  pending  in  relation  to crimes allegedly committed by the managers of the Raffineria  di  Gela  SpA  and  EniMed  SpA  relating  to environmental disaster, unauthorized waste disposal and unauthorized spill of industrial wastewater. The Gela Refinery has been prosecuted for administrative\n\noffence  pursuant  to  Legislative  Decree  No.  231/01.",

        "page_content": "This criminal proceeding initially regarded soil pollution allegedly caused by spills from 14 tanks of the  refinery  storage,  which  had  not  been  provided with double bottoms, and pollution of the sea water near the coastal area adjacent to the site due to the failure of the barrier system implemented as part of the  clean-up  activities  conducted  at  the  site.  At  the closing  of  the  preliminary  investigation,  the  Public Prosecutor of Gela merged into this proceeding the other  investigations  related  to  the  pollution  that occurred  at  the  other  sites  of  the  Gela  refinery  as well as hydrocarbon spills at facilities of EniMed. The proceeding is ongoing.\n\n- (ix) Val  d'Agri. In  March  2016,  the  Public  Prosecutors of  Potenza  started  a  criminal  investigation  into alleged illegal handling of waste material produced at  the  Viggiano  oil  center  (COVA),  part  of  the  Enioperated  Val  d'Agri  oil  complex.  After  a  two-year investigation,  the  Prosecutors  ordered  the  house arrest of 5 Eni employees and the seizure of certain plants  functional  to  the  production  activity  of  the Val  d'Agri  complex  which,  consequently,  was  shut down  (loss  of  60  KBOE/d  net  to  Eni).  From  the commencement of the investigation, Eni has carried out several technical and environmental surveys, with the support of independent experts of international standing, who found a full compliance of the plant and the industrial process with the requirements of the  applicable  laws,  as  well  as  with  best  available technologies  and  international  best  practices.  The Company  implemented  certain  corrective  measures to  upgrade  plants  which  were  intended  to  address the  claims  made  by  the  Public  Prosecutor  about an alleged operation of blending which would have occurred  during  normal  plant  functioning.  Those corrective measures were favorably reviewed by the Public Prosecutor. The Company restarted the plant in August 2016. In relation to the criminal proceeding, the Public  Prosecutor's  Office  requested  the  indictment of  all  the  defendants  for  alleged  illegal  trafficking  of waste, violation of the prohibition of mixing waste, unauthorized  management  of  waste  and  other violations, and the Company, pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 231/01, which presumes that companies are liable for crimes committed by their employees when  performing  job  tasks.  The  trial  started  in November 2017. At the outcome of the preliminary hearings, the Court of Potenza, on  March 10, 2021, acquitted all the defendants in relation to the allegation of false statements in an administrative deed, while in relation to the request of administrative fines, the Court declared that there was no need to proceed due to the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nstatute of limitations. Finally, in relation to the alleged crime of illegal trafficking of waste, the Court acquitted two  former  employees  of  the  Southern  District  for not having committed the crime, while convicted six former officials of the same District with suspension of the sentence and at the same time sentenced Eni pursuant to Legislative Decree no. 231/01 to pay a fine of \u20ac700,000, with the contextual confiscation of a sum of \u20ac44,248,071 deemed to constitute the unfair profit obtained from the crime, from which Eni will deduct the amount incurred for the plant upgrade carried out in 2016. The Court reserved the term of ninety days for the filing of the reasons of the sentence and an appeal will be promptly filed against all the condemnations.\n\n- (x) Eni SpA - Health investigation related to the COVA center. Beside  the  criminal  proceeding  for  illegal trafficking  of  waste,  the  Public  Prosecutor  started another  investigation  in  relation  to  alleged  health violations. The Public Prosecutor requested the formal opening of an investigation with respect to nine people in relation to alleged violations of the rules providing for the preparation of a Risk Assessment Document of the working conditions at the Val d'Agri Oil Center (COVA). In March 2017, following the request of the consultant of the Prosecutor, the Labor Inspectorate of  Potenza  issued  a  fine  against  the  employers  of the  COVA  for  omitted  and  incomplete  assessment of the chemical risks for the COVA center. In October 2017,  the  Prosecutor's  Office  changed  the  criminal allegations to disaster, murder and negligent personal injury,  also  alleging  breaches  of  health  and  safety regulations. The proceeding is ongoing.\n- (xi) Proceeding  Val  d'Agri  -  Tank  spill. In  February 2017, the Italian police department of Potenza found a  stream  of  water  contaminated  by  hydrocarbon traces of unknown origin, flowing inside a small shaft located  outside  the  COVA.  Eni  carried  out  activities at  the  COVA  aimed  at  determining  the  origin  of  the contamination  and  identified  the  cause  in  a  failure of  a  tank  (the  'D'  tank)  outside  of  the  COVA,  that presented a risk of extension of the contamination in the downstream area of the plant. In executing these activities,  Eni  performed  all  the  communications provided for by Legislative Decree 152/06 and started certain  emergency  safe-keeping  operations  at  the areas subject to potential contamination outside the COVA. Furthermore, the characterization plan of  the areas inside and outside the COVA was approved by the  relevant  authorities,  to  which  the  Risk  Analysis document  was  subsequently  submitted.  Following this  event,  a  criminal  investigation  was  initiated  in",

The Company has paid damages of an immaterial amount almost to all the landlords  of  areas  close  to  the  COVA,  which  were affected by a spillover. Discussions are ongoing with other claimants. The likely disbursements relating to these transactions have been provisioned. In February 2018, Eni contested the reports presented in October and in December 2017 by the Italian Fire Department stating that it does not consider itself obliged to carry out the integration required, considering that the data acquired in the area affected by the event indicate, according  to  Eni's  assessments,  that  the  loss  was promptly and efficiently controlled and there were no situations of serious danger to human health and the environment.  In  April  2019,  precautionary  measures were ordered against three Eni employees at the COVA which,  following  an  appeal,  were  canceled  by  the Third Instance Court. In September 2019, the Public Prosecutor requested one of those employees to be put on trial with expedited proceeding, accepted by the Judge  for  preliminary  investigations.  The  judgment was suspended in order to allow the continuation of the  environmental  clean-up  and  reclamation  of  the site. As part of the concomitant procedure against the remaining employees and Eni as the legal entity being  held  liable  pursuant  to  Legislative  Decree  No. 231/01, the Public Prosecutor, after issuing a notice of conclusion of the preliminary investigations, made a request for indictment. The hearings are ongoing.\n\n## (xii) Raffineria di\n\n- Gela  SpA  and  Eni  Mediterranea Idrocarburi SpA - Waste management of the landfill Camastra. In  June  2018,  the  Public  Prosecutor  of\n\nPalermo  (Sicily)  notified  Eni's  subsidiaries  Raffineria di  Gela  SpA  and  Eni  Mediterranea  Idrocarburi  SpA of  a  criminal  proceeding  relating  to  allegations  of unlawful disposal of industrial waste resulting from the reclaiming activities of soil, which were discharged at  a  landfill  owned  by  a  third  party.  The  Prosecutor charged the then chief executive officers of the two subsidiaries, and the legal entities have been charged with  the  liability  pursuant  to  Legislative  Decree  No. 231/01. The alleged wrongdoing related to the willful\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n267\n\nfalsification of the waste certification for purpose of discharging  at  the  landfill.  The  charges  against  the CEO  of  the  Refinery  of  Gela  SpA  and  the  company itself  were  dismissed,  while  a  request  to  put  on trial  the  CEO  of  EniMed  SpA  and  the  company  was approved. The proceeding is in progress before the Court of Agrigento, to which the proceeding has been transferred due to territorial jurisdiction.\n\n- (xiii) Versalis  SpA  -  Preventive  seizure  at  the  Priolo Gargallo  plant. In  February  2019,  the  Court  of Syracuse  at  the  request  of  the  Public  Prosecutor ordered the seizure of the Priolo/Gargallo plant as part of an ongoing investigation concerning the offenses of dangerous disposal of materials and environmental pollution,  by  the  former  plant  manager  of  Versalis, pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 231/01. The Public Prosecutor's  thesis,  according  to  the  consultants, is  that  the  plants  covered  by  the  provision  have points  of  emissions  that  do  not  comply  with  the Best  Available  Techniques  (BAT),  therefore  resulting in violation of the applicable legislation. Versalis has already implemented certain plant upgrades designed to  comply  with  measures  requested  by  the  Public Prosecutor  and  his  consultants.  Based  on  this,  an appeal was filed against the measure of precautionary seizure  of  the  plant  before  a  review  court,  which revoked the seizure of the plants on March 26, 2019. In March 2021, a notice of conclusion of the preliminary investigations was notified, with the formulation by the Public Prosecutor of the allegations already previously stated.\n\n## (xiv) Eni SpA - Fatal accident Ancona offshore platform.\n\n- On  March  5,  2019,  a  fatal  accident  occurred  at  the Barbara F platform in the offshore of Ancona. During the unloading phase of a tank from the platform to a supply vessel, there was a sudden failure of a part of the structure on which a crane was installed, causing the  death  of  an  Eni  employee  who  was  inside  the control cabin of the crane and injuries to two other workers.  The  Public  Prosecutor  of  Ancona  initially opened  an  investigation  against  unknown  persons and ordered further technical appraisals relating to the  crane.  As  part  of  the  technical  assessment  of the  incident,  the  Public  Prosecutor  resolved  to  put under investigation the Eni employees who were in charge  of  safety  standards  at  the  involved  facility. Also the Company has been put under investigation pursuant  to  Legislative  Decree  No.  231/01,  which holds  companies  liable  for  the  crimes  committed by employees in a number of matters, including the violations of laws about safety of the workplace.

Following  complaints made by former contractors, the Public Prosecutor's Office  of  Gela  issued  an  inspection  and  seizure  of the  area  called  Isola  32  within  the  refinery  of  Gela, where  old  and  new  monitored  landfills  are  located. The  proceeding  concerns  criminal  allegations  of environmental  pollution,  omitted  clean-up,  negligent personal injury and illegal waste management, as part of the execution of clean-up of soil and groundwater as  well  as  decommissioning  activities  in  the  area currently managed by Eni Rewind SpA, also on behalf of the companies Raffineria di Gela SpA, ISAF SpA (in liquidation) and Versalis SpA (efficiency and efficacy of the barrier system). The Public Prosecutor acquired documents and evidence at the Syndial office in Gela and at the refinery  of  Gela,  which,  during  the  period January  1,  2017  -  March  20,  2019,  managed  the facilities involved in cleaning up the groundwater area (TAF  Syndial,  site  TAF-TAS  and  pumping  wells  and hydraulic barrier). Subsequently a decree was issued for  the  seizure  of  eleven  (11)  piezometers  of  the hydraulic  barrier  system  with  contextual  guarantee notice, issued by the Public Prosecutor of Gela against nine employees of Gela Refinery and four employees of Syndial SpA. The proceedings are ongoing.\n\n## (xvi)\n\n- Eni Rewind SpA and Versalis - Mantua. Environmental crime  investigation. In August  and  September 2020,  the  Public  Prosecutor  of  Mantua  notified  the conclusion of the preliminary investigations relating to several criminal proceedings. Several employees of the Eni's subsidiaries Versalis SpA and Eni Rewind SpA as well as of a third-party company Edison SpA were notified  of  being  under  investigations.  Furthermore the  above-mentioned  entities  were  being  held  liable for the alleged crimes committed on their own interest by  their  own  employees  pursuant  to  Legislative Decree No. 231/01. The Public Prosecutor is alleging, depending  on  some  specific  areas  related  to  the Mantua  industrial  hub,  the  crimes  of  unauthorized waste management, environmental damage/ pollution,  omitted  communication  of  environmental contamination  and  omitted  clean-up.  Following  the filing of defense briefs, the case has been dismissed against  some  individuals.  The  Public  Prosecutor's Office  requested  the  indictment  of  the  remaining defendants, not yet notified, confirming the allegations referred to in the closing of the investigation.\n\n(xvii)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nVersalis  SpA  -  Brindisi  plant  factory  flares  and odor  emissions  -  Criminal  procedure  n.  6580/18 R.G.  Mod.  44  against  unknown  persons. On  May 18, 2018 the manager of the Versalis plant in Brindisi and two other employees were summoned in order to provide brief information regarding two episodes that occurred in April 2018, which led to the activation of the plant torches. The company collaborated with the judicial authorities to provide useful information to exclude that such events may have had a negative and  significant  impact  on  air  quality.  Moreover,  the Company  is  reviewing  available  data  as  well  as carrying out some important upgrading to minimize any detrimental effect, even if only visual, of the flaring phenomenon with the construction of a new ground torch facility.\n\nAt the end of May 2020, in conjunction with a scheduled shutdown of the plant, anomalous concentrations of benzene and toluene were detected; on those bases, the mayor of Brindisi ordered the plant shutdown. The order was issued without any technical check on the real correlation between the peaks detected in the air and the activities in progress at the plant. After a close discussion with the authorities in charge, the order was revoked. However, the Public Prosecutor acquired information  and  documents,  also  produced  by  the Company itself, on the aforementioned order to verify, also from a criminal point of view, any connection or responsibilities.\n\nThe proceeding has been filed for the time being against unknown persons and it is not possible to exclude that this event may be the subject of a proceeding from the Public Prosecutor's Office. The company is providing all the involved local authorities with all the useful information for the correct reconstruction of the facts.\n\n- (xviii) Eni  SpA  R&M  Depot  of  Civitavecchia  -  Criminal proceedings for groundwater pollution. In the period in  which  Eni  was  in  charge  of  the  Civitavecchia storage  hub  (2008-2018),  pending  the  approval  of a characterization plan of the environmental status of the site, the Company, in coordination with public authorities, adopted measures to preserve the safety of  the  groundwaters  and  to  pursue  the  clean-up process of the site until its disposal.\n\nThe  Public  Prosecutor  of  Civitavecchia  issued  a notice of conclusion of the preliminary investigations, contesting,  among  others,  the  former  manager  of the Eni fuel storage hub of Civitavecchia, the alleged crime  of  environmental  pollution  in  relation  to  the mismanagement of the hydraulic barrier placed over the site aimed at putting under emergency safety the contaminated  groundwater,  as  part  of  the  clean-up",

Eni is under investigation pursuant to Legislative Decree 231/2001.  The prosecutor made a request for indictment.\n\n## 1.2 Civil and administrative proceedings in the matters of environment, health and safety\n\n## (i) Eni Rewind SpA - Summon for alleged environmental damage caused by DDT pollution in Lake Maggiore.\n\nIn  May  2003,  the  Ministry  for  the  Environment claimed compensation from Eni Rewind for alleged environmental damage caused by the activity at the Pieve Vergonte plant in the years 1990 through 1996. In July 2008, the District Court of Turin ordered Eni Rewind to pay environmental damages amounting to \u20ac1,833.5 million, plus interests accrued from the filing of the decision. Eni and its subsidiary deemed the amount of the environmental damage to be absolutely groundless as the sentence lacked sufficient elements to support such a material amount of the liability  from  the  volume  of  pollutants  ascertained by  the  Italian  Environmental  Minister.  In  July  2009, Eni  Rewind  filed  an  appeal  and  consequently  the proceeding  continued  before  a  second  Instance Court  of  Turin  that  requested  a  technical  appraisal on the matter. The consultants that undertook this appraisal concluded that: (i) no further measure for environmental restoration is required; (ii) there was no significant and measurable impact on the environment of the ecosystem, therefore no restoration or damage compensation  should  be  claimed;  the  only  impact seen  concerned  fishing  activity,  with  an  estimated damage of \u20ac7 million which could be already restored through  the  measures  proposed  by  Eni  Rewind, and; (iii) the necessity and convenience of dredging should be excluded, both from the legal and scientific point of view, while confirming  technical  and scientific  correctness  of  the  Eni  Rewind's  approach based on the monitoring of the process of natural recovery, which is estimated to require 20 years. In March 2017, the second Instance Court: (i) excluded the application  of  compensation  for  monetary equivalent; (ii) annulled the monetary compensation of \u20ac1.8 billion requesting Eni Rewind to perform the already  approved  clean-up  project  of  the  polluted areas,  which  comprise  groundwater,  as  well  as compensatory remediation works. The value of these compensatory works required by the Court, in case of Eni Rewind failure or misperformance, is estimated at \u20ac9.5 million. The clean-up project filed by Eni Rewind\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n269\n\nwas ratified by the authorities and is currently being executed. Expenditures expected to be incurred have been  provisioned  in  the  environmental  provision. Any other claims filed by the Italian Minister for the Environment  were  rejected  by  the  court  (including compensation  for  non-material  damage).  In  April 2018, the Ministry for the Environment filed an appeal to  the  Third  Instance  Court.  Following  this  appeal, the Company appeared in Court. After the hearings in July 2020 and in January 2021, the sentence is still ongoing.\n\n## (ii) Eni Rewind SpA - Versalis SpA - Eni SpA (R&M)\n\n-  Augusta  harbor. The  Italian  Ministry  for  the Environment with various administrative acts required  companies  that  were  operating  plants  in the petrochemical site of Priolo to perform safety and environmental remediation works in the Augusta harbor. Companies involved include Eni subsidiaries Versalis, Eni Rewind and Eni Refining & Marketing Division.  Pollution  has  been  detected  in  this  area primarily due to a high mercury concentration that is  allegedly  attributed  to  the  industrial  activity  of the Priolo petrochemical site. The above-mentioned companies contested these administrative actions, objecting in particular to the nature of the remediation works decided and the methods whereby information on the pollutants concentration has been gathered. A number of administrative proceedings started on this  matter  were  subsequently  merged  before  the Regional Administrative Court. In October 2012, the Court  ruled  in  favor  of  Eni's  subsidiaries  against the  Ministry's  requirements  for  the  removal  of  the pollutants and the construction of a physical barrier. In  September  2017,  the  Ministry  notified  all  the companies involved of a formal notice for the start of remediation and environmental restoration of the Augusta harbor within 90 days, basing its request on an alleged ascertainment of liability on the basis of the 2012 provision of Regional Administrative Court. The  act,  contested  by  the  co-owner  companies  in December  2017,  constitutes  a  formal  notice  for environmental  damage.  In  June  2019,  the  Italian Ministry  for  the  Environment  set  up  a  permanent technical committee to review the matter of the cleanup and reclamation of the Augusta harbor. The report, recalling the warning of 2017, confirmed the thesis of the parties on the responsibility of the companies co-located  for  the  contamination  of  the  Rada  and affirmed  a  breach  of  the  aforementioned  warning by the companies, also communicated to the Public Prosecutor's Office. In agreement with all the other companies  involved,  this  report  and  other  parallel",

        "page_content": "internal technical investigations were challenged for defensive purposes. Eni's subsidiary proposed to the Italian Environmental Ministry to start a collaboration with  other  interested  parties  to  find  remediation measures based on new available environmental data collected by independent agencies, without prejudice to the need for the parties to correctly identify the legal entity responsible  for the contamination detected. In the meantime, the company requested, in full compliance with applicable environmental laws, to establish a roadmap for identifying the companies accountable  for  the  environmental  pollution  and their respective shares of responsibility in order to (iv)\n\nimplement a clean-up and remediation project. In  September  2020,  the  Company  took  part  in  the Investigation Services Conference  convened  by the  Ministry  of  the  Environment  on  the  results  of the  technical  investigations  and  exhibited,  together with  its  consultants,  the  in-depth  analyzes  on  the environmental state of the Rada and its observations to the report which would lead to the exclusion of any  involvement  of  the  Group  companies  in  the contamination detected.\n\n- (iii) Eni  SpA  -  Eni  Rewind  SpA  (former  Syndial  SpA) -  Raffineria  di  Gela  SpA  -  Claim  for  preventive technical inquiry. In February 2012, Eni's subsidiaries Raffineria  di  Gela  SpA  and  Eni  Rewind  SpA  and  the parent  company  Eni  SpA  (involved  in  this  matter through  the  operations  of  the  Refining  &  Marketing Division) were notified of a claim issued by the parents of  children  with  birth  defects  in  the  Municipality of  Gela  between  1992  and  2007.  The  claim  called for  an  inquiry  aimed  at  determining  any  causality between the birth defects suffered by these children and any environmental pollution caused by the Gela site,  quantifying  the  alleged  damages  suffered  and eventually  identifying  the  terms  and  conditions  to settle the claim. The same issue was the subject of previous criminal proceedings, of which one closed without determining any illegal behavior on the part of  Eni  or  its  subsidiaries,  while  a  further  criminal proceeding  is  still  pending.  In  December  2015,  the three companies involved were sued in relation to a total of 30 cases of compensation for damages in civil proceedings. In May 2018, the Court issued a first instance judgment concerning one case. The Judge rejected the claim for damages, acknowledging the arguments  of  the  defendant  companies  in  relation to the absence of evidence concerning the existence of a causal link between the birth defects and the alleged industrial pollution. The judgement has been appealed.\n\n(v)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEnvironmental claim relating to the Municipality of Cengio. Since 2008 a proceeding is pending by the Court of Genoa, brought by The Ministry for the Environment and  the  Delegated  Commissioner  for  Environmental Emergency in the territory of the Municipality of Cengio. Those  parties  summoned  Eni  Rewind  before  a  Civil Court and demanded Eni's subsidiary compensate for the environmental damage relating to the site of Cengio. The request for environmental damage amounted to \u20ac250 million to which was to be added health damage to  be  quantified  during  the  proceeding.  The  plaintiffs accused Eni Rewind of negligence in performing the clean-up and remediation of the site. In March 2019, the Ministry for the Environment presented a proposal to Eni Rewind to settle the case. The Company responded with  a  counterproposal  in  July  2019.  In  September 2020,  the  debate  reopened  and  the  drafting  of  an agreement shared between the parties and considered to  be  final  also  by  the  representatives  of  the  Ministry was  reached.  The  Ministry,  through  the  Attorney's Office,  at  the  hearing  in  February  2021,  declared  the 'advanced state' of the negotiations, thus allowing the hearing to be postponed to June 2021.\n\nIn March 2021, the Inspection Commission also issued a test certificate for the works carried out on the soils, thereby further strengthening the restorative suitability of the measures carried out by the Company.\n\n- Val D'Agri - Eni/Vibac. In  September  2019  a  claim was  brought  in  the  Court  of  Potenza  against  Eni. The  plaintiffs  are  eighty  people,  living  in  different municipalities  of  the  Val  d'Agri  area,  who  are complaining  of  economic,  non-economic,  biological and moral damages, all deriving from the presence of  Eni's  oil  facilities  in  the  territory.  In  particular,  the claim refers to certain events which allegedly caused damage  to  the  local  community  and  the  territory (such as a 2017 spill, flaring events since 2014, smelly and noisy emissions). The Judge has been asked to ascertain  Eni's  responsibility  for  causing  emissions of  polluting  substances  into  the  atmosphere.  The plaintiffs  have  also  requested  Eni  be  ordered  to interrupt any polluting activity and to be allowed to resume industrial activities on condition that all the necessary  remediation  measures  be  implemented to eliminate all of the alleged dangerous situations. Finally, they are asking that Eni compensate all direct and indirect property damages, current and future, to an extent that will be quantified in the course of the case. At the end of the trial phase, the Judge sent the parties  the  proposal  for  an  extra-judicial  settlement, putting a deadline to present further proposals on the matter.",

        "page_content": "- (vi) Eni SpA - Climate change. In 2017 and 2018, local government  authorities  and  a  fishing  association brought in the courts of the State of California seven proceedings against a controlled entity (Eni Oil & Gas Inc)  and  other  oil  companies.  These  proceedings claim compensation for the damages attributable to the increase in sea level and temperature, as well as to the hydrogeological instability. The cases have been transferred, by request of the defendants, from the State Courts to the Federal Courts. A specific request has been filed, highlighting the lack of jurisdiction of  the  State  Courts.  Following a suspension period waiting for the decision on jurisdiction, on May 26, 2020 the proceedings returned to the State Courts. On July 9,2020, Eni Oil & Gas Inc, together with other defendants, signed a petition for rehearing 'en blanc' to request a review of the postponement decision to  the  competent  '9th  Circuit  Court'.  The  disputes will  remain  suspended  until  a  decision  made  on the  petition  for  rehearing.  The  Court  rejected  the petition  for  rehearing  en  banc  but,  at  the  request of  the  defendants,  granted  a  suspension  of  the proceedings  of  120  days  (until  January  2021)  to allow  the  defendants  themselves  to  present  a  socalled  petition  for  certiorari  to  the  Supreme  Court of  the  United  States  in  order  to  obtain  the  revision of rejection. The petition was presented in January 2021  by  the  defendant;  the  Supreme  Court  of  the United States will rule on the matter by June 2021.\n\n## (vii) Eni Rewind / Province of Vicenza - Clean-up process\n\nfor Trissino site. On  May  7,  2019  the  Province  of Vicenza imposed (with a warning) on some persons and  companies  as  MITENI  SpA  in  bankruptcy, Mitsubishi  and  ICI,  to  clean-up  the  Trissino  site where  MITENI  carried  out  its  industrial  activity.  In this site, in 2018, based on the analysis carried out by  administrative  parties,  significant  concentrations of  substances  considered  highly  toxic-harmful  and carcinogenic were allegedly discovered in groundwater and in surface water. The analysis carried out by the Province  of  Vicenza  with  the  direct  involvement  of the Istituto Superiore di Sanit\u00e0 reported the presence of  these  substances  in  the  blood  of  about  53,000 people in the area. The action of health analysis and monitoring by the institutions is destined to increase. The  Province  warned  some  individuals,  including a  former  employee  who  served  between  1988  and 1996 as CEO of a company that was taken over by Eni Rewind.\n\nIn an initial phase of the administrative procedure, there were no references to the former company Enichem Synthesis,  which  Eni  Rewind  took  over,  therefore\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthe legal assistance and the defense strategy were concentrated supporting only the persons involved. Instead, several appeals to the Regional Administrative Court have arisen in which Eni Rewind was called into question as the 'successor' of Enichem for the period of management of the site as the majority shareholder of MITENI. On the basis of this, in February 2020, the Province extended the proceeding also to Eni Rewind which set a procedural brief for the prompt filing of the proceeding against it.\n\nHowever, on October 5, 2020 the Province notified a warning with which it would have identified Eni Rewind as further responsible for the potential contamination of the Trissino site. On December 4, 2020 Eni Rewind appealed  to  the  Administrative  Court,  pending  the setting of the hearing.\n\nEni Rewind was also invited to take part in several meetings that will be held by the Public Entities in relation to the site remediation interventions, and has already participated in the first one held on December 23, 2020, without thereby granting any acquiescence to the provisions issued by the Province. Access to the documents is ongoing with the Public Authorities aimed at acquiring a complete knowledge of the facts and  being  able  to  integrate  the  defenses  in  these proceedings. In order to carry out a transversal study on the issue of PFAS, the company has established a Working Group (WG) that will analyze the technicalenvironmental,  toxicological  and  regulatory  aspects also  addressing  the  issue  with  an  international approach. In addition to Eni Group personnel, three external  competent  consultants  for  the  respective subjects are part of the WG.\n\n## 2. Proceedings concerning criminal/administrative corporate responsibility\n\n(i)\n\n- Block OPL 245 - Nigeria. A criminal case is ongoing before  the  Court  of  Milan  alleging  international corruption in connection with the acquisition in 2011 of the OPL 245 exploration block in Nigeria. In July 2014, the Public Prosecutor of Milan served Eni with a notice of investigation pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree No. 231/01. The proceeding was commenced following a claim filed by NGO ReCommon relating to alleged corruptive practices which, according to the Public  Prosecutor,  allegedly  involved  the  Resolution Agreement  made  on  April  29,  2011  relating  to  the so-called  Oil  Prospecting  License  of  the  offshore oilfield  that  was  discovered  in  OPL  245.  Eni  fully cooperated with the Public Prosecutor and promptly filed  the  requested  documentation.  Furthermore,  Eni voluntarily reported the matter to the US Department",

        "page_content": "of Justice and the US SEC. In July 2014, Eni's Board of Statutory Auditors jointly with the Eni Watch Structure resolved  to  engage  an  independent,  US-based  law firm,  expert  in  anticorruption,  to  conduct  a  forensic, independent review of the matter, upon informing the Judicial Authorities. After reviewing the matter, the US lawyers concluded that they detected no evidence of wrongdoing by Eni in relation to the 2011 transaction with the Nigerian government for the acquisition of the OPL 245 license. In September 2014, the Public Prosecutor  notified  Eni  of  a  restraining  order  issued by a British judge who ordered the seizure of a bank account not pertaining to Eni domiciled at a British bank following a request from the Public Prosecutor. Since the act had also been notified to some persons, including  the  CEO  of  Eni  and  the  former  Chief Development,  Operation  &  Technology  Officer  of  Eni and the former CEO of Eni, it was assumed that the same had been registered in the register of suspects at the Milan Prosecutor's office. During a hearing before a court in London in September 2014, Eni and its current executive officers stated their non- involvement in the matter regarding the seized bank account. Following the  hearing,  the  Court  reaffirmed  the  seizure.  In December 2016, the Public Prosecutor of Milan notified Eni of the conclusion of the preliminary investigation and  requested  Eni's  CEO,  the  Chief  Development, Operations and Technological Officer and the Executive Vice President for international negotiations to stand trial, as well as Eni's former CEO and Eni SpA, pursuant to  Italian  Legislative  Decree  No.  231/01.  Upon  the notification to Eni of the conclusion of the preliminary investigation by the Public Prosecutor, the independent US-based law firm was requested to assess whether the new documentation made available from Italian prosecutors  could  modify  the  conclusions  of  the prior review. The US law firm was also provided with the  documentation  filed  in  the  Nigerian  proceeding mentioned  below.  The  independent  US  law  firm concluded that the reappraisal of the matter in light of the new documentation available did not alter the outcome of the prior review. In September 2019, the DoJ notified Eni that based on the information it currently possessed, the DoJ was closing its investigation of Eni in  connection with OPL 245 without the filing of any charges. In December 2017, the Judge for preliminary investigation ordered the indictment of all the parties mentioned above, and other parties under investigation by the Public Prosecutor, before the Court of Milan. The request of the Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN) for admission as a civil claimant in the proceedings was granted  in  July  2018.  The  first  instance  trial  of the Milan Prosecutor's OPL 245 charges began before\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthe  Court  of  Milan  on  June  20,  2018.  Following  the discussion of the parties, in response to the request for conviction for all the individuals and companies involved, at the hearing of March 17, 2021 the judge fully acquitted all the defendants,  since there was no case.\n\nIn  January  2017,  Eni's  subsidiary  Nigerian  Agip Exploration Ltd ('NAE') became aware of an Interim Order of Attachment ('Order') issued by the Nigerian Federal High Court upon request  from  the  Nigerian Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), attaching OPL 245 temporarily pending a proceeding in Nigeria relating to alleged corruption and money laundering. After making this application, Eni became aware  of  a  formal  filing  of  charges  by  the  EFCC against NAE and other parties. In March 2017, the Nigerian Court revoked the Order. To NAE's knowledge EFCC charges have not been dropped but none of the defendants were served nor arraigned. In November 2018,  Eni  SpA  and  its  subsidiaries  NAE,  NAOC  and AENR (as well as some companies of the Shell Group) were notified of the intention of the FGN to bring a civil claim before an English court to obtain compensation for damages allegedly deriving from the transaction that resulted in assignment of the OPL 245 to NAE and  Shell  subsidiary  SNEPCO  (Shell  subsidiary). On  April  15,  2019  the  Nigerian  subsidiaries  NAE, NAOC and AENR received formal notification  of  the commencement  of  the  proceeding,  while  similar notification was received by Eni SpA on May 16, 2019. In the introductory deeds of the proceeding, the claim is  set  at  $1,092  million  or  at  any  other  amount  that will be established during the proceedings. The FGN has based its assessment on an estimated fair value of the asset of $3.5 billion. Eni's interest in the asset is 50%. As the FGN is also acting as claimant in the Italian  proceeding  before  the  Court  of  Milan,  this claim appears to duplicate the claims made before the Milan's Court against Eni employees. On May 22, 2020, the Judge accepted the exception presented by Eni and declined its jurisdiction over the case, having found the judicial pending with the Milan procedure according to the criteria set out in Regulation (EU) No 1215/2012.  The  Appeal  Court  obtained  permission to appeal against the decision. Similarly, the Appeal Court rejected the Nigerian Government's request to appeal the decision, thus making it definitive.\n\nOn  January  20,  2020,  NAE  subsidiary  was  notified of the beginning of a new criminal case before the Federal High Court in Abuja. The proceeding, mainly focused on the accusations against Nigerian persons (including  the  Minister  of  Justice  in  office  in  2011, at  the  time  of  the  disputed  facts),  involves  NAE",

The  beginning  of  the trial, scheduled for the end of March 2020, has been postponed  for  the  closure  of  the  judicial  offices  in Nigeria  due  to  COVID-19  emergency.  A  new  hearing has not been scheduled to date.\n\n(ii)\n\nCongo. In March 2017, the Italian Finance Police served Eni with an information request in accordance with the Italian Code of Criminal Procedure in connection with an investigative file opened by the Public Prosecutor of  Milan  against  unknown  persons.  The  request related in particular to the agreements signed by Eni Congo SA with the Ministry  of  Hydrocarbons  of  the Republic of Congo in 2013, 2014 and 2015 in relation to exploration, development and production activities concerning  certain  permits  held  by  Eni  Congo  SA for  Congolese  projects  and  Eni's  relationships  with Congolese  companies  that  hold  stakes  in  those projects.  In  July  2017,  the  Italian  Financial  Police, on behalf of the Public Prosecutor of Milan, served Eni  with  another  information  request  and  a  notice of  investigation  pursuant  to  Legislative  Decree  No. 231/01  for  alleged  international  corruption.  The request expressly stated that it was based in part on the March 2017 information request and concerned the relationship of Eni and its subsidiaries with certain third-party companies from 2012 to the present. Eni produced all of the documentation requested in March and July 2017 and voluntarily disclosed this matter to the relevant US authorities (SEC and DoJ). In January 2018, the Public Prosecutor's Office requested a sixmonths  extension  of  the  deadline  for  conducting its  preliminary  investigation  into  this  matter,  from January 31, 2018 until July 30, 2018. Subsequently in  July  2018,  the  Public  Prosecutor  requested  a second  extension  until  February  28,  2019.  In  April 2018, the Public Prosecutor of Milan served Eni SpA with a further request for documentation and notified a  former  Eni  employee,  who  was  the  then  Chief Development,  Operation  &  Technology  Officer,  of  a search order stating that he and another Eni employee had been placed under investigation.\n\nIn October 2018, the Public Prosecutor ordered the seizure of an e-mail account of another Eni manager, who was formerly the general director of Eni in Congo during the period 2010-2013. In December 2018 and subsequently in May, September and December 2019, Eni  was  notified  by  the  Public  Prosecutor  of  Milan of a request for documents in accordance with the Italian Code of Criminal Procedure, concerning some\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\neconomic transactions between Eni Group companies and  certain  third-party  companies.  All  the  required documentation has been produced to the Judge.\n\nIn September 2019, the Company was informed that the Company's CEO was served with a search decree and  an  investigation  decree  in  connection  with  an alleged violation of article 2629 bis of the Italian Civil Code which penalizes directors of listed companies, who  fail  to  communicate  conflicts  of  interest.  The alleged omission relates to the supply of logistics and transportation  services  to  certain  Eni's  subsidiaries operating  in  Africa,  among  which  Eni  Congo  SA,  by third-party  companies  owned  by  Petroserve  Holding BV,  in  the  period  2007-2018.  The  claims  are  based on  the  allegations  that  the  wife  of  the  Company's CEO retained a shareholding of the above-mentioned holding company during part of the period of time under investigation. The Board of Directors of Eni SpA has never been involved in any resolution concerning the suppliers under  investigation. Subsequently, on June 15, 2020, the company was informed that an extension of the investigations relating to these allegations  was  requested  until  December  21,  2020. In  April  2018,  the  Board  of  Statutory  Auditors,  the Watch Structure and the Control and Risk Committee of Eni jointly appointed an independent law firm and a professional consulting company, knowledgeable in the matter of anti-corruption, to carry out a forensic review of facts relating to Eni's work in Congo. Such review  did  not  find  any  factual  evidence  as  to  the involvement of Eni, nor of any Eni employees and key managers, in the alleged crimes.\n\nIn  November  2019,  following  the  notification  of further investigative documents, the Board of Statutory Auditors, the Watch Structure of Eni and the Control  and  Risk  Committee  asked  the  professional consultants, which had been engaged in 2018, also to review the conclusions reached, in the light of the documentation made available following the decree notified  to  the  CEO  in  September  2019. The  second report of the consultants, which was delivered in July 2020, integrates the findings achieved in the first report, particularly  indicating  that:  (i)  it  is  probable  that  the CEO's wife retained a shareholding in the Petroserve Group for a few years, at least, starting from 2009 until 2012; (ii) there is an absence of evidence to contradict the  statements  made  by  the  CEO  as  to  his  lack  of knowledge of his wife's interests in the ownership of Petroserve  Group;  (iii)  absence  of  evidence  that  the activity  of  the  abovementioned  involved  employees was carried out in the interest of Eni.\n\nOn September 9, 2020, Eni was notified of a decree, setting  a  hearing  due  to  the  filing  by  the  Public",

However, this five-year limitation term would have been suspended due  to  the  recent  anti-COVID-19  legislation  until September 16, 2020. The Judge also stated that a claim was pending before the Constitutional Court about the constitutional legitimacy of the aforementioned antiCOVID-19 legislation, with particular reference to the principle  of  non-retroactivity  of  an  unfavorable  rule. Therefore, the hearing initially set for September 21, 2020, was postponed initially to December 10, 2020 pending the resolution of the Constitutional Court and then, once the Court resolved to declare the legitimacy of the anti-COVID-19 rule to February 17, 2021 also to await the filing of the reasons for the sentence.\n\nThe  hearing  of  February  17,  2021  was  postponed to March 25, 2021, due to the fact that the Public Prosecutor  changed  the  charge  from  international corruption to undue inducement to give or promise benefits,  a  possible  course  of  action  was  explored whereby the public prosecutor and the defendant may request the judge to apply a penalty. On March 15, 2021, the Board of Directors of Eni SpA approved the granting of a special power of attorney in favor of the defense lawyer of Eni SpA, the entity legally liable, to propose a motion to apply a penalty on request of the parties.\n\nThe  sanction  agreed  with  the  Public  Prosecutor amounts to \u20ac11.8 million. At the hearing on March 25, 2021 the Judge for Preliminary Investigations accepted the agreed sanction and the Prosecutor also revoked the request for a restrictive measure for Eni SpA.\n\n## 3. Other proceedings concerning criminal matters\n\n## (i)\n\n- Eni  SpA  (R&M)  -  Criminal  proceedings  on  fuel excise  tax. A  criminal  proceeding  is  currently pending, relating to alleged evasion of excise taxes in  the  context  of  retail  sales  in  the  fuel  market. In  particular,  the  claim  states  that  the  quantity  of oil  products  marketed  by  Eni  was  larger  than  the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nquantity subjected to the excise tax. This proceeding (No.  7320/2014  RGNR)  concerns  the  combination of three distinct investigations: (i) A first proceeding, opened by the Public Prosecutor's Office of Frosinone involved  a  company  (Turrizziani  Petroli)  purchaser of  Eni's  fuel.  This  investigation  was  subsequently extended  to  Eni.  The  Company  fully  cooperated and  provided  all  data  and  information  concerning the excise tax obligations for the quantities of fuel coming from the storage sites of Gaeta, Naples and Livorno.  Such  proceeding  referred  to  quantities  of oil  products  sold  by  Eni,  allegedly  larger  than  the quantity  subjected  to  the  excise  tax.  (ii)  A  second proceeding, concerning an investigation by the Public Prosecutor's  Office  of  Prato,  commenced  in  regard to the deposit of Calenzano and relates to abduction of fuel through manipulation of the fuel dispensers, subsequently  extended  also  to  the  Refinery  of Stagno (Livorno); (iii) A third proceeding, opened by the  Public  Prosecutor's  Office  of  Rome,  concerns alleged missing payment of excise tax on the surplus of the unloading products, as the quantity of such products  was  larger  than  the  quantity  reported  in the  supporting  fiscal  documents.  This  proceeding represents  a  development  of  the  first  proceeding mentioned above and substantially concerns similar facts  presenting,  however,  some  differences  with regard to the nature of the alleged crimes and the responsibility.\n\nThe Public Prosecutor's Office of Rome has alleged the  existence  of  a  criminal  conspiracy  aimed  at habitual abduction of oil products at all of the 22 storage sites which are operated by Eni in Italy. Eni is cooperating with the Prosecutor in order to defend the correctness of its operation. In September 2014, a search was conducted at the office of the former chief of the R&M Division in Rome. The motivations of the search are the same as the above-mentioned proceeding as the ongoing investigations also relate to a period of time when the officer was in charge at Eni's R&M Division. In March 2015, the Prosecutor of Rome ordered a search at all the storage sites of Eni's network in Italy as part of the same proceeding. The  search  was  intended  to  verify  the  existence of  fraudulent  practices  aimed  at  tampering  with measuring systems functional to the tax compliance of  excise  duties  in  relation  to  fuel  handling  at the  storage  sites.  In  September  2015,  the  Public Prosecutor  of  Rome  requested  a  one-off  technical appraisal  aimed  to  verify  the  compliance  of  the software installed at certain metric heads previously seized with those lodged by the manufacturer at the Ministry  of  Economic  Development.

Eni  has  continued  to  provide  full cooperation to the authorities.\n\nDuring  2018,  as  part  of  the  general  proceeding  no. 7320/2014, the Public Prosecutor of Rome notified the conclusion of the preliminary investigations in relation to the criminal proceeding concerning the Calenzano, Pomezia,  Naples,  Gaeta  and  Ortona  storage  sites and  the  Livorno  and  Sannazzaro  refineries.  Based on the outcome of the investigations, as far as Eni is concerned, the proceeding involves former managers and  directors  of  the  logistic  sites  and  refineries indicated above concerning alleged aggravated and continuous  non-payment  of  excise  duties,  alteration and removal of seals, use and possession of false measures and weights instruments. In addition, for the Calenzano site, three employees and their manager of the storage site were accused of alleged procedural fraud.\n\nIn September 2018, Eni received, as injured party, the notification of the schedule of hearing issued by the Court of Rome, in relation to criminal association and other minor claims, against numerous persons under investigation - including  over  forty  Eni  employees subject   of   a   separated   proceeding (No. 22066/17 RGNR), for which, in May 2017, the Public Prosecutor's Office  had  requested  the  dismissal.  At  the  end  of the  hearing  in  December  2018,  the  Judge  accepted the request for dismissal for several persons under investigation, including thirteen Eni employees. The Judge also initially rejected the request of indictment for  criminal  association  relating  to  twenty-eight  Eni employees  (including  the  former  managers  of  the R&M Division).\n\nAs part of the separate proceeding no. 22066/2017 RGNR, following the re-filing by the Public Prosecutor of the indictment for criminal association, following a preliminary hearing, the judge resolved to dismiss the case against all of the defendants because allegations were found to be groundless.\n\n- (ii) Eni SpA - Public Prosecutor of Milan - Criminal proceeding  no.  12333/2017. In  February  2018, Eni was notified of a search and seizure decree in relation  to  allegations  of  associative  crime  aimed at  slander  and  at  reporting  false  information  to  a Public Prosecutor. In the decree, the Prosecutor of Milan  included,  among  the  other  persons  under investigation, a former external lawyer and a former Eni manager, at the time of the facts holding strategic positions in the Company. According to the decree,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n275\n\nthe association is allegedly aimed at interfering with the judicial activity in certain criminal proceedings that are involving, among others, Eni and some of its directors and managers. Afterwards, the Control and  Risks  Committee,  having  consulted  the  Board of  Statutory  Auditors,  and  together  with  the  Watch Structure,  agreed  to  engage  an  auditing  firm  to perform an internal audit of all relevant facts and circumstances and all records and documentation relating  to  the  matter  with  respect  to  the  events of    the    aforementioned    proceeding,  including  a forensic  review.  The  final  report,  submitted  to  the Control  and  Risk  Committee,  the  Watch  Structure and the Board of Statutory Auditors on September 12, 2018, concluded that following the review carried out  with  respect  to  the  allegations  made  by  the Public Prosecutor of Milan, there was not sufficient factual  evidence  to  prove  the  involvement  of    the aforementioned former manager of Eni in the alleged crimes.  On  April  19,  2018,  the  Board  of  Directors appointed  two  external  consultants,  a  criminal lawyer and a civil lawyer to provide independent legal advice in relation to the facts under investigation. Their report, dated November 22, 2018, did not find facts which could suggest any involvement of any Eni employees in the crimes alleged by the Public Prosecutor.  On  June  4,  2018,  Consob,  the  Italian market  regulator,  requested  to  be  informed  about the above-mentioned  proceeding.  The  request was addressed to the Company and to its Board of Statutory Auditors.\n\nSpecifically,  Consob  asked  for  the  outcome  of  the forensic review and to be updated about any other audit action taken in relation to the matter by the Company and by its Board of Statutory Auditors. The Board of Statutory Auditors was also requested to report about the  findings  of  the  additional  audit  program  agreed with an external auditor regarding the matter and to keep  Consob  updated  about  any  further  initiatives adopted.  The  Company  answered  the  request  on June 11, 2018. Subsequently, the Company finalized its response  by  sending  further  documentation including  the  final  report  of  the  independent  third party and the reports of the consultants of the Board of  Directors.  The  Board  of  Statutory  Auditors  has periodically  updated  Consob  of  the  initiatives  taken as  part  of  the  Board's  monitoring  responsibilities with several communications, the last of which on July  25,  2020.  On  June  13,  2018,  Eni  was  notified of  a  request  from  the  Prosecutor  Office  to  transmit certain documentation in accordance with the Italian Code  of  Criminal  Procedure.  The  request  targeted evidence and documents relating to the internal audit",

This lawyer appears to be investigated as part of this proceeding. The reports of the independent third party and of the consultant of the Board of directors were also sent to the Public Prosecutor.\n\nIn  May  and  June  2019,  in  the  context  of  the  same proceeding, the Court of Milan notified Eni and three of its subsidiaries (ETS SpA, Versalis SpA, Ecofuel SpA) of various requests for documentation in accordance with  the  Italian  Code  of  Criminal  Procedure.  At  the same time, on May 23, 2019, Eni was served a notice that  the  Company  is  being  investigated  pursuant  to Legislative Decree No. 231/01, with reference to the crime sanctioned by the Italian Penal Code concerning 'inducement not to make statements or to make false statements to the judicial authority'.\n\nThe object of the aforementioned requests particularly concerned the relations with two business partners, access  to  Eni  offices  of  certain  third  parties,  also on  behalf  of  one  of  the  above-mentioned  business partners,  the  mailbox  of  some  employees  and former  employees,  the  documentation  concerning the relations (and the interruption of those relations) with  the  former  external  lawyer  investigated  in  the proceeding, the internal audit reports and the reports of  the  Company's  bodies  that  dealt  with  assessing these  relationships.  Following  internal  audits,  on June 21, 2019, the Company sued for fraud a former employee at its subsidiary ETS, who was fired on May 28, 2019, and also filed a complaint before the Judicial Authority to ascertain possible complicity in fraud of other third parties.\n\nOn  August  14,  2019,  the  Italian  tax  police  sent  a new request for information to Eni, concerning the economic  relations  between  Eni  Group  companies and an external professional.\n\nIn November 2019, Eni received a notice to extend the preliminary  investigations.  The  notice  also  covered the  investigations  of  the  alleged  breach  of  certain provisions  of  Italian  Law  Decree  231/01  until  May 2020 on part of Eni. Furthermore, it was ascertained that certain former Eni employees have been charged with  various  criminal  allegations.  Those  employees were  a  former  manager  of  Eni's  legal  department, the  former  Chief  Upstream  Officer  of  Eni  and  an employee that was fired in  2013.  A  number  of  third parties  have  also  been  indicted,  among  them,  two former legal consultants of Eni. On January 23, 2020, a  search  decree  and  an  indictment  were  notified  to the Company's Chief Services & Stakeholder Relations Officer,  the  Senior Vice President for Security and to\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- a  manager  of  the  legal  department.  Following  the requests for review of the aforementioned decree, the material  deposited  by  the  Public  Prosecutor's  Office was made available to the Company, which requested its examination by the same consultants appointed in 2018 to examine the documentation. Subsequently, in June, July and September 2020, Eni was notified by the Public Prosecutor of Milan of several requests for documentation concerning, in particular: the results of the inquiries carried out by the internal audit following an anonymous report relating to a hospitality event in  2017;  some  clarifications  regarding  an  invoice issued  by  an  external  law  firm;  the  internal  audit report on relations with a commercial third part; work commitments  of  the  Chief  Services  &  Stakeholder Relations Officer relating to certain dates of 2014 and 2016; the documentation concerning the dismissal of a former Eni employee. All the required documentation has been produced over time to the Judicial Authority. On November 9, 2020, the Company was informed of the notification to Eni's CEO of a technical assessments notice, with contextual guarantee information aimed at allowing participation, through its consultant, in the scheduled review of the content of a telephone device seized from a former Eni employee.\n- (iii) Eni  SpA  -  Public  Prosecutor  of  Milan  -  Insider trading. In  March  2019,  a  request  for  extending certain  investigations  was  notified  to  Eni's  former Chief Upstream Officer by the public prosecutor office of Milan. The commencement of the investigations was otherwise not notified. The investigations related to an alleged breach of Italian provisions that regulate insider trading and  access  to  market-sensitive information.  The  breach  was  allegedly  made  from November  1  to  December  1,  2016.  There  were  no more informative details about the alleged breach in the  notified  document.  This  investigation  has  been combined into the abovementioned one.\n\n## 4. Tax proceedings\n\n- (i) Dispute for omitted payment of a property tax for some  oil  offshore  platforms  located  in  territorial waters. Tax disputes are pending with some Italian local authorities regarding whether Oil & Gas offshore platforms located within territorial boundaries should be subject to a property tax in the period 2016-2019. In 2016 the tax regulatory framework changed due to enactment of law no. 208/2015, which excluded from  the  scope  of  the  property  tax  the  value  of plants instrumental to specific production processes. In addition,  the  Finance  Department  recognized",

        "page_content": "that offshore platforms met  the requirements for classification as instrumental plants and consequently  are  excluded  from  the  scope  of  the property tax (resolution no. 3 of June 1, 2016). Based on this interpretation, Eni did not pay any property tax  for  the  years  2016-2019.  However,  the  ruling  of the  Department  of  Finance  is  not  binding  for  local authorities with taxing powers as recognized by the Third Instance Court and some of these have issued assessment  notices  for  2016-2019.  The  Company filed  an  appeal  against  these  notices.  Although  Eni believes that oil platforms located in the territorial sea should be excluded from the tax base of the property tax on the base of the interpretation of the law in the light of the resolution of the Department of Finance, having  assessed  the  risks  of  losing  in  pending disputes, the Company accrued a risk provision, the amount of which excludes fines since Eni's conduct was based on the administrative resolution, as well as taking into account the reduction of the tax base excluding  the  'plant  component'  as  provided  by  the law. The proceeding is still ongoing.\n\nLaw Decree 124/2019 (enacted with Law 157/2019) has  established,  starting  from  2020,  that  marine platforms  are  subject  to  a  new  property  tax  that will replace and supersede any other ordinary local property tax eventually levied on these plants up to 2019.  This  rule  has  therefore  sanctioned,  starting from 2020, the existence of the tax requirement for these plants.\n\n## 5. Settled proceedings\n\n- (i) EniPower  SpA. In  2004,  the  Public  Prosecutor  of Milan commenced inquiries into contracts awarded by Eni's subsidiary EniPower SpA and as to supplies provided  by  other  companies  to  EniPower  SpA.  It emerged that illicit payments were made by EniPower SpA suppliers to a manager of EniPower SpA who was  immediately  fired.  The  Court  served  EniPower SpA  (the  commissioning  entity)  and  Snamprogetti SpA, now Saipem SpA (contractor of engineering and procurement  services),  with  notices  of  investigation pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 231/01. In August 2007,  Eni  was  notified  that  the  Public  Prosecutor requested  the  dismissal  of  EniPower  SpA  and Snamprogetti  SpA,  while  the  proceeding  continues against former employees of these companies and employees and managers of the suppliers pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 231/01. Eni SpA, EniPower SpA  and  Snamprogetti  SpA  presented  themselves as  plaintiffs.  In  September  2011,  the  Court  of  Milan found  that  nine  persons  were  guilty  for  the  above-\n\n(ii)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nmentioned crimes. In addition, they were sentenced jointly and severally to the payment of all damages to  be  assessed  through  a  specific  proceeding  and to  the  reimbursement  of  the  proceeding  expenses incurred by the plaintiffs. The Court also resolved to dismiss all the criminal indictments for 7 employees, representing  some  companies  involved  as  a  result of  the  statute  of  limitations,  while  the  trial  ended with an acquittal of 15 defendants. In reference to the  parts  involved  in  the  proceeding  pursuant  to Legislative  Decree  No.  231/01,  the  Court  found  that 7 companies are responsible for the administrative offenses  ascribed  to  them,  imposing  a  fine  and  the disgorgement of profit. The Court rejected the position as plaintiffs of the Eni Group companies, reversing the prior decision made by the Court. This decision may have been made based on a pronouncement made by a Third Instance Court that stated the illegitimacy of the constitution as plaintiffs against any legal entity, as indicted pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 231/01. The sentenced parties filed appeal against the abovementioned decision. The Appeal Court issued a ruling that substantially confirmed the first-degree judgment except for the fact that it ascertained the statute of limitation with regard to certain defendants. The Third Instance  Court  successively  annulled  the  judgment of the Second Instance Court ascribing the judgment to  another  section  that,  once  more,  confirmed  the sentence of first instance, excepting the rulings of the previous appeal sentence not subject to annulment, including the statute of limitation. The grounds of the sentence have been filed confirming the motivations provided by the previous instance Courts. An appeal was  filed  at  the  Third  Instance  Court  solely  for  the purposes  of  the  civil  proceeding.  Following  this ruling by the Court, the criminal proceedings can be considered concluded.\n\n- Eni Rewind  SpA  -  Environmental  disaster  at Ferrandina. In January 2018, the Public Prosecutor of Matera commenced a criminal proceeding against a manager of the Eni subsidiary Eni Rewind based on  allegations  of  unlawful  handling  of  waste  and environmental  disaster  as  part  of  the  reclaiming activities performed at an industrial site (Ferrandina/ Pisticci in the south of Italy). The charge related to an alleged spillover of effluent in the subsoil and then in a nearby river due to a damaged pipe dedicated to the transportation  of  effluent  to  a  disposal  plant  owned by a third party. At the preliminary hearing in October 2019, the Judge dismissed the case on the basis that the defendant did not commit any crime. The sentence has become final.",

On  January  15,  2020,  the  second  penal section  of  the  Court  of  Appeal  of  Milan  confirmed the first-degree acquittal sentence against the former Eni  managers  in  relation  to  the  disputes  for  the acquisition  of  the  FCP  by  Eni,  declaring  the  appeal proposed  by  the  Public  prosecutor  inadmissible against the Company. On June 12, 2020, the General Prosecutor  filed  an  appeal  in  Third  Instance  Court for  the  part  of  the  proceeding  relating  to  Saipem, not  expressly  challenging  the  heads  and  points  of the  judgment  relating  to  the  so-called  'Eni  affair  FCP'.  The  Third  Instance  Court  rejected  the  appeal pronounced against Saipem, its former managers and third  party  accused.  In  2012,  Eni  contacted  the  US Department of Justice (DoJ) and the US SEC in order to voluntarily inform them about this matter and has kept them informed about the developments in the Italian  Prosecutors'  investigations  and  proceedings. Following  Eni's  notification,  both  the  US  SEC  and the  DoJ  started  their  own  investigations  regarding this  matter.  Eni  has  furnished  various  information and documents, including the findings of its internal reviews, in response to formal and informal requests. The DoJ notified Eni that based on the information it currently possessed, closing its investigation of Eni in  connection  with  Eni's  and  Saipem's  businesses in  Algeria  without  the  filing  of  any  charges,  ordering the  closure  of  the  proceeding  as  communicated to  the  market on October 1, 2019. In April 2020 Eni, having informed SEC of the acquittal pronounced on appeal on January 15, 2020, however concluded the investigation by the US SEC on Algerian activities of Saipem SpA, with a transaction that does not involve the  admission  of  responsibility.  The  agreement provided  for  the  payment  of  USD  19,750,000,  which represents Eni's part of the tax benefits obtained by Saipem in relation to the costs incurred by Saipem, which  are  non-deductible,  in  addition  to  a  sum  of compensation for interest equal to USD 4,750,000.\n- (iv) Eni  Rewind  SpA  and  Versalis  SpA  -  Summon  for alleged  environmental  damage  caused  by  illegal waste disposal in the municipality of Melilli (Sicily) . In May 2014, the Municipality of Melilli summoned Eni's  subsidiaries  Eni  Rewind  and  Versalis  for  the environmental damage allegedly caused by carrying out illegal waste disposal activities and unauthorized landfill.  In  particular,  the  plaintiff  alleged  Eni  Rewind and Versalis were responsible because they produced the  waste  and  commissioned  the  waste  disposal. The plaintiff stated that this illegal handling of waste was part of certain criminal proceedings dating back to  2001-2003  which  would  have  allegedly  traced\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthe  hazardous  waste  materials  back  to  the  Priolo and  Gela  industrial  sites  that  are  managed  by  the above-mentioned Eni's subsidiaries (in particular, the waste with high mercury concentration and railway sleepers no longer in use). Such waste was allegedly handled  and  disposed  illegally  at  an  unauthorized landfill  owned  by  a  third  party.  Two  subsidiaries  of Eni and a third-party waste company were claimed to be jointly and severally liable for damage amounting to  \u20ac500  million.  The  third-party  company  executed waste disposal at the site. In June 2017, the Judge accepted all the defensive instances of Eni Rewind and Versalis, judging the requests of the Municipality to be inadmissible for lacking right to sue, also considering the  requests  to  be  unfounded  or  unproved,  and ordered the Municipality to refund the expenses of the proceeding. In April 2018, the First Instance Judge rejected the counterclaim filed by the Municipality. An appeal for revocation is pending at the Third Instance Court. In July 2020, the appeal to the Third Instance Court was held. The Judge confirmed the outcome of the previous degrees of judgment, only ordering the Company to pay the expenses of the proceeding that the Company promptly provided.\n\n## Assets under concession arrangements\n\nEni  operates  under  concession  arrangements  mainly  in the  Exploration  &  Production  segment  and  the  Refining  & Marketing  business  line.  In  the  Exploration  &  Production segment, contractual clauses governing mineral concessions, licenses  and  exploration  permits  regulate  the  access  of Eni  to  hydrocarbon  reserves.  Such  clauses  can  differ  in each  country.  In  particular,  mineral  concessions,  licenses and permits are granted by the legal owners and, generally, entered into with government entities, State oil companies and,  in  some  legal  contexts,  private  owners.  Pursuant  to the assignment of mineral concessions, Eni sustains all the operational risks and costs related to the exploration and development activities and it is entitled to the productions realized.  In respect of the mining concessions received, Eni pays royalties in accordance with the tax legislation in force in the country and is required to pay the income taxes deriving from the exploitation of the concession. In production sharing agreement and service contracts, realized productions are defined  based  on  contractual  agreements  with  State  oil companies, which hold the concessions. Such contractual agreements regulate the recovery of costs incurred for the exploration,  development  and  operating  activities  (Cost Oil)  and  give  entitlement to the own portion of the realized productions (Profit Oil). In the Refining & Marketing business line, several service stations and other auxiliary assets of the distribution service are located in the motorway areas and they",

In  exchange  for  the  granting  of  the  services  described above,  Eni  provides  to  the  motorway  companies  fixed  and variable royalties based on quantities sold. At the end of the concession period, all non-removable assets are transferred to the grantor of the concession for no consideration.\n\n## Environmental regulations\n\nIn the future, Eni will sustain significant expenses in relation to compliance with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations and for reclaiming, safety and remediation works of areas previously used for industrial production and dismantled sites. In particular, regarding the environmental risk,  management  does  not  currently  expect  any  material adverse effect upon Eni's Consolidated Financial Statements, taking  account  of  ongoing  remediation  actions,  existing insurance  policies  and  the  environmental  risk  provision accrued in the Consolidated Financial Statements. However, management believes that it is possible that Eni may incur material losses and liabilities in future years in connection with  environmental  matters  due  to:  (i)  the  possibility  of as  yet  unknown  contamination;  (ii)  the  results  of  ongoing surveys and other possible effects of statements required by  Legislative  Decree  152/2006;  (iii)  new  developments  in environmental  regulation  (i.e.  Law  No.  68/2015  on  crimes against the environment and European Directive 2015/2193 on  medium  combustion  plants);  (iv)  the  effect  of  possible\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n279\n\ntechnological changes relating to future remediation; and (v) the  possibility  of  litigation  and  the  difficulty  of  determining Eni's liability,  if  any,  as  against  other  potentially  responsible parties  with  respect  to  such  litigation  and  the  possible insurance recoveries.\n\n## Emission trading\n\nFrom  2013,  the  third  phase  of  the  European  Union Emissions  Trading  Scheme  (EU-ETS)  came  in  force.  The new phase marked a significant change in the method of awarding  emission  allowance  from  a  no-consideration scheme based on historical emissions to allocation through auctioning.  For  the  period  2013-2020,  the  award  of  free emission  allowances  is  performed  based  on  European benchmarks specific to each industrial segment, except for the thermoelectric sector that is not eligible for allocations for  no  consideration.  This  regulatory  scheme  implies  for Eni's plants subject to emission trading a lower assignment of emission permits compared to the emissions recorded in  the  relevant  year  and,  consequently,  the  necessity  of covering the amounts in excess by purchasing the relevant emission  allowances  on  the  open  market.  In  2020,  the emissions of carbon dioxide from Eni's plants were higher than the free allowances assigned to Eni. Against emissions of carbon dioxide amounting to approximately 17.32 million tonnes, Eni was awarded free emission allowances of 6.84 million tonnes, determining a deficit of 10.48 million tonnes. This deficit was entirely covered through the purchase of emission allowances in the open market.",

The  average  number  of  senior\n\nmanagers included managers employed in foreign countries, whose position is comparable to a senior manager's status.\n\n## LONG-TERM MONETARY INCENTIVE PLAN FOR THE MANAGERS OF ENI\n\nOn April 13, 2017 and on May 13, 2020, the Shareholders Meeting  approved  the  Long-Term  Monetary  Incentive  Plan 2017-2019  and  2020-2022  and  empowered  the  Board  of Directors  to  execute  the  Plan  by  authorizing  it  to  dispose up to a maximum of 11 million of treasury shares in service of the plan 2017-2019 and 20 million in service of the plan 2020-2022.\n\nThe  Long-Term  Monetary  Incentive  plans  provide  for  three annual  awards  (2017,  2018  and  2019  and  2020,  2021  and 2022,  respectively)  and  are  intended  for  the  Chief  Executive Officer of Eni and for the managers of Eni and its subsidiaries who  qualify  as  'senior  managers  deemed  critical  for  the business', selected among those who are in charge of tasks directly linked to the Group results or of strategic clout to the\n\nbusiness. The Plans provide the granting of Eni shares for no consideration to eligible managers after a three-year vesting period  under  the  condition  that  they  would  remain  in  office until vesting. Considering that these incentives fall within the category of employee compensation, in accordance with IFRS, the cost of the plans is determined based on the fair value of the financial instruments awarded to the beneficiaries and the number of shares that are granted at the end of the vesting period; the cost is accruing along the vesting period.\n\nWith reference to the 2017-2019 Plan, the number of shares that  will  be  granted  at  the  end  of  the  vesting  period  will depend:  (i)  for  a  50%,  on  the  market  condition  in  terms  of Total Shareholder Return (TSR) of the Eni share compared to the TSR of the FTSE Mib index of the Italian Stock Exchange\n\n<!-- image -->",

Furthermore, 50% of the shares that will eventually vest is subject to a lockup clause of one year after the vesting date.\n\nThe  number  of  shares  awarded  at  the  grant  date  was:  (i)\n\n2,922,749 shares in 2020, with a weighted average fair value of \u20ac4.67 per share;  (ii) 1,759,273 shares in 2019, with a weighted average fair value of \u20ac9.88 per share; (iii) 1,517,975 shares in 2018, with a weighted average fair value of \u20ac11.73 per share. The estimation of the fair value was calculated by adopting specific valuation techniques regarding the different performance parameters provided by the plan (the stochastic method for  the  market  condition  of  the  plan  and  the  BlackScholes model for the component related to the NPV of the reserves,  for  the  2017-2019  Plan;  the  stochastic  method  for the  2020-2022  Plan),  taking  into  account  the  fair  value  of the Eni share at the grant date (between \u20ac5.885 and \u20ac8.303 depending on the grant date in relation to the 2020 award; \u20ac13.714 per share in 2019; \u20ac14.246 per share in 2018), reduced by dividends expected along the vesting period (between 7.0% and 10.0% of the share price at vesting date in 2020; 6.1% of the share price at vesting date in 2019; 5.8% of the share price at vesting date in 2018), considering the volatility of the stock (between  41%  and  44%  in  relation  to  the  2020  award;  19% for  attribution  2019;  20%  for  attribution  2018),  the  forecasts for the performance parameters, as well as the lower value attributable to the shares considering the lock-up period at the end of the vesting period.\n\nIn 2020, the costs related to the long-term monetary incentive plan, recognized as a component of the payroll cost, amounted to  \u20ac7  million  (\u20ac9  million  in  2019;  \u20ac5  million  in  2018)  with  a contra-entry to equity reserves.",

Furthermore, it will focus its actions on the development of carbon capture and compensation projects. The General Department will incorporate the Company's Oil & Gas exploration, development and production activities, natural gas wholesale via pipeline and LNG. In addition, it will include  forests  conservation  (REDD+)  and  carbon  storage projects. The company Eni Rewind (environmental activities), will also be consolidated in this General Department.\n- \uf0da Energy Evolution will focus on the evolution of the businesses of  power  generation,  transformation  and  marketing  of products from fossil to bio, blue and green. In particular, it will focus on growing power generation from renewable energy and biomethane, it will coordinate the bio and circular evolution of the Company's refining system and chemical business,  and  it  will  further  develop  Eni's  retail  portfolio, providing  increasingly  more  decarbonized  products  for mobility,  household  consumption  and  small  enterprises. The  General  Department  will  incorporate  the  activities  of power  generation  from  natural  gas  and  renewables,  the refining and chemicals businesses, Retail Gas&Power and mobility  Marketing.  The  companies  Versalis  (chemical products) and Eni gas e luce will also be consolidated in this General Department.\n\nIn re-designing the Group's segment information for financial reporting  purposes,  the  management  evaluated  that  the components  of  the  Company  whose  operating  results  are regularly  reviewed  by  the  Chief  Operating  Decision  Maker (CEO)  to  make  decisions  about  the  allocation  of  resources and  to  assess  performances  would  continue  being  the single business units which are comprised in the two newlyestablished General Departments, rather than the two groups\n\nthemselves. Therefore, in order to comply with the provisions of  the  international  reporting  standard  that  regulates  the segment  reporting  (IFRS  8),  the  new  reportable  segments of  Eni,  substantially  confirming  the  pre-existing  setup,  are identified as follows:\n\nExploration & Production: research, development  and production  of  oil,  condensates  and  natural  gas,  forestry conservation (REDD+) and CO 2 capture and storage projects.\n\nGlobal  Gas  &  LNG  Portfolio  (GGP): supply  and  sale  of wholesale  natural  gas  by  pipeline,  international  transport and purchase and marketing of LNG. It includes gas trading activities finalized to hedging and stabilizing the trade margins, as well as optimising the gas asset portfolio.\n\nRefining  &  Marketing  and  Chemicals: supply,  processing, distribution  and  marketing  of  fuels  and  chemicals.  The results  of  the  Chemicals  segment  were  aggregated  with the Refining & Marketing performance in a single reportable segment, because these two operating segments have similar economic returns. It comprises the activities of trading oil and products with the aim to execute the transactions on the market in order to balance the supply and stabilize and cover the commercial margins.\n\nEni gas e luce, Power & Renewables: retail sales of gas, electricity  and  related  services,  production  and  wholesale sales of electricity from thermoelectric and renewable plants. It includes trading activities of CO 2 emission certificates and forward sale of electricity with a view to hedging/optimising the margins of the electricity.\n\nCorporate and Other activities: includes the main business support functions, in particular holding, central treasury, IT, human  resources,  real  estate  services,  captive  insurance activities,  research  and  development,  new  technologies, business digitalization and the environmental activity developed by the subsidiary Eni Rewind.\n\nSegment  information  presented  to  the  CEO  (i.e.  the  Chief\n\nOperating  Decision  Maker,  ex  IFRS  8)  includes:  revenues, operating profit and directly attributable assets and liabilities. According to the requirements of the international accounting  standards  regarding  segment  information  in the  event  of  a  reorganization  of  business  segments,  the segment  information  for  the  2019  and  2018  comparative periods have been restated for homogeneous comparison as follows.\n\n<!-- image -->",

These  amounts  do  not  include  any  allocation  of  interest expenses or general corporate overheads and, therefore, are not necessarily indicative of the contributions to consolidated net earnings of Eni. Related income taxes are calculated by applying  the  local  income  tax  rates  to  the  pre-tax  income from production activities. Eni is party to certain Production\n\nSharing  Agreements  (PSAs),  whereby  a  portion  of  Eni's share of oil and gas production is withheld and sold by its joint venture partners which are state owned entities, with proceeds being remitted to the state to fulfil Eni's PSA related tax liabilities. Revenue and income taxes include such taxes owed  by  Eni  but  paid  by  state-owned  entities  out  of  Eni's share of oil and gas production.

        "page_content": "## PROVED RESERVES OF OIL AND NATURAL GAS\n\nEni's criteria concerning evaluation and classification of proved developed and undeveloped reserves comply with Regulation S-X  4-10  of  the  U.S.  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission and have been disclosed in accordance with FASB Extractive Activities - Oil and Gas (Topic 932).\n\nProved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible, from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and  government  regulations,  prior  to  the  time  at  which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates  that  renewal  is  reasonably  certain,  regardless  of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time. Existing economic conditions include prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined. The  price  shall  be  the  average  price  during  the  12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report,  determined  as  an  un-weighted  arithmetic  average  of the  first-day-of-the-month  price  for  each  month  within  such period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, excluding escalations based upon future conditions.\n\nIn 2020, the average price for the marker Brent crude oil was $41 per barrel.\n\nNet proved reserves exclude interests and royalties owned by others. Proved reserves are classified as either developed or undeveloped. Developed oil and gas reserves are reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well. Undeveloped oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.\n\nEni has its proved reserves audited on a rotational basis by independent  oil  engineering  companies 37 . The  description of  qualifications  of  the  person  primarily  responsible  of  the reserves audit is included in the third-party audit report 38 .\n\nIn the preparation of their reports, independent evaluators rely, without independent verification,  upon  data  furnished  by  Eni with respect to property interest, production, current costs of\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n309\n\noperation and development, sale agreements, prices and other factual information and data that were accepted as represented by the independent evaluators. These data, equally used by Eni in its internal process, include logs, directional surveys, core and PVT (Pressure Volume Temperature) analysis, maps, oil/ gas/water production/injection data of wells, reservoir studies and technical analysis relevant to field performance, long-term development plans, future capital and operating costs. In order to calculate the economic value of Eni equity reserves, actual prices  applicable  to  hydrocarbon  sales,  price  adjustments required by applicable contractual arrangements, and other pertinent information are provided.\n\nIn  2020,  Ryder  Scott  Company,  DeGolyer  and  MacNaughton provided  an  independent  evaluation  of  about  36% 39 of  Eni's total proved reserves as of December 31, 2020 40 ,  confirming, as  in  previous  years,  the  reasonableness  of  Eni's  internal evaluations.\n\nIn the three-year period from 2018 to 2020, 92% of Eni's total proved reserves were subject to independent evaluation. As of December 31, 2020, the principal properties which did not undergo an independent evaluation in the last three years were Balder in Norway and Merakes in Indonesia.\n\nEni operates under production sharing agreements in several of the foreign jurisdictions where it has oil and gas exploration and production activities. Reserves of oil and natural gas to which Eni is entitled under PSA arrangements are shown in accordance with Eni's economic interest in the volumes of oil and natural gas estimated to be recoverable in future years. Such reserves include estimated quantities allocated to Eni for recovery of costs, income taxes owed by Eni but settled by its joint venture partners (which are state-owned entities) out of Eni's share of production and Eni's net equity share after cost recovery. Proved oil and gas reserves associated with PSAs represented 57%, 57% and 61% of total proved reserves as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, on an oil-equivalent basis. Similar effects as PSAs apply to service contracts;  proved  reserves  associated  with  such  contracts represented 4%, 3% and 3% of total proved reserves on an oilequivalent  basis  as  of  December  31,  2020,  2019  and  2018, respectively.\n\nOil and gas reserves quantities include: (i) oil and natural gas quantities  in  excess  of  cost  recovery  which  the  company has  an  obligation  to  purchase  under  certain  PSAs  with governments  or  authorities,  whereby  the  company  serves\n\n(39) The percentage of 36% increases to 37% considering the certification of A-LNG (proven reserves equal to 87 Mboe net to Eni) conducted by Gaffney Cline for the\n\nshareholders of the A-LNG Consortium (Eni 13.6%).\n\n(40) Including reserves of equity-accounted entities.",

Changes in  Eni's  2020  proved  undeveloped  reserves were as follows:\n\n(mmboe)\n\n| Proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2019   | 2,114   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|---------|\n| Transfer to proved developed reserves                 | (206)   |\n| Extensions and discoveries                            | 40      |\n| Revisions of previous estimates                       | 53      |\n| Improved recovery                                     | 4       |\n| Proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2020   | 2,005   |\n\nIn  2020,  total  proved  undeveloped  reserves  decreased  by 109  mmboe,  including  the  effect  of  the  update  of  the  gas conversion rate of +18 mmboe (proved undeveloped reserves of consolidated companies decreased by 114 mmboe, while those of joint ventures and associates increased by 5 mmboe). Main changes derived from:\n\n- (i) proved undeveloped reserves matured to proved developed reserves amounted to 206 mmboe and were driven by progress in development activities, production start-ups and project revisions. The main reclassifications to proved developed reserves related to the fields of Zohr in Egypt (79 mmboe) and Zubair in Iraq (34 mmboe), to the Area 1 project in Mexico (17 mmboe), to the concession Umm Shaif/Nasr in the United Arab Emirates (16 mmboe) and to the Karachaganak field in Kazakhstan (14 mmboe).\n- (ii)  new discoveries and extensions of 40 mmboe, of which 33 mmbbl of oil and 35 BCF of natural gas. The increase in oil reserves was driven by the FIDs made for the Breidablikk project in Norway (30 mmboe) and the Pegasus project in the United States (3 mmboe). The increase of 35 BCF of natural gas was due to the Mahani field in the United Arab Emirates;\n- (iii) revisions  of  previous  estimates  were  positive  for  53 mmboe  (which  also  included  the  update  of  the  gas conversion rate), of which 24 mmbbl of oil and around 56 BCF of natural gas. Positive revisions of 319 mmboe were recorded as result of higher entitlements at the oil fields of Zubair in Iraq (47 mmboe), of Karachaganak in Kazakhstan (37 mmboe) and of Area 1 in Mexico (32 mmboe), as well as of the progress in development activities at the Zohr gas field in Egypt (37 mmboe), at the field Umm Shaif in the United Arab Emirates (27 mmboe) and at the Merakes gas field in Indonesia (44 mmboe). Negative revisions of 266 mmboe were mainly driven by negative price effects relating to Area A and E in Libya (-41 mmboe), Belayim and Abu Rudeis in Egypt (-45 mmboe), and by revisions related to reservoir underperformance at the fields Tuomo West in Nigeria (-33 mmboe), Val d'Agri in Italy (-23 mmboe), Cafc/ Mle in Algeria (-15 mmboe), Grane in Norway (-12 mmboe), Nasr in the United Arab Emirates (-6 mmboe), Front Runner in  the  United  States  (-6  mmboe),  M'boundi  in  Congo  (-5 mmboe), Blacktip in  Australia (-4 mmboe);\n- (iv) improved recoveries of 4 mmboe mainly referred to the Burun field in Turkmenistan.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ndevelopment  expenditures.  The  accuracy  of  any  reserve estimate  is  a  function  of  the  quality  of  available  data  and engineering and geological interpretation and evaluation. The results  of  drilling,  testing  and  production  after  the  date  of the estimate may require substantial upward or downward revisions. In addition, changes in oil and natural gas prices have an effect on the quantities of Eni's proved reserves since estimates of reserves are based on prices and costs relevant to  the  date  when  such  estimates  are  made.  Consequently, the evaluation of reserves could also significantly differ from actual oil and natural gas volumes that will be produced.",

crude  oil  (including condensates  and  natural  gas  liquids)  reported  in  the  tables above for the period 2018, 2019 and 2020 are discussed below.\n\n## CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## Purchase of Minerals in Place\n\nIn  2018,  purchase  of  proved  reserves  (319  mmbbl)  mainly related to the entry in two Concession Agreements of Lower Zakum and Umm Shaif and Nasr in Abu Dhabi.\n\nIn 2019, purchase of proved reserves (29 mmbbl) related to the acquisition of 100% of the Oooguruk production field in Alaska. In 2020, no purchases were made.\n\n## Revisions of Previous Estimates\n\nIn 2018, revisions of previous estimates of 86 mmbbl were mainly due to: (i) positive changes in the projects Meleiha in Egypt, Structure E in Libya and Nikaitchuq in the United States; (ii)  negative  changes  at  Karachaganak  in  Kazakhstan  and Zubair in Iraq.\n\nIn 2019, revisions of previous estimates amounted to 203 mmbbl and  were  mainly  due  to:  (i)  positive  revisions  of  79  mmbbl  in Kazakhstan in relation to the progress in development activities\n\nof the Kashagan and Karachaganak fields; (ii) positive revisions of 37 mmbbl in North Africa primarily in relation to the development of the Berkine Nord project in Algeria and lower contributions from development projects in Libya; (iii) positive revisions of 46 mmbbl in the Sub-Saharan Africa in relation  to  the  progress  in development activities of projects in Nigeria and Angola; and (iv) 45 mmbbl of upward revisions in the rest of Asia were due to the progress of development in the Umm Shaiff and other projects in  United  Arab  Emirates  (25  mmbbl)  and  to  entitlement  effects in  Iraq,  Turkmenistan  and  Timor  Leste.  Upward  revisions  also include 6 mmbbl in Italy and Rest of Europe and 4 mmbbl in the United States. Downward revisions (total 24 mmbbl) are related to Mexico Area 1 (20 mmbbl) due to the removal of uneconomic volumes and for 4 mmbbl in Australia.\n\nIn  2020,  revisions  of  previous  estimates  amounted  to  an increase  of  184  mmbbl.  Positive  revisions  of  100  mmbbl reported in Kazakhstan were driven by higher entitlements and progress in development activities. In the rest of Asia, positive revisions of 114 mmbbl were due to higher entitlements in Iraq (74 mmbbl) and progress at a few projects, among which the most important was the Umm Shaif/Nasr concession in the United Arab Emirates (37 mmbbl). In the Sub-Saharan Africa positive revisions of 10 mmbbl were due to higher entitlements",

        "page_content": "in Nigeria (14 mmbbl), Angola (8 mmbbl) and Ghana (3 mmbbl), partly offset by negative revisions due to the debooking of the Loango and Zatchi fields reserves in Congo (-18 mmbbl). In America, positive revisions of 16 mmbbl were due to higher entitlements  in  Mexico  (25  mmbbl),  partially  offset  by  the removal  of  non-economic  reserves  at  various  fields  in  the United  States  (-9  mmbbl).  In  Egypt,  negative  revisions  of  14 mmbbl were mainly due to the Abu Rudeis project. In North Africa  negative  revisions  of  44  mmbl  were  driven  by  price effects  and  capital  expenditures  curtailments  in  Libya  (-30 mmbbl) and Algeria (-17 mmbbl).\n\n## Improved Recovery\n\nIn 2018, improved recoveries of 13 mmbbl mainly related to Egypt and Iraq.\n\nIn 2019, no improved recoveries were reported.\n\nIn 2020, improved recoveries of 5 mmbbl related to the Burun project in Turkmenistan.\n\n## Extensions and Discoveries\n\nIn 2018, new discoveries and extensions of 100 mmbbl mainly related to the sanctioning of the final investment decision for the Area 1 project in Mexico (85 mmbbl).\n\nIn  2019,  new  discoveries  and  extensions  of  34  mmbbl  were driven for 21 mmbbl by the final investment decisions relating to the Assa North field in Nigeria and the Agogo field in the operated Block 15/06 offshore Angola. The remaining extensions and discoveries  related  to  certain  fields  in  the  United  States  (9 mmbbl  in  total,  relating  to  Nikaitchuq  and  Pegasus-2  fields) and 4 mmbbl in North Africa and Middle East Region driven by incremental near-field discoveries.\n\nIn 2020, new discoveries and extensions added 5 mmbbl related to the Pegasus and Front Runner fields in the United States and the Mahani field in the United Arab Emirates 78 BCF related to the  final  investment  decision  relating  the  Assa  North  field  in Nigeria and 6 BCF in the United States and United Kingdom.\n\n## Sales of Minerals in Place\n\nIn  2018,  the  sale  of  279  mmbbl  related  to  the  business combination between Eni Norge AS and Point Resources AS. The merger agreement provided for the sale of the reserves of the former subsidiary Eni Norge as part of the business combination with Point Resources and the acquisition by Eni of the interest in the reserves held by the joint venture V\u00e5r Energi, in which Eni owns a 70% stake.

In the Rest of Europe negative revisions for 11 mmbbl were reported mainly at the Ringhorne East and Ekofisk fields in Norway driven by price effects. These were partially offset by positive revisions reported in the Sub-Saharan Africa up  by  9  mmbbl  driven  by  an  improved  performance  at  the Angola LNG project.\n\n## Extensions and Discoveries\n\nIn 2018, there were no extensions or new discoveries.\n\nIn 2019, extensions and new discoveries of 6 mmbbl related to the development of the Trestakk field in Norway.\n\nIn 2020, extensions and new discoveries of 30 mmbbl were reported  as  a  result  of  the  final  investment  decision  for  the Bredaiblikk project in Norway.\n\n## Sales of Minerals in Place\n\nIn 2018, no sales were made.

Estimated future development and  production  costs  are  determined  by  estimating  the expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves at the end of the year.  Neither the effects of price and cost escalations nor expected future changes in technology and operating practices have been considered.\n\nThe  standardized  measure  is  calculated  as  the  excess  of future cash inflows from proved reserves less future costs of producing and developing the reserves, future income taxes and a yearly 10% discount factor.\n\nFuture production costs include the estimated expenditures related  to  the  production  of  proved  reserves  plus  any production  taxes  without  consideration  of  future  inflation.\n\nFuture  development  costs  include  the  estimated  costs  of drilling  development  wells  and  installation  of  production facilities, plus the net costs associated with dismantlement and abandonment of wells and facilities, under the assumption that  year-end  costs  continue  without  considering  future inflation. Future income taxes were calculated in accordance with the tax laws of the countries in which Eni operates.\n\nThe standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows,\n\nrelated to the preceding proved oil and gas reserves, is calculated in accordance with the requirements of FASB Extractive Activities - Oil and Gas (Topic 932). The standardized measure does not purport to reflect realizable values or fair market value of Eni's proved reserves. An estimate of fair value would also take into account, among other things, hydrocarbon resources other than proved reserves, anticipated changes in future prices and costs and a discount factor representative of the risks inherent in the oil and gas exploration and production activity.\n\nThe standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows by geographical area consists of the following:\n\n| (\u20ac million)                                                     | Italy   | Rest   of Europe   | North   Africa   | Egypt   | Sub - Saharan  Africa   | Kazakhstan   | Rest   of

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs part of our audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia), we exercised professional judgement and maintained professional scepticism throughout the audit. Furthermore:\n\n- \uf0b7 We identified and assessed the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error; we designed and performed audit procedures responsive to those risks; we obtained audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- \uf0b7 We obtained an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control;\n- \uf0b7 We evaluated the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the directors;\n- \uf0b7 We concluded on the appropriateness of the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;\n- \uf0b7 We evaluated the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- \uf0b7 We obtained sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements.\n\nWe communicated with those charged with governance, identified at an appropriate level as required by ISA Italia regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identified during our audit.\n\n<!-- image -->",

December 22, 1986, No. 917. Following the aforementioned amendments and the amendments to Art. 167 of the D.P.R. December 22, 1986, No. 917, the provisions regarding foreign subsidiaries, CFC, are applied if the non-resident controlled entities jointly present the following conditions: (a) they are subject to an effective taxation of less than half to which\n\nthey would have been subject if they were resident in Italy; (b) more than one third of the proceeds fall into one or more of  the  following  categories:  interests,  royalties,  dividends, financial leasing income, income from insurance and banking activities, income from intra-group services with low or zero added economic value.\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2020,  Eni  controls  5  companies  that benefit from a privileged tax regime. Of these 5 companies, 4 are subject to taxation in Italy because they are included in  Eni's  tax  return,  1  company  is  not  subject  to  taxation  in Italy for the exemption obtained by the Revenue Agency. No subsidiary  that  benefits  from  a  privileged  tax  regime  has issued financial instruments. All the financial statements for 2020 are audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers.",
