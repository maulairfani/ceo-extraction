Notwithstanding the pandemic, we posted record Distributable Earnings, transaction volumes, and carbon mitigation impact. At the same time, we grew as an organization, in part, by recognizing how the needs of the community intersect with investing in climate solutions.\n\n2020 was also a year of tragedy, as the pandemic took its unspeakable toll on the health and livelihoods of millions while several incidents highlighted the urgent need for social justice. However, it was also the year when climate change went mainstream.\n\nIn last year's letter, which was published before the outbreak of COVID-19, I focused on questions owners of capital must ask themselves if we are to seriously address the climate crisis - particularly, how efficiently capital is being deployed to reduce carbon. I believe those questions, paired with my 2018 letter advocating for a carbon fee and dividend plan, form a powerful combination of ideas to accelerate the adoption of climate solutions.\n\nFor the last fifty years, many companies have closely adhered to the Friedman Doctrine, named after the Nobel Prize-winning economist, who argued that a company's sole purpose is to generate profits for shareholders. But for today's workforce and an increasing number of investors, this doctrine is not only unambitious and unattractive, it is wholly inadequate. With a mission of investing exclusively in climate solutions since we became a public company, Hannon Armstrong embodies a broader ethos - one that recognizes our role as a responsible corporate citizen while continuing to produce outstanding financial results. Undoubtedly, 2020 also broadened our ambition to find ways to incorporate social justice into our business.\n\nAs a pioneer in climate solutions investing, we are proud of the Environmental, Social and Governance ('ESG') reputation we have built. Yet 2020 has shown we can and must do more to expand our leadership role in both our local community and nationwide. As part\n\nof our response to the pandemic, we focused on the health and well-being of our team and also made significant corporate donations to local organizations addressing critical issues of homelessness, hunger and domestic violence. As the year progressed, team discussions focused on how we can do more. As a result of these efforts, we created the Hannon Armstrong Foundation to identify the intersection of climate change and social justice and determine how best to engage with our community. This flowed from an organic expression of shared values that fits naturally within our culture of fierce curiosity and rigor about outcomes in climate investing. We have declared an initial 'Social Dividend' to the Foundation of $1 million. I look forward to reporting on the Foundation's activities in next year's letter.\n\nThe social aspect of ESG has also come front and center in our recruitment, hiring and training efforts. While change takes time, we have used 2020 to develop a human capital management strategy designed to improve data collection, establish reporting metrics, and enhance transparency related to the material aspects of our human capital activities. As a result of these efforts, we expect to benefit from material and ongoing changes in the diversity of our staff. You will also notice enhanced disclosures on human capital in our 2020 Form 10-K. Over time, our goal is to continually provide you the data to hold us accountable for progress on this front.\n\nWith the Biden administration, we have continued our political engagement to build support for the enactment of economywide carbon pricing, ideally in the form of a fee and dividend. We believe the dividend should be structured to eliminate the cost impacts on lower-income families and to advance environmental justice. This",

In 2020, we did all three. We closed on a record $1.9 billion in transactions, up from $1.3 billion in 2019, preserved our asset yield despite falling market rates, and significantly reduced our cost of capital. That timeless formula produced record earnings of $1.55 per share which exceeded our previous threeyear guidance.\n\n- \u00b7  Much of the increase in transactions was accounted for by two large programmatic partnerships. These large portfolio transactions were preceded by much smaller transactions with these clients, which demonstrated to these firms how our focus on solving client problems was accretive to their businesses. We also continued to enjoy success in the smaller niches in our three core markets: Behind-the-Meter, Grid-Connected, and Sustainable Infrastructure.\n- \u00b7  At year-end 2020, our unlevered portfolio yield held steady at 7.6%, despite the 10year U.S. Treasury falling to almost 0.90%. With a long-duration portfolio substantially comprised of non-prepayable, strong credit profile investments, we have locked in stable and recurring income for more than a decade.\n- \u00b7  We significantly lowered both our cost of debt and equity capital. The coupon rate on our corporate green bonds has dropped from 5.25% in 2019 to 3.75% in 2020. Similarly, our share price and forward-looking dividend yield indicate a cost of equity that has never been lower. As a result, we have been able to improve our Distributable ROE to 10.7%, marking the fifth straight year it has exceeded 10%.\n\nWe are well-positioned for 2021. We believe we will realize the full year benefit of funding the balance of our 2020 transactions plus additional investments that are funded in 2021. The impact is expected to be reflected in higher Net Investment Income and ultimately higher Distributable Earnings. As such, we have issued new guidance for the 2021 to 2023 period of 7% to 10% compound annual growth in Distributable Earnings, higher than the 7% compound annual growth we achieved in the prior three-year period. This signals the accelerated growth we expect in this robust climate solutions market as our client base of the world's leading energy and infrastructure companies continue their expansion. In fact, our clients' ambition is the principal driver for the growth in our 12-month pipeline to more than $3 billion of investment opportunities.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nOur investment thesis is simple: in a world increasingly defined by climate change, we will earn superior risk-adjusted returns making only climate positive investments. We have significantly outperformed virtually all broader market and peer group indices in the last year, the last five years, and indeed\n\n|\n\nsince our public debut in 2013. Last year, we achieved not only record financial results, but also the highest carbon reductions since our IPO. Our 2020 investments will reduce five times more carbon than our investments in 2019, and with a CarbonCount\u00ae of 1.03, 2020 has turned out to be the most efficient use of capital to reduce carbon in our history as a public company.\n\nWhile I thank you for investing in Hannon Armstrong, we all should thank the professionals at Hannon Armstrong, including our Board of Directors, who executed in 2020 under the most difficult circumstances and yet had enough passion to help this company grow in its awareness of how it can contribute to social justice in addition to positively affecting climate change. I am inspired and honored to work alongside this team every day, but never more than in 2020.\n\nRespectfully,\n\nJeffrey W. Eckel Chairman & CEO March 2021\n\n<!-- image -->",

For these statements, we claim the protections of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in such Sections. These forward-looking statements include information about possible or assumed future results of our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, plans and objectives. When we use the words 'believe,' 'expect,' 'anticipate,' 'estimate,' 'plan,' 'continue,' 'intend,' 'should,' 'may' or similar expressions, we intend to identify forward-looking statements.\n\nForward-looking statements are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Investors are cautioned against placing undue reliance on such statements. Actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other important factors that we think could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected results are summarized below, including the ongoing impact of the current outbreak of the novel coronavirus ('COVID-19'), on the U.S., regional and global economies, the U.S. sustainable infrastructure market and the broader financial markets. The current outbreak of COVID-19 has also impacted, and is likely to continue to impact, directly or indirectly, many of the other important factors below and the risks described in this Form 10-K and in our subsequent filings under the Exchange Act. Other factors besides those listed could also adversely affect us. In addition, we cannot assess the impact of each factor on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. In particular, it is difficult to fully assess the impact of COVID-19 at this time due to, among other factors, uncertainty regarding the severity and duration of the outbreak domestically and internationally, uncertainty regarding the effectiveness of federal, state and local governments' efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19 and respond to its direct and indirect impact on the U.S. economy and economic activity, including the timing of the successful distribution of an effective vaccine.\n\nStatements regarding the following subjects, among others, may be forward-looking:\n\n- z negative impacts from a continued spread of COVID-19, including on the U.S. or global economy or on our business, financial position, or results of operations;\n- z our expected returns and performance of our investments;\n- z the state of government legislation, regulation and policies that support or enhance the economic feasibility of projects that reduce carbon emissions or increase resilience to climate change, which we refer to as climate solutions, including energy efficiency and renewable energy projects and the general market demands for such projects;\n- z market trends in our industry, energy markets, commodity prices, interest rates, the debt and lending markets or the general economy;\n- z our business and investment strategy;\n- z availability of opportunities to invest in climate solutions including energy efficiency and renewable energy projects and our ability to complete potential new opportunities in our pipeline;\n- z our relationships with originators, investors, market intermediaries and professional advisers;\n- z competition from other providers of capital;\n- z our or any other company's projected operating results;\n- z actions and initiatives of the federal, state and local governments and changes to federal, state and local government policies, regulations, tax laws and rates and the execution and impact of these actions, initiatives and policies;\n- z the state of the U.S. economy generally or in specific geographic regions, states or municipalities and economic trends;\n- z our ability to obtain and maintain financing arrangements on favorable terms, including securitizations;\n- z general volatility of the securities markets in which we participate;\n- z the credit quality of our assets;\n- z changes in the value of our assets, our portfolio of assets and our investment and underwriting process;\n- z the impact of weather conditions, natural disasters, accidents or equipment failures or other events that disrupt the operation of our investments or negatively impact the value of our assets;\n- z rates of default or decreased recovery rates on our assets;\n- z interest rate and maturity mismatches between our assets and any borrowings used to fund such assets;\n- z changes in interest rates and the market value of our assets and target assets;\n- z changes in commodity prices, including continued low natural gas prices;\n- z effects of hedging instruments on our assets or liabilities;\n- z the degree to which our hedging strategies may or may not protect us from risks, such as interest rate volatility;\n- z impact of and changes in accounting guidance;\n- z our ability to maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust ('REIT') for U.S. federal income tax purposes;\n- z our ability to maintain our exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the '1940/uni00A0Act');\n- z availability of and our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel;\n- z estimates relating to our ability to generate sufficient cash in the future to operate our business and to make distributions to our stockholders; and\n- z our understanding of our competition.\n\nForward-looking statements are based on beliefs, assumptions and expectations as of the date of this Form/uni00A010-K. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made. New risks and uncertainties arise over time, and it is not possible for us to predict those events or how they may affect us. Except as required by law, we are not obligated to, and do not intend to, update or revise any forward-looking statements after the date of this Form 10-K, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\n\nThe risks included here are not exhaustive. Other sections of this Form 10-K may include additional factors that could adversely affect our business and financial performance. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors, nor can it assess the impact of all such risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results.\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## RISK FACTOR SUMMARY\n\nAn investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks summarized in Item 1A, 'Risk Factors' included in this report. These risks include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n## Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry\n\n- z Our business depends in part on U.S. federal, state and local government policies and a decline in the level of government support could harm our business.\n- z A change in the fiscal health, level of appropriations or budgets of U.S. federal, state and local governments could reduce demand for the projects in which we invest and the capital we provide.\n- z If the cost of energy generated by traditional sources of energy declines or continues to remain low, demand for the projects in which we invest may decline.\n- z We operate in a competitive market and future competition may impact the terms of the investments we make.\n\n## Risks Related to Our Assets and Projects in Which We Invest\n\n- z The lack of liquidity of our assets may adversely affect our business, including our ability to value and sell our assets.\n- z Our investments are subject to delinquency, foreclosure and loss, any or all of which could result in losses to us.\n- z Our mezzanine or subordinated loans are riskier, less protected against loss than, and generally less liquid than other forms of senior debt.\n- z Our equity investments, many of which are illiquid with no readily available market, involve a substantial degree of risk.\n- z We generally do not control the projects in which we invest, which may result in the project owner making certain business decisions or taking risks with which we disagree.\n- z Portions of the electricity our assets generate is sold on the open market at spot-market prices. A prolonged environment of low prices for natural gas, or other conventional fuel sources such as we are experiencing may, and could continue to, have a material adverse effect on our long-term business prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\n- z Some of the projects in which we invest  may require substantial operating or capital expenditures in the future.\n- z We invest in projects which rely on third parties to manufacture quality products or provide reliable services in a timely manner and the failure of these third parties could cause project performance to be adversely affected.\n\n- z Our insurance and contractual protections may not always cover lost revenue, increased expenses or liquidated damages payments.\n- z Energy efficiency, renewable energy and other sustainable infrastructure projects are subject to performance risks, including risks due to extreme weather events, that could impact the repayment of and the return on our assets.\n\n## Risks Related to Our Company\n\n- z We may change our operational policies (including our investment guidelines, strategies and policies) with the approval of our board of directors but without stockholder consent at any time, which may adversely affect the market value of our common stock and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.\n- z An increase in our borrowing costs relative to the interest we receive on our leveraged assets may adversely affect our profitability and our cash available for distribution to our stockholders. Our borrowings may have a shorter duration than our assets.\n- z We do not have a formal policy limiting the amount of debt we may incur. Our board of directors may change our financial leverage guidelines without stockholder consent.\n\n## Risks Related to Our Common Stock\n\n- z We cannot assure you of our ability to make distributions in the future. Although we currently do not intend to do so, if our portfolio of assets does not generate sufficient income and cash flow, we could be required to sell assets, borrow funds or make a portion of our distributions in the form of a taxable stock distribution or distribution of debt securities in order to maintain our qualification as a REIT.\n\n## Risks Related to Our Organization and Structure\n\n- z Our qualification as a REIT depends on interpretations of highly technical and complex legal provisions, and our failure to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT would subject us to taxes that would negatively impact the results of our operations and reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders.\n\n## Risks Related to Our Taxation as a REIT\n\n- z Complying with REIT requirements may force us to liquidate assets or forego otherwise attractive investments.\n\n## Risks Related to COVID-19\n\n- z The current outbreak and spread of the COVID-19 outbreak has disrupted, and is likely to further cause severe disruptions in, the U.S. and global economies and financial markets and create widespread business continuity and viability issues.\n\n|",

Hannon Armstrong Sustainable Infrastructure, L.P. is a Delaware limited partnership of\n\nwhich we are the sole general partner and to which we refer in this Form 10-K as our 'Operating Partnership.' Our business is focused on reducing the impact of greenhouse gases that have been scientifically linked to climate change./uni00A0We refer to these gases, which are often for consistency expressed as carbon dioxide equivalents, as carbon emissions.\n\n## ITEM 1. BUSINESS\n\n## General\n\nWe invest in climate solutions developed by the leading companies in the energy efficiency, renewable energy and other sustainable infrastructure markets. We believe that we are one of the first U.S. public companies solely dedicated to climate solution investments. Our goal is to generate attractive returns from a diversified portfolio of projects with long-term, predictable cash flows from proven technologies that reduce carbon emissions or increase resilience to climate change.\n\nWe are internally managed, and our management team has extensive relevant industry knowledge and experience. We have long-standing relationships with the leading energy service companies ('ESCOs'), manufacturers, project developers, utilities, owners and operators. Our origination strategy is to use these relationships to generate recurring, programmatic investment and fee-generating opportunities. Additionally, we have relationships with leading commercial and investment banks and institutional investors from which we are referred additional investment and fee-generating opportunities.\n\nWe completed approximately $1.9 billion of transactions during 2020, compared to approximately $1.3/uni00A0billion during 2019. As of December/uni00A031, 2020, we held approximately $2.9 billion of transactions on our balance sheet, which we refer to as our 'Portfolio.' For those transactions that we choose not to hold on our balance sheet, we transfer all or a portion of the economics of the transaction, typically using securitization trusts, to institutional investors in exchange for cash and, in certain cases, residual interests in the trusts and ongoing fees. As of December/uni00A031, 2020, we managed approximately $4.3 billion in these trusts or vehicles that are not consolidated on our balance sheet. When combined with our Portfolio, as of December/uni00A031, 2020, we manage approximately $7.2 billion of assets, which we refer to as our 'Managed Assets.'\n\nOur investments take many forms, including equity, joint ventures, land ownership, loans, and other financing transactions. We also generate ongoing fees via off-balance sheet securitization transactions, services, and asset management. We use borrowings as part of our strategy to increase potential returns to our stockholders and have available a broad range of financing sources including non-recourse or recourse debt, equity, and off-balance sheet securitization structures. A further description of our financing activities can be found herein.\n\nWe have a large and active pipeline of potential new opportunities that are in various stages of our underwriting process. We refer to potential\n\nopportunities as being part of our pipeline if we have determined that the project fits within our investment strategy and exhibits the appropriate risk and reward characteristics through an initial credit analysis, including a quantitative and qualitative assessment of the opportunity, as well as research on the relevant market and sponsor. Our pipeline of transactions that could potentially close in the next 12/uni00A0months consists of opportunities in which we will be the lead originator as well as opportunities in which we may participate with other institutional investors. As of December/uni00A031, 2020, our pipeline consisted of more than $3.0/uni00A0billion in new equity, debt and real estate opportunities. However, there can be no assurance with regard to any specific terms of such pipeline transactions or that any or all of the transactions in our pipeline will be completed.\n\nWe are committed to leadership in transparent disclosure on environmental, social, and governance ('ESG') matters. Beginning in 2013, we became one of the first capital providers to evaluate the carbon efficiency of our investment portfolio by utilizing CarbonCount \u00a9 , a proprietary tool which measures the efficiency with which our investments reduce carbon emissions. In 2017, we believe we were the first U.S-based public company to commit to the Climate Disclosure Standards Board led initiative on implementing the recommendations of the Financial Stability Board's Task Force for Climate-related Financial Disclosures ('TCFD') and have since endeavored to provide the recommended disclosures in our Form 10-K. In 2020, we joined the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials ('PCAF'), a global financial industry-led partnership to implement a consistent and transparent disclosure framework to report carbon emissions resulting from financed assets. We anticipate that our reporting in accordance with PCAF will be implemented by 2023. For further information on our ESG disclosures, see the discussion in the sections titled 'Investment Strategy' and 'Environmental and Social Responsibility and Corporate Governance' herein. In addition, we are committed to providing transparent disclosures on our human capital management and have enhanced the discussion herein in the section titled 'Human Capital and Social Strategy.'\n\nWe elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, commencing with our taxable year ended December/uni00A031, 2013 and operate our business in a manner that permits us to maintain our exemption from registration as an investment company under the 1940 Act.\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## Investment strategy\n\nWith scientific consensus that global-warming trends are linked to human activities and resulting in various extreme weather events, we believe our firm is well-positioned to generate attractive riskadjusted returns by investing in, and managing a portfolio of, assets that address climate-changing greenhouse gas emissions. Further, with increasing weather-related events, we see similar investment opportunities in infrastructure assets that mitigate the impact of, and increase the resiliency to, these weather events and other adverse impacts of climate change.\n\nOur vision is that every investment improves our climate future and thus the carbon impact of an investment is at the core of our business model. We believe that climate positive investments will produce attractive risk adjusted returns and require investments to be neutral to negative on incremental carbon emissions or have some other tangible environmental benefit such as reducing water consumption.\n\nOur climate-positive investment thesis is based on the following theories:\n\n- z More efficient technologies are more productive and thus should lead to higher economic returns;\n- z Lower portfolio risk is inherent in a portfolio of smaller investments, generated by trends of increasing decentralization and digitalization of energy assets, compared to larger, centralized utility-scale investments;\n- z Investing in assets aligned with scientific consensus and broadly held societal values will reduce potential regulatory and social costs through better internalization of externalities; and\n- z Assets that reduce carbon emissions may represent an embedded option that may increase in value if regulatory authorities were to set a price on carbon emissions.\n\nWe believe combining this investment thesis with our multi-decade experience in investing in our markets through multiple interest rate and business cycles, intermittent governmental support for reducing carbon emissions and several cycles of business expansions in renewable and other sustainable infrastructure markets, allows us to earn attractive riskadjusted returns on the assets in which we invest. We also believe there is a very large potential market opportunity as the legacy technologies for generating and using energy and the systems that produce carbon emissions are converted to low-to-no carbon emission systems while mitigation and resiliency investments continue to grow to address severe weather events and other climate change impacts.\n\nOur investments are focused on three areas:\n\n- z Behind-the-Meter ('BTM'): distributed building or facility projects, which reduce energy usage or cost through the use of solar generation and energy storage or energy efficiency improvements including heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems ('HVAC'), lighting, energy controls, roofs, windows, building shells, and/or combined heat and power systems;\n- z Grid-Connected ('GC'): projects that deploy cleaner energy sources, such as solar and wind to generate power where the off-taker or counterparty is part of the wholesale electric power grid; and\n- z Sustainable Infrastructure: upgraded transmission and distribution systems, water and storm water infrastructure, and other projects that improve water or energy efficiency, increase resiliency, positively impact the environment or more efficiently use natural resources.\n\nOf our pipeline,/uni00A058%/uni00A0is related to BTM assets and/uni00A033%/uni00A0is related to GC assets, with the remainder related to other sustainable infrastructure. We prefer investments in which the assets have a long-term, investmentgrade rated off-taker or counterparties. For BTM assets, the off-taker or counterparty may be the building owner or occupant, and we may be secured by the installed improvements or other real estate rights. For GC assets, the off-taker or counterparty may be a utility or electric user who has entered into a contractual commitment, such as a power purchase agreement ('PPA'), to purchase power produced by a renewable energy project at a minimum price with potential price escalators for a portion of the project's estimated life.\n\nWe make our investments utilizing a variety of structures, including:\n\n- z Equity investments in either preferred or common structures in unconsolidated entities;\n- z Government and commercial receivables or securities, such as loans for renewable energy and energy efficiency projects; and\n- z Real estate, such as land or other assets leased for use by GC projects typically under long term leases.\n\nOur equity investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency projects are operated by various renewable energy companies or by joint ventures in which we participate. These transactions allow us to participate in the cash flows associated with these projects, typically on a priority basis. Our energy efficiency debt investments are usually assigned the payment stream from the project savings and other contractual rights, often using our pre-existing master purchase agreements with the ESCOs. Our debt investments in various renewable energy or other sustainable infrastructure projects or portfolios of projects are generally secured by the installed improvements or other real estate rights. We also own, directly or through equity investments, or manage over 39,000 acres of land that are leased under long-term agreements to over 60 renewable energy projects, where our investment returns are typically senior to most project costs, debt, and equity.\n\nWe focus on projects that use proven technology and that often have contractually committed agreements with an investment grade rated off-taker or counterparties. We often make investments where we hold preferred or mezzanine position in a project where we are subordinated to project debt and/or preferred forms of equity. Investing greater than 15% of our assets in any individual project requires the approval of a majority of our independent directors. We may adjust the mix and duration of our assets over time in order to allow us to manage various aspects of our portfolio, including expected riskadjusted returns, macroeconomic conditions, liquidity, availability of adequate financing for our assets, and the maintenance of our REIT qualification and our exemption from registration as an investment company under the 1940 Act.\n\nAs of December/uni00A031, 2020, our Portfolio consisted of over 230 investments and we seek to manage the diversity of our Portfolio by, among other factors, project type, project operator, type of investment, type of technology, transaction size, geography, obligor and maturity. The mix of our Portfolio is expected to vary over time and approximately 48% of our Portfolio was invested in BTM assets and approximately 52% was invested in GC assets, which includes our land holdings.\n\nAs part of our investment process, we calculate the ratio of the estimated first year of metric tons of carbon emissions avoided by our investments\n\n|",

In this calculation, which we refer to as CarbonCount \u00ae , we use emissions factor data, expressed on a CO 2 equivalent basis, from the U.S. Government or the International Energy Administration to an estimate of a project's energy production or savings to compute an estimate of metric tons of carbon emissions avoided. We estimate that our investments originated in 2020 will reduce annual carbon emissions by approximately 2.0 million metric tons, equating to a CarbonCount \u00ae of 1.03. In addition to carbon, we also consider other environmental attributes, such as water use reduction, stormwater remediation benefits and stream restoration benefits.\n\n## Financing strategy\n\nWe believe we have available a broad range of financing sources as part of our strategy that are designed to increase potential returns to our stockholders. We may finance our investments through the use of non-recourse debt, recourse debt, or equity and may also decide to finance such transactions through the use of off-balance sheet securitization structures. We often provide, and our sources of financing are increasingly interested in, the estimated carbon emission savings or environmental ratings associated with our financings. We believe that certain debt that we have issued meets the environmental eligibility criteria for green bonds as defined by the International Capital Markets Association's Green Bond Principles, which we believe makes our debt more attractive for many investors compared to such offerings which do not qualify under these principles.\n\nWe plan to raise additional equity capital and continue to use other fixed and floating rate borrowings which may be in the form of additional bank credit facilities, including term loans and revolving facilities, warehouse facilities, repurchase agreements and public and private equity and debt issuances. We may also consider the use of separately financed special purpose entities or funds to allow us to expand our investments or manage Portfolio diversity.\n\nThe decision on how we finance specific assets or groups of assets is largely driven by risk and portfolio management considerations, as well as the overall interest rate environment, prevailing credit spreads and the terms of available financing and market conditions. Over time, as market conditions change, we may use other forms of leverage in addition to these financing arrangements. Although we are not restricted by any regulatory requirements as to the type or amount of financial leverage we may utilize, we do seek to, but are not required to, operate within certain metrics, including maintaining a\n\n## Human capital and social strategy\n\nOur culture is focused on hiring and retaining highly talented employees with diverse backgrounds and empowering them to create value for our stockholders, and our success is dependent on employee understanding of and investment in their role in that value creation. Our chief executive officer periodically leads employee meetings intended to reinforce the importance of sustainability and regularly meets with small groups of employees to receive their feedback on our business. Our employees are responsible for upholding our purpose, values, strategy, and talent leadership expectations.\n\nIt is important to us that our employees are engaged in our mission of sustainability. We also want them to be engaged to drive our business forward, to recruit from their networks, and envision a long tenure with us. We meet no less than quarterly as a Company to\n\nWe believe that our long history of sustainable infrastructure investing, the experience, expertise and relationships of our management team, the anticipated credit strength of the obligors or investees involved in our investments and the size and growth potential of our market, position us well to capitalize on our strategy.\n\nRefer to Item 7.

In addition, our board of directors has established a current target range for our percentage of fixed rate debt to total debt of between 75% and 100%. See additional discussion in Item/uni00A07. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources regarding our ongoing evaluation of our leverage limits and fixed-rate debt targets.\n\nFor those transactions that we choose not to hold on our balance sheet, we transfer all or a portion of the economics of the transaction, typically using securitization trusts, to institutional investors in exchange for cash and in certain cases, residual assets and ongoing fees. The market for the assets we finance has remained active throughout various market cycles due to investor demand for high credit quality, long-term investments. We may arrange such securitizations of loans or other assets prior to originating the transaction and thus avoid exposure to credit spread, interest rate and funding risks. We also typically manage and service these assets in exchange for fees. We may also use other funds or structures where institutional investors purchase all or a portion of the economics of the transaction and where we may receive upfront or ongoing fees for managing the assets. We periodically provide other services, including arranging financings that are held on the balance sheet of other investors and advising various companies with respect to structuring investments.\n\nRefer to Item/uni00A07.

We care about our employees' employment experience and care about them as individuals who are motivated in different ways.\n\nWe adhere to a blended learning approach with the understanding that our people learn from experiences (on the job and in life), from other people (mentors or supportive managers), and formal learning and training programs.

We believe that fostering an internal climate that is supportive and allows people of all backgrounds to flourish lends itself to the highest levels of company performance and facilitates the attraction and retention of best-in-class talent. We also believe it is inherently the right way to conduct business. We support an innovative, creative culture where people can bring their best and most authentic selves to work. Employees who hold divergent opinions are encouraged to voice their views. We track and report internally on key talent metrics including workforce demographics, critical role pipeline data, diversity data, and engagement and inclusion indices.\n\nDecisions regarding staffing, selection, and promotions are made on the basis of individual qualifications related to the requirements of the position. We are committed to identifying and developing the talents of our next generation of leaders. We endeavor to select qualified individuals from a diverse pool of candidates derived from broad outreach efforts when we are recruiting. We are committed to the sourcing and/or promotion of highly-qualified women, people of color and other under-represented groups for management and Board positions. We are also challenging ourselves to better support our female and underrepresented employees in their onboarding, training, development and progression within the Company.\n\nOur policy is 'equal pay for equal work' in compliance with applicable state law. Compensation for our employees is based upon experience, seniority, educational-attainment, and individual contribution and company performance against goals.\n\nRefer to Item 7.

Under the direction of our chief executive officer and the board of directors, we are focused on achieving a high level of environmental and social responsibility and strong corporate governance. The Nominating, Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee of our board of directors is responsible for our ESG oversight, including related policies and communications. Additionally, we have a committee comprised of employees from across our organization that is focused on implementing ESG strategies and policies and reports directly to our chief executive officer. Annually we publish a report that illustrates our progress on these matters.\n\nOur business and business strategy are focused on addressing climate change, in part through the reduction of carbon emissions that have been scientifically linked to climate change. As described in the previous Investment Strategy section , we quantify the carbon impact of each of our investments. In addition, we operate our business in a manner intended to reduce our own environmental impact, including by purchasing carbon credits for 100% of the electricity used by our office, encouraging recycling and composting, and offering clean transportation employee incentives for electric and hybrid vehicles. We have also adopted policies focused on minimizing the environmental impact of our operations.\n\nWe are a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact, an initiative focused on responsible business practices related to human",

RISK FACTORS\n\nOur business and operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, the occurrence of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, consolidated results of operations and ability to make distributions to stockholders and could cause the value of our capital stock to decline. We may refer to the energy efficiency, renewable energy and the other sustainable infrastructure projects or market collectively as sustainable infrastructure projects or the industry. Please also refer to the sections entitled 'Forward-Looking Statements' and 'Risk Factor Summary'.\n\n## Risks related to our business and our industry\n\n## Our business depends in part on U.S. federal, state and local government policies and a decline in the level of government support could harm our business.\n\nThe projects in which we invest typically depend in part on various U.S. federal, state or local governmental policies and incentives that support or enhance project economic feasibility. Such policies may include governmental initiatives, laws and regulations designed to reduce energy usage and impact the use of renewable energy or the investment in and the use of sustainable infrastructure.\n\nPolicies and incentives provided by the U.S. federal government may include tax credits (with some of these tax credits that are related to renewable energy being recently reduced and scheduled to be eliminated or phased out in the future), tax deductions, bonus depreciation, federal grants and loan guarantees and energy market regulations. The value of tax credits, deductions and incentives may be impacted by changes in tax laws, rates or regulations.\n\nIncentives provided by state and local governments may include renewable portfolio standards ('RPS'), which specify the portion of the power utilized by local utilities that must be derived from renewable energy sources such as renewable energy as well as the state or local government sponsored programs where the financing of energy efficiency or renewable energy projects is repaid through a special tax assessment against commercial property in accordance with various state and local government programs known as C-PACE. Additionally, certain states have implemented feed-in tariffs, pursuant to which electricity generated from renewable energy sources is purchased at a higher rate than prevailing wholesale rates. Other incentives include tariffs, tax incentives and other cash and non-cash payments.\n\nGovernmental agencies, commercial entities and developers of sustainable infrastructure projects frequently depend on these policies and incentives to help defray the costs associated with, and to finance, various projects. Government regulations also impact the terms of third-party financing provided to support these projects. If any of these government policies, incentives or regulations are adversely amended, delayed, eliminated, reduced, retroactively changed or not extended\n\nbeyond their current expiration dates, or there is a negative impact from the recent federal law changes or proposals, the operating results of the projects we finance and the demand for, and the returns available from, the investments we make may decline, which could harm our business.\n\n## U.S. federal, state and local government entities are major/uni00A0participants in the sustainable infrastructure industry/uni00A0and their actions could be adverse to our projects or our company.\n\nThe projects we invest in are subject to substantial regulation by U.S. federal, state and local governmental agencies. For example, many projects require government permits, licenses, concessions, leases or contracts. Government entities, due to the wide-ranging scope of their authority, have significant leverage in setting their contractual and regulatory relationships with third parties. In addition, government permits, licenses, concessions, leases and contracts are generally very complex, which may result in periods of non-compliance, or disputes over interpretation or enforceability. If the projects in which we invest fail to obtain or comply with applicable regulations, permits, or contractual obligations, they could be prevented from being constructed or subjected to monetary penalties or loss of operational rights, which could negatively impact project operating results and the returns on our assets.\n\nContracts with government counterparties that support the projects in which we invest may be more favorable to the government counterparties compared to commercial contracts with private parties. For example, a lease, concession or general service contract may enable the government to modify or terminate the contract without requiring the payment of adequate compensation. Typically, our contracts with government counterparties contain termination provisions including prepayment amounts. In most cases, the prepayment amounts provide us with amounts sufficient to repay the financing we have provided but may be less than amounts that would be payable under 'make whole' provisions customarily found in commercial lending arrangements.\n\n|",

        "page_content": "In addition, government counterparties also may have the discretion to change or increase regulation of project operations, or implement laws or regulations affecting project operations, separate from any contractual rights they may have. These actions could adversely impact the efficient and profitable operation of the projects in which we invest.\n\nGovernment entities may also suspend or debar contractors from doing business with the government or pursue various criminal or civil remedies under various government contract regulations. They may also issue new government contracts or fail to extend existing government contracts. Our ability to originate new assets could be adversely affected if one or more of the ESCOs or other origination sources with whom we have relationships are suspended or debarred or fail to win new, or renew existing, contracts.\n\n## Changes in the terms of energy savings performance contracts could have a material and adverse impact on our/uni00A0business.\n\nWe derive a portion of our income from the assignment to us of payment streams under energy savings performance contracts with property owners, including government customers, in which the scope and cost of improvements and services are specified. While U.S. federal, state and local government rules governing such contracts vary, such rules may, for example, permit the funding of such contracts through long-term financing arrangements, permit long-term payback periods from the savings realized through such contracts, allow units of government to exclude debt related to such contracts from the calculation of their statutory debt limitation, allow for award of contracts on a 'best value' instead of 'lowest cost' basis and allow for the use of sole source providers. To the extent these rules become more restrictive in the future, our ability to provide financing to support these projects could be adversely impacted, which could harm our business. Changes in these rules, including retroactive changes, could also negatively impact the operating results of the projects we finance and the returns on our assets.\n\n## A change in the fiscal health, level of appropriations or budgets of U.S. federal, state and local governments could reduce demand for our investments.\n\nAlthough our energy efficiency investments do not normally require additional governmental appropriations to cover repayment due to the energy and operating savings derived from the newly installed equipment and systems, a significant decline in the fiscal health, level of appropriations or budgets of government customers may make it difficult for them to remain current on existing payment obligations or undesirable to enter into new energy efficiency improvement projects. Alternatively, some government entities may choose to provide appropriations or other credit support for sustainable infrastructure projects, which would negatively impact the use of private capital such as ours. This could have a material and adverse effect on the return of and return on our investments for existing projects and on our ability to originate new assets. Moreover, other changes in resources available to governments may also impact their willingness to undertake energy efficiency projects. For example, an increase in money set aside for government expenditures for energy efficiency projects may reduce demand for our investments.\n\nIn addition, to the extent we make investments that involve direct appropriations, we will depend on approval of the necessary\n\nspending for the projects. The repayment of the investment, or the return on our asset, could be adversely affected if appropriations for any such projects are delayed or terminated.\n\n## Because our business depends to a significant extent upon relationships with key industry players, our inability to maintain or develop these relationships, or the failure of these relationships to generate business opportunities, could adversely affect our business.\n\nWe rely, to a significant extent, on our relationships with key industry players in the markets we target. We originate transactions through programmatic finance relationships with various parties, including global ESCOs. We also originate transactions with renewable energy manufacturers, developers and operators who own and operate renewable energy projects, including several U.S. utility companies. In addition to the net proceeds from past and future debt and equity offerings, we have also financed our business by accessing the securitization, syndication, or other debt markets, primarily utilizing our relationships with insurance companies and commercial banks. We also rely on relationships with a variety of key financial participants, including institutional investors, senior lenders, and investment and commercial banks, as well as leading intermediaries, to complement our origination and financing activities. Our inability to maintain or develop these relationships, or the failure of these relationships to generate business opportunities, could adversely affect our business. In addition, individuals and entities with whom we have relationships are not obligated to provide us with business opportunities, and, therefore, there is no assurance that such relationships will generate business opportunities for us.\n\n## If the cost of energy generated by traditional sources of energy continues to stay or further declines from present levels, demand for the projects in which we invest may decline.\n\nMany traditional sources of energy such as coal, petroleum based fuels and natural gas can be influenced by the price of underlying or substitute commodities. While we believe the potential for rising or increasingly volatile commodity prices and inflation will spur investment in our industry, there have been, and may continue to be, decreases in such prices, which may reduce the demand for energy efficiency projects or other projects, including renewable energy facilities, that do not rely on fossil fuel energy sources. For example, we believe low natural gas prices may reduce the demand for projects like renewable energy that can substitute for natural gas. Additionally, low natural gas prices can adversely affect both the price available to renewable energy projects under future power sale agreements and the price of the electricity the projects sell on either a forward or a spot-market basis. Technological progress in electricity generation, storage or in the production of traditional fuels or the discovery of large new deposits of traditional fuels could reduce the cost of energy generated from those sources and consequently reduce the demand for the types of projects in which we invest, which could harm our new business origination prospects as well as the value of our existing portfolio. In addition, volatility in commodity prices, including energy prices, may cause building owners and other parties to be reluctant to commit to projects for which repayment is based upon a fixed monetary value for energy savings that would not decline if the price of energy declines. Any resulting decline in demand for our investments or the price that",

        "page_content": "industry participants receive for the sale of fossil fuel could adversely impact our operating results.\n\n## If the market for various types of sustainable infrastructure projects or the investment techniques related to such projects do not develop as we anticipate, new business generation in this target area may be adversely impacted.\n\nThe market for various types of sustainable infrastructure projects such as renewable energy projects, commercial office building energy efficiency projects, electricity storage, and storm water and various other sustainable infrastructure projects is emerging and rapidly evolving, leaving their future success uncertain. Similarly, various investing techniques, such as leasing land for renewable energy projects, purchasing interests in existing renewable energy projects, the use of C-PACE financing and the use of taxable debt for state and local energy efficiency or sustainable infrastructure financings are emerging and the future success of these investing techniques is also uncertain. If some or all market segments or investing techniques prove unsuitable for widespread commercial deployment or if demand for such projects or techniques fail to grow sufficiently, the demand for our capital may decline or develop more slowly than we anticipate. Many factors will influence the widespread adoption and demand for such projects and investing techniques, including general and local economic conditions, commodity prices of fossil fuel energy sources, the cost and availability of energy storage, the cost-effectiveness of various projects and techniques, performance and reliability of such technologies compared to conventional power sources and technologies, and the extent of government subsidies and regulatory developments. Any changes in the markets, products, technologies, financing techniques, or the regulatory environment could adversely impact the demand or financial performance for such projects and our investments.\n\nIn addition, renewable energy projects rely on electric and other types of transmission lines and facilities owned and operated by third parties to receive and distribute their energy. Any substantial access barriers to these lines and facilities could make projects that depend on them more expensive, which could adversely impact the demand or financial performance for such projects and our investments.\n\n## Existing electric utility industry regulations, and changes to regulations, may present technical, regulatory and economic barriers to the purchase and use of renewable energy and energy efficiency systems that may significantly reduce demand for systems in which we can invest.\n\nFederal, state and local government regulations and policies concerning the electric utility industry, and internal policies and regulations promulgated by electric utilities, heavily influence the market for electricity products and services. These regulations and policies often relate to electricity pricing and the interconnection of customerowned electricity generation. In the United States, governments and utilities continuously modify these regulations and policies. These regulations and policies could deter customers from purchasing energy efficiency and renewable energy systems. For example, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ('FERC') recently conducted its own review of grid resiliency and the functioning of electricity markets and has made, and could continue to make, changes to policies and regulations related to the function of the electricity markets and grid resiliency which may negatively impact the use of renewable energy\n\nor encourage the use of fossil fuel energy over renewable energy. This could result in a significant reduction in the potential demand for such systems. Utilities commonly charge fees to larger, industrial customers for disconnecting from the electric grid or for having the capacity to use power from the electric grid for back-up purposes. In addition, there is an increasing trend towards initiating or increasing fixed fees for users to have electricity service from a utility. These fees could increase our customers' cost to use energy efficiency and renewable energy systems not supplied by the utility and make them less desirable, thereby harming our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any changes to government or internal utility regulations and policies that favor electric utilities could reduce competitiveness and cause a significant reduction in demand for systems in which we invest.\n\n## Some projects in which we invest rely on net metering and related policies to improve project economics which if reduced could impact repayment of our investments or the return on our assets.\n\nThere has been a nationwide increase in distributed generation which has prompted discussions among policy makers and regulators regarding ways to both better integrate distributed energy resources into the electric grid and how to compensate distributed generators. Many states have a regulatory policy known as net energy metering, or net metering. Net metering typically allows some project customers to interconnect their on-site solar or other renewable energy systems to the utility grid and offset their utility electricity purchases by receiving a bill credit at the utility's retail rate for the amount of energy in excess of their electric usage that is generated by their renewable energy system and is exported to the grid. At the end of the billing period, the customer simply pays for the net energy used or receives a credit at the retail rate if more energy is produced than consumed. Net metering policies are under review or have been limited or amended in a number of states. The ability and willingness of customers to pay for renewable energy systems which benefit from net metering rules may be reduced if net metering rules are eliminated or their benefits reduced, which may also impact our returns on such systems.\n\n## Sustainable infrastructure projects that involve the generation, transmission or sale of electricity such as renewable energy projects may be subject to regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission under the Federal Power Act or other regulations that regulate the sale of electricity, which may adversely affect the profitability of such projects.\n\nSustainable infrastructure projects that involve the generation, transmission or sale of electricity such as renewable energy projects may be 'qualifying facilities' that are exempt from regulation as public utilities by the 'FERC under the Federal Power Act, (the 'FPA') while certain other such projects may be subject to rate regulation by the FERC under the FPA. FERC regulations under the FPA confer upon these qualifying facilities key rights to interconnection with local utilities and can entitle such facilities to enter into PPAs with local utilities, from which the qualifying facilities benefit. Changes to these U.S. federal laws and regulations could increase the regulatory burdens and costs and could reduce the revenue of the project. In addition, modifications to the pricing policies of utilities could require sustainable infrastructure projects to achieve lower prices in order to compete with the price",

To the extent that the projects in which we invest are subject to rate regulation, the project owners will be required to obtain FERC acceptance of their rate schedules for wholesale sales of energy, capacity and ancillary services. Any changes in the rates project owners are permitted to charge could impact the repayment of our investments, or the return on our assets.\n\nIn addition, the operation of, and electrical interconnection for, our sustainable infrastructure projects may be subject to U.S. federal, state or local interconnection and federal reliability standards, some of which are set forth in utility tariffs. These standards and tariffs specify rules, business practices and economic terms to which the projects where we invest are subject and which may impact a project's ability to deliver the electricity it produces or transports to its end customer. The tariffs are drafted by the utilities and approved by the utilities' state and U.S. federal regulatory commissions. These standards and tariffs change frequently and it is possible that future changes will increase our administrative burden or adversely affect the terms and conditions under which the projects render services to their customers.\n\nIn addition, under certain circumstances, we may also be subject to the reliability standards of the North American Electric Reliability Corporation. If project owners fail to comply with the mandatory reliability standards, they could be subject to sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties, which could also raise credit risks for, or lower the returns available from, the projects in which we invest.\n\nThese various regulations may also limit the transferability or sale of renewable energy projects and any such limits could negatively impact our returns from such projects.\n\n## Unfavorable publicity or public perception of the industries in which we operate could adversely impact our operating results and our reputation.\n\nThe sustainable infrastructure industry, including various forms of renewable energy and C-PACE financings receives significant media coverage that, whether or not directly related to our business or our projects, can adversely impact our reputation and the demand for our investments. Similarly, negative publicity or public perception of the renewable energy industry or the broader energy industries in which we operate or of climate change in general could reduce demand for our investments and our projects' services. Any reduction in demand for sustainable infrastructure projects or for our investments could damage our reputation or could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and business prospects.\n\n## We operate in a competitive market and future competition may impact the terms of our investments.\n\nWe compete against a number of parties who may provide alternatives to our investments including specialty finance companies, savings and loan associations, banks, private equity, hedge or infrastructure investment funds, insurance companies, mutual funds, institutional investors, investment banking firms, financial institutions, utilities,\n\nindependent power producers, project developers, pension funds, government entities, public entities established to own infrastructure assets and other entities. The continued low interest rate environment and increasing investor acceptance of the sustainable infrastructure market have increased the level of competition we experience. We also encounter competition in the form of potential customers or our origination partners electing to use their own capital rather than engaging an outside provider such as us. In addition, we may also face competition based on technological developments that reduce demand for electricity, increase power supplies through existing infrastructure or that otherwise compete with our sustainable infrastructure projects. Some of our competitors are significantly larger than we are, have access to greater capital and other resources than we do and may have other advantages over us. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships than we can. In addition, many of our competitors are not subject to the operating constraints associated with REIT tax compliance or maintenance of an exemption from the 1940 Act. These characteristics could allow our competitors to consider a wider variety of opportunities, establish more relationships and offer better pricing and more flexible structuring than we can offer. We may lose business opportunities if we do not match our competitors' pricing, terms and structure. If we match our competitors' pricing, terms and structure, we may not be able to achieve acceptable risk-adjusted returns on our assets or we may be forced to bear greater risks of loss. The increase in the number and/or the size of our competitors in this market has resulted, and could continue to result, in less attractive terms on our investments or the need to accept a higher level of risks associated with our investments. As a result, competitive pressures we face could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n## Our business is affected by seasonal trends and construction cycles, and these trends and cycles could have an adverse effect on our operating results.\n\nThe volume and timing of our originations are subject to seasonal fluctuations and construction cycles, particularly in climates that experience colder weather during the winter months, such as the northern United/uni00A0States, or at educational institutions, where large projects are typically carried out during summer months when their facilities are unoccupied. In addition, government customers, many of which have fiscal years that do not coincide with ours, typically follow annual procurement cycles. Further, government contracting cycles can be affected by the timing of, and delays in, the legislative process related to government programs, funding, or incentives that help drive demand for sustainable infrastructure projects. As a result of such fluctuations, we may occasionally experience fluctuations in the timing of new asset opportunities or declines in revenue or earnings as compared to the immediately preceding quarter, and comparisons of our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful.",

        "page_content": "## Risks related to our assets and projects in which we invest\n\n## Changes in interest rates could adversely affect the value of our assets and negatively affect our profitability.\n\nInterest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control. Many of our assets pay a fixed rate of interest or provide a fixed preferential return.\n\nWith respect to our business operations, increases in interest rates, in general, may over time cause: (1)/uni00A0project owners to be less interested in borrowing or raising equity and thus reduce the demand for our investments; (2)/uni00A0the interest expense associated with our borrowings to increase; (3)/uni00A0the market value of our fixed rate or fixed return assets to decline; and (4)/uni00A0the market value of our interest rate swap agreements to increase. Conversely, decreases in interest rates, in general, may over time cause: (1)/uni00A0project owners to be more interested in borrowing or raising equity and thus increase the demand for our assets; (2)/uni00A0prepayments on our assets, to the extent allowed, to increase; (3)/uni00A0the interest expense associated with our borrowings to decrease; (4)/uni00A0the market value of our fixed rate or fixed return assets to increase; and (5)/uni00A0the market value of our interest rate swap agreements to decrease. Adverse developments resulting from changes in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n## The lack of liquidity of our assets may adversely affect our business, including our ability to value and sell our assets.\n\nVolatile market conditions could significantly and negatively impact the liquidity of our assets. Illiquid assets typically experience greater price volatility, as a ready market does not exist, and can be more difficult to value. In addition, validating third-party pricing for illiquid assets may be more subjective than more liquid assets. The illiquidity of our assets may make it difficult for us to sell such assets if the need or desire arises. In addition, if we are required to liquidate all or a portion of our Portfolio quickly, we may realize significantly less than the value at which we have previously recorded our assets. To the extent that we utilize leverage to finance our investments that are or become illiquid, the negative impact on us related to trying to sell assets in a short period of time for cash could be greatly exacerbated. As a result, our ability to vary our portfolio in response to changes in economic and other conditions may be relatively limited, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## Provisions for loan losses are difficult to estimate.\n\nOur provision for loan losses is evaluated on a quarterly basis. The determination of our provision for loan losses requires us to make certain estimates and judgments, which may be difficult to determine. Our estimates and judgments are based on a number of factors, including a project's operating results, loan-to-value ratio, any cash reserve, the ability of expected cash from operations to cover the cash flow requirements currently and into the future, key terms of the transaction, the ability of the borrower to refinance the transaction, other credit support from the sponsor or guarantor and the project's collateral value. In addition, we consider the overall economic environment, the sustainable infrastructure sector, the effect of local, industry, and broader economic factors, the impact of any variation in weather and the historical and anticipated trends in interest rates, defaults and loss severities for similar transactions.\n\nOur estimates and judgments may not be correct and, therefore, our results of operations and financial condition could be severely impacted.\n\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No./uni00A02016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses-Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (Topic 326), which is effective for accounting periods beginning after December 15, 2019 and replaces the current 'incurred loss' model for recognizing credit losses with an 'expected loss' model referred to as the Current Expected Credit Loss ('CECL') model. Under the CECL model, we are required to present certain financial assets carried at amortized cost, such as loans held for investment, at the net amount expected to be collected. The measurement of expected credit losses is to be based on information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. This measurement will take place at the time the financial asset is first added to the balance sheet and updated quarterly thereafter. This differs significantly from the 'incurred loss' model required under current accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ('GAAP'), which delays recognition until it is probable a loss has been incurred.\n\nAccordingly, the adoption of the CECL model has affected how we determine our allowance for loan losses and is requiring us to increase our allowance and recognize provisions for loan losses earlier in the lending cycle. Moreover, the CECL model may create more volatility in the level of our allowance for loan losses. If our required level of allowance for loan losses is material for any reason, such increase could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n## We may experience a decline in the fair value of our assets.\n\nA decline in the fair market value of available-for-sale securities, any receivables we hold for sale, our interest rate hedges, if any, or any other assets which we may carry at fair value in the future, may require us to reduce the value of such assets under GAAP. In addition, our other financial assets are subject to an impairment assessment that could result in adjustments to their carrying values. Upon the subsequent disposition or sale of such assets, we could incur future losses or gains based on the difference between the sale price received and adjusted value of such assets as reflected on our balance sheet at the time of sale.\n\n## Some of the assets in our portfolio may be recorded at fair value and, as a result, there could be uncertainty as to the value of these assets.\n\nOur investments are not publicly traded. The fair value of assets that are not publicly traded may not be readily determinable. In accordance with GAAP, we record certain of our assets at fair value, which may include unobservable inputs. Because such valuations are subjective, the fair value of these assets may fluctuate over short periods of time and our determinations of fair value may differ materially from the values that would have been used if a ready market for these assets existed. The value of our common stock could be adversely affected if our determinations regarding the fair value of these assets were materially higher than the values that we ultimately realize upon their disposal. Additionally, our results of operations for a given period could be adversely affected if our determinations regarding the fair",

The valuation process can be particularly challenging during periods when market events make valuations of certain assets more difficult, unpredictable and volatile.\n\n## We may not realize income or gains from our assets, which could cause the value of our common stock to decline.\n\nWe seek to provide attractive risk-adjusted returns to our stockholders. However, our assets may not appreciate in value and, in fact, may decline in value, and the assets we originate or acquire may default or not perform in accordance with our expectations. Accordingly, we may not be able to realize gains or income from our assets. Any gains that we do realize may not be sufficient to offset any other losses we experience. Any income that we realize may not be sufficient to offset our expenses.\n\n## The majority of our investments are not rated by a rating agency, which may result in an amount of risk, volatility or potential loss of principal that is greater than that of alternative asset opportunities.\n\nThe majority of our investments are not rated by any rating agency and we expect that most of the assets we originate and acquire in the future will not be rated by any rating agency. Although we focus on sustainable infrastructure projects with high credit quality obligors, we believe that some of the projects or obligors in which we invest, if rated, would be rated below investment grade, due to speculative characteristics of the project or the obligor's capacity to pay interest and repay principal or pay dividends. Some of our assets may result in an amount of risk, volatility or potential loss of principal that is greater than that of alternative asset opportunities.\n\n## Any credit ratings assigned to our assets, debt or obligors are subject to ongoing evaluations and revisions and we cannot assure you that those ratings will not be downgraded.\n\nTo the extent our assets, their underlying obligors, or our debt are rated by credit rating agencies or by our internal rating process, such assets, obligors or our debt will be subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies and our internal rating process, and we cannot assure you that any ratings will not be changed or withdrawn in the future. If rating agencies assign a lower-than-expected rating or if a rating is further reduced or withdrawn by a rating agency or us, or if there are indications of a potential reduction or withdrawal of the ratings of our assets, the underlying obligors or our debt in the future, the value of these assets could significantly decline, the level of borrowings based on such asset could be reduced or we could incur higher borrowing costs or incur losses upon disposition or the failure of obligors to satisfy their obligations to us.\n\n## Our investments are subject to delinquency, foreclosure and loss, any or all of which could result in losses to us.\n\nOur investments are subject to risks of delinquency, foreclosure and loss. In many cases, the ability of a borrower to return our invested capital and our expected return is dependent primarily upon the successful development, construction and operation of the underlying project. If the cash flow of the project is reduced, the borrower's ability to return our capital and our expected return may be impaired. We\n\nmake certain estimates regarding project cash flows or savings during the underwriting of our investment. These estimates may not prove accurate, as actual results may vary from estimates. The cash flows or cost savings of a project can be affected by, among other things: the terms of the power purchase or other use agreements used in such project; the creditworthiness of the off-taker or project user; price of power or services now and in the future; the technology deployed; unanticipated expenses in the development or operation of the project and changes in national, regional, state or local economic conditions, laws and regulations; and acts of God, terrorism, social unrest and civil disturbances.\n\nIn the event of any default or shortfall of an investment, we will bear a risk of loss of principal or equity to the extent of any deficiency between the value of the collateral, if any, and the amount of our investment, which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow from operations and may impact the cash available for distribution to our stockholders. Many of the projects are structured as special purpose limited liability companies which limits our ability to realize any recovery to the collateral or value of the project itself. In the event of the bankruptcy of a project owner, obligor, or other borrower, our investment or the project will be deemed to be subject to the avoidance powers of the bankruptcy trustee or debtor-in-possession and our or the project's contractual rights may be unenforceable under federal bankruptcy or state law. Foreclosure proceedings against a project can be an expensive and lengthy process, which could have a substantial negative effect on our anticipated return on the foreclosed investment.\n\n## Our sustainable infrastructure projects may incur liabilities that rank equally with, or senior to, our investments in such projects.\n\nWe provide a range of investment structures, including various types of debt and equity securities, senior and subordinated loans, real property leases, mezzanine debt, preferred equity and common equity. Our projects may have, or may be permitted to incur, other liabilities or equity preferences that rank equally with, or senior to, our positions or investments in such projects or businesses, as the case may be, including with respect to grants of collateral. By their terms, such instruments may entitle the holders to receive payment of interest, principal payments or other distributions on or before the dates on which we are entitled to receive payments with respect to the instruments in which we invest. Also, in the event of insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or bankruptcy of an entity in which we have invested, holders of instruments ranking senior to our investment in that project or business would typically be entitled to receive payment in full before we receive any distribution. After repaying such senior stakeholders, such project may not have any remaining assets to use for repaying its obligation to us. In the case of securities ranking equally with instruments we hold, we would have to share on an equal basis any distributions with other stakeholders holding such instruments in the event of an insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or bankruptcy of the relevant project.\n\n## Our mezzanine or subordinated loans are less protected against losses than senior debt.\n\nWe make or acquire mezzanine and subordinated loans, which are loans made to project owners for sustainable infrastructure projects that are subordinate to other more senior interest or are secured by pledges of the borrower's ownership interests in the project and/or",

These mezzanine and subordinated loans may be subordinate to senior secured loans on the projects or to the returns required by the investors focused on the tax attributes in a project, known as tax equity investors, but senior to the project owner's equity. In the event a borrower defaults on a loan and lacks sufficient assets to satisfy our mezzanine or subordinated financing, we may suffer a loss of principal or interest. In the event a borrower declares bankruptcy, we may not have full recourse to the assets of the borrower, or the assets of the borrower may not be sufficient to satisfy our mezzanine or subordinated loan. In addition, mezzanine or subordinated loans are by their nature structurally subordinated to more senior project level investments, and in some cases, to tax equity investors. If a borrower defaults on our mezzanine or subordinated loan, on its obligations to the tax equity investor or on debt or other obligations senior to our loan, or if a borrower declares bankruptcy, our mezzanine or subordinated loan will be satisfied only after the project level debt or other obligations or tax equity and other senior debt is paid in full. Significant losses related to our mezzanine or subordinated loans would result in operating losses for us and may limit our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.\n\n## Our subordinated and mezzanine debt and equity investments, many of which are illiquid with no readily available market, involve a substantial degree of risk.\n\nWe make subordinated and mezzanine debt and equity investments which may fail to be repaid or appreciate and may decline in value or become worthless and our ability to recover our investment will depend on the success of the project in which we make such investments. Subordinated and mezzanine debt and equity investments involve a number of significant risks, including:\n\n- z such investments could be subject to further dilution as a result of the issuance of additional debt or equity interests and to serious risks because subordinated and mezzanine debt are subordinate to other indebtedness and in some cases, project tax equity, and equity interests are subordinate to all indebtedness (including trade creditors) and any senior securities in the event that the issuer is unable to meet its obligations or becomes subject to a bankruptcy process;\n- z to the extent that a project in which we invest requires additional capital and is unable to obtain it, we may not recover our investment; and\n- z in some cases, subordinated and mezzanine debt may not pay current interest or principal or equity investments may not pay current dividends, and our ability to realize a return on our investment, as well as to recover our investment, will be dependent on the success of the project in which we invest. The project may face unanticipated costs or delays or may not generate projected cash flows which could lead to the project generating lower than expected rates of return.\n\n## We generally do not control the projects in which we invest.\n\nAlthough the covenants in our financing or investment documentation generally restrict certain actions that may be taken by project owners, we generally do not control the projects in which we invest. As a result, we are subject to the risk that the project owner may make certain business decisions or take risks with which we disagree or otherwise act in ways that do not serve our interests.\n\n## We invest in joint ventures and other similar arrangements that subject us to additional risks.\n\nSome of our projects are structured as joint ventures, partnerships, securitizations, syndications and consortium arrangements. Part of our strategy is to participate with other institutional investors or the project's sponsor on various sustainable infrastructure transactions. These arrangements are driven by the magnitude of capital required to complete acquisitions and the development of sustainable infrastructure projects and other industry-wide trends that we believe will continue. Such arrangements involve risks not present where a third party is not involved, including the possibility that partners or co-venturers might become bankrupt or otherwise fail to fund their share of required capital contributions. Additionally, partners or co-venturers might at any time have economic or other business interests or goals different from ours. These investments generally provide for a reduced level of control over an acquired project because governance rights are shared with others. Accordingly, project decisions relating to the management, operation and the timing and nature of any exit, are often made by a majority vote of the investors or by separate agreements that are reached with respect to individual decisions. In addition, project operations may be subject to the risk that the project owners may make business, financial or management choices with which we do not agree or the management of the project may take risks or otherwise act in a manner that does not serve our interests. Because we may not have the ability to exercise control, we may not be able to realize some or all of the benefits expected from our investment. If any of the foregoing were to occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could suffer as a result.\n\nIn addition, some of our joint ventures, partnerships, and equity investments, subject the sale or transfer of our interests in these projects to rights of first refusal or first offer, tag along or drag along rights and buy-sell, call-put or other restrictions. Such rights may be triggered at a time when we may not want them to be exercised and such rights may inhibit our ability to sell our interest in an entity within our desired time frame or on any other desired terms.\n\n## Energy efficiency, renewable energy and other sustainable infrastructure projects are subject to performance risks, including risks due to extreme weather events, that could impact the repayment of and the return on our assets.\n\nEnergy efficiency, renewable energy and other sustainable infrastructure projects are subject to various construction and operating delays and risks that may cause them to incur higher than expected costs or generate less than expected amounts of savings or outputs such as electricity in the case of a renewable energy project. These risks include, extreme weather events, construction delays, a failure or degradation of our, our customers' or the utilities' equipment; obsolescence of, or an inability to find suitable, equipment or parts; labor shortages; less than expected supply of a project's source of renewable energy, such as solar insolation and wind; or a faster than expected diminishment of such supply. Further, many projects in which we invest will be subject to competitive risks and to volatility in commodity prices including the price of energy. Any extended interruption in the project's construction or operation, any cost overrun or failure of the project for any reason to generate the expected amount of output or cash flow, could have a material adverse effect on the repayment of and the return on our assets.",

        "page_content": "## Many of our assets depend on revenues from third-party contractual arrangements.\n\nMany of the projects in which we invest rely on revenue or repayment from contractual commitments of end-customers, including federal, state or local governments for energy efficiency projects or utilities or other customers under PPAs. There is a risk that these customers may default under their contracts. In addition, many of these endcustomers are large entities with wide ranging activities. An event in a non-related part of the business could have a material adverse impact on the financial strength of such end-customer such as the effect of recent wildfires on the California utilities. Furthermore, the bankruptcy, insolvency or other liquidity constraints of one or more customers may result in a renegotiation or rejection of the thirdparty contract, delay the receipt of any obligations or reduce the likelihood of collecting defaulted obligations. Some projects rely on one customer for their revenue and thus the project could be materially and adversely affected by any material change in the financial condition of that customer. While there may be alternative customers for such a project, there can be no assurance that a new contract on the same terms will be able to be negotiated for the project.\n\nCertain of our projects with contractually committed revenues or other sources of repayment under long term contracts will be subject to re-contracting risk in the future. We cannot provide assurance that these contracts can be re-negotiated once their terms expire on equally favorable terms or at all. If it is not possible to renegotiate these contracts on favorable terms, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nRevenues at some of the projects in which we invest depend on reliable and efficient metering, or other revenue collection systems, which are often specified in the contract. There is a risk that, if one or more of such projects are not able to operate and maintain the metering or other revenue collection systems in the manner expected, if the operation and maintenance costs, are greater than expected, or if the customer disputes the output of the revenue collection system, the ability of the project to repay our investments or provide a return to us on our asset could be materially and adversely affected.\n\n## We are exposed to the credit risk of ESCOs, various project sponsors, and others.\n\nWe are subject to varying degrees of credit risk related to ESCOs in government energy efficiency projects in which guarantees provided by ESCOs under energy savings performance contracts are required in the event that certain energy savings are not realized by the customer. We are also exposed to credit risk in projects in which we invest that do not depend on funding from governments.\n\nWhere we make loans to or own equity interests in special purposes entities such as those which lease solar energy systems to residential customers, those special purpose entities often enter into various contractual arrangements with, or receive performance guarantees from the affiliate project sponsor to ensure satisfactory equipment or other project performance over the term of the lease or power purchase agreement. To the extent those parties are unable to perform on their contractual obligations or performance guarantees we may see diminished equity returns or the special purpose entity may be unable to repay their loan timely or at all.\n\nWe seek to mitigate these credit risks by employing a comprehensive review and asset selection process and careful ongoing monitoring of acquired assets. Nevertheless, unanticipated credit losses could occur which could adversely impact our operating results. During periods of economic downturn in the global economy, our exposure to credit risks from obligors increases, and our efforts to monitor and mitigate the associated risks may not be effective in reducing our credit risks. Certain participants in the sustainable energy industry have experienced significant declines in the value of their equity and difficulty in raising or refinancing debt, which increases the credit risk to these companies and there can be no assurance they will be able to fulfill their obligations which could adversely impact our operating results.\n\n## Some of the projects in which we invest have sold their output under PPAs which expose the projects to various risks.\n\nSome of our projects enter into PPAs when they contract to sell all or a fixed proportion of the electricity generated by the project, sometimes bundled with renewable energy credits and capacity or other environmental attributes, to a power purchaser, often a utility, or increasingly, a corporation. PPAs are used to stabilize our revenues from that project. We are exposed to the risk that the power purchaser, who we consider an obligor, will fail to perform under a PPA or the PPA will be terminated or expire, which will lead to that project needing to sell its electricity at the then market price, which could be substantially lower than the price provided in the applicable PPA. In most instances, the project also commits to sell minimum levels of generation. If the project generates less than the committed volumes, it may be required to buy the shortfall of electricity on the open market or make payments of liquidated damages or be in default under a PPA, which could result in its termination. In the event that any of these events were to occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could suffer as a result.\n\n## Portions of the electricity our assets generate is sold on the open market at spot-market prices. A prolonged environment of low prices for natural gas, or other conventional fuel sources such as we are experiencing may, and could continue to, have a material adverse effect on our long-term business prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nHistorically low prices for traditional fossil fuels, particularly natural gas, could cause demand for renewable energy to decrease and they have, and may continue to, adversely affect both the future sale price of energy under new PPAs and the current sale price of energy sold on a spot-market basis. Low PPA and spot market power prices, if combined with other factors, can have a material adverse effect on our projects and their respective values and our expected returns, results of operations and cash available for distribution.\n\n## The ability of our assets to generate revenue from certain projects depends on having interconnection arrangements and services.\n\nThe future success of our assets will depend, in part, on their ability to maintain satisfactory interconnection agreements. If the interconnection or transmission agreement of a project is terminated for any reason, they\n\n|",

If a network to which one or more of the projects is connected experiences equipment or operational problems or other forms of 'down time,' the affected project may lose revenue and be exposed to non-performance penalties and claims from its customers. These may include claims for damages incurred by customers, such as the additional cost of acquiring alternative electricity supply at then-current spot market rates. The owners of the network will not usually compensate electricity generators for lost income due to down time. In addition, our projects may be exposed to a locational basis risk resulting from a difference between where the power is generated and the contracted delivery point. These factors could materially affect these projects, which could negatively affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.\n\n## Our projects and their obligors are exposed to an increase in climate change or other change in meteorological conditions which could have an impact on electric generation, revenue, insurance costs or the ability of the projects or their obligors to honor their contract obligations, all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows.\n\nThe electricity produced and revenues generated by a renewable electric generation facility are highly dependent on suitable weather conditions, which are beyond our control. Components of renewable energy systems, such as turbines, solar panels and inverters, could be damaged by natural disasters or severe weather, including extreme temperatures, wildfires, hurricanes, hailstorms or tornadoes. Furthermore, the potential physical impacts of climate change may impact our projects, including the result of changes in weather patterns (including floods, tsunamis, drought, and rainfall levels), wind speeds, water availability, storm patterns and intensities, and temperature levels. The projects in which we invest will be obligated to bear the expense of repairing the damaged renewable energy systems and replacing spare parts for key components and insurance may not cover the costs or the lost revenue. Natural disasters or unfavorable weather and atmospheric conditions could impair the effectiveness of the renewable energy assets, reduce their output beneath their rated capacity, require shutdown of key equipment or impede operation of the renewable energy assets, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows. Sustained unfavorable weather could also unexpectedly delay the installation of renewable energy systems, which could result in a delay in our investing in new projects or increase the cost of such projects. The resulting effects of climate change can also have an impact on the cost of, and the ability of a project to obtain, adequate insurance coverage to protect against related losses.\n\nWe typically base our investment decisions with respect to each renewable energy facility on the findings of studies conducted onsite prior to construction or based on historical conditions at existing facilities. However, actual climatic conditions at a facility site may not conform to the findings of these studies. Even if an operating project's historical renewable energy resources are consistent with the long-term estimates, the unpredictable nature of weather conditions often results in daily, monthly and yearly material deviations from the\n\naverage renewable resources anticipated during a particular period. Therefore, renewable energy facilities in which we invest may not meet anticipated production levels or the rated capacity of the generation assets, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows.\n\nThe amount of electricity renewable energy generation assets produce is also dependent in part on the time of year. For example, because shorter daylight hours in winter months results in less solar irradiation, the generation of particular assets will vary depending on the season. Further, time-of-day pricing factors vary seasonally which contributes to variability of revenues. As a result, we expect the revenue and cash flow from certain of our assets to vary based on the time of year.\n\nIn addition, many of the project's end-customers are large entities with wide ranging activities. A climate related event in a non-related part of the business could have a material adverse impact on the financial strength of such end-customer and their ability to honor their contractual obligations which could negatively impact on revenue and the cash flow of the project and our business.\n\n## Operation of the projects in which we invest involves significant risks and hazards customary to our investees that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\nThe ongoing operation of the projects in which we invest involves risks that include the breakdown or failure of equipment or processes or performance below expected levels of output or efficiency due to wear and tear, latent defect, design error or operator error or force majeure events, among other things. In addition to natural risks such as earthquake, flood, drought, lightning, wildfire, hurricane, ice, wind, and temperature extremes, other hazards, such as fire, explosion, structural collapse and machinery failure, acts of terrorism or related acts of war, hostile cyber intrusions or other catastrophic events are inherent risks in the operation of a project. These and other hazards can cause significant personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property, plant and equipment and contamination of, or damage to, the environment and suspension of operations. Operation of a project also involves risks that the operator will be unable to transport its product to its customers in an efficient manner due to a lack of transmission capacity. Unplanned outages of projects, including extensions of scheduled outages due to mechanical failures or other problems, occur from time to time and are an inherent risk of the business. Unplanned outages typically increase operation and maintenance expenses and may reduce revenues as a result of selling less electricity or require the project to incur significant costs as a result of obtaining replacement power from third parties in the open market to satisfy forward power sales obligations. The project's inability to operate its assets efficiently, manage capital expenditures and costs and generate earnings and cash flow could have a material adverse effect on our investment and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. While the projects maintain insurance, obtain warranties from vendors and obligate contractors to meet certain performance levels, the proceeds of such insurance, warranties or performance guarantees may not cover the lost revenues, increased expenses or liquidated damages payments should the project experience any equipment breakdowns, insurance claims or non-performance by contractors or vendors.",

        "page_content": "## Some of the projects in which we invest may require substantial operating or capital expenditures in the future.\n\nMany of the projects in which we invest are capital intensive and require substantial ongoing expenditures for, among other things, additions and improvements, and maintenance and repair of plant and equipment related to project operations. In addition, there may be cash needs to settle certain contractual obligations of the projects, such as settlements or margining requirements related to hedging activities. While we do not typically bear the responsibility for these expenditures, any failure by the equity owner to make necessary operating or capital expenditures could adversely impact project performance. In addition, some of these expenditures may not be recoverable from current or future contractual arrangements.\n\n## The use of real property rights that we acquire or are used for our sustainable infrastructure projects may be adversely affected by the rights of lienholders and leaseholders that are superior to those of the grantors of those real property rights to us.\n\nThe projects in which we invest often require large areas of land for construction and operation or other easements or access to the underlying land. In addition, we may acquire rights to land or other real property. The rights to own or use the land can be obtained through fee simple title, leases and other rights of use. Although we believe that the real property rights we acquire, or our projects in which we invest, have valid rights to all material easements, licenses and rights of way, not all of such easements, licenses and rights of way are registered against the lands to which they relate and may not bind subsequent owners. Some of our real property rights and projects generally are, and are likely to continue to be, located on land occupied pursuant to long-term easements and leases. The ownership interests in the land subject to these easements and leases may be subject to mortgages securing loans or other liens (such as tax liens) and other easement and lease rights of third parties (such as leases of water, oil or mineral rights) that were created prior to, or are superior to, our or our projects' easements and leases. As a result, our rights may be subject, and subordinate, to the rights of those third parties. We typically obtain representations or perform title searches or obtain title insurance to protect our real property interest and our investments in our projects against these risks. Such measures may, however, be inadequate to protect against all risk of loss of rights to use the land rights we have acquired or the land on which these projects are located, which could have a material and adverse effect on our land rights, our projects and their financial condition and operating results.\n\nWe own land or leasehold interests that are used by renewable energy projects. Negative market conditions or adverse events affecting tenants, or the industries in which they operate, could have an adverse impact on our underwritten returns. Moreover, many of our assets are concentrated in similar geographic locations, which subjects us to an increased risk of significant loss if any property declines in value, incurs a natural disaster or if we are unable to lease a property.\n\nWe own land or leasehold interests used by renewable energy projects that are concentrated in a limited number of geographic locations. One consequence of this is that the aggregate returns we realize may\n\nbe substantially adversely affected by the unfavorable performance of a small number of leases, a significant decline in the market value of any single property or a natural disaster in a concentrated area. Our cash flow depends in part on the ability to lease the real estate to projects or other tenants on economically favorable terms. We could be adversely affected by various facts and events over which we have limited or no control, such as:\n\n- z lack of demand in areas where our properties are located;\n- z inability to retain existing tenants and attract new tenants;\n- z oversupply of space and changes in market rental rates;\n- z our tenants' creditworthiness and ability to pay rent, which may be affected by their operations, the current economic situation and competition within their industries from other operators;\n- z defaults by and bankruptcies of tenants, failure of tenants to pay rent on a timely basis, or failure of tenants to comply with their contractual obligations;\n- z economic or physical decline of the areas where the properties are located; and\n- z destruction from natural disasters.\n\nAt any time, any tenant may experience a downturn in its business, including increased operating costs, termination of a PPA or low spotmarket prices of products, that may weaken its operating results or overall financial condition, a tenant may delay lease commencement, fail to make rental payments when due, decline to extend a lease upon its expiration, become insolvent or declare bankruptcy. Any tenant bankruptcy or insolvency, leasing delay or failure to make rental payments when due could result in the termination of the tenant's lease and material losses to us.\n\nIf a tenant elects to terminate its lease prior to or upon its expiration or does not renew its lease as it expires, we may not be able to rent or sell the properties or realize our expected value. Furthermore, leases that are renewed and some new leases for properties that are re-leased, may have terms that are less economically favorable than expiring lease terms, or may require us to incur significant costs, such as lease transaction costs. In addition, negative market conditions or adverse events affecting tenants, or the industries in which they operate, may force us to sell vacant properties for less than their carrying value, which could result in impairments. Any of these events could adversely affect the value of our asset, the cash flow from operations and our ability to make distributions to stockholders and service indebtedness. A significant portion of the costs of owning property, such as real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance, are not necessarily reduced when circumstances cause a decrease in rental revenue from the properties. In a weakened financial condition, tenants may not be able to pay these costs of ownership and we may be unable to recover these operating expenses from them.\n\nFurther, the occurrence of a tenant bankruptcy or insolvency could diminish the income we receive from the tenant's lease or leases. For instance, a bankruptcy court might authorize the tenant to terminate its leases with us. If that happens, our claim against the bankrupt tenant for unpaid future rent would be subject to statutory limitations that most likely would be substantially less than the remaining rent we are owed under the leases. In addition, any claim we have for unpaid past rent, if any, may not be paid in full. As a result, tenant bankruptcies may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\n\n|",

If these projects were unable to negotiate acceptable contracts with any of their unions as existing agreements expire, they could experience a significant disruption of their operations, higher ongoing labor costs and restrictions on their ability to maximize the efficiency of their operations, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, in some jurisdictions where our projects have operations, labor forces have a legal right to strike which may have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations, either directly or indirectly, for example if a critical upstream or downstream counterparty was itself subject to a labor disruption which impacted the ability of our projects to operate.\n\n## We invest in projects that rely on third parties to manufacture quality products or provide reliable services in a timely manner and the failure of these third parties could cause project performance to be adversely affected.\n\nWe invest in projects that typically rely on third parties to select, manage or provide equipment or services. Third parties may be responsible for choosing vendors, including equipment suppliers and subcontractors. Project success often depends on third parties who are capable of installing and managing projects and structuring contracts that provide appropriate protection against construction and operational risks. In many cases, in addition to contractual protections and remedies, project owners may seek guaranties, warranties and construction bonding to provide additional protection.\n\nThe warranties provided by the third parties and, in some cases, their subcontractors, typically limit any direct harm that results from relying on their products and services. However, there can be no assurance that a supplier or subcontractor will be willing or able to fulfill its contractual obligations and make necessary repairs or replace equipment. In addition, these warranties generally expire within one to five years or may be of limited scope or provide limited remedies. If projects are unable to avail themselves of warranty protection or receive the expected protection under the terms of the guaranties or bonding, we may need to incur additional costs, including replacement and installation costs, which could adversely impact our investment.\n\n## Liability relating to environmental matters may impact the value of properties that we may acquire or the properties underlying our assets.\n\nUnder various U.S. federal, state and local laws, an owner or operator of real estate or a project may become liable for the costs of removal of certain hazardous substances released from the project or any underlying real property. These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the release of such hazardous substances.\n\nThe presence of hazardous substances may adversely affect our, or another owner's, ability to sell a contaminated project or borrow using the project as collateral. To the extent that we, or another project owner, become liable for removal costs, our investment, or the ability of the owner to make payments to us, may be negatively impacted.\n\nWe acquire real property rights, make investments in projects that own real property, have collateral consisting of real property and in the course of our business, we may take title to a project or its underlying real estate assets relating to one of our debt financings. In these cases, we could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these assets. To the extent that we become liable for the removal costs, our results of operation and financial condition may be adversely affected. The presence of hazardous substances, if any, may adversely affect our ability to sell the affected real property or the project and we may incur substantial remediation costs, thus harming our financial condition.\n\n## Our insurance and contractual protections may not always cover lost revenue, increased expenses or liquidated damages payments.\n\nAlthough our assets or projects generally have insurance, supplier warranties, subcontractors performance assurances such as bonding and other risk mitigation measures, the proceeds of such insurance, warranties, bonding or other measures may not be adequate to cover lost revenue, increased expenses or liquidated damages payments that may be required in the future.\n\n## The repayment of certain of our assets is dependent upon collection of payments from residential customers and we may be indirectly subject to consumer protection laws and regulations.\n\nCertain obligors to which we have credit exposure are, or may be, subject to consumer protection laws, such as federal truth-in-lending, consumer leasing, and equal credit opportunity laws and regulations, as well as state and local sales and finance laws and regulations. Claims arising out of actual or alleged violations of law may be asserted against those obligors by individuals or governmental entities and may exposure them to significant damages or other penalties, including fines, or could reduce the likelihood the residential customer may pay their obligation, which could limit their ability to repay borrowings or make equity distributions to us.",

We may change our investment guidelines, underwriting process and our strategy at any time with the approval of our board of directors, but without the consent of our stockholders, which could result in originating assets that are different in type from, and possibly riskier than, the assets initially contemplated. In addition, our charter provides that our board of directors may authorize us to revoke or otherwise terminate our REIT election, without the approval of our stockholders, if it determines that it is no longer in our best interests to qualify as a REIT. These changes could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.\n\n## Our management and employees depend on information systems and system failures could significantly disrupt our business, which may, in turn, negatively affect the market price of our common stock and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.\n\nOur underwriting process and our asset and financial management and reporting are dependent on our present and future communications and information systems. Any failure or interruption of these systems could cause delays or other problems in our originating, financing, investing, asset and financial management and reporting activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\n\nWe contract with information technology service providers where, in part, we rely upon their systems and controls for the quality of the data provided. The inappropriate establishment and maintenance of these systems and controls could cause information that we use to operate our business to be unavailable or inaccurate and could negatively impact our financial results.\n\nOur information technology architecture is partially outsourced. These systems and processes may be either internet based or through traditional outsourced functions and certain of these arrangements are new or emerging. When we contract with these service providers we attempt to evaluate the quality of their systems and controls before we execute the arrangement and may rely on third party reviews and audits of these service providers and attempt to implement certain processes to ensure the quality of the data received from these service providers. Because of the nature and maturity of the technology such efforts may be unsuccessful or incomplete and the unavailability of these systems or the inaccurate data provided from these service providers could negatively impact our financial results.\n\n## Cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents may adversely affect our business by causing a disruption to our operations, a compromise or corruption of our confidential information, a misappropriation of funds, and/or damage to our business relationships, all of which could negatively impact our financial results.\n\nA cyber incident is considered to be any adverse event that threatens the confidentiality, integrity or availability of our information resources. These incidents may be an intentional attack or an unintentional event and could involve gaining unauthorized access to our information systems for purposes of misappropriating assets, stealing confidential information, corrupting data or causing operational disruption. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attacks or cyber intrusions, including by computer hackers, nation-state affiliated actors, and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. The result of these incidents may include disrupted operations, misstated or unreliable financial data, disrupted market price of our common stock, misappropriation of assets, liability for stolen assets or information, increased cybersecurity protection and insurance cost, regulatory enforcement, litigation and damage to our relationships. These risks require continuous and likely increasing attention and other resources from us to, among other actions, identify and quantify these risks, upgrade and expand our technologies, systems and processes to adequately address them and provide periodic training for our employees to assist them in detecting phishing, malware and other schemes. Such attention diverts time and other resources from other activities and there is no assurance that our efforts will be effective. Potential sources for disruption, damage or failure of our information technology systems include, without limitation, computer viruses, security breaches, human error, cyber- attacks, natural disasters and defects in design. Additionally, due to the size and nature of our company, we rely on third-party service providers for many aspects of our business. We can provide no assurance that the networks and systems that our third-party vendors have established or use will be effective. As our reliance on technology has increased, so have the risks posed to both our information systems and those provided by third-party service providers. Our processes, procedures and internal controls that are designed to mitigate cybersecurity risks and cyber intrusions do not guarantee that a cyber incident will not occur or that our financial results, operations or confidential information will not be negatively impacted by such an incident.\n\nWe may seek to expand our business internationally, which will expose us to additional risks that we do not face in the United States, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\n\nWe generate substantially all of our revenue from operations in the United States. We may seek to expand our projects outside of the United States in the future. These operations will be subject to a variety of risks that we do not face in the United States, including risk from changes in foreign country regulations, infrastructure, legal systems and markets.

Section/uni00A03(a)(1)(A) of the 1940 Act defines an investment company as any issuer that is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. Section/uni00A03(a)(1)(C) of the 1940 Act defines an investment company as any issuer that is engaged or proposes to engage in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities and owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of the issuer's total assets (exclusive of U.S. Government securities and cash items) on a non-consolidated basis, which we refer to as the 40% test. Excluded from the term 'investment securities,' among other things, are U.S. Government securities and securities issued by majority-owned subsidiaries that are not themselves investment companies and are not relying on the exemption from the definition of investment company set forth in Section/uni00A03(c)(1) or Section/uni00A03(c)(7) of the 1940 Act.\n\nor convertible debt investments in, companies or assets to invest in new or different projects or markets, expand our project skill-sets and capabilities, expand our geographic markets, add experienced management and increase our product and service offerings. There are a number of risks associated with these transactions and we may not achieve our goals in the transaction. Such transaction could disrupt our business, cause dilution to our stockholders and harm our business, financial condition or operating results. In addition, the time and effort involved to identify candidates and consummate such transactions may divert members of our management from the operations of our company.\n\nWe conduct our businesses primarily through our subsidiaries and our operations so that we comply with the 40% test. The securities issued by any wholly-owned or majority-owned subsidiaries that we hold or may form in the future that are exempted from the definition of 'investment company' based on Section/uni00A03(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the 1940 Act, together with any other investment securities we may own, may not have a value in excess of 40% of the value of our total assets on a non-consolidated basis. Certain of our subsidiaries rely on or will rely on an exemption from registration as an investment company under the 1940 Act pursuant to Section/uni00A03(c)(5)(C) of the 1940 Act, which is available for entities which are not primarily engaged in issuing redeemable securities, face-amount certificates of the installment type or periodic payment plan certificates and which are primarily engaged in the business of purchasing or otherwise acquiring mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate. This exemption generally requires that at least 55% of such subsidiaries' portfolios must be comprised of qualifying assets and at least 80% of each of their portfolios must be comprised of qualifying assets and real estate-related assets under the 1940 Act. Consistent with guidance published by the SEC staff, we intend to treat as qualifying assets for this purpose loans secured by projects for which the original principal amount of the loan did not exceed 100% of the value of the underlying real property portion of the collateral when the loan was made. We intend to treat as real estate-related assets non-controlling equity interests in joint ventures that own projects whose assets are primarily real property. In general, with regard to our subsidiaries relying on Section/uni00A03(c)(5)(C), we rely on other guidance published by the SEC or its staff or on our analyses of guidance published with respect to other types of assets to determine which assets are qualifying real estate assets and real estate-related assets.\n\nIn addition, one or more of our subsidiaries qualifies for an exemption from registration as an investment company under the 1940 Act pursuant to either Section/uni00A03(c)(5)(A) of the 1940 Act, which is available for entities which are not engaged in the business of issuing redeemable securities, face-amount certificates of the installment type or periodic payment plan certificates, and which are primarily engaged in the business of purchasing or otherwise acquiring notes, drafts, acceptances, open accounts receivable, and other obligations representing part or all of the sales price of merchandise, insurance, and services, or Section/uni00A03(c)(5)(B) of the 1940 Act, which is available for entities primarily engaged in the business of making loans to manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers of, and",

These exemptions generally require that at least 55% of such subsidiaries' portfolios must be comprised of qualifying assets that meet the requirements of the exemption. We intend to treat energy efficiency loans where the loan proceeds are specifically provided to finance equipment, services and structural improvements to properties and other facilities and renewable energy and other sustainable infrastructure projects or improvements as qualifying assets for purposes of these exemptions. In general, we also expect, with regard to our subsidiaries relying on Section/uni00A03(c)(5)(A) or (B), to rely on guidance published by the SEC or its staff, including reliance on a no-action letter obtained in connection with Sections 3(c)(5)(A) and 3(c)(5)(B) of the 1940 Act, or on our analyses of guidance published with respect to other types of assets to determine which assets are qualifying assets under the exemptions.\n\nAlthough we monitor the portfolios of our subsidiaries relying on the Section/uni00A03(c)(5)(A), (B)/uni00A0or (C)/uni00A0exemptions periodically and prior to each acquisition, there can be no assurance that such subsidiaries will be able to maintain their exemptions. Qualification for exemptions from registration under the 1940 Act will limit our ability to make certain investments. For example, these restrictions will limit the ability of these subsidiaries to make loans that are not secured by real property or that do not represent part or all of the sales price of merchandise, insurance, and services.\n\nThere can be no assurance that the laws and regulations governing the 1940 Act, including the Division of Investment Management of the SEC providing more specific or different guidance regarding these exemptions, will not change in a manner that adversely affects our operations. For example, on August/uni00A031, 2011, the SEC issued a concept release (No. IC-29778; File No. SW7-34-11, Companies Engaged in the Business of Acquiring Mortgages and MortgageRelated Instruments) pursuant to which it is reviewing the scope of the exemption from registration under Section/uni00A03(c)(5)(C) of the 1940 Act. While the SEC has yet to provide additional information on its position relating to these exemptions and timing of any future changes to the exemptions remain unknown, any additional guidance from the SEC or its staff from this process or in other circumstances could provide additional flexibility to us, or it could further inhibit our ability to pursue the strategies we have chosen. If we or our subsidiaries fail to maintain an exemption from the 1940 Act, we could, among other things, be required either to (1)/uni00A0change the manner in which we conduct our operations to avoid being required to register as an investment company, (2)/uni00A0effect sales of our assets in a manner that, or at a time when, we would not otherwise choose to do so or (3)/uni00A0register as an investment company, any of which could negatively affect our business, our ability to make distributions, our financing strategy and the market price for our shares of common stock.\n\nWe have not requested the SEC or its staff to approve our treatment of any company as a majority-owned subsidiary and neither the SEC nor its staff has done so. If the SEC or its staff were to disagree with our treatment of one or more companies as majority-owned subsidiaries, we would need to adjust our strategy and our assets in order to continue to pass the 40% test. Any such adjustment in our strategy could have a material adverse effect on us.\n\n## Rapid changes in the values of our assets may make it more difficult for us to maintain our qualification as a REIT or our exemption from the 1940 Act.\n\nIf the market value or income potential of our assets changes as a result of changes in interest rates, general market conditions, government actions or other factors, we may need to adjust the portfolio mix of our real estate assets and income or liquidate our non-qualifying assets to maintain our REIT qualification or our exemption from the 1940 Act. If changes in asset values or income occur quickly, this may be especially difficult to accomplish. This difficulty may be exacerbated by the illiquid nature of the assets we may own. We may have to make decisions that we otherwise would not make absent the REIT and 1940 Act considerations.\n\n## Because we expect to distribute substantially all of our REIT taxable income to our stockholders, we will need additional capital to finance our growth and such capital may not be available on favorable terms or at all.\n\nWe will need additional capital to fund our growth. U.S. federal income tax law generally requires that a REIT distribute annually at least 90% of its REIT taxable income, without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains, and that it pay tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that it annually distributes greater than 90% but less than 100% of such REIT taxable income. Because we intend to grow our business, this limitation may require us to incur additional debt or raise additional equity at a time when it may be disadvantageous to do so. We cannot make any assurance that debt and equity financing will be available to us on favorable terms, or at all, and debt financings may be restricted by the terms of any of our outstanding borrowings. If additional funds are not available to us, we could be forced to curtail or cease new asset originations and acquisitions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\n\n## The preparation of our financial statements involves use of estimates, judgments and assumptions, and our financial statements may be materially affected if our estimates prove to be inaccurate.\n\nFinancial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP require the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts. Different estimates, judgments and assumptions reasonably could be used that would have a material effect on the financial statements, and changes in these estimates, judgments and assumptions are likely to occur from period to period in the future. Significant areas of accounting requiring the application of management's judgment include but are not limited to determining the fair value of our assets.\n\nThese estimates, judgments and assumptions are inherently uncertain, and, if they prove to be wrong, then we face the risk that charges to income will be required. Any charges could significantly harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and the price of our securities. See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates for a discussion of the accounting estimates, judgments and assumptions that we believe are the most critical to an understanding of our business, financial condition and results of operations.",

        "page_content": "## Risks related to borrowings\n\n## We use financial leverage in executing our business strategy, which may adversely affect the returns on our assets and may reduce cash available for distribution to our stockholders, as well as increase losses when economic conditions are unfavorable.\n\nWe use debt to finance our assets, including credit facilities, recourse and non-recourse debt as well as securitizations and syndications. Changes in the financial markets and the economy generally could adversely affect one or more of our lenders or potential lenders and could cause one or more of our lenders, potential lenders or institutional investors to be unwilling or unable to provide us with financing or participate in securitizations or could increase the costs of that financing or securitization. If we are unable to repay or refinance the remaining balance of this debt, or if the terms of any available refinancing are not favorable, we may be forced to liquidate assets or incur higher costs which may significantly harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and our ability to make distributions, which could cause the value of our common stock to decline. The return on our assets and cash available for distribution to our stockholders may be reduced to the extent that market conditions prevent us from leveraging our assets or increase the cost of our financing relative to the income that can be derived from the assets acquired. Increases in our financing costs will reduce cash available for distributions to stockholders. We may not be able to meet our financing obligations and, to the extent that we cannot, we risk the loss of some or all of our assets to liquidation or sale to satisfy the obligations.\n\n## An increase in our borrowing costs relative to the interest we receive on our assets may adversely affect our profitability and our cash available for distribution to our stockholders. Our borrowings may have a shorter duration than our assets.\n\nAs some of our borrowings will have a remaining balance at maturity, we may be required to enter into new borrowings at higher rates or to sell certain of our assets to repay the loan. In addition, any increases in the federal funds rate announced by the Federal Reserve Board of Governors is likely to increase shorter-term interest rates and may lower the difference between shorter-term interest rates and longer-term interest rates which would result in a flattening or inversion of the yield curve. Our credit facilities have rates that adjust on a frequent basis based on prevailing short-term interest rates. An increase in interest rates, or a flattening or inversion of the yield curve, would reduce the spread between the returns on our assets which are typically priced using longer-term interest rates and the cost of any new borrowings or borrowings where the interest rate adjusts to market rates or is based on shorter-term rates. This change in interest rates would adversely affect our earnings and, in turn, cash available for distribution to our stockholders. In addition, as we may use short-term borrowings including repurchase agreements and warehouse facilities that are generally short-term commitments of capital, lenders may respond to market conditions making it more difficult for us to secure continued financing. If we are not able to renew our then existing facilities or arrange for new financing on terms acceptable to us, or if we default on our covenants or are otherwise unable to access funds under any of these facilities, we may have to curtail entering into new transactions and/or dispose of assets. We will face these risks given that a number of our borrowings have a shorter duration than the assets they finance.\n\n## We do not have a formal policy limiting the amount of debt we may incur. Our board of directors may change our leverage limits without stockholder approval.\n\nAlthough we are not restricted by any regulatory requirements to maintain our leverage ratio at or below any particular level, the amount of leverage we may deploy for particular assets will depend upon the availability of particular types of financing and our assessment of the credit, liquidity, price volatility and other risks of those assets and the credit quality of our financing counterparties. We have established leverage limits which are discussed in Item/uni00A07, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of OperationsLiquidity and Capital Resources. However, our charter and bylaws do not limit the amount or type of indebtedness we can incur, and our board of directors has changed, and has the discretion to deviate from or change at any time in the future, our leverage policy, which could result in an investment portfolio with a different risk profile. We utilize non-recourse facilities on certain types of assets that have significantly higher leverage. On these facilities, the lenders' primary recourse is to the pledged assets and if the value of the pledged assets is below the value of the debt or if we default on a facility, the lender would be able to foreclose on all the pledged assets, which would result in losses and reduce our assets and the cash available for distributions to stockholders./uni00A0We may apply too much leverage to our assets or may employ an inefficient financing strategy to our assets.\n\n## The use of securitizations and special purpose entities would expose us to additional risks.\n\nWe presently hold, and to the extent that we securitize loans in the future, we anticipate that we will often hold the most junior certificates or the residual value associated with a securitization. We may also establish other funds or special purpose entities, where we would hold only a partial or subordinate interest or a residual value after taking into account our non-recourse debt facilities or a right to participate in the profits of such entity once it achieves a predefined threshold. As a holder of the residual value or other such interests, we are more exposed to losses on the underlying collateral because the interest we retain in the securitization vehicle or other entity would be subordinate to the more senior notes or interests issued to investors and we would, therefore, absorb all of the losses, up to the value of our interests, sustained with respect to the underlying assets before the owners of the notes or other interests experience any losses. In addition, the inability to securitize our portfolio or assets within our portfolio could hurt our performance and our ability to grow our business.\n\nWe also use various special purpose entities to own and finance our assets. These subsidiaries incur various types of debt, which can be used to finance one or more of our assets. This debt is typically structured as non-recourse debt, which means it is repayable solely from the revenue from the investment financed by the debt and is secured by the related physical assets, major contracts, cash accounts and in some cases, a pledge of our ownership interests in the subsidiaries involved in the projects. Although this subsidiary debt is typically non-recourse to us, we make certain representations and warranties or enter into certain guaranties of our subsidiary's obligations or covenants to the non-recourse debt holder, the breach of which may require us to make payments to the lender. We may also from time to time determine to provide financial support to the subsidiary in order to maintain rights to the project or otherwise avoid the adverse consequences of a default.",

The loss of our ownership interest in a subsidiary or some or all of a subsidiary's assets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\n\n## Our existing credit facilities and debt contain, and any future financing facilities may contain, covenants that restrict our operations and may inhibit our ability to grow our business and increase revenues.\n\nOur existing credit facilities and debt contain, and any future financing facilities may contain, various affirmative and negative covenants, including maintenance of an interest coverage ratio and limitations on the incurrence of liens and indebtedness, investments, fundamental organizational changes, dispositions, changes in the nature of business, transactions with affiliates, use of proceeds and stock repurchases. In addition, the terms of our non-recourse debt include restrictions and covenants, including limitations on our ability to transfer or incur liens on the assets that secure the debt. For further information see Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources.\n\nThe covenants and restrictions included in our existing financings do, and the covenants and restrictions to be included in any future financings may, restrict our ability to, among other things:\n\n- z incur or guarantee additional debt;\n- z make certain investments, originations or acquisitions;\n- z make distributions on or repurchase or redeem capital stock;\n- z engage in mergers or consolidations;\n- z reduce liquidity below certain levels;\n- z grant liens;\n- z have a tangible net worth below a defined threshold;\n- z incur operating losses for more than a specified period; and\n- z enter into transactions with affiliates.\n\nOur non-recourse debt limits our ability to take action with regard to the assets pledged as security for the debt. These restrictions, as well as any other covenants contained in any future financings, may interfere with our ability to obtain financing, or to engage in other business activities, which may significantly limit or harm our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. Our financing agreements may contain cross-default provisions, so that if a default occurs under any one agreement, the lenders under our other agreements could also declare a default. A default and resulting repayment acceleration could significantly reduce our liquidity, which could require us to sell our assets to repay amounts due and outstanding. This could also significantly harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and our ability to make distributions, which could cause the value of our common stock to decline and adversely affect our ability to qualify, or remain qualified, as a REIT. A default will also significantly limit our financing alternatives such that we will be unable to pursue our leverage strategy, which could curtail the returns on our assets.\n\nIn addition, certain of our financing arrangements contain provisions that provide for a preference in cash flow allocations to the lender from our assets or an acceleration of principal payments owed when certain conditions are present related to the underlying assets that serve as collateral for the financing. These provisions may limit our ability to\n\nobtain distributions from the underlying assets and could impact our cash flow and expected returns.\n\nWe have issued senior unsecured notes which require us to maintain a certain amount of unencumbered assets as a part of our portfolio, as well as to maintain certain debt coverage service ratios in order to issue additional notes. These provisions may limit our ability to leverage certain assets and limit our overall debt levels.\n\n## We will have to pay off the remaining balance or refinance our borrowings when they become due. The failure to be able to pay off the remaining balance or refinance such borrowings or an increase in interest rates of such refinancing could have a material impact on our business.\n\nSome of our borrowings will have a remaining balance when they become due. If our subsidiary is unable to repay or refinance the remaining balance of this debt, or if the terms of any available refinancing are not favorable, we may be forced to liquidate assets or incur higher costs which may significantly harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and our ability to make distributions, which could cause the value of our common stock to decline.\n\n## If a counterparty to repurchase transactions defaults on its obligation to resell the underlying security back to us at the end of the transaction term, or if the value of the underlying security has declined as of the end of that term, or if we default on obligations under the repurchase agreement, we may lose money on repurchase transactions.\n\nIn repurchase transactions, we will generally sell certain of our assets to lenders (i.e., repurchase agreement counterparties) and receive cash from the lenders. The lenders will be obligated to resell the same assets back to us at the end of the term of the transaction. Because the cash we will receive from the lender when we initially sell the assets to the lender is less than its value, if the lender defaults on its obligation to resell the same asset back to us we would incur a loss on the transaction equal to the differential in value at which the lender purchased the asset (assuming there was no other change in value). We would also lose money on a repurchase transaction if the value of the underlying asset has declined as of the end of the transaction term, as we would have to repurchase the assets for their initial value but would receive loans worth less than that amount. We may also be forced to sell assets at significantly depressed prices to meet margin calls, post additional collateral and maintain adequate liquidity, which could cause us to incur losses. Moreover, to the extent we are forced to sell assets at such time, given market conditions, we may be selling at the same time as others facing similar pressures, which could exacerbate a difficult market environment and which could result in our incurring significantly greater losses on our sale of such assets. In an extreme case of market duress, a market may not even be present for certain of our assets at any price. Such a situation would likely result in a rapid deterioration of our financial condition and possibly necessitate a filing for protection under the United States Bankruptcy Code (the 'Bankruptcy Code'). Further, if we default on one of our obligations under a repurchase transaction, the lender will be able to terminate the transaction and cease entering into any other repurchase transactions with us. Our repurchase agreements may contain crossdefault provisions, so that if a default occurs under any one agreement, the lenders under any other of our agreements could also declare a default. If a default occurs under any of our repurchase agreements",

There can be no assurance that we will be successful in entering into such replacement repurchase agreements on the same terms as the repurchase agreements that were terminated or at all. Any losses we incur on our repurchase transactions could adversely affect our earnings and thus our cash available for distribution to our stockholders. In the event of our insolvency or bankruptcy, certain repurchase agreements may qualify for special treatment under the Bankruptcy Code, the effect of which, among other things, would be to allow the lender under the applicable repurchase agreement to avoid the automatic stay provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and to foreclose on the collateral agreement without delay, which could ultimately reduce the amounts we could otherwise recover.\n\n## The expected discontinuance of the London interbank offered rate ('LIBOR') and transition to alternative reference rates may adversely impact our borrowings and assets.\n\nIn July 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates the LIBOR administrator, ICE Benchmark Administration Limited ('IBA') announced that it would cease to compel banks to participate in setting LIBOR as a benchmark by the end of 2021. Such announcement indicates that market participants cannot rely on LIBOR being published after 2021. On December 4, 2020, the IBA published a consultation on its intention to cease the publication of LIBOR. For the most commonly used tenors (overnight and one, three, six and 12 months) of U.S. dollar LIBOR, the IBA is proposing to cease publication immediately after June 30, 2023, anticipating continued rate submissions from panel banks for these tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR. The IBA's consultation also proposes to cease publication of all other U.S. dollar LIBOR tenors, and of all non-U.S. dollar LIBOR rates, after December 31, 2021. The FCA and U.S. bank regulators have welcomed the IBA's proposal to continue publishing certain tenors for U.S. dollar LIBOR through June 30, 2023 because it would allow many legacy U.S. dollar LIBOR contracts that lack effective fallback provisions and are difficult to amend to mature before such LIBOR rates experience disruptions. U.S. bank regulators are, however, encouraging banks to cease entering into new financial contracts that use LIBOR as a reference rate as soon as practicable and in any event by December 31, 2021. Given consumer protection, litigation, and reputation risks, U.S. bank regulators believe entering into new financial contracts that use LIBOR as a reference rate after December 31, 2021 would create safety and soundness risks. In addition, they expect new financial contracts to either utilize a reference rate other than LIBOR or have robust fallback language that includes a clearly defined alternative reference rate after LIBOR's discontinuation. Although the foregoing may provide some sense of timing, there is no assurance that LIBOR, of any particular currency and tenor, will continue to be published or be representative of the underlying market until any particular date, and it appears highly likely that LIBOR will be discontinued or modified after December 31, 2021 or June 30, 2023, depending on the currency and tenor.\n\nThe Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a group of private-market participants convened by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board and the New York Federal Reserve, has recommended the Secured Overnight\n\nFinancing Rate ('SOFR') as a more robust reference rate alternative to U.S. dollar LIBOR. The use of SOFR as a substitute for U.S. dollar LIBOR is voluntary and may not be suitable for all market participants. SOFR is calculated based on overnight transactions under repurchase agreements, backed by Treasury securities. SOFR is observed and backward looking, which stands in contrast with LIBOR under the current methodology, which is an estimated forward-looking rate and relies, to some degree, on the expert judgment of submitting panel members. Given that SOFR is a secured rate backed by government securities, it will be a rate that does not take into account bank credit risk (as is the case with LIBOR). SOFR is therefore likely to be lower than U.S. dollar LIBOR and is less likely to correlate with the funding costs of financial institutions. To approximate economic equivalence to LIBOR, SOFR can be compounded over a relevant term and a spread adjustment may be added. Market practices related to SOFR calculation conventions continue to develop and may vary, and inconsistent calculation conventions may develop among financial products.\n\nThe debt drawn from our credit facilities is linked to U.S. dollar LIBOR. These facilities mature in July 2023. We expect similar financing arrangements, including new debt and interest rate hedge agreements, will be in place at the time at which the IBA ceases to publish LIBOR. It is not possible to predict all consequences of the IBA's proposals to cease publishing LIBOR, any related regulatory actions and the expected discontinuance of the use of LIBOR as a reference rate for financial contracts. Some of our LIBOR linked financing arrangements may not include robust fallback language that would facilitate replacing LIBOR with a clearly defined alternative reference rate after LIBOR's discontinuation, and we may need to amend these before the IBA ceases to publish LIBOR. If such arrangements mature after LIBOR ceases to be published, our counterparties may disagree with us about how to calculate or replace LIBOR. Even when robust fallback language is included, there can be no assurance that the replacement rate plus any spread adjustment will be economically equivalent to LIBOR, which could result in a change in our interest rate. Modifications to any debt or interest rate hedging transactions or other contracts to replace LIBOR with an alternative reference rate could result in adverse tax consequences. In addition, any resulting differences in interest rate standards among our financing arrangements may result in interest rate mismatches between our assets and the borrowings used to fund such assets. Furthermore, the transition away from LIBOR may adversely impact our ability to manage and hedge exposures to fluctuations in interest rates using derivative instruments. There is no guarantee that a transition from LIBOR to alternative reference rates will not result in financial market disruptions, significant increases in benchmark rates, or borrowing costs to borrowers, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and the market price of our common stock.\n\nWe expect LIBOR to be available in substantially its current form until the end of 2021. However, if a significant number of panel banks decline to provide LIBOR submissions to the IBA, it is possible that LIBOR will become unrepresentative of the underlying market and subject to increased volatility prior to such date. Should that occur, the risks associated with the transition to alternative reference rates will be accelerated and magnified.",

        "page_content": "## Risks related to hedging\n\n## We, or the projects in which we invest, enter into hedging transactions that could expose us to contingent liabilities or additional credit risk in the future and adversely impact our financial condition.\n\nSubject to maintaining our qualification as a REIT, part of our strategy, or the strategy of the projects in which we invest, involves entering into hedging transactions that could require us to fund cash payments in certain circumstances (e.g., the early termination of the hedging instrument caused by an event of default or other early termination event, or the decision by a counterparty to request margin it is contractually owed under the terms of the hedging instrument). The amount due would be equal to the unrealized loss of the open swap positions with the respective counterparty and could also include other fees and charges. These economic losses will be reflected in our, or the project's, financial statements, and our, or the project's, ability to fund these obligations will depend on the liquidity of our, or the project's, assets and access to capital at the time, and the need to fund these obligations could adversely impact our financial condition.\n\nIn addition, over-the-counter hedges entered into to hedge interest rates, credit risk or commodity prices involve risk since they often are not traded on regulated exchanges or cleared through a central counterparty. We would remain exposed to our counterparty's ability to perform on its obligations under each hedge and cannot look to the creditworthiness of a central counterparty for performance. As a result, if a hedging counterparty cannot perform under the terms of the hedge, we would not receive payments due under that hedge, we may lose any unrealized gain associated with the hedge and the hedged liability would cease to be hedged. While we would seek to terminate the relevant hedge transaction and may have a claim against the defaulting counterparty for any losses, including unrealized gains, there is no assurance that we would be able to recover such amounts or to replace the relevant hedge on economically viable terms or at all. In such case, we could be forced to cover our unhedged liabilities at the then current market price. We may also be at risk for any collateral we have pledged to secure our obligations under the hedge if the counterparty becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy.\n\nFurthermore, our interest rate swaps and other hedge transactions are subject to increasing statutory and other regulatory requirements and, depending on the identity of the counterparty, applicable international requirements. Recently, new regulations have been promulgated by U.S. and foreign regulators to strengthen the oversight of swaps, and any further actions taken by such regulators could constrain our strategy or increase our costs, either of which could materially and adversely impact our results of operations.\n\nIn addition, the Dodd-Frank Act requires certain derivatives, including certain interest rate swaps, to be executed on a regulated market and cleared through a central counterparty. Unlike over-the-counter swaps, the counterparty for the cleared swaps is the clearing house, which reduces counterparty risk. However, cleared swaps require us to appoint clearing brokers and to post margin in accordance with the clearing house's rules, which has resulted in increased costs for cleared swaps compared to over-the-counter swaps. Our over-\n\nthe-counter hedges with swap dealers became subject to margin regulations promulgated by U.S. regulators on March/uni00A01, 2017, which regulations increased the required margin, and the cost to us of over-the-counter swaps. The margin requirements for both cleared and uncleared swaps also limit eligible margin to cash and specified types of securities, which may further increase the costs of hedging and induce us to change or reduce the use of hedging transactions. The margin regulations generally do not apply to any over-the-counter swaps that were entered into prior to the effective date of such regulations.\n\nIn addition, any mortgage real estate investment trust that trades in swaps may be considered a 'commodity pool,' which would cause its operator to be regulated as a 'commodity pool operator' (a 'CPO'). In December 2012, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ('CFTC'), issued a no-action letter giving relief to operators of mortgage REITs from any applicable CPO registration requirement. In order for us to qualify for the no-action relief, we must, among other non-operation requirements: (1) limit our initial margin and premiums for commodity interests (swaps and exchange-traded derivatives subject to the jurisdiction of the CFTC) to no more than 5% of the fair market value of our total assets; and (2) limit our net income from commodity interests that are not 'qualifying hedging transactions' to less than 5% of its gross income. The need to operate within these parameters could limit the use of swaps and other commodity interests by us below the level that we would otherwise consider optimal or may lead to the registration of our company, our management team or our directors as commodity pool operators, which will subject us to additional regulatory oversight, compliance and costs.\n\nIn addition, the projects in which we invest, may enter into various forms of hedging including interest rate and power price hedging. To the extent they enter into such hedges, the financial results of the project will be exposed to similar risks as described above which could adversely impact our results of operations.\n\n## If we, or our projects, choose not to pursue, or fail to qualify for, hedge accounting treatment, our operating results may be impacted because losses on the derivatives that we enter into may not be offset by a change in the fair value of the related hedged transaction.\n\nWe, or our projects, may choose not to pursue, or fail to qualify for, hedge accounting treatment relating to derivative and hedging transactions. We, or our projects, may fail to qualify for hedge accounting treatment for a number of reasons, including if we, or our projects, use instruments that do not meet the Accounting Standards Codification ('ASC') Topic 815 definition of a derivative, we, or our projects, fail to satisfy ASC Topic 815 hedge documentation and hedge effectiveness assessment requirements or the hedge relationship is not highly effective. If we, or our projects, fail to qualify for, or choose not to pursue, hedge accounting treatment, our, or our projects, operating results may be impacted because losses on the derivatives that we, or our projects, enter into may not be offset by a change in the fair value of the related hedged transaction.",

However, there can be no assurance that an active trading market for our common stock will continue, which could cause our common stock to trade at a discount to historical prices. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the ability of our stockholders to sell their common stock or the price that our stockholders may obtain for their common stock. Some of the factors that could negatively affect the market price of our common stock include:\n\n- z our actual or projected operating results, financial condition, cash flows and liquidity or changes in business strategy or prospects;\n- z changes in the mix of our investment products and services, including the level of securitizations or fee income in any quarter;\n- z actual or perceived conflicts of interest with individuals, including our executives;\n- z our ability to arrange financing for projects;\n- z equity issuances by us, or share resales by our stockholders, or the perception that such issuances or resales may occur;\n- z seasonality in construction and demand for our investments;\n- z actual or anticipated accounting problems;\n- z publication of research reports about us or the sustainable infrastructure industry;\n- z changes in market valuations of similar companies;\n- z adverse market reaction to any increased indebtedness we may incur in the future;\n- z commodity price changes;\n- z interest rate changes;\n- z additions to or departures of our key personnel;\n- z speculation or negative publicity in the press or investment community;\n- z our failure to meet, or the lowering of, our earnings estimates or those of any securities analysts;\n- z increases in market interest rates, which may lead investors to demand a higher distribution yield for our common stock, and would result in increased interest expenses on certain of our debt;\n- z changes in governmental policies, regulations or laws;\n- z failure to qualify, or maintain our qualification, as a REIT or failure to maintain our exemption from registration as an investment company under the 1940 Act;\n- z price and volume fluctuations in the stock market generally; and\n- z general market and economic conditions, including the current state of the credit and capital markets.\n\nMarket factors unrelated to our performance could also negatively impact the market price of our common stock. One of the factors that investors may consider in deciding whether to buy or sell our common stock is our distribution rate as a percentage of our stock price relative\n\nto market interest rates. If market interest rates increase, prospective investors may demand a higher distribution rate or seek alternative investments paying higher dividends or interest. As a result, interest rate fluctuations and conditions in capital markets can affect the market value of our common stock.\n\n## Common stock and preferred stock eligible for future sale may have adverse effects on our share price.\n\nSubject to applicable law, our board of directors, without stockholder approval, may authorize us to issue additional authorized and unissued shares of common stock and preferred stock on the terms and for the consideration it deems appropriate.\n\nWe cannot predict the effect, if any, of future sales of our common stock or the availability of shares for future sales, on the market price of our common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of common stock or the perception that such sales could occur may adversely affect the prevailing market price for our common stock.\n\nWe cannot assure you of our ability to make distributions in the future. If our portfolio of assets fails to generate sufficient income and cash flow, we could be required to sell assets, borrow funds, raise additional equity or make a portion of our distributions in the form of a taxable stock distribution or distribution of debt securities.\n\nWe are generally required to distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains) each year for us to qualify, and maintain our qualification, as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the 'Internal Revenue Code'). Our current policy is to pay quarterly distributions, which on an annual basis is expected to equal or substantially exceed 90% or more of our REIT taxable income. In the event that our board of directors authorizes distributions in excess of the income or cash flow generated from our assets, we may make such distributions from the proceeds of future offerings of equity or debt securities or other forms of debt financing or the sale of assets.\n\nOur ability to make distributions may be adversely affected by a number of factors. Therefore, although we anticipate making quarterly distributions to our stockholders, our board of directors has the sole discretion to determine the timing, form and amount of any distributions to our stockholders. If our portfolio of assets fails to generate sufficient income and cash flow, we could be required to sell assets, borrow funds, raise additional equity or make a portion of our distributions in the form of a taxable stock distribution or distribution of debt securities. To the extent that we are required to sell assets in adverse market conditions or borrow funds at unfavorable rates, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If we raise additional equity, our stock price could be materially and adversely affected. Our board of directors will make determinations regarding distributions based upon various factors, including our earnings, our financial condition, our liquidity, our debt covenants, maintenance of our REIT qualification, applicable provisions of the MGCL and other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant from time to time.",

Notwithstanding these agreements, there can be no assurance that any or all members of our senior management team will remain employed by us. We do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our officers other than two policies we maintain for Mr./uni00A0Eckel under which we are a beneficiary in the amount of approximately $500/uni00A0thousand. The loss of services of one or more members of our senior management team could harm our business and our prospects.\n\n## Conflicts of interest could arise as a result of our structure.\n\nConflicts of interest could arise in the future as a result of the relationships between us and our affiliates, on the one hand, and our Operating Partnership or any partner thereof, on the other. Our directors and officers have duties to our company under applicable Maryland law in connection with our management. Our duties, as the general partner, to our Operating Partnership and our partners may come into conflict with the duties of our directors and officers to us.\n\nUnder Delaware law, a general partner of a Delaware limited partnership owes its limited partners the duties of good faith and fair dealing. Other duties, including fiduciary duties, may be modified or eliminated in the partnership's partnership agreement, except that conflict of interest transactions may still run afoul of implied contractual standards under Delaware law. The partnership agreement of our Operating Partnership provides that, for so long as we own a controlling interest in our Operating Partnership, any conflict that\n\ngain income recognized by us or may constitute a return of capital to the extent that they exceed our earnings and profits as determined for tax purposes. A return of capital is not taxable income but has the effect of reducing the basis of a stockholder's investment in shares of our common stock.\n\n## Future offerings of debt or equity securities, which may rank senior to our common stock, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\n\nOur present debt ranks, and any future debt would rank, senior to our common stock. Such debt is, and likely will be, governed by a loan agreement, an indenture or other instrument containing covenants restricting our operating flexibility. Additionally, our convertible securities, and any equity securities or convertible or exchangeable securities that we issue in the future may have rights, preferences and privileges more favorable than those of our common stock and may result in dilution to owners of our common stock. We and, indirectly, our stockholders will bear the cost of issuing and servicing such debt or securities. Because our decision to issue debt or equity securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. Thus, holders of our common stock will bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of our common stock and diluting the value of their stock holdings in us.\n\ncannot be resolved in a manner not adverse to either our stockholders or the limited partners will be resolved in favor of our stockholders. We have not obtained an opinion of counsel covering the provisions set forth in the partnership agreement of our Operating Partnership that purport to waive or restrict our fiduciary duties that would be in effect under common law were it not for the partnership agreement of our Operating Partnership.\n\nAdditionally, the partnership agreement of our Operating Partnership expressly limits our liability by providing that neither we, as the general partner of the Operating Partnership, nor any of our directors or officers, will be liable or accountable in damages to our Operating Partnership, its limited partners or their assignees for errors in judgment, mistakes of fact or law or for any act or omission if the general partner, director or officer, acted in good faith.

We are subject to the 'business combination' provisions of the MGCL that, subject to limitations, prohibit certain business combinations between us and an 'interested stockholder' (defined generally as any person who beneficially owns 10% or more of our then outstanding voting stock or an affiliate or associate of ours who, at any time within the two-year period prior to the date in question, was the beneficial owner of 10% or more of our then outstanding voting stock) or an affiliate thereof for five years after the most recent date on which the stockholder becomes an interested stockholder and, thereafter, impose fair price and/or supermajority stockholder voting requirements on these combinations.\n\nThe 'control share' provisions of the MGCL provide that, subject to certain exemptions, a holder of 'control shares' of a Maryland corporation (defined as shares which, when aggregated with all other shares controlled by the stockholder (except solely by virtue of a revocable proxy), entitle the stockholder to exercise one of three increasing ranges of voting power in electing directors) acquired in a 'control share acquisition' (defined as the direct or indirect acquisition of ownership or control of issued and outstanding 'control shares') has no voting rights with respect to such shares except to the extent approved by our stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least two thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter, excluding votes entitled to be cast by the acquirer of control shares, our officers and our directors who are also our employees.\n\nThe 'unsolicited takeover' provisions of Title 3, Subtitle 8 of the MGCL permit our board of directors, without stockholder approval and regardless of what is currently provided in our charter or bylaws, to implement certain takeover defenses, some of which (for example, a classified board) we do not yet have.\n\nAs permitted by the MGCL, our board of directors has by resolution exempted from the 'business combination' provision of the MGC business combinations (1) between us and any other person, provided, that such business combination is first approved by our board of directors (including a majority of our directors who are not affiliates or associates of such person), (2) the Predecessor and its affiliates and associates as part of our formation transactions and (3) persons acting in concert with any of the foregoing. Our bylaws contain a provision exempting from the control share acquisition statute any and all acquisitions by any person of shares of our stock. There can be no assurance that our board of directors will not amend or revoke the exemption at any time.\n\n## Our authorized but unissued shares of common and preferred stock may prevent a change in our control.\n\nOur charter permits our board of directors to authorize us to issue additional shares of our authorized but unissued common or preferred stock. In addition, our board of directors may, without common stockholder approval, amend our charter to increase the aggregate number of our shares of stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series that we have the authority to issue and classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common or preferred stock and set the terms of the classified or reclassified shares. As a result, our board\n\nof directors may establish a series of common or preferred stock that could delay or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for shares of our common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders.\n\n## Our rights and the rights of our stockholders to take action against our directors and officers are limited, which could limit stockholder recourse in the event of actions not in our stockholders' best interests.\n\nOur charter eliminates the liability of our present and former directors and officers to us and our stockholders for money damages to the maximum extent permitted under Maryland law.\n\nOur charter authorizes us, and our bylaws and indemnification agreements entered into with each of our directors and executive officers require us, to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law, to indemnify and, without requiring a preliminary determination of their ultimate entitlement to indemnification, to pay or reimburse defense costs and other expenses of each of our directors and officers in the defense of any proceeding to which he or she is made, or threatened to be made, a party or witness by reason of his or her service to us.\n\n## Our charter contains provisions that make removal of our directors difficult, which could make it difficult for our stockholders to effect changes to our management.\n\nOur charter provides that, subject to the rights of holders of any series of preferred stock, a director may be removed with or without cause upon the affirmative vote of holders of at least two thirds of the votes entitled to be cast generally in the election of directors. Vacancies may be filled only by a majority of the remaining directors in office, even if less than a quorum. These requirements make it more difficult to change our management by removing and replacing directors and may prevent a change in control of our company that is in the best interests of our stockholders.\n\n## Ownership limitations may restrict change of control or business combination opportunities in which our stockholders might receive a premium for their shares.\n\nIn order for us to qualify as a REIT for each taxable year after 2013, no more than 50% in value of our outstanding capital stock may be owned, directly or constructively, by five or fewer individuals during the last half of any calendar year, and at least 100 persons must beneficially own our stock during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months, or during a proportionate portion of a shorter taxable year. 'Individuals' for this purpose include natural persons, private foundations, some employee benefit plans and trusts, and some charitable trusts. To assist us in preserving our REIT qualification, among other purposes, our charter generally prohibits any person from directly or indirectly owning more than 9.8% in value or in number of shares, whichever is more restrictive, of the aggregate outstanding shares of our capital stock, the outstanding shares of any class or series of our preferred stock or the outstanding shares of our common stock. These ownership limits could have the effect of discouraging a takeover or other transaction in which holders of our common stock might receive a premium for their shares over the then prevailing market price or which holders might believe to be otherwise in their best interests. Our board of directors has established exemptions from these ownership limits that permit certain institutional investors and their clients to hold shares of our common stock in excess of these ownership limits.\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## Risks related to our taxation as a REIT\n\nQualifying as a REIT involves highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, and our failure to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT would subject us to U.S. federal income tax and applicable state and local tax, which would negatively impact the results of our operations and reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders.\n\nWe elected and qualified as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ended December/uni00A031, 2013. The U.S. federal income tax laws governing REITs are complex, and judicial and administrative interpretations of the U.S. federal income tax laws governing REIT qualification are limited. To qualify as a REIT and remain so qualified, we must meet, on an ongoing basis through actual operating results, various tests regarding the nature and diversification of our assets and our income, the ownership of our outstanding shares, and the amount of our distributions. Even a technical or inadvertent violation could jeopardize our REIT qualification. Our ability to satisfy the asset tests depends upon our analysis of the characterization and fair market values of our assets, some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination, and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals.\n\nWe received a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service ('IRS'), which we refer to as the Ruling, relating to our ability to treat certain of our assets as qualifying REIT assets. We are entitled to rely on this Ruling for those assets which fit within the scope of the Ruling only to the extent that we have the legal and contractual rights described therein, we continue to operate in accordance with the relevant facts described in the ruling request we submitted, that such facts were accurately presented and to the extent such ruling is not inconsistent with the Real Property Regulations (as discussed in more detail below). As a result, no assurance can be given that we will always be able to rely on this Ruling.\n\nIn August of 2016, the Treasury Department and the IRS published regulations which we refer to as the Real Property Regulations relating to the definition of 'real property' for purposes of the REIT income and asset tests which apply to us with respect to our taxable years beginning after December/uni00A031, 2016. Among other things, the Real Property Regulations provide that an obligation secured by a structural component of a building or other inherently permanent structure qualifies as a real estate asset for REIT qualification purposes only if such obligation is also secured by a real property interest in the inherently permanent structure served by such structural component. This aspect of the Real Property Regulations has important implications for our qualification as a REIT since a significant portion of our REIT qualifying assets consists of receivables that are secured by liens on installed structural improvements designed to improve the energy efficiency of buildings and a significant portion of our REIT qualifying gross income is interest income earned with respect to such receivables.\n\nThe structural improvements securing our receivables generally qualify as 'fixtures' under local real property law, as well as under the Uniform Commercial Code, or the UCC, which governs rights and obligations of parties in secured transactions. Although not controlling for REIT purposes, the general rule in the United States is that once improvements are permanently installed in real properties, such improvements become fixtures and thus take on the character of and are considered to be real property for certain state and local law\n\npurposes. In general, in the United States, laws governing fixtures, including the UCC and real property law, afford lenders who have secured their financings with security interests in fixtures with rights that extend not just to the fixtures that secure their financings, but also to the real properties in which such fixtures have been installed. By way of example only, Section/uni00A09-604(b) of the UCC, which has been adopted in all but two states in the United States, permits a lender secured by fixtures, upon a default, to enforce its rights under the UCC or under applicable real property laws. Although there is limited authority directly on point, given the nature of, and the extent to which, the structural improvements securing our receivables are integrated into and serve the related buildings, we believe that the better view is that the nature and scope of our rights in such buildings that inure to us as a result of our receivables are sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the Real Property Regulations described above. In addition to the limited authority directly on point, two other important caveats apply in this regard. First, the Real Property Regulations do not define what is required for an obligation secured by a lien on a structural component to also be secured by a real property interest in the building served by such structural component. However, the initial proposed version of the Real Property Regulations, which never became effective, included a requirement that the interest in the real property held by a REIT be 'equivalent' to the interest in a structural component held by the REIT in order for the structural component to be treated as a real estate asset. This requirement was ultimately not included in the final Real Property Regulations, in part in response to comments that such requirement may negatively affect investment in energy efficiency and renewable energy assets. We believe the deletion of this requirement implies that under the final Real Property Regulations, our rights in the building need not be equivalent to our rights in the structural components serving the building. Second, real property law is typically relegated to the states and the specific rights available to any lien or mortgage holder, including our rights as a fixture lien holder described above, may vary between jurisdictions as a result of a range of factors, including the specific local real property law requirements and judicial and regulatory interpretations of such laws, and the competing rights of mortgage and other lenders. We have applied the analysis described above in a number of states that have adopted Section 9-604(b) of the UCC. In addition, in states where Section 9-604(b) of the UCC has not been adopted, we apply the analysis described above based on the application of the local real property laws of that state to the extent that we have received advice from counsel in those jurisdictions that local real property law provides us with appropriate rights to the buildings in which the structural improvements securing our receivables have been installed. Furthermore, we have applied the analysis described above to certain receivables secured by liens on structural improvements installed in buildings located in certain U.S. installations outside of the United States, based on our view that such installations are subject to U.S. sovereignty and as a result the UCC applies in such installations. While a number of cases have addressed the rights of fixture lien holders generally, there are limited judicial interpretations in only a few jurisdictions that directly address the rights and remedies available to a fixture lien holder in the real property in which the fixtures have been installed. Such rights have been addressed in some cases which support our position and, in factual circumstances distinguishable from our own, in some cases where the courts have found these rights to be more limited. The resolution of these issues in many jurisdictions",

        "page_content": "therefore remains uncertain. As a result of the foregoing, no assurance can be given that the IRS will not challenge our position that our receivables meet the requirements of the Real Property Regulations or that, if challenged, such position would be sustained.\n\nThe preamble to the Real Property Regulations provides that, to the extent a private letter ruling issued prior to the issuance of the Real Property Regulations is inconsistent with the Real Property Regulations, the private letter ruling is revoked prospectively from the applicability date of the Real Property Regulations. We do not believe that the Ruling is inconsistent with the Real Property Regulations because we believe the analysis in the Ruling was based on similar principles as the relevant portions of the Real Property Regulations, and accordingly we do not believe that the Real Property Regulations impact our ability to rely on the Ruling. However, no assurance can be given that the IRS would not successfully assert that we are not permitted to rely on the Ruling because the Ruling has been revoked by the Real Property Regulations.\n\nIf the IRS were to assert that a significant portion of our receivables do not qualify as real estate assets and do not generate income treated as interest income from mortgages on real property, we would fail to satisfy both the gross income requirements and asset requirements applicable to REITs. If this were to occur, we would be required to restructure the manner in which we receive such income and we may realize significant income that does not qualify for the REIT 75% gross income test, which could cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT.\n\nIn addition, our compliance with the REIT income and quarterly asset requirements also depends upon our ability to successfully manage the composition of our income and assets on an ongoing basis in accordance with existing REIT regulations and rules and interpretations thereof. Moreover, the IRS, new legislation, court decisions or other administrative guidance, in each case possibly with retroactive effect, may make it more difficult or impossible for us to qualify as a REIT. Our ability to satisfy the requirements to qualify as a REIT also depends in part on the actions of third parties over which we have no control or only limited influence, including in cases where we own an equity interest in an entity that is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Thus, given the highly complex nature of the rules governing REITs, the ongoing importance of factual determinations, and the possibility of future changes in our circumstances, no assurance can be given that we will so qualify for any particular year.\n\nIf we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, and we do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, we would be required to pay U.S. federal income tax on our net taxable income, and distributions to our stockholders would not be deductible by us in determining our taxable income. In such a case, we might need to borrow money or sell assets in order to pay our taxes. Our payment of income tax would negatively impact the results of our operations and decrease the amount of our income available for distribution to our stockholders. Furthermore, if we fail to maintain our qualification as a REIT, we no longer would be required to distribute substantially all of our taxable income to our stockholders, which would leave our board of directors with more discretion over our future distribution levels. In addition, unless we were eligible for certain statutory relief provisions, we could not re-elect to qualify as a REIT for the subsequent four taxable years following the year in which we failed to qualify.\n\n## Complying with REIT requirements may force us to liquidate or forego otherwise attractive investments.\n\nTo qualify as a REIT, we must ensure that we meet the REIT gross income tests annually and that, at the end of each calendar quarter, at least 75% of the value of our total assets consists of cash, cash items, government securities, shares in REITs and other qualifying real estate assets. The remainder of our investment in securities (other than government securities and REIT qualified real estate assets) generally cannot include more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer or more than 10% of the total value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer. In addition, in general, no more than 5% of the value of our total assets (other than government securities, securities of a taxable REIT subsidiary (a 'TRS') and securities that are qualifying real estate assets) can consist of the securities of any one issuer, no more than 20% of the value of our total assets can be represented by securities of one or more TRSs, and no more than 25% of the value of our assets can consist of debt instruments issued by publicly offered REITs that are not otherwise secured by real property. If we fail to comply with these requirements at the end of any calendar quarter, we must correct the failure within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provisions to avoid losing our REIT qualification and suffering adverse tax consequences. As a result, we may be required to liquidate from our portfolio, or contribute to a TRS, otherwise attractive investments, and may be unable to pursue investments that would be otherwise advantageous to us in order to satisfy the source of income or asset diversification requirements for qualifying as a REIT. These actions could have the effect of reducing our income and amounts available for distribution to our stockholders.\n\n## REIT distribution requirements could adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan and may require us to incur debt or sell assets to make such distributions.\n\nIn order to qualify as a REIT, we must distribute to our stockholders, each calendar year, at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (including certain items of non-cash income), determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gain. To the extent that we satisfy the 90% distribution requirement, but distribute less than 100% of our REIT taxable income, we will be subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on our undistributed income. In addition, we will incur a 4% non-deductible excise tax on the amount, if any, by which our distributions in any calendar year are less than a minimum amount specified under U.S. federal income tax laws. We intend to distribute our taxable income to our stockholders in a manner intended to satisfy the REIT 90% distribution requirement and to avoid the 4% non-deductible excise tax.\n\nIn addition, differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income, our GAAP income and the actual receipt of cash may occur. For example, we may be required to accrue interest and discount income on debt securities or interests in debt securities before we receive any payments of interest or principal on such assets, and there may be timing differences in the accrual of such interest and discount income for tax purposes and for GAAP purposes.\n\nAs a result of the foregoing, we may generate less cash flow than taxable income in a particular year and find it difficult or impossible to",

        "page_content": "meet the REIT distribution requirements in certain circumstances. In such circumstances, we may be required to: (i)/uni00A0sell assets in adverse market conditions, (ii)/uni00A0raise debt or equity on unfavorable terms, (iii)/uni00A0distribute amounts that would otherwise be invested in future acquisitions, capital expenditures or repayment of debt, (iv)/uni00A0make a taxable distribution of our shares as part of a distribution in which stockholders may elect to receive shares or (subject to a limit measured as a percentage of the total distribution) cash or (v)/uni00A0use cash reserves, in order to comply with the REIT distribution requirements and to avoid U.S. federal corporate income tax and the 4% non-deductible excise tax. Thus, compliance with the REIT distribution requirements may hinder our ability to grow, which could adversely affect the value of our common stock.\n\n## Even though we qualify as a REIT, we may face tax liabilities that reduce our cash flow.\n\nEven though we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to certain U.S. federal, state and local taxes on our income and assets, including taxes on any undistributed income, tax on income from some activities conducted as a result of a foreclosure, and state or local income, franchise, property and transfer taxes, including mortgage recording taxes. In addition, any TRSs we own will be subject to U.S. federal, state and local corporate income or franchise taxes. In order to meet the REIT qualification requirements, or to avoid the imposition of a 100% tax that applies to certain gains derived by a REIT from sales of inventory or property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business, we may hold some of our assets through TRSs. Any taxes paid by such TRSs would decrease the cash available for distribution to our stockholders.\n\n## The failure of assets subject to a repurchase agreement to be considered owned by us or mezzanine loans or other assets to qualify as real estate assets may adversely affect our ability to qualify as a REIT.\n\nWe may enter into repurchase agreements under which we will nominally sell certain of our assets to a counterparty and simultaneously enter into an agreement to repurchase the sold assets. We believe that we will be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as the owner of the assets that are the subject of any such agreements and that the repurchase agreements will be treated as secured lending transactions notwithstanding that such agreements may transfer record ownership of the assets to the counterparty during the term of the agreement. It is possible, however, that the IRS could assert that we did not own the assets during the term of the repurchase agreement, in which case our REIT asset test could be adversely affected.\n\nIn addition, we may acquire mezzanine loans, which are loans secured by equity interests in a partnership or limited liability company that directly or indirectly owns real property. In IRS Revenue Procedure 2003-65, the IRS provided a safe harbor pursuant to which a mezzanine loan, if it meets each of the requirements contained in the Revenue Procedure, will be treated by the IRS as a real estate asset for purposes of the REIT asset tests, and interest derived from the mezzanine loan will be treated as qualifying mortgage interest for purposes of the REIT 75% gross income test. Although IRS Revenue Procedure 2003-65 provides a safe harbor on which taxpayers may rely, it does not prescribe rules of substantive tax law. We may acquire mezzanine loans that may not meet all of the requirements for reliance on this safe harbor. In the event we own a mezzanine loan that does not meet the safe harbor, the IRS could challenge such loan's treatment as a real estate asset for purposes of the REIT asset and\n\nincome tests, and if such a challenge were sustained, we could fail to qualify as a REIT. Further, we invest in assets such as C-PACE bonds and assessments, which we believe are secured by real property for purposes of the REIT income and asset tests but with respect to which no authority is directly on point. If the IRS were to successfully assert that such C-PACE assets are not qualifying assets for purposes of the REIT gross asset tests or do not generate qualifying income for purposes of the 75% gross income test, our REIT qualification could be adversely affected.\n\n## We may be required to report taxable income for certain investments in excess of the economic income we ultimately realize from them.\n\nTo the extent we acquire debt investments in the secondary market for less than their face amount, the amount of such discount will generally be treated as 'market discount' for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Market discount is generally accrued on the basis of a constant yield to maturity of a debt investment. Accrued market discount is reported as income when, and to the extent that, any payment of principal of the debt instrument is made, unless we elect to include accrued market discount in income as it accrues. Principal payments on certain loans are made monthly, and consequently accrued market discount may have to be included in income each month as if the debt investment was assured of ultimately being collected in full. If we collect less on the debt investment than our purchase price plus the market discount we had previously reported as income, we may not be able to benefit from any offsetting loss deductions.\n\nSimilarly, some of the debt investments that we acquire may have been issued with an original issue discount. We will generally be required to report such original issue discount based on a constant yield method and will be taxed based on the assumption that all future projected payments due on such debt investments will be made. If such debt investments turn out not to be fully collectible, an offsetting loss deduction will become available only in the later year that uncollectability is provable. In addition, in the event that any debt investments acquired by us are delinquent as to mandatory principal and interest payments, or in the event payments with respect to a particular debt investment are not made when due, we may nonetheless be required to continue to recognize the unpaid interest as taxable income as it accrues, despite doubt as to its ultimate collectability. While we would in general ultimately have an offsetting loss deduction available to us when such interest was determined to be uncollectible, the utility of that deduction could depend on our having taxable income in that later year or thereafter. Although we do not presently intend to, we may, in the future, acquire debt investments that are subsequently modified by agreement with the borrower. If such amendments are 'significant modifications' under the applicable Treasury Regulations, we may be required to recognize taxable income as a result of such amendments. Finally, we may be required under the terms of indebtedness that we incur with private lenders to use cash received from interest payments to make principal payments on that indebtedness, with the effect of recognizing income but not having a corresponding amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders.\n\nPublic law no. 115-97, signed into law on December 22, 2017 and commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 ('TCJA') implements various changes to the U.S. federal income tax laws that impacts the taxation of us and our shareholders. Among these changes, the TCJA may accelerate our accrual for U.S. federal",

        "page_content": "income tax purposes of certain items of income to the extent that we would otherwise recognize such items of income for U.S. federal income tax purposes later than we would report such items on our financial statements. This provision of the TCJA could increase our taxable income in certain taxable years, which could impact our ability to satisfy the REIT distribution requirements.\n\nThe interest apportionment rules under Treasury Regulation Section/uni00A01.856-5(c) provide that, if a loan is secured by both real property and other property, a REIT is required to apportion its annual interest income to the real property securing the loan based on a fraction, the numerator of which is the value of such real property, determined when the REIT commits to acquire the loan, and the denominator of which is the highest 'principal amount' of the loan during the year. If a mortgage loan is secured by both real property and personal property and the value of the personal property does not exceed 15% of the aggregate value of the property securing the mortgage loan, the mortgage loan is treated as secured solely by real property for this purpose. IRS Revenue Procedure 2014-51 interprets the 'principal amount' of the loan to be the face amount of the loan, despite the Internal Revenue Code requiring taxpayers to treat any market discount, that is the difference between the purchase price of the loan and its face amount, for all purposes (other than certain withholding and information reporting purposes) as interest rather than principal. The interest apportionment regulations apply only if the loan in question is secured by both real property and other property and the value of personal property securing the mortgage exceeds 15% of the aggregate value of the property securing the mortgage.\n\nIf the IRS were to assert successfully that our loans were secured by property other than real estate, the interest apportionment rules applied for purposes of our REIT testing, and that the position taken in IRS Revenue Procedure 2014-51 should be applied to certain loans in our portfolio, then depending upon the value of the real property securing our loans and their face amount, and the sources of our gross income generally, we may fail to meet the 75% REIT gross income test. If we do not meet this test, we could potentially lose our REIT qualification or be required to pay a penalty to the IRS.\n\n## The 'taxable mortgage pool' rules may increase the taxes that we or our stockholders may incur and may limit the way we effect future securitizations.\n\nSecuritizations by us or our subsidiaries could result in the creation of taxable mortgage pools for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, we could have 'excess inclusion income.' Certain categories of stockholders, such as non-U.S. stockholders eligible for treaty or other benefits, U.S. stockholders with net operating losses, and certain U.S. tax-exempt stockholders that are subject to unrelated business income tax, could be subject to increased taxes on a portion of their dividend income from us that is attributable to any such excess inclusion income. In the case of a stockholder that is a REIT, a regulated investment company (a 'RIC'), common trust fund or other pass-through entity, our allocable share of our excess inclusion income could be considered excess inclusion income of such entity. In addition, to the extent that our common stock is owned by U.S. tax-exempt 'disqualified organizations,' such as certain government-related entities and charitable remainder trusts that are not subject to tax on unrelated business income, we may incur a corporate level tax on a portion of any excess inclusion income. Because this tax generally would be imposed on us, all of our stockholders, including stockholders that\n\nare not disqualified organizations, generally will bear a portion of the tax cost associated with the classification of us or a portion of our assets as a taxable mortgage pool. A RIC, or other pass-through entity owning our common stock in record name will be subject to tax at the highest U.S. federal corporate income tax rate on any excess inclusion income allocated to their owners that are disqualified organizations. Moreover, we could face limitations in selling equity interests in these securitizations to outside investors, or selling any debt securities issued in connection with these securitizations that might be considered to be equity interests for tax purposes. Finally, if we were to fail to qualify as a REIT, any taxable mortgage pool securitizations would be treated as separate taxable corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes that could not be included in any consolidated U.S. federal corporate income tax return. These limitations may prevent us from using certain techniques to maximize our returns from securitization transactions.\n\n## Although our use of TRSs may be able to partially mitigate the impact of meeting the requirements necessary to maintain our qualification as a REIT, our ownership of and relationship with our TRSs is limited and a failure to comply with the limits would jeopardize our REIT qualification and may result in the application of a 100% excise tax.\n\nA REIT may own up to 100% of the stock of one or more TRSs. Subject to certain exemptions, a TRS may hold assets and earn income that would not be qualifying assets or income if held or earned directly by a REIT. Both the subsidiary and the REIT must jointly elect to treat the subsidiary as a TRS. A corporation of which a TRS directly or indirectly owns more than 35% of the voting power or value of the stock will automatically be treated as a TRS. The TRS rules limit the deductibility of interest paid or accrued by a TRS to its parent REIT to assure that the TRS is subject to an appropriate level of corporate taxation. The rules also impose a 100% excise tax on certain transactions between a TRS and its parent REIT that are not conducted on an arm's-length basis. Our TRSs will pay U.S. federal, state and local income or franchise tax on their taxable income, and their after-tax net income will be available for distribution to us but will not be required to be distributed to us, unless necessary to maintain our REIT qualification.\n\nOverall, no more than 20% of the value of a REIT's total assets may consist of stock or securities of one or more TRSs. In order to satisfy the TRS limitation, we may make loans to our TRSs that meet the requirements to be treated as qualifying investments of new capital, which are generally treated as real estate assets under the Internal Revenue Code. Because such loans are treated as real estate assets for purposes of the REIT requirements, we do not treat these loans as TRS securities for purposes of the TRS asset limitation, which is consistent with private rulings issued by the IRS. However, no assurance can be provided that the IRS may not successfully assert that such loans should be treated as securities of our TRSs, which could adversely impact our qualification as a REIT. In addition, our TRSs have obtained financing in transactions in which we and our other subsidiaries have provided guaranties and similar credit support. Although we believe that these financings are properly treated as financings of our TRSs for U.S. federal income tax purposes, no assurance can be provided that the IRS would not assert that such financings should be treated as issued by other entities in our structure, which could impact our compliance with the TRS limitation and the other REIT requirements. While we will be monitoring the aggregate value of the securities of our TRSs and intend to conduct our affairs so that such securities will",

In general, prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of property, other than foreclosure property, but including loans, held as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business. We might be subject to this tax if we were to sell or securitize loans in a manner that was treated as a sale of the loans as inventory for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Therefore, in order to avoid the prohibited transactions tax, we may choose not to engage in certain sales of loans, other than through a TRS, and we may be required to limit the structures we use for our securitization transactions, even though such sales or structures might otherwise be beneficial for us.\n\n## Complying with REIT requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively.\n\nThe REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code may limit our ability to hedge our assets and operations. Under these provisions, any income that we generate from transactions intended to hedge our interest rate exposure will be excluded from gross income for purposes of the REIT 75% and 95% gross income tests if (i)/uni00A0the instrument (A)/uni00A0hedges interest rate risk on liabilities used to carry or acquire real estate assets or certain other specified types of risk, or (B)/uni00A0hedges an instrument described in clause (A)/uni00A0for a period following the extinguishment of the liability or the disposition of the asset that was previously hedged by the hedged instrument, and (ii)/uni00A0such instrument is properly identified under applicable Treasury Regulations. Income from hedging transactions that do not meet these requirements will generally constitute non-qualifying income for purposes of both the REIT 75% and 95% gross income tests.

In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China. COVID-19 has since spread to over 100 countries, including the United States. COVID-19 has also spread to every state in the United States and in regions where we have our executive offices and principal operations, and in regions where our projects and other investments are located or where they are managed. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, and on\n\nsubject to tax on gains or the limits on our use of hedging techniques could expose us to greater risks associated with changes in interest rates than we would otherwise want to bear.

No assurance can be given as to whether, when, or in what form, the U.S. federal income tax laws applicable to us and our stockholders may be enacted. Changes to the U.S. federal income tax laws and interpretations of U.S. federal tax laws could adversely affect an investment in our common stock.\n\nThe TCJA, which was signed into law on December/uni00A022, 2017, significantly changes U.S. federal income tax laws applicable to businesses and their owners, including REITs and their stockholders, and may lessen the relative competitive advantage of operating as a REIT rather than as a C corporation.\n\n## Liquidation of our assets may jeopardize our REIT qualification.\n\nTo qualify as a REIT, we must comply with requirements regarding our assets and our sources of income. If we are compelled to liquidate our assets to repay obligations to our lenders, we may be unable to comply with these requirements, thereby jeopardizing our qualification as a REIT, or we may be subject to a 100% tax on any resultant gain if we sell assets that are treated as inventory or property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business.\n\n## Your investment has various U.S. federal income tax risks.\n\nWe urge you to consult your tax advisor concerning the effects of U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax laws to you regarding an investment in shares of our common stock.\n\nMarch 13, 2020, the United States declared a national emergency with respect to COVID-19. Since March 13, 2020, there have been a number of federal, state and local government initiatives to manage the spread of the virus and its impact on the economy, financial markets and continuity of businesses of all sizes and industries.\n\nThe impact and duration of COVID-19 or another pandemic, is having and could in the future have significant repercussions across regional, national and global economies and financial markets, and could trigger a period of regional, national and global economic slowdown or regional, national or global recessions. The outbreak of COVID-19 in many countries continues to adversely impact regional, national and global economic activity and has contributed to significant volatility and negative pressure in financial markets. The impact of the outbreak has been rapidly evolving and, as cases of the virus have continued to increase around the world, many countries, including the United States,",

While some of these restrictions have been relaxed or phased out, many of these or similar restrictions remain in place, continue to be implemented, or additional restrictions are being considered. Although, in certain cases, exceptions may be available for certain essential operations and businesses which generally include the renewable energy projects in which we invest, there is no assurance that such exceptions will enable us to avoid adverse effects to our results of operations and business. Further, such actions create disruption in energy efficiency, renewable energy, real estate and other sustainable infrastructure markets and adversely impact a number of industries.\n\nWe believe that our ability to operate and our level of business activity has been, and will in all likelihood continue to be, impacted by effects of COVID-19 and could in the future be impacted by another pandemic and that such impacts could adversely affect the profitability of our business, as well as the values of, and the cash flows from, the assets we own. For example, the effects of COVID-19 or another pandemic could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations due to, among other factors:\n\n- z interrupted service and availability of personnel, including our executive officers and other employees that are part of our management team and an inability to recruit, attract and retain skilled personnel-to the extent our management or personnel are impacted by the outbreak of pandemic or epidemic disease and are not available or allowed to conduct work, our business and operating results may be negatively impacted;\n- z difficulty accessing debt and equity capital on attractive terms, or at all, and severe disruption or instability in the global financial markets or deterioration in credit and financing conditions may affect our ability or the ability of our sustainable infrastructure projects and our ultimate off-taker or project users to make regular payments of principal, interest or project revenue (e.g., due to unemployment, underemployment, or reduced income or revenues) or to access savings or capital necessary to fund business operations or replace or renew maturing liabilities on a timely basis, and may adversely affect the valuation of financial assets and liabilities, any of which could result in the inability to make payments under our borrowing facilities or notes, affect our or our projects' ability to meet liquidity, net worth, and leverage covenants under borrowing facilities or have a material adverse effect on the value of investments we hold or on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows;\n- z temporary or lasting changes involving the status, practices and procedures of our or our projects or our projects' sponsors' operations, including with respect to new originations of investments to the extent we elect or are required to limit or be more selective in making new originations of investments, we may strain our relationships with business partners, customers and counterparties, breach actual or perceived obligations to them, and be subject\n\nto litigation and claims from such partners, customers and counterparties, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows; moreover, some of our ultimate off-taker or project users' operations, or our operations, the sustainable infrastructure markets or projects and our ultimate off-taker or project users have not been able to and others may not be able to function effectively because of, among other factors, disruptions in the normal operation of sustainable infrastructure markets or projects, any inability to access short-term or long-term financing, a disruption in the market for securitization transactions, or the inability to access these markets or execute securitization transactions due to negative impacts to our, our projects or our ultimate off-taker or project users financial condition or operating capabilities resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic; any or all of these impacts could result in reduced net investment income and cash flow, as well as an impairment of our investments which reductions and impairments could be material;\n\n- z to the extent ultimate off-taker or other project users that have been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic do not timely remit payments of principal, interest or other payments (whether due to an inability to make such payments, an unwillingness to make such payments, or a waiver of the requirement to make such payments on a timely basis or at all, including under the terms of any applicable forbearance, modification, or maturity extension agreement or program (which forbearance, waiver, or maturity extension may be available as a result of a government-sponsored or -imposed program or under any such agreement or program we or our project sponsors may otherwise offer)), then the value of our investments will likely be impaired, potentially materially; moreover, to the extent any such pandemic impacts local, regional or national economic conditions, the value of a sustainable infrastructure project is likely to decline, which would likely negatively impact the value of our investments, potentially materially;\n- z some of our sustainable infrastructure projects are being constructed and others are subject to ongoing maintenance; planned construction or maintenance of some of these projects have not been able to proceed on a timely basis or at all and others may be similarly affected as a result of being negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including due to operating disruptions or government mandated moratoriums on construction, development or redevelopment or the inability to source the necessary construction personnel, equipment or parts; all of the foregoing factors would likely negatively impact the value of our investments, potentially materially;\n- z the inability of our project sponsors to operate in affected areas, including the bankruptcy of one or more project sponsors or their suppliers, or inability of our internal resources to effectively manage our investments in certain of their activities or perform certain administration functions;\n- z the inability of other third-party vendors we rely on to conduct our business to operate effectively and continue to support our business and operations, including vendors that provide IT services, legal and accounting services, or other operational support services;\n- z the inability of our or our investments' counterparties to make or satisfy the conditions, covenants or representations and warranties in agreements they have entered into with us or our counterparties;

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES\n\n## Market information\n\nOur common stock is traded on the NYSE under the symbol 'HASI.'\n\n## Holders\n\nAs of February 18, 2021, we had 161 registered holders of our common stock. The 161 holders of record do not include the beneficial owners of our common stock whose shares are held by a broker or bank. Such information was obtained from The Depository Trust Company.\n\n## Dividends\n\nWe intend to make regular quarterly distributions to holders of our common stock. Any distributions we make will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon, among other things, our actual results of operations. These results and our ability to pay distributions will be affected by various factors, including the net interest and other income from our portfolio, our operating expenses and any other expenditures. See Item/uni00A01A. Risk Factors, and Item/uni00A07. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of this Form 10-K, for information regarding the sources of funds used for dividends and for a discussion of factors, if any, which may adversely affect our ability to pay dividends.

See Note 10 regarding the amount of our distributions that are taxed as ordinary income to our stockholders.\n\nour common stock will continue in line with the same or similar trends depicted in the graph below. In this Form 10-K we have added both the FTSE NAREIT/uni00A0All Equity REIT Index and the Global X Renewable Energy Producers ETF, which beginning with the 2021 Form 10-K will replace the SNL Finance REIT Index and the Dow Jones Utility Average as indices in this graph. As a growing, US-based, welldiversified, mid-cap REIT, we believe these indices are well positioned to serve as peer group indices.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and accompanying/uni00A0notes included in Item/uni00A08. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Form 10-K. Refer to 'Item 7 -- Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations' on our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 for a discussion of our results for the year ended December 31, 2018 and a comparison of our results of operations for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018.\n\n## Overview\n\nWe invest in climate solutions developed by the leading companies in the energy efficiency, renewable energy and other sustainable infrastructure markets. We believe we are one of the first U.S. public companies solely dedicated to such climate change investments. Our goal is to generate attractive returns from a diversified portfolio of projects with long-term, predictable cash flows from proven technologies that reduce carbon emissions or increase resilience to climate change.\n\nWe are internally managed, and our management team has extensive relevant industry knowledge and experience, dating back more than 30 years. We have long-standing relationships with the leading energy service companies ('ESCOs'), manufacturers, project developers, utilities, owners and operators. Our origination strategy is to use these relationships to generate recurring, programmatic investment and fee-generating opportunities. Additionally, we have relationships with leading banks, investment banks, and institutional investors from which we are referred additional investment and fee generating opportunities.\n\nWe completed approximately $1.9 billion of transactions during 2020, compared to approximately $1.3 billion during 2019. As of December/uni00A031, 2020, we held approximately $2.9 billion/uni00A0of\n\n## Market conditions\n\nAs a result of increasing global awareness of and aversion to climate change impacts, we believe the sustainable infrastructure markets in which we invest, and investment in climate solutions more broadly, will continue to grow as the impact of climate change increases. In January 2021, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ('NOAA') reported that 2020 was the second warmest year on record, with all seven of the warmest years on record having occurred since 2014.\n\nFurther, communities across the globe are increasingly experiencing the destructive economic impacts of climate change, which are only expected to increase in frequency and severity. According to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ('NOAA'), there were 22 natural disaster events in the United States in 2020, with an estimated individual cost of greater than $1/uni00A0billion and an aggregate cost of approximately $95 billion. NOAA reports, that since 1980, the U.S. has sustained 285 separate billion-dollar weather events and climate disasters with cumulative costs exceeding $1.9 trillion dollars. In its Weather, Climate & Catastrophe Insight: 2020 Annual Report,\n\ntransactions on our balance sheet, which we refer to as our 'Portfolio.' For those transactions that we choose not to hold on our balance sheet, we transfer all or a portion of the economics of the transaction, typically using securitization trusts, to institutional investors in exchange for cash and in certain cases, residual interests in the assets and ongoing fees. As of December/uni00A031, 2020, we managed approximately $4.3 billion/uni00A0in these trusts or vehicles that are not consolidated on our balance sheet. When combined with our Portfolio, as of December/uni00A031, 2020, we manage approximately $7.2 billion of assets, which we refer to as our 'Managed Assets'.\n\nOur investments have taken many forms, including equity, joint ventures, land ownership, lending, or other financing transactions. We also generate ongoing fees through off-balance sheet securitization transactions, services, and asset management. We use borrowings as part of our strategy to increase potential returns to our stockholders and have available a broad range of financing sources including non-recourse or recourse debt, equity and off-balance sheet securitization structures.\n\nSee Item 1. Business for a further discussion of our business, investing strategy, and financing strategy.\n\nAon reports that there were 416 natural catastrophe events globally in 2020, resulting in economic losses of $268 billion representing increased losses of 8% compared to the century average.\n\nBloombergNEF ('BNEF') reported in January 2021, that carbon solutions investment exceeded $500 billion annually with $85 billion being invested in the United States. In its Energy Efficiency 2020 report, the International Energy Agency ('IEA') estimates global spending on energy efficiency at approximately $250 billion. Given that many projects are often self-financed (especially energy efficiency), we believe our total addressable market is likely a subset of these overall industry estimates. However, we believe these estimates are reliable indicators of market trends.\n\nThese positive industry trends coupled with the increasing environmental and economic imperative to reduce carbon emissions are expected to further broaden our investable universe. Investments in energy efficiency as a service allow organizations to avoid the upfront costs of efficiency investments by paying for efficiency-enabled cost savings\n\n|",

In its Annual Energy Outlook 2021, the U.S. Energy Information Administration ('EIA') estimates that decreasing energy intensity resulting from energy efficiency improvements will keep U.S. energy consumption for residential and commercial buildings growing at a level far below that of the U.S. economy. In addition, Lazard's 2020 Levelized Cost of Energy Analysis shows that renewables continue to outperform traditional generation sources on a new-built cost basis with certain renewable technologies achieving competitiveness with existing conventional generation technologies on a marginal basis, making renewables even more attractive investment targets. Further, in its New Energy Outlook 2020, BNEF expects wind and solar generation to provide 56% of the world's electricity by 2050, with renewables attracting $11 trillion of aggregate investment over this time period.\n\nWe expect the federal government to take, and they have taken, certain actions which are supportive of the industry for climate solutions. In December 2020, Congress extended the end date to December 2022 for qualifying property being eligible for the 26% investment tax credit for photovoltaic solar projects. The new presidential administration has taken immediate steps at the federal level which we believe signify support for climate solutions, including, but not limited to, rejoining the Paris Climate Accords and re-establishing a social price on carbon used in cost/benefit analysis for policy making. We expect the new administration, combined with a closely divided Congress, will result in additional regulations supportive of the markets in which we invest.\n\nState governmental agencies are responding to climate change risks through the implementation of renewable portfolio standards ('RPS') as well as energy reduction targets such as energy efficiency resource standards. According to the UCLA Luskin Center of Innovation one in three Americans lives in a city or state that has committed to, or already achieved, 100% clean electricity. Corporates are also responding to climate change risks - in part through renewable energy sourcing commitments. In its 2020 Annual Report, the RE 100, a global corporate leadership initiative bringing together influential businesses committed to 100% renewable electricity, reported that over 260 multinational companies have pledged to achieve 100% renewable energy with an average target date of 2028, with three quarters of those companies planning to reach 100% renewable energy by 2030.\n\nFederal Energy Savings Performance Contracts ('ESPCs') are an example of a public-private partnership that eliminate the need for a federal agency to find appropriated funds to replace, operate, and maintain energy-intensive equipment while also providing multiple ancillary benefits, including saving taxpayer dollars currently spent on energy consumption, improving conditions for federal workers and\n\n## Factors impacting our operating results\n\nWe expect that our results of operations will be affected by a number of factors and will primarily depend on the size of our Portfolio, including the mix of transactions which we hold in our Portfolio, the income we receive from securitizations, syndications and other services, our Portfolio's credit risk profile, changes in market interest rates, commodity prices, federal, state and/or municipal governmental policies, general market conditions in local, regional and national economies, our ability to qualify as a REIT and maintain our exemption from registration as an investment company under the 1940 Act and, the impact of climate change, and the impact of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19).\n\nservice men and women, and creating private sector jobs. Support for ESPCs remain bipartisan, and the new presidential administration is expected to continue to support the program. DOE announced that fiscal year 2020 was the most successful year in the history of the ESPC program, with over $842 million invested in qualifying projects, the third consecutive record year in the history of the program.\n\nWhile we believe that the long-term growth prospects for our business remain positive, volatility in financial markets and commodity prices along with interest rate movements could impact the markets we serve. Further, the current interest rate environment of low yields coupled with increasing investor acceptance of our markets has increased competitive pressure. In 2020, the Federal Reserve Board of Governors lowered the rate at which banks lend to one another (known as the federal funds rate) to a range of 0 to 25 basis points. The Federal Reserve Board of Governors has indicated that their plan is to keep rates at this level for some time, until labor market conditions recover from the COVID-19 pandemic and their inflation target of 2 percent is met. See 'Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk-Interest Rate and Borrowing Risks' for an analysis of the impact of rates on our business.\n\nAccording to the Department of Energy, average annual Henry Hub natural gas prices decreased by over 50% from 2014 to 2020, and its 2021 outlook forecasts that prices will stay below pre-2010 levels through 2050. As wholesale electricity prices are closely tied to wholesale natural gas prices in many parts of the United States, lower natural gas prices have negatively impacted, and are expected to continue to negatively impact, renewable energy projects that sell wholesale power on a 'merchant' basis at spot market prices. For more detail on commodity price impacts, see 'Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk-Commodity Price Risk'. We attempt to mitigate our exposure to these low commodity prices and future volatility, as well as any credit risk associated with these prices, by acquiring projects with contracted revenues, negotiating certain structural protections such as preferred returns, and through active asset management and portfolio monitoring. Similarly, we seek to manage credit risk that might arise from commodity price declines through our due diligence and underwriting processes, strong structural protections in our transaction agreements with customers, and active asset management and portfolio monitoring.\n\nNotwithstanding any concerns that current market conditions have raised for our business, we believe significant opportunities exist for us to grow our business. As a long-term participant committed to providing capital for sustainable infrastructure, we plan to continue to fund projects that meet our underwriting standards and look for opportunities to expand our business.\n\n## Portfolio Size\n\nThe size of our Portfolio will be a key revenue driver. Generally, as the size of our Portfolio on our balance sheet grows the amount of our revenue will increase. Our Portfolio may grow at an uneven pace as opportunities to originate new assets may be irregularly timed, and the timing and extent of our success in such originations cannot be predicted. To the extent the size of our Portfolio changes due to equity method investment activity, the income or loss from such investments will not be included in revenue but are reflected as income (loss) from equity method investments in our income statement and will vary over time. In addition,\n\n|",

        "page_content": "we may decide for any particular asset that we should securitize or otherwise sell a portion, or all, of the asset, which would result in gain on sale of receivables and investments or fee income as described below. The level of portfolio activity will fluctuate from period to period based upon the market demand for the capital we provide, our view of economic fundamentals including interest rates, the present mix of our Portfolio, our ability to identify new opportunities that meet our investment criteria, the volume of projects that have advanced to stages where we believe a transaction is appropriate, seasonality in our activities and in the various projects where we may provide debt or equity and our ability to consummate the identified opportunities, including as a result of our available capital. The level of our new origination activity, the percentage of the originations that we choose to retain on our balance sheet and the related income, will directly impact our interest and rental revenue and income from equity method investments.\n\n## Income from Securitization, Syndication and Other Services\n\nWe will also earn gain on sale of financial assets or fee income by securitizing or selling all or a portion of certain transactions. For transactions that we securitize via a non-consolidated trust, we recognize a gain on the securitization. The gain may be comprised of both cash received and a residual interest in securitized assets. We may also recognize additional income from servicing fees from these securitized assets over the life of the asset.\n\nIn many cases, we arrange the securitization of the loan or other asset prior to originating the transaction and thus have avoided exposure to credit spread and interest rate risks that are typically associated with traditional capital markets conduit transactions. In these cases, we avoid funding risks for these financings or other assets given that our securitization partners contractually agree to fund such assets before the origination transaction is completed.\n\nWe also generate fee income for syndications where we arrange financings that are held by other investors or if we sell existing transactions to other investors. In these transactions, unless we decide to hold a portion of the economic interest of the transaction on our balance sheet, we have no exposure to risks related to ownership of those financings. We may charge advisory, retainer or other fees, including through our broker dealer subsidiary.\n\nThe gain on sale income and our other sources of fee income will also vary depending on the level of our new origination activity and the portion of originated assets we decide to transfer to other investors. We view this revenue from such activities as a valuable component of our earnings and an important source of franchise value. The total amount of income from securitizations, syndications, and other services will vary on a quarter to quarter basis depending on various factors, including the level of our originations, the duration, credit quality and types of assets we originate, current and anticipated future interest rates, the impact on our leverage, the potential income from a securitization or syndication, the mix of our Portfolio and our need to tailor our mix of assets in order to allow us to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes and maintain our exemption from registration under the 1940 Act.\n\n## Credit Risks\n\nWe source and identify quality opportunities within our broad areas of expertise and apply our rigorous underwriting processes to our transactions, which, we believe, will generally enable us to minimize\n\nour credit losses and maintain our current level of financing costs. In the case of various renewable energy and other sustainable infrastructure projects, we will be exposed to the credit risk of the obligor of the project's PPA or other long-term contractual revenue commitments, as well as to the credit risk of certain suppliers and project operators. While we do not anticipate facing significant credit risk in our assets related to government energy efficiency projects, we are subject to varying degrees of credit risk in these projects in relation to payment guarantees provided by ESCOs that are required in the event that certain energy savings are not realized by the customer. We are also exposed to credit risk in our other projects that do not benefit from governments as the obligor such as on balance sheet financing of projects undertaken by universities, schools and hospitals, as well as privately owned commercial projects. We have extended mezzanine loans to various special purpose entities which own residential solar projects, and the ultimate repayment of those loans is dependent on the creditworthiness of the related residential obligors. Our level of credit risk has increased, and is expected to continue to increase, as our strategy contemplates new investments in mezzanine debt and equity. We seek to manage credit risk through thorough due diligence and underwriting processes, strong structural protections in our transaction agreements with customers and continual, active asset management and portfolio monitoring. Nevertheless, unanticipated credit losses could occur and during periods of economic downturn in the global economy, our exposure to credit risks from obligors increases, and our efforts to monitor and mitigate the associated risks may not be effective in reducing our credit losses. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Credit Risks for further information on our credit risks and see Note 6 of our audited financial statements in this Form 10-K for additional detail of the credit risks surrounding our Portfolio.\n\n## Changes in Market Interest Rates and Liquidity\n\nInterest rate risk is highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control. We are subject to interest rate risk in connection with new asset originations and our borrowings, including our credit facilities, and in the future, any new floating rate assets, credit facilities or other borrowings. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk for further information on interest rates risks and liquidity.\n\n## Commodity Prices\n\nWhen we make investments in a project that act as a substitute for an underlying commodity, we may be exposed to volatility in prices for that commodity. For example, the performance of renewable energy projects that produce electricity can be impacted by volatility in the market prices of various forms of energy, including electricity, coal and natural gas. This is especially true for utility scale projects that sell power on a wholesale basis such as many of our Grid-Connected projects as opposed to Behind-the-Meter projects which compete against the retail or delivered costs of electricity which includes the cost of transmitting and distributing the electricity to the end user. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk for further information on the impact of commodity prices.",

Such policies may include governmental initiatives, laws and regulations designed to reduce energy usage and impact the use of renewable energy or the investment in, and the use of, sustainable infrastructure. Policies and incentives provided by the U.S. federal government may include tax credits (with some of these tax credits that are related to renewable energy scheduled to be reduced or eliminated in the future), tax deductions, bonus depreciation, federal grants and loan guarantees, and energy market regulations. The value of tax credits, deductions and incentives may be impacted by changes in tax laws rates or regulations, including as a result of the TCJA.\n\nIncentives provided by state and local governments may include a RPS or similar clean energy standard, which specify the portion of the power utilized by local utilities that must be derived from renewable or clean energy sources as well as the state or local government sponsored programs where the financing of energy efficiency or renewable energy projects is repaid through an assessment in the property tax bill in a program commonly referred to as PACE. Additionally, certain states have implemented feed-in or net metering tariffs, pursuant to which electricity generated from renewable energy sources is purchased at a higher rate than prevailing wholesale rates. Other incentives include tariffs, tax incentives and other cash and non-cash payments.\n\nGovernmental agencies, commercial entities and developers of sustainable infrastructure projects frequently depend on these policies and incentives to help defray the costs associated with, and to finance, various projects. Government regulations also impact the terms of third party financing provided to support these projects. If any of these government policies, incentives or regulations are adversely amended, delayed, eliminated, reduced, retroactively changed or not extended beyond their current expiration dates or there is a negative impact from the recent federal law changes or proposals, the operating results of the projects we finance and the demand for, and the returns available from our investments may decline, which could harm our business.\n\n## Impacts of climate change on our future operations\n\nAs our business is focused on reducing carbon emissions and increasing resiliency to climate change, we are impacted by the effects of climate change and various related regulatory responses. In managing our business, we consider the potential impacts to our operations that may result in certain climate-related scenarios. In 2018, we began to implement the recommendations of the TCFD. The TCFD provides a framework to consider and disclose our processes for managing the risks and opportunities associated with climate change. We have disclosed the components of the TCFD framework throughout this document. The following tables highlight our evaluation of potential impacts to our business in two climate related scenarios as well as our resilience and strategy to handling the potential impacts.\n\nTransition Risks and Opportunities - We believe our investment portfolio will be impacted by the transition risks and opportunities contemplated by the Paris Accords and the achievement of its objectives.\n\nScenario 1 - Global action is taken to limit the global temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels\n\nConsiderations of and impact\n\n| Assumption                                                                                                                                                                                  | Qualitative impacts                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Quantitative impacts                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | on our management strategy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| The price of Renewable  Energy Credits ('RECs') or  similar structures increase as  more aggressive renewable  portfolio standards and  corporate renewable energy  targets are implemented | Increased expected cash flows and  financial returns for certain of our  investments to the extent the RECs are  sold at higher market prices.

        "page_content": "## Impact of COVID-19\n\nThe current outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is having an ongoing impact on the U.S., regional and global economies, the U.S. sustainable infrastructure market and the broader financial markets.\n\nSince March, in an attempt to control COVID-19 the Federal government and most states and/or local governments, including where we have our office (Maryland) and in regions where our projects and other investments are located or where they are managed, have implemented various restrictions, rules, or guidelines including quarantines, restrictions on travel, 'shelter in place', 'stay at home', or 'safer at home' rules, restrictions on types of business that may continue to operate, and/or restrictions on types of construction projects allowed. While some of these restrictions have been relaxed or phased out, many of these or similar restrictions remain in place, continue to be implemented, or additional restrictions are being considered. Although, in certain cases, exceptions may be available for certain essential operations and businesses which generally include the renewable energy projects in which we invest, there is no assurance that such exceptions will enable us to avoid adverse effects to our results of operations and business. Further, such actions create disruption in energy efficiency, renewable energy, real estate and other sustainable infrastructure markets and adversely impact a number of industries.\n\nWe closed our office and moved to a remote workforce in early March to help ensure the safety and productivity of our employees and help prevent the spread of COVID-19 among our workforce and in the community. We took this action early as we recognized the seriousness of the situation and wanted to protect our employees and the members of the communities in which they live and work. We have spent significant time and resources over the last several years to update our IT infrastructure and our use of the cloud to allow us to take this action. Operating as a remote workforce has not materially impacted\n\nour ability to carry out day to day operations. We have announced donations totaling $375,000 to several Maryland charities who are providing services during the pandemic as well as to charities addressing racial inequity.\n\nWe have taken certain actions to increase liquidity, including issuing approximately $300 million in common stock and issuing over $900 million of senior unsecured and convertible senior notes. We believe these actions give us ample liquidity to continue to operate our business and make investments in green projects as opportunities present themselves. See the Notes 7 and 8 to our financial statements and Liquidity and Capital Resources in this Form 10-K for further discussion of our liquidity.\n\nOur financial results for 2020 have not been adversely impacted by COVID-19 to a material degree. We currently have no material loan delinquencies. We believe that the cost-savings attributes of the projects in which we invest provide incentive to borrowers and other obligors to continue to make their contractual payments.\n\nThe rapid development and fluidity of the circumstances resulting from this pandemic preclude any prediction as to the ultimate adverse impact of COVID-19. Nevertheless, COVID-19 and the current financial, economic and capital markets environment, and future developments in these and other areas present material uncertainty and risk with respect to our performance, financial condition, volume of business, results of operations and cash flows. We expect to review and adjust our efforts as the circumstances and impacts of the pandemic develop and respond to the shifting business and financial landscape and heightened volatility in, among other things, financial markets as well as the general economy and the various federal, state and local guidelines on business operations. See the Risk Factors section of this Form 10-K for additional discuss of certain potential risks to our business arising from COVID-19.\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\n\nOur financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, which requires the use of estimates and assumptions that involve the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties. The following discussion addresses the accounting policies that we use including areas that involve the use of significant estimates. Our most critical accounting policies involve decisions and assessments that could affect our reported assets and liabilities, as well as our reported revenues and expenses. We believe that all of the decisions and assessments upon which our financial statements are based are reasonable at the time made and based upon information available to us at that time. Our critical accounting policies and accounting estimates may be expanded over time. Those material accounting policies and estimates that we expect to be most critical to an investor's understanding of our financial results and condition and require complex management judgment are discussed below. See Note 2 of the audited financial statements in this Form/uni00A010-K for further details on our accounting policies.\n\nWe evaluate our critical accounting estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and update them, as necessary, based on changing conditions. Additionally, there were certain newly issued accounting pronouncements that may be relevant to our business. See Note 2 of the audited financial statements in this Form/uni00A010-K for further details on these newly issued accounting pronouncements.\n\nWe have identified the following accounting policies as critical because they require significant judgments and assumptions about highly complex and inherently uncertain matters and the use of reasonably different estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on our reported results of operations or financial condition.\n\n## Consolidation\n\nWe account for our investment in entities that are considered voting or variable interest entities under ASC 810, Consolidation . We perform an ongoing assessment and make judgments to determine the primary beneficiary of each entity as required by ASC 810, which includes an assessment of the type of control we have over the entity. If we would conclude that certain of these entities should be consolidated, we would include the entities assets, liabilities and related activity in our financial statements. Refer to discussion below relating to consolidation considerations for the securitization of receivables. We further discuss our process for evaluating these judgments in Note 2 of the audited financial statements of this Form 10-K.\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## Equity Method Investments\n\nFor our non-consolidated equity investments, we generally determine our income allocations under the equity method of accounting based on the change in our claim on net assets of the investee entity using a method commonly referred to as the hypothetical liquidation at book value method or ('HLBV'). This method uses a hypothetical liquidation scenario that may require judgment in its application and could have a material impact on our reported financial results. Any changes in this method of application or in certain assumptions could either increase or decrease our net income. We further discuss our process for applying this method of income allocations in Note 2 of the audited financial statements of this Form 10-K.\n\n## Impairment of our Portfolio\n\nWe evaluate the various assets in our Portfolio on at least a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or other conditions warrant such an evaluation, for potential delinquencies or other events that may indicate a potential impairment of the such asset. If an asset is determined to be impaired, any impairment charges would be recorded in the income statement and reduce our net income. We further discuss our process for evaluating these judgments in Note 2 of the audited financial statements in this Form 10-K.\n\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses-Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments ('Topic 326'). Topic 326 significantly changes how entities will recognize and measure credit losses and impairments for most financial assets and certain other instruments that are not measured at fair value through net income. Topic 326 replaces the 'incurred loss' approach under existing guidance with an 'expected loss' model for instruments measured at amortized cost and require entities to record allowances for expected losses from available-for-sale\n\n## Results of Operations\n\nFor a comparison of our results of operations for the fiscal years ended December/uni00A031, 2019 and December/uni00A031, 2018, see 'Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations' of our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December/uni00A031, 2019, filed with the SEC on February 25, 2020.\n\nWe make investments in climate solutions by providing capital to the leading companies in the energy efficiency, renewable energy and other sustainable infrastructure markets. We believe that Hannon Armstrong is one of the first U.S. public companies solely dedicated to such climate investments. Our goal is to generate attractive returns for our shareholders by investing in a diversified portfolio of assets and projects that reduce carbon emissions or increase resilience to climate change and generate long-term, recurring and predictable cash flows or cost savings from proven commercial technologies.\n\nWe completed approximately $1.9 billion/uni00A0of transactions during 2020, compared to approximately $1.3 billion during 2019. Our strategy includes holding a large portion of these transactions on our balance sheet. We refer to the transactions we hold on our balance sheet as of a given date as our 'Portfolio.' Our Portfolio was approximately $2.9 billion as of December/uni00A031, 2020 and $2.1 billion December 31, 2019.\n\ndebt securities rather than reduce the amortized cost, as currently required. The expected loss model inherently requires more judgment than the incurred loss model, as management's expectations of the creditworthiness of our borrowers as well as macroeconomic factors such as power prices and unemployment rates can impact the provision for receivables we record. Topic 326 also simplifies the accounting model for purchased credit-impaired debt securities and loans. Topic 326 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 and was adopted through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. The Company has adopted the new standard as of January 1, 2020. We further discuss our process for applying this accounting standard in Note 2 of the audited financial statements of this Form 10-K.\n\n## Securitization of Financial Assets\n\nWe have established various special purpose entities or securitization trusts for the purpose of securitizing certain receivables or other debt investments. We make judgments, based in part, on supporting legal opinions, on whether these entities should be consolidated as a variable interest entity, as defined in ASC 810, Consolidation , and whether the transfers to these entities are accounted for as a sale of a financial asset or a secured borrowing under ASC 860, Transfers and Servicing . If we would conclude that certain of these special purpose entities or securitization trusts should be consolidated, we would include the assets and liabilities of the entity and their related activity in our financial statements. If sale accounting is not met in these transactions it would be treated as a secured borrowing rather than a sale in our financial statements. We further discuss our process for evaluating these judgments in Note 2 of the audited financial statements of this Form 10-K.\n\n## Portfolio\n\nOur Portfolio totaled approximately $2.9/uni00A0billion as of December/uni00A031, 2020, and included approximately $1.4 billion/uni00A0of BTM assets and approximately $1.5 billion/uni00A0of GC assets. Approximately 44% consisted of fixed-rate government and commercial receivables and debt securities, which are classified as investments, on our balance sheet. Approximately 43% of our Portfolio consisted of unconsolidated equity investments in renewable energy related projects and approximately 13% of our Portfolio was real estate leased to renewable energy projects under lease agreements. Our Portfolio consisted of over 230 transactions with an average size of $12/uni00A0million and the weighted average remaining life of our Portfolio (excluding match-funded transactions) of approximately 17 years as of December/uni00A031, 2020.\n\nOur Portfolio included the following as of December/uni00A031, 2020:\n\n- z Equity investments in either preferred or common structures in unconsolidated entities;\n- z Government and commercial receivables, such as loans for renewable energy and energy efficiency projects;\n- z Real estate, such as land or other assets leased for use by sustainable infrastructure projects typically under long-term leases; and\n- z Investments in debt securities of renewable energy or energy efficiency projects.\n\n|",

These results do not include the Non-GAAP earnings adjustment related to equity method investments, which is discussed in the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section.\n- z Interest and rental income increased by $20 million due to the addition of higher yielding assets to an overall larger portfolio.\n- z Gain on sale and fee income increased by $25 million primarily due to a change in the mix of assets being securitized.\n- z Interest expense for the year increased by approximately $28 million primarily as a result of higher outstanding balances of debt during the year.\n- z Provision for loss on receivables was $10 million primarily as a result of provisions based on new loans and loan commitments made during the year required by the new credit loss standard. The prior period provision of $8 million, recorded under the previous incurred loss model, was due to a 2019 court ruling related to receivables that were previously placed on non-accrual status in 2017.\n- z Income from equity method investments decreased by $16 million, primarily due to the GAAP gain of $28 million recognized from the sale of a portfolio of wind projects in 2019 which did not recur in the current year, partially offset by additional income resulting from the realization of tax attributes by our co-investors.\n- z Income tax benefit (expense) increased by $11 million as a result of higher taxable income in 2019 largely due to the gain on the sale of the portfolio of wind projects discussed above which did not recur in the current year.\n\n## Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nWe consider the following Non-GAAP financial measures useful to investors as key supplemental measures of our performance: (1)/uni00A0 distributable earnings, (2) managed assets, and (3)/uni00A0distributable net investment income. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered along with, but not as alternatives to, net income or loss as measures of our operating performance. These Non-GAAP financial measures, as calculated by us, may not be comparable to similarly named financial measures as reported by other companies that do not define such terms exactly as we define such terms.\n\n- z Compensation and benefits increased by $9/uni00A0million as a result of an increase in our employee headcount and incentive compensation.",

        "page_content": "## PART II\n\n## Item 7./uni00A0Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\n## Distributable Earnings\n\nWe are changing the name of our primary Non-GAAP earnings metric from Core (Pre-CECL) earnings to distributable earnings with no change in the historical method of calculation. We will no longer be reporting a Core earnings metric which includes the CECL provision. We calculate distributable earnings as GAAP net income (loss) excluding non-cash equity compensation expense, provisions for loss on receivables, amortization of intangibles, non-cash provision (benefit) for taxes, any one-time acquisition related costs or non-cash tax charges and the earnings attributable to our non-controlling interest of our Operating Partnership. We also make an adjustment to our equity method investments in the renewable energy projects as described below. Judgment will be utilized in determining when we will reflect the losses on receivables in our distributable earnings. In making this determination, we will consider certain circumstances such as, the time period in default, sufficiency of collateral as well as the outcomes of any related litigation. In the future, distributable earnings may also exclude one-time events pursuant to changes in GAAP and certain other noncash charges as approved by a majority of our independent directors.\n\nWe believe a Non-GAAP measure, such as distributable earnings, that adjusts for the items discussed above is and has been a meaningful indicator of our economic performance and is useful to our investors as well as management in evaluating our performance as it relates to expected dividend payments over time. As a REIT, we are required to distribute substantially all of our taxable income to investors in the form of dividends and is a principal focus of our investors. Additionally, we believe that our investors also use distributable earnings, or a comparable supplemental performance measure, to evaluate and compare our performance to that of our peers, and as such, we believe that the disclosure of distributable earnings is useful to our investors.\n\nCertain of our equity method investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency projects are structured using typical partnership 'flip' structures where the investors with cash distribution preferences receive a pre-negotiated return consisting of priority distributions from the project cash flows, in many cases, along with tax attributes. Once this preferred return is achieved, the partnership 'flips' and the common equity investor, often the operator or sponsor of the project, receives more of the cash flows through its equity interests while the previously preferred investors retain an ongoing residual interest. We have made investments in both the preferred and common equity of these structures.\n\nRegardless of the nature of our equity interest, we typically negotiate the purchase prices of our equity investments, which have a finite expected life, based on our assessment of the expected cash flows we will receive from these projects discounted back to the net present value, based on a target investment rate, with the expected cash flows to be received in the future reflecting both a return on the capital (at the investment rate) and a return of the capital we have committed to the project./uni00A0We use a similar approach in the underwriting of our receivables.\n\nUnder GAAP, we account for these equity method investments utilizing the HLBV method. Under this method, we recognize income or loss based on the change in the amount each partner would receive, typically based on the negotiated profit and loss allocation, if the assets were liquidated at book value, after adjusting for any distributions or contributions made during such quarter. The HLBV allocations of income or loss may be impacted by the receipt of tax attributes, as tax equity investors are allocated losses in proportion to the tax benefits received, while the sponsors of the project are allocated gains of a similar amount. In addition, the agreed upon allocations of the project's cash flows may differ materially from the profit and loss allocation used for the HLBV calculations.\n\nThe cash distributions for those equity method investments where we apply HLBV are segregated into a return on and return of capital on our cash flow statement based on the cumulative income (loss) that has been allocated using the HLBV method. However, as a result of the application of the HLBV method, including the impact of tax allocations, the high levels of depreciation and other non-cash expenses that are common to renewable energy projects and the differences between the agreed upon profit and loss and the cash flow allocations, the distributions and thus the economic returns (i.e. return on capital) achieved from the investment are often significantly different from the income or loss that is allocated to us under the HLBV method. Thus, in calculating distributable earnings, for certain of these investments where there are characteristics as described above, we further adjust GAAP net income (loss) to take into account our calculation of the return on capital (based upon the investment rate) from our renewable energy equity method investments, as adjusted to reflect the performance of the project and the cash distributed. We believe this equity method investment adjustment to our GAAP net income (loss) in calculating our distributable earnings measure is an important supplement to the HLBV income allocations determined under GAAP for an investor to understand the economic performance of these investments where HLBV income can differ substantially from the economic returns.\n\nThe following table provides results related to our equity method investments for the last three years:\n\n|                        | For the years ended December 31,   | For the years ended December 31,   | For the years ended December 31,   |\n|------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| (dollars in millions)  | 2020                               | 2019                               | 2018                               |\n| Income under GAAP      | $ 48                               | $ 64                               | $ 22                               |\n| Distributable earnings | $ 55                               | $ 41                               | $ 41                               |\n| Return of capital      | 102                                | 60                                 | 74                                 |\n| CASH COLLECTED         | $ 157                              | $ 101                              | $ 115                              |\n\nDistributable earnings does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP), or an indication of our cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP), or a measure of our liquidity, or an indication of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make cash\n\ndistributions.

Thus, we present our investments on a non-GAAP 'managed' basis, which assumes that securitized receivables are not sold. We believe that our Managed Asset information is useful to investors because it portrays the amount of both on- and off-balance sheet receivables that we manage, which enables investors to understand and evaluate the credit performance associated with our portfolio of receivables, investments, and residual assets in securitized receivables. Our non-GAAP Managed Assets measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\n\nThe following is a reconciliation of our GAAP Portfolio to our Managed Assets as of December/uni00A031, 2020, 2019, and 2018:\n\n|                                                              | As of and for the year ended December 31,   | As of and for the year ended December 31,   | As of and for the year ended December 31,   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| (dollars in millions)                                        | 2020                                        | 2019                                        | 2018                                        |\n| Equity method investments                                    | $ 1,280                                     | $ 499                                       | $ 471                                       |\n| Government receivables                                       | 248                                         | 263                                         | 497                                         |\n| Commercial receivables                                       | 965                                         | 896                                         | 447                                         |\n| Real estate                                                  | 359                                         | 362                                         | 365                                         |\n| Investments                                                  | 55                                          | 75                                          | 170                                         |\n| Assets held in securitization trusts                         | 4,308                                       | 4,101                                       | 3,334                                       |\n| MANAGED ASSETS                                               | $ 7,215                                     | $ 6,196                                     | $ 5,284                                     |\n| Credit losses as a percentage of assets under management (1) | 0.0 %                                       | 0.1%                                        | 0.0%                                        |",

We calculate distributable net investment income by adjusting GAAP-based net investment income for those earnings adjustments related to our distributable earnings which impact net investment income. We believe that this measure is useful to investors as it shows the recurring income generated by our portfolio after the associated interest cost of debt financing. Our management also uses distributable net investment income in this way.

Underwritten yield is the rate at which we discount the expected cash flows from the assets in our Portfolio to determine our purchase price. In calculating underwritten yield, we make certain assumptions, including the timing and amounts of cash flows generated by our investments, which may differ from actual results, and we may update this yield to reflect our most current estimates of project performance. We believe that portfolio yield provides an additional metric to understand certain characteristics of our Portfolio as of a point in time. Our management uses portfolio yield this way and we believe that our investors use it in a similar fashion to evaluate certain characteristics of our Portfolio compared to our peers, and as such, we believe that the disclosure of portfolio yield is useful to our investors.\n\nOur Portfolio totaled approximately/uni00A0$2.9/uni00A0billion/uni00A0as of December/uni00A031, 2020. Unlevered portfolio yield was/uni00A07.6%/uni00A0as of both/uni00A0December/uni00A031, 2020 and 2019./uni00A0See Note 6 to our financial statements and MD&A/uni00A0- Our Business in this Form 10-K for additional discussion of the characteristics of our portfolio as of/uni00A0December/uni00A031, 2020.\n\n## Environmental Metrics\n\nAs discussed in Item 1. Business, as part of our investment process, we calculate the estimated metric tons of CO2 equivalent emissions, or carbon emissions avoided by our investments. In this calculation which we refer to as CarbonCount \u00ae , we apply emissions factor data from the U.S. Government or the International Energy Administration to an estimate of a project's energy production or savings to compute an estimate of metric tons of carbon emissions avoided. We estimate that our investments originated in 2020 will reduce annual carbon emissions by approximately 2.0 million metric tons.\n\nIn assessing our performance and results of operations, we also consider the impact of our operations on the environment. We utilize the carbon emissions categorizations established by the World Resources Institute Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Standards ('Standards') to set goals and calculate our estimated emissions. The categorizations are as follows:\n\n- z Scope 1 GHG emissions -Direct emissions - Emissions from operations that are owned or controlled by the reporting company.\n- z Scope 2 GHG emissions -Indirect emissions - Emissions from the generation of purchased or acquired energy such as electricity, steam, heating or cooling, consumed by the reporting company.\n- z Scope 3 GHG emissions -Indirect emissions - All other indirect emissions that occur in the value chain of the reporting company, including both upstream and downstream emissions.\n\n|",

As of December 31, 2020, we employed 73 people full-time, one person part-time, and five people as independent contractors. As a growing company, the average tenure of our employees as of December 31, 2020, was approximately 5 years, and more than 47% of our employees had been employed by us for more than 4 years. For the year ending December 31, 2020, we had no retirements or resignations related to ill health.\n\nAs discussed in Item 1. Business - Human Capital and Social Strategy, we are undertaking studies and are focused on continuing to increase the diversity of our workforce at all levels of our organization and are in the process of developing goals to enhance diversity and inclusion. These metrics are and will continue to be actively managed and will be reported along with the results of the studies to our executive leadership as well as our board of directors.\n\nMetrics surrounding the diversity and inclusion of our workforce are shown below:\n\nPercentage of various levels of the workforce who identify as male or female\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

We will use significant cash to make investments in sustainable infrastructure, repay principal and interest on our borrowings, make distributions to our stockholders and fund our operations. We use borrowings as part of our financing strategy to increase potential returns to our stockholders and have available to us a broad range of financing sources. We finance our investments primarily with non-recourse or recourse debt, equity and off-balance sheet securitization structures.\n\nWe believe we have substantial liquidity as of December/uni00A031, 2020, with unrestricted cash balances of $286 million compared to $6 million as of December 31, 2019. We have been able to successfully access the equity markets, raising approximately $300 million under our 'at-the-market' equity distribution program (our 'ATM program') during the twelve months ended December/uni00A031, 2020. During 2020, we have issued $775 million principal amount of senior unsecured notes and $144 million of convertible notes.\n\nbusiness or economics, including in science and engineering, liberal and fine arts, and law.\n\nWe have two senior secured revolving credit facilities ('Rep-Based Facility' and 'Approval-Based Facility') with several lenders with a combined maximum commitment of $450/uni00A0million. For additional information on our credit facilities, see Note 7 to our audited financial statements on this Form 10-K. As of December/uni00A031, 2020, we had approximately $605/uni00A0million of non-recourse borrowings. We have approximately $1.3/uni00A0billion of senior unsecured notes and $294/uni00A0million of convertible notes outstanding. We also continue to utilize off-balance sheet securitization transactions, where we transfer the loans or other assets we originate to securitization trusts or other bankruptcy remote special purpose funding vehicles that are not consolidated on our balance sheet. We have continued to complete off-balance sheet securitization transactions with large institutional investors such as life insurance companies throughout 2020. As of December/uni00A031, 2020, the outstanding principal balance of our assets financed through the use of these off-balance sheet transactions was approximately $4.3 billion.\n\n|",

Cash maturities related to these obligations are shown below:\n\n## Cash Maturities of Outstanding Debt\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe above cash maturities do not include our non-recourse debt, given that to the extent there are not sufficient cash flows received from those investments pledged as collateral, the investor has no recourse against other corporate assets to recover any shortfalls and corporate cash contributions would not be required. The above also does not include convertible debt maturities, as it is possible those obligations will be settled with the issuance of shares. For further information on non-recourse debt and our convertible notes, see Note 8 to our financial statements.\n\nLarge institutional investors have provided the financing for our on and off-balance sheet financings. We have worked to expand our liquidity and access to the debt and bank loan markets. For further information on the credit facilities, senior unsecured notes, asset backed nonrecourse debt, convertible notes, and securitizations, see Notes 5, 7 and 8 to our audited financial statements of this Form 10-K.\n\nWe plan to raise additional equity capital and continue to use fixed and floating rate borrowings which may be in the form of additional bank credit facilities (including term loans and revolving facilities), warehouse facilities, repurchase agreements, and public and private debt issuances as a means of financing our business. We also expect to use both on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet securitizations. We may also consider the use of separately funded special purpose entities or funds to allow us to expand the investments that we make or to manage the Portfolio diversification.\n\nThe decision on how we finance specific assets or groups of assets is largely driven by risk and portfolio and financial management considerations, including the potential for gain on sale or fee income, as well as the overall interest rate environment, prevailing credit spreads and the terms of available financing and market conditions. During periods of market disruptions, certain sources of financing may be more readily accessible than others which may impact our financing decisions. Over time, as market conditions change, we may use other forms of debt and equity in addition to these financing arrangements.\n\nThe amount of financial leverage we may deploy for particular assets will depend upon the availability of particular types of financing and our assessment of the credit, liquidity, price volatility and other risks of those assets, the interest rate environment and the credit quality of our financing counterparties. As shown in the table below, our debt to equity ratio was approximately 1.8 to 1 as of December/uni00A031, 2020, which is below our current board-approved leverage limit of up to 2.5 to 1. Our percentage of fixed rate debt was approximately 99% as of December/uni00A031, 2020, which is within our targeted fixed rate debt percentage range of 75% to 100%.\n\nThe calculation of our fixed-rate debt and financial leverage as of December/uni00A031, 2020 and 2019 is shown in the chart below:\n\n| (dollars in millions)    | December 31, 2020   | % of Total   | December 31, 2019   | % of Total   |\n|--------------------------|---------------------|--------------|---------------------|--------------|\n| Floating-rate borrowings | $ 23                | 1%           | $ 33                | 2%           |\n| Fixed-rate debt          | 2,166               | 99 %         | 1,360               | 98 %         |\n| TOTAL DEBT (1)           | $ 2,189             | 100 %        | $ 1,393             | 100 %        |\n| Equity                   | $ 1,210             |              | $ 940               |              |\n| Leverage                 | 1.8 to 1            |              | 1.5 to 1            |              |\n\nWe intend to use financial leverage for the primary purpose of financing our Portfolio and business activities and not for the purpose of speculating on changes in interest rates. While we may temporarily exceed the leverage limit, if our board of directors approves a material change to this limit, we anticipate advising our stockholders of this change through disclosure in our periodic reports and other filings under the Exchange Act.\n\nWhile we generally intend to hold our target assets that we do not securitize upon acquisition as long term investments, certain of our investments may be sold in order to manage our interest rate risk and liquidity needs, to meet other operating objectives and to adapt to market conditions. The timing and impact of future sales of receivables and investments, if any, cannot be predicted with any certainty.\n\n|",

These increases were offset by $56 million related to non-cash gains on securitizations, $34 million related to equity method investments, and $13 million related to other items.\n\n## Cash Flows Relating to Investing Activities\n\nNet cash used in investing activities was approximately $831 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. We made equity method investments of $886 million, investments in receivables and fixed\n\nrate debt securities of $296 million, and funded escrow accounts of $23/uni00A0million. These were offset by collected payments of $135/uni00A0million from receivables and fixed rate debt securities and the receipt of $128/uni00A0million from the sale of financial assets. We also collected $99/uni00A0million from equity method investments which are considered return of capital determined under GAAP, withdrew $8 million from escrow accounts, and had other cash inflows of $3 million.\n\nNet cash used in investing activities was approximately $201 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. We collected payments of $64 million from receivables and fixed rate debt securities and received $274 million from the sale of financial assets. We also collected $71 million from equity method investments which are considered return of capital determined under GAAP, received $81 million from the sale of equity method investments, withdrew $31 million from escrow accounts, and had other cash inflows of $2 million. These were offset by investments in receivables and fixed rate debt securities of $543 million, equity method investments of $152 million, and funding of escrow accounts of $29 million.\n\n## Cash Flows Relating to Financing Activities\n\nNet cash provided by financing activities was approximately $962/uni00A0million for the year ended December 31, 2020. We received proceeds from the issuance of senior unsecured debt of $771 million, net proceeds from common stock issuances of $298 million, proceeds from the issuance of convertible notes of $144 million, proceeds from credit facilities of $126 million, and proceeds from non-recourse debt of $16 million. These were partially offset by principal payments on credit facilities of $134 million, principal payments on non-recourse debt of $126 million, payments of $17 million for withholding requirements as a result of the vesting of employee shares, and payments of dividends, distributions, and other financing activities of $116 million.\n\nNet cash provided by financing activities was approximately $219/uni00A0million for the year ended December 31, 2019.

Other than our securitization assets (including any outstanding servicer advances) of approximately $164 million as of December/uni00A031, 2020, that may be at risk in the event of defaults or prepayments in our securitization trusts and as discussed below, and except as disclosed in Note 9 to our audited financial statements in this Form 10-K, we have not guaranteed any obligations of non-consolidated entities or entered into any commitment or intent to provide additional funding to any such entities. A more detailed description of our relations with non-consolidated entities can be found in Note 2 of our audited financial statements in this Form 10-K.\n\n## Dividends\n\nU.S. federal income tax law generally requires that a REIT distribute annually at least 90% of its REIT taxable income, without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains, and that it pays tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that it annually distributes less than 100% of its REIT taxable income. Our current policy is to pay quarterly distributions, which on an annual basis will equal or exceed substantially all of our REIT taxable income. The taxable income of the REIT can vary from our GAAP earnings due to a number of different factors, including, the book to tax timing differences of income and expense recognition from our transactions as well as the amount of taxable income of our TRS distributed to the REIT. See Note/uni00A010 regarding the amount of our distributions that are taxed as ordinary income to our stockholders.\n\nAny distributions we make will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon, among other things, our actual results of operations. These results and our ability to pay distributions will be affected by various factors, including the net interest and other income from our portfolio, our operating expenses and any other expenditures. In the event that our board of directors determines to make distributions in excess of the income or cash flow generated from our assets, we may make such distributions from the proceeds of future offerings of equity or debt securities or other forms of debt financing or the sale of assets. To the extent that in respect of any calendar year, cash available for distribution is less than our taxable income, or our declared distribution we could be required to sell assets, borrow funds, or raise additional capital to make cash distributions or make\n\n|\n\nIn connection with some of our transactions, we have provided certain limited guarantees to other transaction participants covering the accuracy of certain limited representations, warranties or covenants and provided an indemnity against certain losses from 'bad acts' including fraud, failure to disclose a material fact, theft, misappropriation, voluntary bankruptcy or unauthorized transfers. In some transactions, we have also guaranteed our compliance with certain tax matters, such as negatively impacting the investment tax credit and certain other obligations in the event of a change in ownership or our exercising certain protective rights.",

        "page_content": "a portion of the required distribution in the form of a taxable stock distribution or distribution of debt securities. We will generally not be required to make distributions with respect to activities conducted through our domestic TRS.\n\nTo the extent that we generate taxable income, distributions to our stockholders generally will be taxable as ordinary income, although all or a portion of such distributions may be designated by us as a qualified dividend or capital gain. Beginning in 2018 (and through taxable years ending in 2025), a deduction is permitted for certain pass-through business income, including 'qualified REIT dividends' (generally, dividends received by a REIT shareholder that are not designated as capital gain dividends or qualified dividend income),\n\n## Book Value Considerations\n\nAs of December/uni00A031, 2020, we carried only our investments and residual assets in securitized financial assets at fair value on our balance sheet. As a result, in reviewing our book value, there are a number of important factors and limitations to consider. Other than our investments and the residual assets in securitized financial assets that are carried on our balance sheet at fair value as of December/uni00A031, 2020, the carrying value of our remaining assets and liabilities are calculated as of a particular point in time, which is largely determined at the time such assets and liabilities were added to our balance sheet using a cost basis in accordance with GAAP. Other than the\n\nallowance for current expected credit losses applied to our government and commercial receivables, our remaining assets and liabilities do not incorporate other factors that may have a significant impact on their value, most notably any impact of business activities, changes in estimates, or changes in general economic conditions, interest rates or commodity prices since the dates the assets or liabilities were initially recorded. Accordingly, our book value does not necessarily represent an estimate of our net realizable value, liquidation value or our market value.\n\n## Inflation\n\nWe do not anticipate that inflation will have a significant effect on our results of operations. However, in the event of a significant increase in inflation, interest rates could rise and our projects and investments may be materially adversely affected.\n\n## ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\nWe anticipate that our primary market risks will be related to, the credit quality of our counterparties and project companies, market interest rates, the liquidity of our assets, commodity prices, and environmental factors. We will seek to manage these risks while, at the same time, seeking to provide an opportunity to stockholders to realize attractive\n\nreturns through ownership of our common stock. Many of these risks have been magnified due to the continuing economic disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic; however, while we continue to monitor the pandemic its impact on such risks remains uncertain and difficult to predict.\n\n## Credit Risks\n\nWe source and identify quality opportunities within our broad areas of expertise and apply our rigorous underwriting processes to our transactions, which, we believe, will generally enable us to minimize our credit losses and maintain access to attractive financing. In the case of various renewable energy and other sustainable infrastructure projects, we will be exposed to the credit risk of the obligor of the project's PPA or other long-term contractual revenue commitments, as well as to the credit risk of certain suppliers and project operators. While we do not anticipate facing significant credit risk in our assets related to government energy efficiency projects, we are subject to varying degrees of credit risk in these projects in relation to guarantees provided by ESCOs where payments under energy savings performance contracts are contingent upon achieving predetermined levels of energy savings. We are exposed to credit risk in our other projects that do not benefit from governments as the obligor such as on balance sheet financing of projects undertaken by universities, schools and hospitals, as well as privately owned\n\ncommercial projects. Our level of credit risk has increased, and is expected to continue to increase, as our strategy contemplates additional investments in mezzanine debt and equity. We seek to manage credit risk through thorough due diligence and underwriting processes, strong structural protections in our transaction agreements with customers and continual, active asset management and portfolio monitoring. Nevertheless, unanticipated credit losses could occur and during periods of economic downturn in the global economy, our exposure to credit risks from obligors increases, and our efforts to monitor and mitigate the associated risks may not be effective in reducing our credit risks.\n\nWe utilize a risk rating system to evaluate projects that we target. We first evaluate the credit rating of the obligors involved in the project using an average of the external credit ratings for an obligor, if available, or an estimated internal rating based on a third-party credit scoring system. We then estimate the probability of default\n\nwhich will allow U.S. individuals, trusts, and estates to deduct up to 20% of such amounts, subject to certain limitations, resulting in an effective maximum U.S. federal income tax rate of 29.6% on such qualified REIT dividends. In the event we make distributions to our stockholders in excess of our taxable income, the excess will constitute a return of capital. In addition, a portion of such distributions may be taxable stock dividends payable in our shares. We will furnish annually to each of our stockholders a statement setting forth distributions paid during the preceding year and their characterization as ordinary income, return of capital, qualified dividend income or capital gain.\n\nThe dividends declared in 2020 and 2019 are described in Note/uni00A011 of the audited financial statements in this Form 10-K.\n\n|",

We also review the performance of each investment, including through, as appropriate, a review of project performance, monthly payment activity and active compliance monitoring, regular communications with project management and, as applicable, its obligors, sponsors and owners, monitoring the financial\n\nperformance of the collateral, periodic property visits and monitoring cash management and reserve accounts. The results of our reviews are used to update the project's risk rating as necessary. Additional detail of the credit risks surrounding our Portfolio can be found in Note 6 to our financial statements in this Form 10-K.\n\n## Interest Rate and Borrowing Risks\n\nInterest rate risk is highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control.\n\nWe are subject to interest rate risk in connection with new asset originations and our borrowings, including our credit facilities, and in the future, any new floating rate assets, credit facilities or other borrowings. Because short-term borrowings are generally short-term commitments of capital, lenders may respond to market conditions, making it more difficult for us to secure continued financing. If we are not able to renew our then existing borrowings or arrange for new financing on terms acceptable to us, or if we default on our covenants or are otherwise unable to access funds under any of these borrowings, we may have to curtail our origination of new assets and/or dispose of assets. We face particular risk in this regard given that we expect many of our borrowings will have a shorter duration than the assets they finance. Increasing interest rates may reduce the demand for our investments while declining interest rates may increase the demand. Both our current and future credit facilities and other borrowings may be of limited duration and are periodically refinanced at then current market rates. We attempt to reduce interest rate risks and to minimize exposure to interest rate fluctuations through the use of fixed rate financing structures, when appropriate, whereby we seek to (1)/uni00A0match the maturities of our debt obligations with the maturities of our assets, (2)/uni00A0borrow at fixed rates for a period of time, or (3)/uni00A0match the interest rates on our assets with like-kind debt (i.e., we may finance floating rate assets with floating rate debt and fixedrate assets with fixed-rate debt), directly or through the use of interest rate swap agreements, interest rate cap agreements or other financial instruments, or through a combination of these strategies. We expect these instruments will allow us to minimize, but not eliminate, the risk that we must refinance our liabilities before the maturities of our assets and to reduce the impact of changing interest rates on our earnings. In addition to the use of traditional derivative instruments, we also seek to mitigate interest rate risk by using securitizations, syndications\n\n## Liquidity and Concentration Risk\n\nThe assets that comprise our asset portfolio are not and are not expected to be publicly traded. A portion of these assets may be subject to legal and other restrictions on resale or will otherwise be less liquid than publicly-traded securities. The illiquidity of our assets may make it difficult for us to sell such assets if the need or desire arises, including in response to changes in economic and other conditions. Certain of the projects in which we invest have one obligor and thus\n\nwe are subject to concentration risk for these investments and could incur significant losses if any of these projects perform poorly or if we are required to write down the value of any of these projects. Many of our assets, or the collateral supporting those assets, are concentrated in certain geographic areas, which may make those assets or the related collateral more susceptible to natural disasters or other regional events. See also 'Credit Risks' discussed above.\n\nand other techniques to construct a portfolio with a staggered maturity profile. We monitor the impact of interest rate changes on the market for new originations and often have the flexibility to negotiate the term of our investments to offset interest rate increases.\n\nTypically, our long-term debt is at fixed rates or we have used interest rate hedges that convert most of the floating rate debt to fixed rate. If interest rates rise, and our fixed rate debt balance remains constant, we expect the fair value of our fixed rate debt to decrease and the value of our hedges on floating rate debt to increase. See Note 3 to our financial statements in this Form 10-K for the estimated fair value of our fixed rate long-term debt, which is based on having the same debt service requirements that could have been borrowed at the date presented, at prevailing current market interest rates.\n\nOur credit facilities are variable rate lines or credit with approximately $23 million/uni00A0outstanding as of December/uni00A031, 2020. Increases in interest rates would result in higher interest expense while decreases in interest rates would result in lower interest expense. As described above, we may use various financing techniques including interest rate swap agreements, interest rate cap agreements or other financial instruments, or a combination of these strategies to mitigate the variable interest nature of these facilities. A 50 basis point increase in LIBOR would increase the quarterly interest expense related to the $23 million in variable rate borrowings by $28 thousand. Such hypothetical impact of interest rates on our variable rate borrowings does not consider the effect of any change in overall economic activity that could occur in a rising interest rate environment. Further, in the event of such a change in interest rates, we may take actions to further mitigate our exposure to such a change. However, due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects, the analysis assumes no changes in our financial structure.\n\nWe record certain of our assets at fair value in our financial statements and any changes in the discount rate would impact the value of these assets. See Note 3 of the audited financial statements in this Form 10-K.\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## Commodity Price Risk\n\nWhen we make equity or debt investments for a renewable energy project that acts as a substitute for an underlying commodity, we may be exposed to volatility in prices for that commodity. The performance of renewable energy projects that produce electricity can be impacted by volatility in the market prices of various forms of energy, including electricity, coal and natural gas. This is especially true for utility scale projects that sell power on a wholesale basis such as many of our GC projects as opposed to BTM projects which compete against the retail or delivered costs of electricity which includes the cost of transmitting and distributing the electricity to the end user.\n\nAlthough we generally focus on renewable energy projects that have the majority of their operating cash flow supported by long-term PPAs or leases, many of our projects have shorter term contracts (which may have the potential of producing higher current returns) or sell their power in the open market on a merchant basis, the cash flows of such projects, and thus the repayment of, or the returns available for, our assets, are subject to risk if energy prices change. We also attempt to mitigate our exposure through structural protections. These structural protections, which are typically in the form of a preferred return mechanism, are designed to allow recovery of our capital and\n\n## Environmental Risks\n\nOur business is impacted by the effects of climate change and various related regulatory responses. We discuss the risks and opportunities associated with the impacts of climate change in Item/uni00A07. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition\n\nand Results of Operations - Impact of climate change on our future operations. This discussion outlines potential qualitative impacts to our business, quantitative illustrations of sensitivity as well as our strategy and resilience to these risks and opportunities.\n\n## Risk Management\n\nOur ongoing active asset management and portfolio monitoring processes provide investment oversight and valuable insight into our origination, underwriting and structuring processes. These processes create value through active monitoring of the state of our markets, enforcement of existing contracts and asset management. As described above, we engage in a variety of interest rate management techniques that seek to mitigate the economic effect of interest rate changes on the values of, and returns on, some of our assets. While we have either written off or specifically identified only two transactions, amounting to approximately $19/uni00A0million (net of recoveries) on the approximately $8/uni00A0billion of transactions we originated since 2012, which represents an aggregate loss of approximately 0.2% on cumulative transactions originated over this time period, there can be no assurance that we will continue to be as successful, particularly as we invest in more credit sensitive assets or more equity investments and engage in increasing numbers of transactions with obligors other than U.S. federal government agencies. We seek to manage credit risk using thorough due diligence and underwriting processes, strong structural\n\nprotections in our loan agreements with customers and continual, active asset management and portfolio monitoring. Additionally, we have established a Finance and Risk Committee of our board of directors which discusses and reviews policies and guidelines with respect to our risk assessment and risk management for various risks, including, but not limited to, our interest rate, counter party, credit, capital availability, and refinancing risks. As it relates to environmental risks, when we underwrite and structure our investments the environmental risks and opportunities are an integral consideration to our investment parameters. While we cannot fully protect our investments, we seek to mitigate these risks by using third party experts to conduct engineering and weather analysis and insurance reviews as appropriate. Once a transaction has closed we continue to monitor the environmental risks to the portfolio. We further discuss our strategy to managing these risks in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Impact of climate change on our future operations.\n\n|\n\nan acceptable return over time. When structuring and underwriting these transactions, we evaluate these transactions using a variety of scenarios, including natural gas prices remaining low for an extended period of time. Despite these protections, as low natural gas prices continue or PPAs expire, the cash flows from certain of our projects are exposed to these market conditions and we work with the projects sponsors to minimize any impact as part of our on-going active asset management and portfolio monitoring. In the case of utility scale solar projects, we focus on owning the land under the project where our rent is paid out of project operational costs before the debt or equity in the project receives any payments.\n\nWe believe the current low prices in natural gas will increase demand for some types of our projects, such as combined heat and power, but may reduce the demand for other projects such as renewable energy that may be a substitute for natural gas. We seek to structure our energy efficiency investments so that we typically avoid exposure to commodity price risk. However, volatility in energy prices may cause building owners and other parties to be reluctant to commit to projects for which repayment is based upon a fixed monetary value for energy savings that would not decline if the price of energy declines.",

During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company made new equity investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency projects amounting to $886 million and held $1.3 billion of equity investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency projects as of December 31, 2020. The Company's determination that it does not have the power to direct the significant activities impacting each of the investees' economic performance ('power') is critical to its determination that it is not the primary beneficiary of the investee. Also, as described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, for equity method investments that contain preferences with regard to cash flows from operations, capital events and liquidation in their respective limited liability company agreements ('LLC Agreements'), the Company applies the Hypothetical Liquidation at Book Value ('HLBV') method to record its share of profits and losses on these investments.\n\nAuditing the Company's determination of whether it has power was complex and required significant judgment to determine both the activities of the investee that most significantly impact the investee's economics, and the distribution of the power among the members of the investee that ultimately determine the outcome of such activities. In addition, auditing the Company's application of the HLBV method was challenging and inherently complex, because the application is based on its interpretations of the liquidation provisions outlined within investees' LLC Agreements.\n\nWe tested controls that address the risks of material misstatement relating to: i) the determination of whether the Company has the power to direct the significant activities of the investees and ii) the recognition of its share of investees' profits and losses through use of the HLBV method. For example, we tested controls over management's review of the variable interest model and determination of whether the Company has power. We also tested controls over management's review of the HLBV method, including the application of the liquidation provisions.\n\nTo evaluate whether the Company has power over each investee, our audit procedures included, among others, inspecting LLC Agreements and evaluating management's analysis of the significant activities of the investee and which parties can direct those significant activities. For example, as part of our evaluation, we considered the purpose and design of the investee and the legal rights of each of the involved parties, including the significance of the decisions that each party makes. We also tested the rights of each party included in management's analysis by comparing such rights to the LLC Agreements.\n\nWe tested the Company's application of the HLBV method for a sample of both new and existing investments. Our audit procedures included, among others, involving tax professionals to assist in evaluating the Company's application of the liquidation provisions within the LLC Agreements. Specifically, we assessed the Company's HLBV calculations by agreeing inputs to the calculations, such as the application of stated preferred returns and allocation of tax attributes, to the terms of the LLC Agreements for each of these investments. We also performed additional procedures on the Company's HLBV calculations that included recalculating the stated preferred returns, allocations of tax attributes, and the Company's share of profits and losses of the investee.\n\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1983.\n\nTysons, Virginia\n\nFebruary 22, 2021\n\n|",

In our opinion, Hannon Armstrong Sustainable Infrastructure Capital, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on the COSO criteria.\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes and our report dated February 22, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThe Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\n\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and\n\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\n\nTysons, Virginia February 22, 2021\n\nexpenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n|",

The Company\n\nHannon Armstrong Sustainable Infrastructure Capital, Inc. (the 'Company') focuses on making investments in climate solutions by providing capital to the leading companies in the energy efficiency, renewable energy and other sustainable infrastructure markets. Our goal is to generate attractive returns from a diversified portfolio of projects with long-term and predictable cash flows from proven technologies that reduce carbon emissions or increase resilience to climate change.\n\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are hereafter referred to as 'we,' 'us,' or 'our.' Our investments take various forms, including equity, joint ventures, lending or other financing transactions, as well as real estate ownership and typically benefit from contractually committed high credit quality obligors. We also generate on-going fees through off-balance sheet securitization transactions, advisory services and asset management. We refer to the income producing assets that we hold on our balance sheet as our 'Portfolio.' Our Portfolio may include:\n\n- z Equity investments in either preferred or common structures in unconsolidated entities;\n- z Government and commercial receivables, such as loans for renewable energy and energy efficiency projects;\n- z Real estate, such as land or other assets leased for use by sustainable infrastructure projects typically under long-term leases; and\n- z Investments in debt securities of renewable energy or energy efficiency projects.\n\n## 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Basis of Presentation\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ('GAAP') requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates and such differences could be material. Certain amounts in the prior years have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. The consolidated financial statements include our accounts and controlled subsidiaries, including the Operating Partnership. All material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.\n\nFollowing the guidance for non-controlling interests in Financial Accounting Standards Board ('FASB') Accounting Standards Codification ('ASC') 810, Consolidation ('ASC 810'), references in this report to our earnings per share and our net income and stockholders' equity attributable to common stockholders do not include amounts attributable to non-controlling interests.\n\n## Consolidation\n\nWe account for our investments in entities that are considered voting interest entities or variable interest entities ('VIEs') under ASC 810 and\n\nassess whether we should consolidate these entities on an ongoing basis. We have established various special purpose entities or securitization trusts for the purpose of securitizing certain assets which are not consolidated in our financial statements as described below in Securitization of Financial Assets.\n\nSince we have assessed that we have power over and receive the benefits from those special purpose entities that are formed for the purpose of holding our government and commercial receivables and investments on our balance sheet, we have concluded we are the primary beneficiary and should consolidate these entities under the provisions of ASC 810. We also have certain subsidiaries we deem to be voting interest entities that we control through our ownership of voting interests and accordingly consolidate.\n\nCertain of our equity method investments were determined to be interests in VIEs in which we are not the primary beneficiary, as we do not direct the significant activities of these entities, and thus we account for those investments as Equity Method Investments as discussed below. Our maximum exposure to loss through these investments is limited to their recorded values. However, we may provide financial commitments to these VIEs or guarantees of certain of their obligations. Certain other equity method investments have been assessed to be voting interest entities as we exert significant influence through our ownership of voting interests, and accordingly we do not consolidate.\n\n|\n\nWe finance our business through cash on hand, borrowings under credit facilities and debt transactions, asset-backed securitization transactions and equity issuances. We also generate fee income through securitizations and syndications, by providing broker/dealer services and by managing and servicing assets owned by third parties. Some of our subsidiaries are special purpose entities that are formed for specific operations associated with investing in sustainable infrastructure receivables for specific long-term contracts.\n\nOur common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange ('NYSE') under the symbol 'HASI.' We have qualified as a real estate investment trust ('REIT') and also intend to continue to operate our business in a manner that will maintain our exemption from registration as an investment company under the 1940 Act, as amended. We operate our business through, and serve as the sole general partner of, our operating partnership subsidiary, Hannon Armstrong Sustainable Infrastructure, L.P., (the 'Operating Partnership'), which was formed to acquire and directly or indirectly own our assets.",

        "page_content": "## Equity Method Investments\n\nWe have made equity investments in various renewable energy and energy efficiency projects. These investments are typically owned in holding companies (using limited liability companies ('LLCs') taxed as partnerships) where we partner with either the operator of the project or other institutional investors. We share in the cash flows, income, and tax attributes according to a negotiated schedule (which typically does not correspond with our ownership percentages). Investors, if any, in a preferred return position typically receive a stated preferred return consisting of a priority distribution of all or a portion of the project's cash flows, and in some cases, tax attributes. Once the stated return, if applicable, is achieved, the partnership 'flips' and the operator of the project along with any other common equity investors receive a larger portion of the cash flows, with the previously preferred investors retaining an on-going residual interest.\n\nOur equity investments in renewable energy or energy efficiency projects are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting, the carrying value of these equity method investments is determined based on amounts we invested, adjusted for the equity in earnings or losses of the investee allocated based on the LLC agreement, less distributions received. For the LLC agreements which contain preferences with regard to cash flows from operations, capital events and liquidation, we reflect our share of profits and losses by determining the difference between our claim on the investee's book value at the beginning and the end of the period, which is adjusted for distributions received and contributions made. This claim is calculated as the amount we would receive if the investee were to liquidate all of its assets at the recorded amounts determined in accordance with GAAP and distribute the resulting cash to creditors and investors in accordance with their respective priorities. This method is referred to as the hypothetical liquidation at book value method ('HLBV'). Any difference between the amount of our investment and the amount of underlying equity in net assets is generally amortized over the life of the assets and liabilities to which the difference relates. Cash distributions received from these equity method investments are classified as operating activities to the extent of cumulative HLBV earnings in our consolidated statements of cash flows. Our initial investment and additional cash distributions beyond that which are classified as operating activities are classified as investing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. We typically recognize earnings one quarter in arrears for certain of these investments to allow for the receipt of financial information.\n\nWe evaluate on a quarterly basis whether our investments accounted for using the equity method have an other than temporary impairment ('OTTI'). An OTTI occurs when the estimated fair value of an investment is below the carrying value and the difference is determined to not be recoverable. This evaluation requires significant judgment regarding, but not limited to, the severity and duration of the impairment; the ability and intent to hold the securities until recovery; financial condition, liquidity, and near-term prospects of the issuer; specific events; and other factors.\n\n## Government and Commercial Receivables\n\nGovernment and commercial receivables ('receivables') include project loans and receivables. These receivables are separately presented in our balance sheet to illustrate the differing nature of the credit risk related to these assets. Unless otherwise noted, we generally have the ability and intent to hold our receivables for the foreseeable future and thus they are classified as held for investment. Our ability\n\nand intent to hold certain receivables may change from time to time depending on a number of factors including economic, liquidity and capital market conditions. At inception of the arrangement, the carrying value of receivables held for investment represents the present value of the note, lease or other payments, net of any unearned fee income, which is recognized as income over the term of the note or lease using the effective interest method. Receivables that are held for investment are carried at amortized cost, net of any unamortized acquisition premiums or discounts and include origination and acquisition costs, as applicable. Our initial investment and principal repayments of these receivables are classified as investing activities and the interest collected is classified as operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. Receivables that we intend to sell in the short-term are classified as held-for-sale and are carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value on our balance sheet. The purchases and proceeds from receivables that we intend to sell at origination are classified as operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. Interest collected is classified as an operating activity in our consolidated statements of cash flows. Certain of our receivables may include the ability to defer required interest payments in exchange for increasing the receivable balance at the borrower's option. We generally accrue this paid-in-kind ('PIK') interest when collection is expected, and cease accruing PIK interest if there is insufficient value to support the accrual or we expect that any portion of the principal or interest due is not collectible.\n\nWe evaluate our receivables for an allowance as determined under ASC Topic 326 Financial Instruments- Credit Losses ('Topic 326') and for our internally derived asset performance categories included in Note 6 on at least a quarterly basis and more frequently when economic or other conditions warrant such an evaluation. When a receivable becomes 90 days or more past due, and if we otherwise do not expect the debtor to be able to service all of its debt or other obligations, we will generally consider the receivable delinquent or impaired and place the receivable on non-accrual status and cease recognizing income from that receivable until the borrower has demonstrated the ability and intent to pay contractual amounts due. If a receivable's status significantly improves regarding the debtor's ability to service the debt or other obligations, we will remove it from non-accrual status.\n\nPrior to January 1, 2020, a receivable was also considered impaired as of the date when, based on current information and events, it was determined that it was probable that we would be unable to collect all amounts due in accordance with the original contracted terms. Many of our receivables are secured by energy efficiency and renewable energy infrastructure projects. Accordingly, we evaluated the extent and impact of any credit deterioration associated with the performance and value of the underlying project, as well as the financial and operating capability of the borrower, its sponsors or the obligor as well as any guarantors. If a receivable was impaired, we determined if a specific allowance should be recorded and recorded such allowance if the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the receivable's contractual effective rate was less than its carrying value. This estimate of cash flows also considered the estimated fair market value of the collateral less estimated selling costs if repayment was expected from the collateral.\n\nBeginning January 1, 2020, we determine our allowance based on the current expectation of credit losses over the contractual life of our receivables as required by Topic 326. We use a variety of methods in developing our allowance including discounted cash flow analysis\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## ITEM/uni00A08./uni00A0FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\n\nand probability-of-default/loss given default ('PD/LGD') methods. In developing our estimates, we consider our historical experience with our and similar assets in addition to our view of both current conditions and what we expect to occur within a period of time for which we can develop reasonable and supportable forecasts, typically two years. For periods following the reasonable and supportable forecast period, we revert to historical information when developing assumptions used in our estimates. In developing our forecasts, we consider a number of qualitative and quantitative factors in our assessment, including a project's operating results, loan-to-value ratio, any cash reserves, the ability of expected cash from operations to cover the cash flow requirements currently and into the future, key terms of the transaction, the ability of the borrower to refinance the transaction, other credit support from the sponsor or guarantor and the project's collateral value. In addition, we consider the overall economic environment, the sustainable infrastructure sector, the effect of local, industry, and broader economic factors such as unemployment rates and power prices, the impact of any variation in weather and the historical and anticipated trends in interest rates, defaults and loss severities for similar transactions. For those assets where we record our allowance using a discounted cash flow method, we have elected to record the change in allowance due solely to the passage of time through the provision for loss on receivables in our income statement. For assets where the obligor is a publicly rated entity, we consider the published historical performance of entities with similar ratings in developing our estimate of an allowance, making adjustments determined by management to be appropriate during the reasonable and supportable forecast period. We have made certain loan commitments that are within the scope of Topic 326. When estimating an allowance for these loan commitments we consider the probability of certain amounts to be funded and apply either a discounted cash flow or PD/LGD methodology as described above. We charge off receivables against the allowance, if any, when we determine the unpaid principal balance is uncollectible, net of recovered amounts. Any provision we record for an allowance is a non-cash reconciling item to cash from operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\n## Real Estate\n\nReal estate consists of land or other real estate and its related lease intangibles, net of any amortization. Our real estate is generally leased to tenants on a triple net lease basis, whereby the tenant is responsible for all operating expenses relating to the property, generally including property taxes, insurance, maintenance, repairs and capital expenditures. Certain real estate transactions may be characterized as 'failed sale-leaseback' transactions as defined under ASC Topic 842 ('Topic 842'), Leases , and thus are accounted for similarly to our Commercial Receivables as described above in Government and Commercial Receivables.\n\nFor our other real estate lease transactions that are classified as operating leases, the scheduled rental revenue typically varies during the lease term and thus rental income is recognized on a straight-line basis, unless there is considerable risk as to collectability, so as to produce a constant periodic rent over the term of the lease. Accrued rental income is the aggregate difference between the scheduled rents which vary during the lease term and the income recognized on a straight-line basis and is recorded in other assets. Expenses, if any, related to the ongoing operation of leases where we are the lessor are charged to operations as incurred. Our initial investment is classified as investing activities and income collected for rental income is classified as operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\nWhen our real estate transactions are treated as an asset acquisition with an operating lease, we typically record our real estate purchases at cost, including acquisition and closing costs, which is allocated to each tangible and intangible asset acquired on a relative fair value basis.\n\nThe fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired leased property is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant, and the 'as-if-vacant' value is then allocated to land, building and tenant improvements, if any, based on the determination of the fair values of these assets. The as-if-vacant fair value of a property is typically determined by management based on appraisals by a qualified appraiser. In determining the fair value of the identified intangibles of an acquired property, above-market and below-market in-place lease values are valued based on the present value (using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases, and (ii) management's estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease, including renewal periods reasonably certain of being exercised by the lessee.\n\nThe capitalized off-market lease values are amortized as an adjustment to rental income over the term used to value the intangible. We also record, as appropriate, an intangible asset for in-place leases. The value of the leases in place at the time of the transaction is equal to the potential income lost if the leases were not in place. The amortization of this intangible occurs over the initial term unless management believes that it is reasonably certain that the tenant would exercise the renewal option, in which case the amortization would extend through the renewal period. If a lease were to be terminated, all unamortized amounts relating to that lease would be written off.\n\n## Investments\n\nInvestments are debt securities that meet the criteria of ASC 320, Investments-Debt and Equity Securities . We have designated our debt securities as available-for-sale and carry these securities at fair value on our balance sheet. Unrealized gains and losses, to the extent not considered to be credit related, on available-for-sale debt securities are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income ('AOCI') in equity on our balance sheet. When a security is sold, we reclassify the AOCI to earnings based on specific identification. Our initial investment and principal repayments of these investments are classified as investing activities and the interest collected is classified as operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\nWe evaluate our investments for impairment on at least a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant such an evaluation. Our impairment assessment is a subjective process requiring the use of judgments and assumptions. Accordingly, we regularly evaluate the extent and impact of any credit deterioration associated with the financial and operating performance and value of the underlying project. We consider several qualitative and quantitative factors in our assessment. The primary factor in our assessment is the current fair value of the security, while other factors include changes in the credit rating, performance of the underlying project, key terms of the transaction, the value of any collateral and any support provided by the sponsor or guarantor.\n\nTo the extent that we have identified an impairment for a security, intend to hold the investment to maturity, and do not expect that we will be required to sell the security prior to recovery of the amortized cost",

    {
        "page_content": "## ITEM/uni00A08./uni00A0FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\n\nbasis, we will recognize only the credit component of the unrealized loss in earnings by recording an allowance against the amortized cost of the asset as required by Topic 326. We determine the credit component using the difference between the security's amortized cost basis and the present value of its expected future cash flows, discounted using the effective interest method or its estimated collateral value. Any remaining unrealized loss due to factors other than credit is recorded in AOCI.\n\nTo the extent we hold investments with a fair value less than the amortized cost and we have made the decision to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis, we recognize the entire portion of the impairment in earnings.\n\nPremiums or discounts on investment securities are amortized or accreted into interest income using the effective interest method.\n\n## Securitization of Financial Assets\n\nWe have established various special purpose entities or securitization trusts for the purpose of securitizing certain financial assets. We determined that the trusts used in securitizations are VIEs, as defined in ASC 810. When we conclude that we are not the primary beneficiary of certain trusts because we do not have power over those trusts' significant activities, we do not consolidate the trust. We typically serve as primary or master servicer of these trusts; however, as the servicer, we do not have the power to make significant decisions impacting the performance of the trusts.\n\nWe account for transfers of financial assets to these securitization trusts as sales pursuant to ASC 860, Transfers and Servicing ('ASC 860'), when we have concluded the transferred assets have been isolated from the transferor (i.e., put presumptively beyond the reach of the transferor and its creditors, even in bankruptcy or other receivership) and we have surrendered control over the transferred assets. We treat those trusts where we are unable to conclude that we have been isolated from the securitized financial assets as secured borrowings, retaining the assets on our balance sheet and recording the amounts due to the trust investor as non-recourse debt.\n\nFor transfers treated as sales under ASC 860, we have received true-sale-at-law and non-consolidation legal opinions for all of our securitization trust structures that support our conclusion regarding the transferred financial assets. When we sell financial assets in securitizations, we generally retain interests in the form of servicing rights and residual assets, which we refer to as securitization assets.\n\nGain or loss on the sale of financial assets is calculated based on the excess of the proceeds received from the securitization (less any transaction costs) plus any retained interests obtained over the cost basis of the assets sold. For retained interests, we generally estimate fair value based on the present value of future expected cash flows using our best estimates of the key assumptions of anticipated losses, prepayment rates, and current market discount rates commensurate with the risks involved. Cash flows related to our securitizations at origination are classified as operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\nWe initially account for all separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities at fair value and subsequently measure such servicing assets and liabilities using the amortization method. Servicing assets and liabilities are amortized in proportion to, and over the period of, estimated net servicing income with servicing income\n\nrecognized as earned. We assess servicing assets for impairment at each reporting date. If the amortized cost of servicing assets is greater than the estimated fair value, we will recognize an impairment in net income.\n\nOur other retained interest in securitized assets, the residual assets, are accounted for similarly to available-for-sale debt securities and carried at fair value. Our residual assets are evaluated for impairment on a quarterly basis. Income related to the residual assets is recognized using the effective interest rate method and included in fee income in the income statement. If there is a change in the expected cash flows related to the residual assets, we will assess whether the asset is impaired and will calculate a new yield based on the current amortized cost of the residual assets and the revised expected cash flows. This yield is used prospectively to recognize our income related to these assets.\n\n## Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents include short-term government securities, certificates of deposit and money market funds, all of which had an original maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase. These securities are carried at their purchase price, which approximates fair value.\n\n## Restricted Cash\n\nRestricted cash includes cash and cash equivalents set aside with certain lenders primarily to support obligations outstanding as of the balance sheet dates. Restricted cash is reported as part of other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 3 for disclosure of the balances of restricted cash included in other assets.\n\n## Convertible Notes\n\nWe have issued convertible senior notes that are accounted for in accordance with ASC 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options , and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging ('ASC 815'). Under ASC 815, issuers of certain convertible debt instruments are generally required to separately account for the conversion option of the convertible debt instrument as either a derivative or equity, unless it meets the scope exemption for contracts indexed to, and settled in, an issuer's own equity. Since this conversion option is both indexed to our equity and can only be settled in our common stock, we have met the scope exemption, and therefore, we are not separately accounting for the embedded conversion option. The initial issuance and any principal repayments are classified as financing activities and interest payments are classified as operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nWe elected and qualified to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, commencing with our taxable year ended December/uni00A031, 2013. We also have taxable REIT subsidiaries ('TRS') which are taxed separately, and which will generally be subject to U.S. federal, state, and local income taxes as well as taxes of foreign jurisdictions, if any. To qualify as a REIT, we must meet on an ongoing basis several organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we currently distribute at least 90% of our REIT's net taxable income before dividends paid, excluding capital gains, to our stockholders. As a REIT, we are not subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on that portion of net income that is currently distributed to our owners.",

        "page_content": "We account for income taxes under ASC 740, Income Taxes ('ASC 740') for our TRS using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities from a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period when the new rate is enacted. We evaluate any deferred tax assets for valuation allowances based on an assessment of available evidence including sources of taxable income, prior years taxable income, any existing taxable temporary differences and our future investment and business plans that may give rise to taxable income. We treat any tax credits we receive from our equity investments in renewable energy projects as reductions of federal income taxes of the year in which the credit arises. Any deferred tax impacts resulting from transfers of assets to or from our TRS are recorded as an adjustment to additional paid-in capital, as it is a transfer amongst entities under common control.\n\nWe apply ASC 740 with respect to how uncertain tax positions should be recognized, measured, presented, and disclosed in the financial statements. This guidance requires the accounting and disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing our tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are 'more likely than not' to be sustained by the applicable tax authority. We are required to analyze all open tax years, as defined by the statute of limitations, for all major jurisdictions, which includes U.S. federal and certain states.\n\n## Equity-Based Compensation\n\nIn 2013, we adopted the 2013 Hannon Armstrong Sustainable Infrastructure Capital, Inc. Equity Incentive Plan (as amended, the '2013 Plan'), which provides for grants of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units, shares of restricted common stock, phantom shares, dividend equivalent rights, long-term incentiveplan units ('LTIP units') and other restricted limited partnership units issued by our Operating Partnership and other equity-based awards. From time to time, we may grant equity or equity based awards as compensation to our independent directors, employees, advisors, consultants and other personnel under our 2013 Plan. Certain awards earned under the plan are based on achieving various performance targets, which are generally earned between 0% and 200% of the initial target, depending on the extent to which the performance target is met. In addition to performance targets, certain LTIP units issued by our Operating Partnership also require a certain level of appreciation of partnership interests to occur before parity is reached and LTIP units can be converted to limited partnership units.\n\nWe record compensation expense for grants made under the 2013 Plan in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation . We record compensation expense for unvested grants that vest solely based on service conditions on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the entire award based upon the fair market value of the grant on the date of grant. Fair market value for restricted common stock is based on our share price on the date of grant. For awards where the vesting is contingent upon achievement of certain performance targets, compensation expense is measured based on the fair market value on the grant date and is recorded over the requisite service period (which includes the performance period). Actual performance results at the end of the performance period determines\n\nthe number of shares that will ultimately be awarded. We have also issued awards where the vesting is contingent upon service being provided for a defined period and certain market conditions being met. The fair value of these awards, as measured at the grant date, is recognized over the requisite service period, even if the market conditions are not met. The grant date fair value of these awards was developed by an independent appraiser using a Monte Carlo simulation.\n\n## Earnings Per Share\n\nWe compute earnings per share of common stock in accordance with ASC 260, Earnings Per Share . Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income attributable to controlling stockholders (after consideration of the earnings allocated to unvested grants under the 2013 Plan, if applicable) by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period excluding the weighted average number of unvested grants under the 2013 Plan, if applicable ('participating securities' as defined in Note 12). Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income attributable to controlling stockholders (after consideration of the earnings allocated to unvested grants under the 2013 Plan, if applicable) by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period plus other potential common stock instruments if they are dilutive. Other potentially dilutive common stock instruments include our unvested restricted stock, other equity-based awards, and convertible notes. The restricted stock and other equity-based awards are included if they are dilutive using the treasury stock method. The treasury stock method assumes that theoretical proceeds received for future service provided is used to purchase shares of treasury stock at the average market price per share of common stock, which is deducted from the total shares of potential common stock included in the calculation. When unvested grants are dilutive, the earnings allocated to these dilutive unvested grants are not deducted from the net income attributable to controlling stockholders when calculating diluted earnings per share. The convertible notes are included if they are dilutive using the ifconverted method. The if-converted method removes interest expense related to the convertible notes from the net income attributable to controlling stockholders and includes the weighted average shares of potential common stock over the period issuable upon conversion of the note. No adjustment is made for shares of potential common stock that are anti-dilutive during a period.\n\n## Segment Reporting\n\nWe make equity and debt investments in the energy efficiency, renewable energy, and other sustainable infrastructure markets. We manage our business as a single portfolio and report all of our activities as one business segment.\n\n## Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\n\n## Credit Losses\n\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued Topic 326 which significantly changes how entities will recognize and measure credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that are not measured at fair value through net income. Topic 326 has replaced the 'incurred loss' approach under existing guidance with an 'expected loss' model for instruments measured at amortized cost and require entities to record allowances for expected losses from available-for-sale debt securities rather than reduce the amortized cost, as previously required. It also\n\n|",

Topic 326 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 and was adopted through a cumulativeeffect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. Topic 326 became effective for us on January 1, 2020.

Fair Value Measurements\n\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The fair value accounting guidance provides a three-level hierarchy for classifying financial instruments. The levels of inputs used to determine the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities carried on the balance sheet at fair value and for those which only disclosure of fair value is required are characterized in accordance with the fair value hierarchy established by ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements . Where inputs for a financial asset or liability fall in more than one level in the fair value hierarchy, the financial asset or liability is classified in its entirety based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of that financial asset or liability. We use our judgment and consider factors specific to the financial assets and liabilities in determining the significance of an input to the fair value measurements. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, only our residual assets related to our securitization trusts and investments were carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets on a recurring basis. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:\n\nreceivables. The allowance for our government receivables recorded as of the adoption date of Topic 326 is not material. We did not have a material impact to the accounting for our available-for-sale securities portfolio.\n\nOther accounting standards updates issued before February 22, 2021 and effective after December 31, 2020, are not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\n\n- z Level 2-Observable prices that are based on inputs not quoted on active markets, but corroborated by market data.\n- z Level 3-Unobservable inputs are used when little or no market data is available.\n\nThe tables below illustrate the estimated fair value of our financial instruments on our balance sheet. Unless otherwise discussed below, fair value for our Level 2 and Level 3 measurements is measured using a discounted cash flow model, contractual terms and inputs which consist of base interest rates and spreads over base rates which are based upon market observation and recent comparable transactions. An increase in these inputs would result in a lower fair value and a decline would result in a higher fair value. Our senior unsecured notes and convertible notes are valued using a market based approach and observable prices. The receivables held-for-sale, if any, are carried at the lower of cost or fair value.\n\n- z Level 1-Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date.\n\n|                                    | As of December 31, 2020   | As of December 31, 2020   | As of December 31, 2020   |\n|------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n| (in millions)                      | Fair Value                | Carrying Value            | Level                     |\n| Assets                             |                           |                           |                           |\n| Government receivables             | $  282  $                 | 248                       | Level 3                   |\n| Commercial receivables             | 1,018                     | 965                       | Level 3                   |\n| Investments (1)                    | 55                        | 55                        | Level 3                   |\n| Securitization residual assets (2) | 159                       | 159                       | Level 3                   |\n| Liabilities (3)                    |                           |                           |                           |\n| Credit facilities                  | $                         | 23  $ 23                  | Level 3                   |\n| Non-recourse debt                  | 678                       | 605                       | Level 3                   |\n| Senior unsecured notes             | 1,362                     | 1,299                     | Level 2                   |\n| Convertible notes                  | 552                       | 296                       | Level 2                   |\n\n- (1)  The amortized cost of our investments as of December 31, 2020, was $51 million.\n- (2)  Included in securitization assets on the consolidated balance sheet.

The weighted average discount rate used to determine the fair value of our securitization residual assets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 was 3.8% and 4.4%, respectively.\n\n## Non-recurring Fair Value Measurements\n\nOur financial statements may include non-recurring fair value measurements related to acquisitions and non-monetary transactions, if any. Assets acquired in a business combination are recorded at their fair value. We may use third party valuation firms to assist us with developing our estimates of fair value.\n\n## Concentration of Credit Risk\n\nGovernment and commercial receivables, real estate leases, and debt investments consist primarily of U.S. federal government-backed receivables, investment grade state and local government receivables and receivables from various sustainable infrastructure projects and do not, in our view, represent a significant concentration of credit risk. Additionally, certain of our investments are collateralized by projects concentrated in certain geographic regions throughout the United States. These investments typically have structural credit protections to mitigate our risk exposure and, in most cases, the projects are insured for estimated physical loss which helps to mitigate the possible risk from these concentrations.\n\nWe had cash deposits that are subject to credit risk as shown below:\n\n|                                                                | December 31,   |   December 31, |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| (in millions)                                                  | 2020           |           2019 |\n| Cash deposits                                                  | $  286 $       |              6 |\n| Restricted cash deposits (included in other assets)            | 24             |            101 |\n| TOTAL CASH DEPOSITS                                            | $ 310 $        |            107 |\n| Amount of cash deposits in excess of amounts federally insured | $ 309 $        |            105 |\n\n## 4. Non-Controlling Interest\n\nUnits of limited partnership interests in the Operating Partnership ('OP/uni00A0units') that are owned by limited partners other than us are included in non-controlling interest on our consolidated balance sheets. The non-controlling interest holders are generally allocated their pro rata share of income, other comprehensive income and equity transactions.\n\nThe outstanding OP units held by outside limited partners represent less than 1% of our outstanding OP units and are redeemable by the limited partners for cash, or at our option, for a like number of shares of our common stock. Non-controlling interest holders exchanged 57,400 OP units for the same number of shares of common stock during the year ended December 31, 2020. OP units of 3,703 were exchanged\n\nfor the same number of shares of our common stock during the year ended December 31, 2019.\n\nWe have also granted to members of our leadership team and directors LTIP Units pursuant to the 2013 plan. These LTIP Units are held by HASI Management HoldCo LLC. The LTIP Units are designed to qualify as profits interests in the Operating Partnership and initially will have a capital account balance of zero and, therefore, will not have full parity with OP units with respect to liquidating distributions or other rights. However, the amended and restated agreement of limited partnership of the Operating Partnership (the 'OP Agreement') provides that 'book gains,' or economic appreciation, in the Operating Partnership will be\n\n|",

Under the terms of the OP Agreement, the Operating Partnership will revalue its assets upon the occurrence of certain specified events, and any increase in valuation from the time of grant until such event will be allocated first to the holders of LTIP Units to equalize the capital accounts of such\n\nholders with the capital accounts of OP unit holders. Once this has occurred, the LTIP Units will achieve full parity with the OP units for all purposes, including with respect to liquidating distributions and redemption rights. In addition to these attributes, there are vesting and settlement conditions similar to our other equity-based awards as discussed in Notes 2 and 11.\n\n## 5. Securitization of Financial Assets\n\nThe following summarizes certain transactions with securitization trusts:\n\n|                                                  | As of and for the year ended December 31,   | As of and for the year ended December 31,   |   As of and for the year ended December 31, |\n|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| (in millions)                                    | 2020                                        | 2019                                        |                                        2018 |\n| Gains on securitizations                         | $  50 $                                     | 24 $                                        |                                          33 |\n| Cost of financial assets securitized             | 292                                         | 853                                         |                                         688 |\n| Proceeds from securitizations                    | 342                                         | 877                                         |                                         721 |\n| Residual and servicing assets                    | 164                                         | 124                                         |                                          72 |\n| Cash received from residual and servicing assets | 12                                          | 7                                           |                                           3 |\n\nIn connection with securitization transactions, we typically retain servicing responsibilities and residual assets. We generally receive annual servicing fees of typically up to 0.20% of the outstanding balance. We may periodically make servicer advances, which are subject to credit risk. Included in securitization assets in our consolidated balance sheets are our servicing assets at amortized cost, our residual assets at fair value, and our servicing advances at cost, if any. Our residual assets are subordinate to investors' interests, and their values are subject to credit, prepayment and interest rate risks on the transferred financial assets. Other than these residual assets, the investors and the securitization trusts have no recourse to our other assets for failure of debtors to pay when due. In computing gains and losses on securitizations, we use discount rates based on a review of comparable market transactions including Level 3 unobservable inputs which consist of base interest rates and spreads over these base rates. Depending on the nature of the transaction risks, the discount rate ranged from 2% to 8%.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, our Managed Assets totaled $7.2 billion and $6.2 billion, respectively, of which\n\n## 6. Our Portfolio\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, our Portfolio included approximately $2.9 billion of equity method investments, receivables, real estate and investments on our balance sheet. The equity method investments represent our non-controlling equity investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency projects and land. The receivables and investments are typically collateralized by contractually committed debt obligations of government entities or private high credit quality obligors and are often supported by additional forms of credit enhancement, including security interests and supplier guaranties. The real estate is typically land and related lease intangibles for long-term leases to wind and solar projects. Our analysis of our Portfolio has historically been analyzed by type of obligor categorized as either government or commercial obligors and whether those obligors are investment grade or non-investment grade. In conjunction with the adoption of Topic 326, we re-evaluated our reporting for this disclosure and have modified our credit quality disclosure to provide more detail of how\n\n$4.3 billion and $4.1 billion, respectively, were securitized assets held in unconsolidated securitization trusts. There were no securitization credit losses in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, or 2018. As of December 31, 2020, there were no material payments from debtors to the securitization trusts that were greater than 90 days past due.\n\nReceivables from contracts for the installation of energy efficiency and other technologies are $100 million of our securitization residual assets. These technologies are installed in facilities owned by, or operated for or by, federal, state or local government entities where the ultimate obligor for the receivable is a governmental entity. The contracts may have guarantees of energy savings from third-party service providers, which typically are entities rated investment grade by an independent rating agency. The remainder of our securitization residual assets are related to contracts where the underlying cash flows are secured by an interest in real estate which are typically senior in terms of repayment to other financings.\n\nthe assets in our Portfolio are performing. Additionally, as discussed in Note 2, we have adopted Topic 326 which requires the establishment of an allowance at origination for our receivables expected over the life of the asset rather than at the time it is probable that a loss has been incurred. These allowances are reflected in our disclosures below and are not necessarily an indication that an actual loss has been incurred.\n\nWe determine our expectation of credit losses related to our investments by evaluating a number of qualitative and quantitative credit criteria including a project's operating results, loan-to-value ratio, any cash reserves, the ability of expected cash from operations to cover the cash flow requirements currently and into the future, key terms of the transaction, the ability of the borrower to refinance the transaction, the financial and operating capability of the borrower, its sponsors or the obligor as well as any guarantors and the project's collateral value. In addition, when deriving our reasonable and supportable forecasts we consider the overall economic environment,\n\n|\n\n|",

As of December 31, 2019, we had an allowance for loss on receivables on specific assets of $8 million discussed above with a Performance Rating of 3. At adoption on January 1, 2020, we recorded an additional pretax allowance for loss on receivables of $17 million which reflects our estimated loss as of that date. Quarterly, we update that expected loss\n\nto reflect both the expected loss on newly originated receivables and any changes in the expected loss on existing receivables. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we increased the allowance on our receivables by $10 million primarily as a result of additional loans and loan commitments made during this period. While macroeconomic indicators we consider in our analyses including unemployment rates and power prices degraded over the year ended December 31, 2020, we have not seen these factors translate to material default rates, and the contracted nature of many of our assets protects us from low spot energy prices.\n\nBelow is a summary of the carrying value, expected loan funding commitments, and allowance by type of receivable or 'Portfolio Segment,' as defined by Topic 326, as of December 31, 2020 and January 1, 2020:\n\n|",

The sum of included financings after taking into account the applicable valuation percentages and any changes in the valuation of the financings in\n\naccordance with the Loan Agreements determines the borrowing capacity, subject to the overall facility limits described above.

As of the inception of the unsecured credit facility, the applicable margins are 2.25% for LIBOR-based loans and 1.25% for prime rate-based loans. The unsecured credit facility contains terms, conditions, covenants, and representations and warranties that are\n\ncustomary and typical for a transaction of this nature, including various affirmative and negative covenants, and limitations on the incurrence of liens and indebtedness, investments, fundamental organizational changes, dispositions, changes in the nature of business, transactions with affiliates, use of proceeds, stock repurchases, and dividends we can declare. The unsecured credit facility also includes customer events of default, which may result in the Company having to post cash collateral equal to 102% of any amounts of outstanding letters of credit drawn on the unsecured credit facility.

There is no recourse for repayment of these obligations other than to the applicable borrower and any collateral pledged as security for the obligations. Generally, the assets and credit of these entities are not available to satisfy any of our other debts and obligations. The creditors can only look to the borrower, the cash flows of the pledged assets and any other collateral pledged, to satisfy the debt and we are not otherwise liable for nonpayment of such cash flows. The debt agreements contain terms, conditions, covenants, and representations and warranties that are customary and typical for transactions of this nature, including limitations on the incurrence of liens and indebtedness, investments, fundamental organizational changes, dispositions, changes in the nature of business, transactions with affiliates, use of proceeds and stock repurchases. The agreements\n\nalso include customary events of default, the occurrence of which may result in termination of the agreements, acceleration of amounts due, and accrual of default interest. We typically act as servicer for the debt transactions. We are in compliance with all covenants as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n\nWe have guaranteed the accuracy of certain of the representations and warranties and other obligations of certain of our subsidiaries under certain of the debt agreements and provided an indemnity against certain losses from 'bad acts' of such subsidiaries including fraud, failure to disclose a material fact, theft, misappropriation, voluntary bankruptcy or unauthorized transfers. In the case of the debt secured by certain of our renewable energy equity interests, we have also guaranteed the compliance of our subsidiaries with certain tax matters and certain obligations if our joint venture partners exercise their right to withdraw from our partnerships.\n\n## ITEM/uni00A08./uni00A0FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA",

To the extent there are additional cash flows received from our investments in renewable energy projects serving as collateral for certain of our non-recourse debt facilities, these additional cash flows are required to be used to make additional principal payments against the respective debt. Any additional principal payments made due to these provisions may impact the anticipated balance at maturity of these financings. To the extent there are not sufficient cash flows received from those investments pledged as collateral, the investor has no recourse against other corporate assets to recover any shortfalls.\n\n## Senior Unsecured Notes\n\nWe have outstanding senior unsecured notes issued jointly by certain of our TRS and are guaranteed by the Company and certain other subsidiaries (the 'Senior Unsecured Notes'). The Senior Unsecured Notes are subject to covenants which limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness and require us to maintain unencumbered assets of not less than 120% of our unsecured debt. These covenants will terminate on any date at which the Senior Unsecured Notes have been rated investment grade by two of the three major credit rating agencies and no event of default has occurred. We are in compliance with all of our covenants as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. The Senior Unsecured Notes impose certain requirements in the event that we merge with or sell substantially all of our assets to another entity. The proceeds of our Senior Unsecured Notes are used to acquire or refinance, in whole or in part, eligible green projects, including assets which are neutral to negative on incremental carbon emissions.\n\nThe following are summarized terms of the Senior Unsecured Notes:\n\n| (in millions)   | Outstanding   Principal Amount   | Maturity Date      | Stated   Interest Rate   | Interest Payment Dates           | Redemption Terms  Modification Date   |\n|-----------------|----------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| 2024 Notes      | $ 500 (1)                        | July 15, 2024      | 5.25%                    | January 15 th  and July 15 th    | July 15, 2021 (2)                     |\n| 2025 Notes      | 400                              | April 15, 2025     | 6.00%                    | April 15 th  and October 15 th   | April 15, 2022 (2)                    |\n| 2030 Notes      | 375 (3)                          | September 15, 2030 | 3.75%                    | February 15 th  and August 15 th | September 15, 2022 (4)                |\n\n|",

There are no cash settlement provisions in the convertible notes and the conversion option can only be settled through physical delivery of our common stock. Additionally, upon the occurrence of certain fundamental changes involving us, holders of the convertible notes may require us to redeem all or a portion of their convertible notes for cash at a price of 100% of the principal amount outstanding, plus accrued and unpaid interest.\n\nWe have a redemption option to call the 2022 Convertible Notes prior to maturity (i) on or after March 1, 2022 and (ii) at any time if such a redemption is deemed reasonably necessary to preserve our qualification as a REIT. The redemption price will be equal to the principal of the notes being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest. In the event of redemption after March 1, 2022, there will be an additional make-whole premium paid to the holder of the redeemed notes unless the redemption is deemed reasonably necessary to preserve our qualification as a REIT.

Commitments and Contingencies\n\n## Leases\n\nWe lease office space at our headquarters in Annapolis, Maryland under an operating lease entered into in 2011 and amended in 2013 and 2017 to add additional space. The lease provides for operating expense reimbursements and annual escalations that are amortized over the respective lease terms on a straight-line basis. Lease payments under this lease commenced in 2012 and incremental payments related to the amendments commenced in 2014 and 2017. The lease expires in 2027.\n\nRent expense was less than $1 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Future gross minimum lease payments are less than $1 million per year during the remaining term of the lease.\n\n## Litigation\n\nThe nature of our operations exposes us to the risk of claims and litigation in the normal course of our business. We are not currently subject to any legal proceedings that are probable of having a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\n\n## Guarantees\n\nIn connection with some of our transactions, we have provided certain limited representations, warranties, covenants and/or provided an\n\n## 10. Income Tax\n\nWe recorded an income tax benefit of approximately $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an $8 million tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2019, and a $2 million tax expense for the year for the year ended 2018 related to the activities of our TRS. Of our $3 million benefit for the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately $1 million is related to the remeasurement of deferred\n\ntax liabilities as the result of the changes in our estimated state tax rates. The federal income tax expense and benefits recorded were determined using a rate of 21%. Our deferred tax assets and liabilities were measured using a federal rate of 21%. Below is a reconciliation between the federal statutory rates of our TRS entities and our effective tax rates for the years ended December 31:\n\n|                                   | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   |\n|-----------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Federal statutory income tax rate | 21%    | 21%    | 21%    |\n| Changes in rate resulting from:   |        |        |        |\n| Share-based compensation          | (13)%  | 2%     | (1)%   |\n| Equity method investments         | (12)%  | (2)%   | (11)%  |\n| Other                             | (4)%   | (1)%   | 2%     |\n| Valuation allowance               | -%     | (15)%  | 2%     |\n| Effective tax rate                | (8)%   | 5%     | 13%    |\n\nindemnity against certain losses resulting from our own actions, including related to certain investment tax credits.  As of December/uni00A031, 2020, there have been no such actions resulting in claims against the Company.\n\nWe have made a guarantee related to the financing of one of our joint venture entities that owns debt securities of energy efficiency projects. The entity entered into a financing arrangement where we have guaranteed the obligations of the entity related to this financing, which includes collateral posting requirements as well as repayment of the financing at maturity in February 2021. As of December 31, 2020, our maximum obligation under this guarantee is approximately $60 million. We have executed a separate agreement with the other joint venture partner pursuant to which it is liable for 15% of this obligation repayable to us.\n\n## COVID-19\n\nThe COVID-19 global pandemic has brought forth uncertainty and disruption to the global economy. As of December 31, 2020, we have not recorded any contingencies on our balance sheet related to COVID-19 with the exception of any allowances related to our receivables described in Note 6. To the extent COVID-19 continues to cause dislocations in the global economy, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows may be adversely impacted.",

Our deferred tax liability is included in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other on our consolidated balance sheet. Deferred income taxes represent the tax effect from continuing operations of the differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets (liabilities) include the following as of December 31:\n\n| (in millions)                          | 2020   | 2019     |\n|----------------------------------------|--------|----------|\n| Net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards | $      | 63  $ 31 |\n| Tax credit carryforwards               | 15     | 13       |\n| Share-based compensation               | 3      | 3        |\n| Other                                  | 9      | 3        |\n| Valuation allowance                    | -      | -        |\n| Gross deferred tax assets              | 90     | 50       |\n| Receivables basis difference           | $ (12) | $ (12)   |\n| Equity method investments              | (86)   | (52)     |\n| Gross deferred tax liabilities         | (98)   | (64)     |\n| NET DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES           | $ (8)  | $ (14)   |\n\nWe have unused NOLs of $264 million and tax credits of approximately $15 million. Approximately, $74 million of our NOLs will begin to expire in 2035. If our TRS entities were to experience a change in control as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, the TRS's ability to utilize NOLs in the years after the change in control would be limited. Similar rules and limitation may apply for state tax purposes as well. Of our NOLs, $190 million were added in taxable years after 2018 which are not subject to expiration but are limited to 80% of taxable income. Our tax credits begin to expire in 2034.\n\nWe have no examinations in progress, none are expected at this time, and years 2017 through 2020 are open. As of December 2020 and 2019, we had no uncertain tax positions. Our policy is to recognize interest expense and penalties related to income tax matters as a component of general and administrative expense. There were no accrued interest and penalties as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and no interest and penalties were recognized during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, or 2018.\n\nFor federal income tax purposes, the cash dividends paid for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 are characterized as follows:\n\n|                      | 2020   | 2019   |\n|----------------------|--------|--------|\n| Common distributions |        |        |\n| Ordinary income      | -%     | 18%    |\n| Return of capital    | 100%   | 82%    |\n|                      | 100%   | 100%   |\n\n## 11.

During the year ended December 31, 2020, our board of directors awarded employees and directors 514,969 shares of restricted stock, restricted stock units, and LTIP Units that vest from 2021 to 2024. As of December 31, 2020, as it relates to previously issued restricted stock awards with performance conditions, we have concluded that it is probable that the performance conditions will be met. Refer to Note 4 for background on the LTIP Units.\n\nA summary of equity-based compensation expense and the fair value of shares and LTIP Units vested on the vesting date for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 is as follows:\n\n| (in millions)                               | 2020    | 2019   |   2018 |\n|---------------------------------------------|---------|--------|--------|\n| Equity-based compensation expense           | $ 17  $ | 14  $  |     10 |\n| Fair value of awards vested on vesting date | 39      | 19     |      7 |\n\nThe total unrecognized compensation expense related to awards of shares of restricted stock,  restricted stock units, and LTIP Units was approximately $11 million as of December 31, 2020.

Earnings per Share of Common Stock\n\nBoth the net income or loss attributable to the non-controlling OP units and the non-controlling limited partners' outstanding OP units have been excluded from the basic earnings per share and the diluted earnings per share calculations attributable to common stockholders. Unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and are excluded from net income available to common shareholders in the computation of earnings per share\n\npursuant to the two-class method. Certain share based awards are included in the diluted share count to the extent they are dilutive as discussed in Note 2. To the extent our convertible notes are dilutive under the if-converted method, we add back the interest expense to the numerator and include the weighted average shares of potential common stock over the period issuable upon conversion of the note in the denominator in calculating dilutive EPS as described in Note 2.\n\nThe computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share of common stock is as follows:\n\n|                                                                                                                        | Year ended December 31,   | Year ended December 31,   | Year ended December 31,   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n| (dollars in millions, except share and per share data)                                                                 | 2020                      | 2019                      | 2018                      |\n| Numerator:                                                                                                             |                           |                           |                           |\n| Net income (loss) attributable to controlling stockholders and participating  securities                               | $ 82.4  $                 | 81.6  $                   | 41.6                      |\n| Less: Dividends and distributions to participating securities                                                          | (0.9)                     | (1.4)                     | (1.8)                     |\n| Undistributed earnings attributable to participating securities                                                        | -

We describe our accounting for the non-controlling equity investments in Note 2.\n\nThe following is a summary of the consolidated financial position and results of operations of the significant entities accounted for using the equity method.\n\n| in millions                                  | SunStrong Capital  Holdings, LLC   | Jupiter Equity  Holdings, LLC   | Other   Investments (1)   | Total   |\n|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------|---------|\n| Balance Sheet                                |                                    |                                 |                           |         |\n| As of September 30, 2020                     |                                    |                                 |                           |         |\n| Current assets                               | $ 94  $                            | 88                              | $ 233  $                  | 415     |\n| Total assets                                 | 1,472                              | 2,689                           | 4,992                     | 9,153   |\n| Current liabilities                          | 48                                 | 229                             | 647                       | 924     |\n| Total liabilities                            | 1,179                              | 340                             | 2,225                     | 3,744   |\n| Members' equity                              | 293                                | 2,349                           | 2,767                     | 5,409   |\n| As of December 31, 2019                      |                                    |                                 |                           |         |\n| Current assets                               | 99                                 | 289                             | 254                       | 642     |\n| Total assets                                 | 1,335                              | 1,892                           | 3,270                     | 6,497   |\n| Current liabilities                          | 54                                 | 209                             | 230                       | 493     |\n| Total liabilities                            | 1,010                              | 270                             | 975                       | 2,255   |\n| Members' equity                              | 325                                | 1,622                           | 2,295                     | 4,242   |\n| Income Statement                             |                                    |                                 |                           |         |\n| For the nine months ended September 30, 2020 |                                    |                                 |                           |         |\n| Revenue                                      | 94                                 | 19                              | 275                       | 388     |\n| Income from continuing operations            | (9)                                | (36)                            | (84)                      | (129)   |\n| Net income                                   | (9)                                | (36)                            | (84)                      | (129)   |\n| For the year ended December 31, 2019         |                                    |                                 |                           |         |\n| Revenue                                      | 102                                | -                               | 155                       | 257     |\n| Income from continuing operations            | (16)                               | 34                              | (73)                      | (55)    |\n| Net income                                   | (16)                               | 34                              | (73)                      | (55)    |\n| For the year ended December 31, 2018         |                                    |                                 |                           |         |\n| Revenue                                      | -                                  | -                               | 176                       | 176     |\n| Income from continuing operations            | -                                  | -                               | (42)                      | (42)    |\n| Net income                                   | -                                  | -                               | (42)                      | (42)    |\n\n## 14. Defined Contribution Plan\n\nWe administer a 401(k) savings plan, a defined contribution plan covering substantially all of our employees. Employees in the plan may contribute up to the maximum annual IRS limit before taxes via payroll deduction. Under the plan, we provide a dollar for dollar match for the first 4% of the employee's contributions and a $0.50 per dollar match for the next 2% of employee contributions. We contributed less than $1/uni00A0million under the plan for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\n\n|",

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\n\nA review and evaluation was performed by our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-K. Based on that review and evaluation, the chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that our current disclosure controls and procedures, as designed and implemented, were effective. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that it will detect or uncover failures within our company to disclose material information otherwise required to be set forth in our periodic reports.\n\n## Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by our board of directors, management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that:\n\n- \u00b7 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of our company;\n- \u00b7 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and\n\n## ITEM 9B.  OTHER INFORMATION\n\nNone.\n\n|\n\n- \u00b7 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\nOur management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020. In making this assessment, our management used criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013 Framework).\n\nBased on this assessment, our management believes that, as of December 31, 2020, our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria.\n\n## Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2020 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n\nOur company's independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of our company's internal control over financial reporting. This report appears on page 84 of this annual report on Form 10-K.",
