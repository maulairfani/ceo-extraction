Our priority is to help the UK recover in an effective, inclusive and sustainable/uni00A0way.\n\nWe're giving our customers the flexibility they need to manage their finances, while helping protect them from fraud.\n\nWe're working with the Government to provide loans and working capital support for the businesses of Britain , at the same time as providing the sectorby-sector expertise needed to help them adapt for success.\n\nWe're keeping our colleagues as safe as we can while they provide essential services to people across the UK. And we're working with the Government to get practical help to those who need it most, in communities across all the regions of the UK.\n\nFor over 320 years, with our unique family of brands, we have supported Britain through the good times and the bad and this time is no different. In 2021, we will continue to do all we can to Help Britain Recover, as this is in the best interests of all our stakeholders. More information on our next chapter on pages 36 to 45.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Supporting businesses\n\nAs a result of the lockdowns, businesses are facing challenges like never before. Many have been forced to close and furlough their staff, while others have had to adapt to external changes. Whatever situation our business customers have faced, we've stood by their side.\n\nWe have supported them to obtain more than \u00a312/uni00A0billion in finance through the Governmentbacked lending schemes, helped them to manage their cash flow by granting around 34,000 capital repayment holidays and helped their working capital by agreeing around 22,000 fee-free overdrafts to businesses.\n\nWe are doing our best to help and advise British businesses of all sizes so that as lockdown eases they can adapt their business models to re-open safely and profitably.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Supporting customers\n\nMany people continue to feel the impact of the past year on their personal finances. We have approved around 1.3 million payment holidays for customers who have mortgages, personal loans, credit cards and car finance with us since the start of the outbreak, and are helping our customers to replan their finances.\n\nOur dedicated telephone services, with extended opening hours for the over 70s and NHS workers, have taken around 880,000 calls since the end of March, allowing us to prioritise support for these customers and their urgent needs. We've also proactively made over 750,000 calls to check on the wellbeing of our vulnerable customers. These services will continue.",

It has been a year of unprecedented challenge in which many people have suffered but also one in which the Group has proved it can make a difference and truly support its customers and the UK economy.\n\nHaving joined the Board in October and taken over the role of Chair from 1 January 2021, I have been hugely impressed with the response of the Group to the COVID-19 crisis and the achievements during the last year. I/uni00A0am particularly proud of our workforce and the continued commitment and dedication in supporting our customers and each other. We/uni00A0provided over \u00a312 billion of lending to businesses through Government-backed schemes and granted around 1.3 million payment holidays to retail customers, providing vital support at a time of crisis.\n\n## Helping Britain Recover and Strategic Review 2021\n\nThe role of Chair is to help ensure that the Board and the executive team are focusing on the right issues and developing the right purpose and strategy, executing it effectively and with the right values and cultures as an organisation.\n\nWe recognise that the focus of the Group's purpose must evolve in response to the current environment and changing customer needs and expectations. Many individual and business customers have been impacted by the crisis and we have a responsibility, as the UK's largest bank, to help these customers and Help Britain Recover. This is completely aligned with our ongoing purpose of Helping Britain Prosper, and is in the best interests of all stakeholders.\n\nThe Group has been playing a leading role in the immediate national response, supporting customers, colleagues and our communities through the crisis and beyond.\n\nRobin Budenberg Chair\n\nIn September 2020, the Group launched The Big Conversation and since then we have brought together more than 900 people, including industry leaders, local politicians and expert voices in virtual sessions around the country to discuss what the pandemic has meant for them and what support they need to survive and thrive.\n\nWe have subsequently published the findings which can provide insight and direction to different stakeholder groups as we explore together how we can help to rebuild the economy.  We are privileged to be able to use our comprehensive regional and national network and our sector expertise to bring together people with a diverse range of perspectives.\n\nAlthough the next couple of years will be challenging, the pandemic provides a unique opportunity for banks to evidence their importance to customers and the economy and we will continue to play the important role expected/uni00A0of us as the UK's leading financial services provider. We will help Britain rebuild sustainably by playing our part in the country's economic recovery.\n\nHelping Britain Recover is at the heart of Strategic Review 2021, which launched the same day as our full year results, in February 2021 and will further enhance our capabilities to create the UK's preferred financial partner for personal customers and the best bank for business. Having been heavily involved in the development of the evolution of strategy, the Board is excited about the opportunities for the/uni00A0Group.\n\nGiven the Group's unique position in the UK economy, as part of Strategic Review 2021, we have identified five areas where we can make a transformational societal impact and which are also deeply integrated into the strategic development of our business: Help rebuild households' financial health and wellbeing, Support businesses to recover, adapt and grow, Expand availability of affordable and quality homes, Accelerate the transition to a low carbon economy and Build an inclusive society and organisation.\n\nThese five priorities for 2021 consist of a number of commitments in areas where we can make the biggest difference, create value for our customers and, given they will enable us to build a sustainable and inclusive business, will also benefit shareholders. Further detail on our purpose and the areas of focus are provided on pages/uni00A038 and 39.\n\n## Continued transformation of the Group\n\nThe Group's significant investment in transformation and digital in recent years has clearly positioned us well. It is also clear that we will need to continue to evolve and invest to build on this advantage. The COVID-19 crisis, which is having an unprecedented impact on the overall economy, on businesses across sectors, and on how we all live our lives, has accelerated the pace of change in the banking/uni00A0industry. It has also highlighted new emerging trends that will shape the industry in the future.\n\nTo compete effectively against new competitors we will need to continue to modernise our technology architecture, transform how we work and enhance our use of data across the business. As an efficient, scale operator with strong multi-brand, multichannel capabilities and a fantastic customer franchise we have significant advantages, but sustainable success will only be possible through further embracing technology and enhancing our customer propositions.\n\nTo do this, we need to continue our journey to become a much more flexible organisation with a more agile culture and faster decisionmaking. We will need to reinvent the way we do business and  are increasingly likely to partner with specialist technology and fintech providers. The first stages of this approach are laid out in our evolution of strategy, Strategic Review 2021. I believe it is a solid foundation for our continued transformation and delivering strong and superior returns.",

The strategy is supported by further investment in four specific capabilities: a modernised technology architecture, integrated payments, creating a data-driven organisation and reimagined ways of working\n\n## Helping Britain Recover: We have identified five priority areas, based on where we feel we can make the most difference\n\n## Help rebuild households' financial health and wellbeing\n\n- We will have over 6,500/uni00A0colleagues trained to support customers to build their financial resilience\n- We will expand our existing 'Mental Health Accessible' accreditation for Lloyds Bank across Halifax and Bank of Scotland\n- We will partner with independent debt advice organisations to ensure customers have access to practical support\n\n## Support businesses to recover, adapt and/uni00A0grow\n\n- We will develop appropriate recovery plans for our customers, supported by 1,100 business specialists\n- We will support at least 75,000 UK businesses to start up in 2021\n- We will help at least 185,000 small businesses boost their digital capability\n- Strategic Review 2021: Building the UK's preferred financial partner pages 36 to 45\n\n## Expand availability of affordable and quality homes\n\n- We will provide \u00a310/uni00A0billion of lending to first-time-buyers and lead a national conversation on access to the housing market\n- We will provide \u00a31.5/uni00A0billion of new funding support, incl. \u00a3500 million in ESG-linked funding, in support of the social housing sector\n- We will assess the energy retrofit requirements of over 200,000 homes in the social housing sector\n\n## Accelerate the transition to a low carbon economy\n\n- We will expand the funding available under our green finance initiatives from \u00a33/uni00A0billion to \u00a35/uni00A0billion\n- We will ensure our own operations are net zero by 2030\n- We will become the first major pensions and insurance provider to target halving the carbon footprint of all our investments by 2030\n- We will introduce a flagship fossil fuel-free fund to support green growth\n\n## Build an inclusive society and organisation\n\n- We will set new aspirations for 50/uni00A0per/uni00A0cent women, 3/uni00A0per cent Black and 13/uni00A0per cent Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic colleagues in senior roles by 2025\n- We will maintain our \u00a325.5 million contribution to foundations in 2021\n- We will support regional regeneration, including launching the 'Regional Housing Growth Initiative'\n- We will support financial inclusion by providing banking to potentially excluded groups of people\n\nEnhancing our Capabilities\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

        "page_content": "## Chair's statement continued\n\n## Our colleagues and culture\n\nThe sheer amount of change that people have coped with during 2020 is phenomenal and the role of our colleagues cannot be understated. I/uni00A0have heard of so many wonderful examples of colleagues supporting each other and our customers, and the empathy and dedication our colleagues have shown is a testament to the Group.\n\nCOVID-19 is likely to change ways of working beyond what we ever thought was possible with more virtually-connected, remote working teams and fewer offices. Also, employees' expectations are evolving with over 77 per cent of our colleagues, who are currently working from home, indicating in recent colleague surveys that they would like to work from home three or more days per week. All this requires companies to rethink the way they manage their business and, given that we want to be an employer of choice, attracting the best staff, this hybrid approach is likely to be increasingly prevalent.\n\nThe Board and senior management have a vital role to play in shaping and embedding a healthy corporate culture. With this in mind, creating structures which put customers at the heart of decision-making has been a major focus for the Board's attention over the last few years. During the pandemic, there has been increased focus on ensuring customers are supported appropriately and the Board is determined that this will continue. More information on the Board oversight of our culture journey can be found on page 92.\n\nThe values and standards of behaviour we set are an important guiding influence and we are determined to address and learn from historic failures, including those at HBOS Reading which occurred before Lloyds acquired HBOS in 2009. An independent re-review of compensation for those impacted is currently being progressed and we await the outcome of the Dame Linda Dobbs' review on the Group's handling of the issue. We are already implementing lessons learnt so far and are committed to ensuring all those impacted are treated fairly and compensated appropriately.\n\nThere are strong links between governance and establishing a culture that supports longterm sustainable success and I am keen to ensure the Group continues to build a strong reputation in this area.\n\nWhile the Group was the first FTSE 100 company to set targets to increase both gender and ethnic diversity at senior levels, the Board recognises that there is always more that can be done to ensure a diverse workforce. The Board was therefore pleased to endorse a Race Action plan in support of Black colleagues to drive cultural change, recruitment and progression across the Group. Further information about the Race Action plan can be found on page 25.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Big Conversation - Helping Britain Recover\n\nLloyds Banking Group has brought together more than 900 businesses, community members, policy makers and subject-matter experts across the UK's nations and regions to explore how we can help the UK recover from the impact of coronavirus.\n\nConversations have covered a range of topics, from accessing the finance and skills to support the  recovery journey, to the opportunities brought about by an increasingly digital economy. Conversations also revealed a shared view of what the critical priorities should be for policy-makers to emerge with an economy that is both more resilient and more sustainable.\n\nWe've partnered with the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), bringing the voices and experience of its 190,000 members to the conversation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Remuneration\n\nProtecting our colleagues and recognising their efforts to support our customers during this unprecedented year has been important to the Group. We were able to confirm to all full-time and part-time permanent colleagues that they would continue to be paid their contracted hours as normal, no matter what their role, how the outbreak affected what they did for the Group or what their personal circumstances were, and did not take any Government funding to pay colleagues.\n\nWe have a duty to support our customers, colleagues and communities during this uncertain time and we believe the changes we made to our pay and absence policies during the course of 2020 have ensured that our colleagues received the support they needed during such a challenging year.\n\nGiven the financial performance of the business, we were not able to pay any bonuses for 2020, but to ensure that the support shown to customers was appropriately recognised, we made a one-off recognition award to 40,000 colleagues, predominantly those in customer-facing roles and are awarding all colleagues a \u00a3400 share award to motivate delivery of the next phase of our strategy. In addition, the vast majority of colleagues will receive an above inflation pay increase this year with larger relative increases for lower grade colleagues. As a result, the total package for the vast majority of customerfacing colleagues was largely unchanged in the year.\n\nScan the QR code to read the report\n\nWe also gained shareholder approval for the 2020 Directors' Remuneration Policy at the AGM in May last year. We do however recognise that a substantial proportion of our shareholders voted against the Policy and against the Long Term Share Plan and are sensitive to concerns on remuneration in the sector. Following further engagement with our shareholders, we have therefore committed to a series of changes in how the new Policy is to be implemented and disclosed in 2021. Our new Chief Executive Officer, Charlie Nunn, has also agreed to a significantly reduced reward package. For further details, please refer to pages 115 to 142 in our Directors' Remuneration Report.\n\n## Shareholder returns\n\nThe Group's financial performance in 2020 was clearly impacted by the pandemic and the consequent challenging economic environment. Despite this we delivered a resilient financial performance and continued to make good strategic progress. Our performance continues to demonstrate the stability of our customer franchise and business model, the appropriateness of our strategy and the strength of our balance sheet.\n\nI am also pleased to announce that the Board has recommended a final ordinary dividend of 0.57 pence per share. This is the maximum dividend we were able to recommend given current regulatory constraints. Going forward our capital position remains strong and we remain committed to future capital returns.",

Charlie will, subject to regulatory approval, join the Group in August 2021 from HSBC and brings with him significant operational, technology and strategic expertise. I am personally excited about Charlie's vision for the Group, as well as his passion for our commitment to Helping Britain Recover. The Board and I look forward to working with him to ensure the success of the next stage of development of the Group.\n\nOn 30 April 2021, Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio will retire as Group Chief Executive and Director of Lloyds Banking Group plc having led the Group for the last ten years. I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the outstanding contribution that Ant\u00f3nio has made to first turning round and then leading the strategic development of the Group over the last decade. His personal commitment and strong vision have driven a period of substantial and successful change in the Group, restoring Lloyds to its pre-eminent position as the UK's leading financial services provider. During his tenure, he has overseen a comprehensive transformation of the Group's balance sheet, operations, and customer propositions, including the repayment of the UK Government's \u00a321 billion investment and evolution of the Group into the UK's largest digital bank.\n\nAs previously indicated, the Board has agreed that during any interim period between Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio stepping down and Charlie Nunn joining the Group, William Chalmers, Chief Financial Officer will, subject to regulatory approval, take on the role of acting Group Chief Executive in addition to his ongoing responsibilities as Chief Financial Officer, with the support of Alan Dickinson and myself. It will be critically important to maintain momentum during this period and arrangements will be made to support William in this role and manage his wider responsibilities appropriately.\n\n## Board changes\n\nWe have a strong, diverse and experienced Board, which proved its effectiveness throughout the year. A number of Board changes have been seen during the year, as outlined below.\n\nAs disclosed in last year's annual report, Catherine Woods joined the Board as a Non-Executive Director in March. In May, Anita Frew retired as Deputy Chair and NonExecutive Director, having served 9 years on the Board. Alan Dickinson succeeded Anita as Senior Independent Director and also took on the role of Deputy Chair, bringing his significant Board, financial and regulatory experience to these roles. In addition, Nick/uni00A0Prettejohn took on/uni00A0the role of Chair of the Board Risk Committee on an interim basis in May, with Catherine Woods taking over from Nick from 1/uni00A0January 2021.\n\nIn addition, during September 2020 both Simon Henry and Juan Colomb\u00e1s retired from the Board. Sarah/uni00A0Legg assumed the role of Chair of the Audit Committee in October.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Introducing our new Group Chief Executive Charlie Nunn\n\nCharlie Nunn will, subject to regulatory approval, join the Group in August 2021, as our new Group Chief Executive. He was previously the Global Chief Executive of Wealth and Personal Banking at HSBC. Charlie has had a long and successful career in financial services.

He  then moved to McKinsey & Co. as a Senior Partner for five years, joining HSBC in 2011.\n\nAt HSBC, he has held a series of leadership positions including Global Chief Operating Officer of Retail Banking and Wealth Management, Group Head of Wealth Management and Digital, and Chief Executive of Retail Banking and Wealth Management before taking on his most recent role.\n\nIn addition Lord Blackwell retired from the Board on 1/uni00A0January 2021 having been a member of the Board for nearly nine years and Chairman since April 2014. He has been instrumental in helping turn the business around since the financial crisis and refocus the business on Helping Britain Prosper. I/uni00A0must thank him for his strong stewardship during this period and sage advice since I/uni00A0joined the/uni00A0Board.\n\nAlso, as recently announced, Sara Weller will have served 9 years as a Non-Executive Director in February 2021 and accordingly plans to retire as Chair of the Responsible Business Committee and a Non-Executive Director at the AGM in May 2021.

Only by truly focusing on the needs of the customer and embracing technology will banks be successful.\n\nGiven significant investment and transformation in recent years we are well positioned with strong foundations to support our response to the evolving banking landscape. We intend to further build and adapt our compelling offering for customers, while at the same time delivering a positive societal impact and long-term superior and sustainable returns for shareholders.\n\nI would like to end by reiterating my thanks to our colleagues for their significant contribution in 2020. It is the commitment, innovation and dedication from all of them that enables us to deliver for our customers and shareholders. There are difficult times and more change ahead, both this year and beyond, however we will do our best to fulfil our role in the country's recovery.\n\nLloyds Banking Group will Help Britain Recover and Help Britain Prosper again.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRobin Budenberg\n\nChair\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

Many countries, including the UK, have seen unprecedented levels of economic contraction as a result of lockdown measures, as well as comprehensive and co-ordinated Government support measures. In this environment, we remain absolutely focused on working with all our stakeholders to support our customers and ensure a sustainable recovery.\n\nThe Group's successful ongoing transformation, continued investment and growing franchise strength positioned us well to face the pandemic. In response to the challenging economic environment, we provided around 1.3 million payment holidays on mortgages, loans, credit cards and motor finance products while we also set up dedicated phone lines for customers over 70/uni00A0years old and for customers who are working on the frontline in the NHS. We are also providing significant support for our business clients, providing more than \u00a331/uni00A0billion of gross lending to small and medium sized businesses, including Government-backed lending. Within Insurance and Wealth, we have supported the NHS by providing free additional insurance cover to its workers and by alleviating pressure on GPs with a reduction in medical evidence required for insurance claims.\n\nThe Group has benefited from its multi-brand, multi-channel distribution model during the pandemic, as we have been able to continue serving customers through the UK's leading digital bank, the largest branch network in the UK and our telephony centres. I am particularly pleased with how quickly the Group adapted to the initial lockdown and how well our digital banking proposition has performed in a period of significantly heightened usage.\n\nCoronavirus has had a profound impact on our lives and the economy but the Group has delivered a resilient performance with continued strategic progress.\n\nAnt\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio Group Chief Executive\n\nOur infrastructure has been highly resilient, with around 90 per cent of our branches remaining open while our digital channels have performed well, attaining record levels of customer satisfaction despite significantly increased usage.\n\nOnce again I would like to express my gratitude to all of our colleagues for their resilience, dedication and hard work throughout 2020. Our people have retained their clear focus on supporting their customers and Helping Britain Prosper in very challenging circumstances. I am proud of everything the Group has done to support the UK economy in 2020. This would not have been possible without the exemplary dedication of our colleagues.\n\nGiven our clear UK focus, the Group's financial performance is inextricably linked to the health of the UK economy and thereby the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Significant uncertainties remain relating to the pandemic, the third national lockdown and the speed and efficacy of the vaccination programme. Nonetheless, the Group's purpose, unique business model, competitive advantages and ambitious strategic evolution will ensure that it will be able to Help Britain Recover from the crisis whilst delivering longterm sustainable returns for our shareholders.\n\n## Financial performance\n\nIn the context of the pandemic, statutory profit after tax was \u00a31.4 billion. This was 54/uni00A0per cent lower than 2019 and earnings per share of 1.2 pence were down 66 per cent. Lower profits were significantly due to the impairment charge of \u00a34.2 billion in 2020 (2019: \u00a31.3 billion), primarily reflecting the deterioration in the economic outlook. Trading surplus of \u00a36.4 billion was down 27 per cent on 2019, reflecting continued revenue pressures partly offset by lower total costs. Our relentless focus on cost efficiencies has led to a 4 per cent reduction in operating costs despite absorbing additional coronavirus-related expenses during 2020.\n\nLoans and advances were broadly in line with prior year at \u00a3440.2 billion. Growth in the open mortgage book of \u00a37.2 billion, including \u00a310.2/uni00A0billion in the second half of the year, and \u00a311.1 billion (\u00a312.4 billion approved at 12 February 2021) of Government-backed lending more than offset lower unsecured Retail balances and other Corporate and Institutional lending, as well as the continued reduction in the closed mortgage book.\n\nThe Group's capital position remains strong with a CET1 ratio of 16.4 per cent before allowing for ordinary dividends and 16.2/uni00A0per/uni00A0cent after dividends, both ahead of the Board's ongoing target of c.12.5 per cent, plus a management buffer of c.1 per cent. Given our strong capital position at the year end and the regulator's clarification that banks may resume capital distributions, the Board has recommended a final ordinary dividend of 0.57 pence per share, the maximum allowed under the Prudential Regulation Authority's temporary framework on 2020 distributions.",

The pandemic has accelerated the shift towards digital for everyday banking needs. We are the largest digital bank in the UK and have seen our digitally active customer base increase to 17.4/uni00A0million customers, while our active mobile app users have increased by nearly two million in 2020 to 12.5 million customers. At the same time, we have continued to enhance our digital propositions, with a focus on convenience and control. As a consequence, we have seen our digital customer satisfaction scores improve to a year end record high of 67.\n\nAlongside creating the UK's leading digital bank, we have maintained the UK's largest branch network. We have managed to keep around 90 per cent of our branches open during the coronavirus pandemic, using appropriate safeguarding measures. In addition, we have maintained our ATM network at over 95 per cent capacity and have set up dedicated telephone lines our customers over 70 years old and those working on the frontline in the NHS.\n\n## Digitising the Group\n\nWe have accelerated the digitisation of the Group by progressively modernising and simplifying the IT architecture, continuing to digitise customer journeys and migrating applications to private cloud. We have now digitised 78 per cent of the Group's cost base, ahead of our GSR3 target of 70 per cent. With cumulative technology spend of more than \u00a34 billion over GSR3, our ongoing focus on transforming the business and investing in digital enabled us to respond effectively to the accelerated shift to digital channels brought about by the coronavirus pandemic. The proportion of products originated via digital channels increased significantly in 2020, up 10/uni00A0percentage points to 85 per cent, our highest level to date.\n\nDespite this significant progress, we are only just starting to see the transformation that technology is enabling. Customers will increasingly expect to interact with us in a more effective, agile and personalised way. To compete effectively against new entrants and respond to these evolving customer expectations, we need to continue to transform how we work, replace some of our legacy systems and enhance our use of data across the business. Some of this development will be internal but we will also increasingly use partnerships with specialist technology and fintech providers.\n\n## Maximising Group capabilities\n\nWe have actively supported our Commercial Banking clients through the pandemic, exceeding our \u00a36 billion target for increasing net lending to start-ups, SME and Mid Market clients over the last three years. Outside of our support for the Government lending schemes, in 2020 we also achieved our \u00a318 billion commitment for gross lending to UK businesses.\n\nIn 2020 we increased the number of customers with access to our unique Single Customer View capability by c.1.5 million to c.6.5 million. We also expanded the scope of Single Customer View to include Halifax Share Dealing so that customers with this functionality are now able to view their pensions and investment portfolios alongside their banking products. We have seen cumulative growth in open book assets under administration of \u00a346 billion, or 69/uni00A0per/uni00A0cent, over the GSR3 period to \u00a3113 billion, only narrowly missing the \u00a350 billion growth target despite challenging market conditions.\n\n## Transforming ways of working\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic is having significant implications for our colleagues, in both their personal and professional lives. These include accelerating the transition to new ways of working for the majority of the Group and accentuating the skills that we have sought to develop over the course of GSR3. Since March 2020, more than 50,000 colleagues (over 70 per cent of our workforce) have worked remotely and we have increased our adoption of remote working tools to greatly increase collaboration and support more agile working practices.\n\nIn 2020 we delivered an additional 2.1 million training hours to develop the skills for the future, taking the total to 5.3 million hours over the course of GSR3, ahead of our target. In addition, the proportion of change programmes delivered using agile methodologies has increased to 65 per cent over the course of GSR3, ahead of our target of 50 per cent.\n\nOur 2020 Colleague Survey received almost 50,000 responses and showed positive increases in all main areas, including overall engagement up 7 percentage points to 81 per cent. This reflects the highest level since measurement started in 2011 and is above the UK highperforming norm.\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

        "page_content": "## Group Chief Executive's review continued\n\n## Strategic Review 2021\n\nToday's environment continues to evolve and provide new challenges. The macroeconomic environment remains uncertain, whilst we are witnessing increasing societal expectations, an accelerated shift to digital and new technology capabilities in the context of the pandemic driving a step change in ways of/uni00A0working.\n\nThroughout 2020 the management team, in conjunction with the Board, have worked on developing an evolution of our strategy to address these issues. We have made significant progress in recent years, leveraging the unique strengths and assets of the Group, including our purpose driven and customer focused business model, our low risk approach to business, our market leading efficiency and our leading multi-channel propositions, including the largest digital bank and branch network in the UK. This has created the platform for Strategic Review 2021, the next stage of our journey.\n\nThe Group has a clear purpose of Helping Britain Prosper, which drives our strategy. Given the pandemic and the challenging macroeconomic environment, our focus for 2021 is Helping Britain Recover. This is in the context of delivering co-ordinated growth opportunities by building the UK's preferred financial partner for personal customers and the best bank for business. Delivery of the Group's customer focused ambitions in our two main segments, will be underpinned by the enhancement of four core capabilities within our business. These capabilities focus on delivering a modernised technology architecture, building an integrated payments platform, creating a data-driven organisation and implementing reimagined ways of working. Strategic execution in 2021, supported by increased investment, is underpinned by long-term strategic vision in these customer segments and capabilities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Helping Britain Prosper\n\nWe recognise that the focus of the Group's purpose must evolve in response to the current environment with changing societal and customer needs and expectations. Given our focus on the UK, we are dedicated to helping our customers, clients, colleagues and communities get through the coronavirus pandemic and rebuild livelihoods, whilst delivering long-term sustainable success for shareholders. Our core values underpin our purpose to Help Britain Prosper. With this in mind, our focus for the near-term will be to Help Britain Recover.\n\nWe are committed to supporting a sustainable recovery which supports all of the people and regions in our society. In 2021, we will Help Britain Recover by concentrating on five key areas where we can make the most difference, all of which are embedded in our business strategy. This is discussed further in the Strategic Review 2021 section.\n\n- Help rebuild households' financial health and wellbeing\n- Support businesses across the UK to recover, adapt and/uni00A0grow\n- Expand availability of affordable and quality homes\n- Accelerate the transition to a low carbon economy\n- Build an inclusive society and organisation\n\nThe Group is committed to helping the UK transition to a sustainable low carbon economy. We continue to make progress in implementing our financed emissions reduction ambition on the path to net zero by 2050 or sooner, working with customers, Government and the market to help reduce the emissions we finance. In so doing, we are also focusing on enhancing our green finance products and services. This includes supporting renewable energy projects since the start of 2018 that could power the equivalent of 10.1 million homes, more than doubling the number of electric vehicles we finance, raising around \u00a32.9 billion funding in green and sustainable bonds for our clients since 2016 and offering pensions to our customers and colleagues with sustainable investment choices.\n\nWe are working hard to tackle social disadvantage across Britain. In 2020, the Group's four independent charitable Foundations received \u00a325.5 million of funding, enabling them to continue their work in supporting nearly 2,800 charities. These charities tackle vital issues such as domestic abuse, mental health, modern slavery and human trafficking, and employability. The Group has committed to maintain its \u00a325.5/uni00A0million funding to the Foundations in 2021, ensuring that these charities can secure a more certain future during these difficult times and safeguard their important work.\n\nOur ongoing commitment to helping people save for the future is key to developing social mobility and we have increased the open book assets that we hold on behalf of customers in retirement and investment products by \u00a346/uni00A0billion since the start of 2018.\n\nAs the UK's largest mortgage lender, we recognise the vital importance of helping Britain get a home. We have provided close to \u00a39 billion of finance for the social housing sector and lent c.\u00a340 billion to first-time buyers over 2018 to 2020.\n\nBuilding capability and digital skills was more important in 2020 than ever, given the need for customers to access services during periods of lockdown. We have now facilitated digital training for 1.8 million individuals, SMEs and charities since the start of 2018 and delivered over 12,500 devices to customers, enabling them to safely book medical appointments, connect with family and access internet banking facilities.\n\nSupporting businesses to start up and to grow is fundamental to Helping Britain Recover. We have now helped over 265,000 businesses start up since the beginning of 2018 and trained over 1,200 apprentices through our investment in the Lloyds Bank Advanced Manufacturing Training Centre since the beginning of 2018.\n\nThe Group launched The Big Conversation: Helping Britain Recover in September 2020, a national programme of events which brought together more than 900 businesses, community members, policy makers and subject-matter experts across the UK's nations and regions to explore how we can together help the UK recover from the impact of coronavirus and build a more resilient and sustainable economy.\n\nWe are championing Britain's diversity and in 2020 launched our Race Action plan. This makes the Group the first FTSE 100 company to make such public commitments, including a new goal to specifically increase Black representation in senior roles to align with the overall UK labour market. We also published our first Ethnicity Pay Gap Report, made progress on gender diversity and published our annual Gender Pay Gap Report.\n\nFurther information on our approach to environmental, social and governance issues can be found in our 2020 Environmental, Social and Governance Report, available on the Group's website.\n\n## Management change\n\nIt is with mixed emotions that I will step down as Group Chief Executive at the end of April. It has been a great honour to work alongside all of my colleagues and achieve the remarkable transformation of the past ten years, but now is the right time to move on, following my announcement last July.\n\nCharlie Nunn will be the next Group Chief Executive. He was previously the Global Chief Executive of Wealth and Personal Banking at HSBC and has had a long and successful career in financial services. Charlie will find a warm welcome at Lloyds Banking Group and a deep commitment from all of our people to deliver on our purpose and to Help Britain Recover. I am sure that he will find his time here as fulfilling and fascinating as I have done and I wish him the very best.",

These include measures for assessing financial and non-financial performance, balancing the interests of various stakeholders including customers, shareholders and colleagues.\n\nTo ensure colleagues act in the best interests of customers and shareholders, variable remuneration at all levels across the Group is aligned to these priorities and takes into account the Group's financial performance and specific conduct and risk management controls.\n\nAll the key performance indicators shown here directly impact remuneration outcomes and support the delivery of our reward principles.\n\n## In 2021\n\nFurther to stakeholder feedback we are looking to further simplify and enhance the single balanced scorecard used for performance assessment, the bonus (Group Performance Share) and the Long Term share plan in 2021. The new balanced scorecard has been aligned to our strategic priorities and has been structured to incentivise the right behaviours and results. The weighting for financial performance has been increased to 50/uni00A0per/uni00A0cent while the number of measures in the balanced scorecard has been reduced from 15 to 7 to ensure greater focus and simplicity.\n\n## Our 2021 balanced scorecard\n\n## Financial (50%)\n\n- - Statutory Profit After Tax (20%)\n- - Statutory ROTE (20%)\n- - Operating Costs (excl. remediation) (10%)\n\n## Strategic (50%)\n\n- -  Reducing operational carbon emissions ( 7. 5 % )\n- -  Increasing our gender and ethnic representation in senior roles (7.5%)\n- -  Group Customer Dashboard - our assessment of how effectively we are serving customers across all brands, products and services (25%)\n- -   Colleague engagement - our performance relative to external benchmark scores (10%)\n\n## FINANCIAL\n\n## Underlying profit before tax\n\n\u00a3m\n\n## 2,193\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nUnderlying profit before tax was lower in 2020, reflecting lower net income and higher impairment charges, partly offset by the Group's continued progress in cost reductions. 1  Restated to include remediation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|   Ordinary dividend p per share 0.57 |      |\n|--------------------------------------|------|\n|                                 2020 | 0.57 |\n|                                 2019 | 1.12 |\n|                                 2018 | 3.21 |\n|                                 2017 | 3.05 |\n|                                 2016 | 2.55 |\n\nOrdinary dividend per share, given the Group's strong capital position dividends have resumed at the maximum allowed under the Prudential Regulation Authority's temporary framework on 2020 distributions.\n\n## Cost:income ratio\n\n%\n\n## 55.3\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|   2020 |   55.3 |\n|--------|--------|\n|   2019 |   48.5 |\n|   2018 |   49.3 |\n|   2017 |   51.8 |\n|   2016 |   55.3 |\n\nThe Group's cost:income ratio deteriorated in the year, driven by lower income, but remains market leading.\n\nIn 2021, this key performance indicator will be replaced by operating costs (excl./uni00A0remediation).

Despite this challenging backdrop, we have successfully built on our track record of strengthening our propositions and improving the experience of both our personal and business customers during the course of 2020.\n\n## Improving the experience of our personal customers\n\nCOVID-19 has accelerated the shift towards digital for everyday banking needs. We are the largest digital bank in the UK and have seen our digitally-active customer base increase by 6 per cent to 17.4 million customers, while our active mobile app users have also increased by nearly 2 million to 12.5 million customers. We have continued to enhance our digital propositions, with a focus on speed, convenience, personalisation and control. These include the broadening of our unique Single Customer View functionality to include stockbroking portfolios, biometric functionality to authorise payments through the mobile banking app, more personalised customer communication and navigation within digital apps, and enhanced control features, such as upcoming payment notifications and 'confirmation of payee' functionality, to protect against fraud. As a consequence, we have seen our digital and all channel customer satisfaction scores continue to improve and reach respective all-time highs of 67 and 68.\n\n## Improving the experience of our business customers\n\nBusiness customers are also turning to digital channels for everyday needs, while continuing to value human interaction for more complex needs. We have proactively supported approximately 60,000 business customers via our Client Outreach Programme, while also improving the digital propositions available to them. Amongst other developments, we were the first bank globally to implement 'SWIFT GPI Instant' to increase the speed and transparency of cross-border payments. In addition, we launched a Green Building Tool to help customers make their properties more energy-efficient, as well as a pilot Business Finance Assistant tool designed to help clients save time on financial admin and manage their finances more effectively.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Personalising our customer experience\n\nWe are improving the experience of our customers through the combination of new technological capabilities and our extensive data insights. Using real time customer triggers and predicted needs, based on machine learning, we are now able to deliver enhanced navigation within our digital apps as well as more timely, relevant and co-ordinated communications across email, SMS and within apps that are specifically tailored our customers' individual needs\n\n## Key Objectives 2018 to 2020\n\n- Deeper end-to-end transformation targeting 70 per cent of our cost base\n- Simplification and progressive modernisation of our data and IT infrastructure\n- Technology enabled productivity improvements across the business\n\nOur ongoing focus on transforming the business and investing in digital have enabled us to respond effectively to the accelerating shift to digital channels brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, with the benefits of this investment evidenced throughout the crisis.\n\n## Delivering for customers\n\nThe proportion of products originated via digital channels increased significantly in 2020, up 10 percentage points to 85 per cent, the highest level to date. Despite increased usage, this was not at the expense of customer satisfaction where net promoter scores reached an all-time high, as ongoing investment in systems and functionality meant that we were able to meet the increased customer demand, while also adapting our offering to make it easier for our customers to perform activities online. For example, we doubled the size of cheque scanning limits for our customers, resulting in a more than 80 per cent increase in the number of cheques deposited by our retail customers.\n\n## Continued adoption of new technologies\n\nIn addition, we have continued to increase our adoption of new technologies and these have allowed us to support our customers at pace. As an example, we have used robotics to process over 90 per/uni00A0cent of Bounce Back Loan applications and, through this, have created significant colleague capacity during a period of increased demand. The use of technology has also created opportunities to further improve operational efficiencies as we modernise our IT and data architecture and improve processes at the same time as prioritising our technology based investment. By the end of 2020, 78 per cent of our cost base was covered by digitisation. This compares to our original GSR3 target of 70 per cent and represents nearly a five and a half fold increase versus the equivalent figure of 12 per cent at the end of 2017. In addition, we have continued to make progress on migrating applications to cloud/uni00A0solutions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Supporting our customers\n\nThrough the use of robotics over 300,000 Bounce Back Loans have been approved with a total value of over \u00a39/uni00A0billion and an approval rate of around 97 per cent\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWithout our robotics capability, we wouldn't have been able to provide such timely support to our customers at a time when they needed it the most.\n\nLloyds Banking Group colleague\n\nProgress in 2020",

We also expanded the scope of Single Customer View to include Halifax Share Dealing so that customers with this functionality are now able to view their pensions and investment portfolios alongside their banking products. Separately, we also launched an equity release product via our Scottish Widows brand, through which customers can access equity in their homes to help family members get onto the housing ladder or supplement their own retirement income. While the pandemic has caused some delays, our ambition for Schroders Personal Wealth to become a top three UK financial planning business remains unchanged, although we now expect to achieve this by 2025.\n\n## Improving the experience of our Commercial Banking clients\n\nWe have actively supported our Commercial Banking clients throughout the COVID-19 crisis. In 2020 we achieved our gross lending commitment to businesses of \u00a318 billion and comfortably exceeded our cumulative three year target of increasing net lending to start-ups, SME and Mid Market clients by \u00a36 billion. In addition, we extended our support for business clients who trade overseas by successfully completing the Bank's first UK Export Finance backed Export Development Guarantee transaction, participating in the completion of transactions with a total syndicated value of \u00a34.4 billion to support clients with their trading ambitions. We have also launched a number of new client propositions. These include our Payables API proposition, 'PayTo', which has seen rapid client uptake, having processed around 500,000 transactions totalling over \u00a32 billion over the course of the year, as well as a 25-fold increase in the value of transactions processed between the first and fourth quarters.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Improving customer experience\n\nOur PayTo payments proposition enables our Commercial Banking clients to make single Faster Payments directly from their own systems in less than a second, via a secure, direct connection with the Bank, and without human intervention. Since launch, PayTo has processed around 500,000 transactions totalling over \u00a32/uni00A0billion, with its real-time response also enabling our clients to significantly improve their own working capital management as well as the experience of their customers.\n\n## Key Objectives 2018 to 2020\n\n- 50 per cent increase in training and development to 4.4/uni00A0million hours\n- Up to 30 per cent change efficiency improvement\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is having significant implications for our colleagues. These include accelerating the transition to new ways of working for the majority of the Group while also challenging the skills that we have sought to develop over the course of this strategic plan. This significant change has also increased our focus on our broader workforce proposition, ensuring our colleagues feel valued and engaged in an uncertain environment.\n\n## New ways of working\n\nSince March, more than 50,000 colleagues have worked remotely as a result of the pandemic. In order to facilitate this and to improve colleague experiences of working from home, we have enabled the distribution of over 100,000 office items to our colleagues' homes. In addition, we increased our adoption of remote working tools to increase collaboration and support more agile working practices. At the height of the crisis, we also demonstrated significant operational agility by rapidly redeploying over 2,500 colleagues to customer support functions to respond to elevated customer demand.\n\nIn addition to physical and technological support, we have also prioritised the mental health of our colleagues in a period of significant uncertainty and change with regular check-ins throughout the year and increasing access to a number of wellbeing tools. For example, over 14,000 colleagues have made use of the mindfulness app, Headspace, for which the Group provides a free annual subscription.\n\n## Delivering the skills for the future\n\nDespite significant levels of change during the year, we remain focused on ensuring our colleagues have the skills to deliver our longer-term transformation aims and, as such, have continued to invest in their development. We delivered an additional 2.1 million training hours to develop the skills for the future in 2020, taking the total to a cumulative 5.3 million over GSR3, surpassing our target for this strategic plan.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Delivering for each other and our customers\n\nThroughout the year our colleagues have done a brilliant job of making the best of this situation by adapting at speed and continuing to deliver for our customers and each other. As we consider how our business can thrive in whatever the new world may look like, we're also seizing the opportunity to pause, learn from our experiences and reimagine how we all might work in the future.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI have worked for the Group for over 20 years and I have never been prouder to say that I work for Lloyds Banking Group; the support for staff (and in turn our customers) throughout the pandemic has been simply exceptional\n\nLloyds Banking Group colleague\n\nProgress in 2020\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

Additional TCFD related disclosures can be found in the Lloyds Banking Group ESG Report.\n\nOur unique position within the UK economy means that the successful transition to a more sustainable, low carbon economy is of strategic importance to us. We support the aims of the 2015 Paris Agreement, the UK Government's Net Zero target and Ten Point Plan for a Green Industrial Revolution; and the recommendations of the TCFD.\n\nThe economic recovery required postCOVID-19 provides a critical opportunity to drive Clean Growth and ensure that the UK's decarbonisation requirements sit at the heart of the UK's policy framework. In 2020, we joined over 200 businesses, investors and business organisations in calling on the Government to deliver a clean, inclusive and resilient recovery plan. The Group produced a separate document outlining why we believe prioritising a green recovery is critical and the priority areas we thought should feature within any economic stimulus plan.\n\n## Our strategy\n\n## Our goal and approach\n\nAs a signal of our commitment we set an ambitious goal in 2020, working with customers,\n\nGovernment and the market to help reduce the emissions we finance by more than 50 per cent by 2030, on the path to net zero by 2050 or sooner, which will support the UK Government's ambition and the 2015 Paris Agreement. During the course of 2020, we have calculated an initial estimate of our 2018 financed emissions baseline and we developed our first emission intensity reduction ambition for the power sector, the decarbonisation of which is critical to the UK achieving its climate targets. We will continue to develop additional sector specific ambitions throughout 2021.\n\nIn addition, the Insurance and Wealth division (excluding Wealth Private Banking) have published a target to reach net zero across our full portfolio of investments by 2050, halving their investments' carbon footprint by 2030.\n\nMore detail is provided in the metrics and targets section (see page 22).\n\nIn order to meet our overall 2030 and 2050 goals, we will continue to:\n\n- Identify new ways to support our customers and clients with the management of opportunities and risks associated with climate change, and the transition to a low carbon economy.\n- Identify, manage and disclose material sustainability and climate-related risks across the Group and their impacts on the Group and its financial planning processes, in line with the TCFD framework. This includes working with industry bodies, specialist consultancies and leading academics to develop a robust climate risk measurement capability.\n- Use our scale and reach to help drive progress towards a sustainable and resilient UK economy through engagement with customers, communities, industry, Government, shareholders and suppliers.\n- Embed sustainability into the way we do business and manage our own operations in a more sustainable way. To support this we have updated our operational climate pledges, setting a new net zero goal for 2030 (see page 22).\n\nWe participate in several industry initiatives and have signed up to key principles that drive action on climate change and sustainability, which are detailed in our Lloyds Banking Group ESG Report.\n\n## Recognition of activity\n\nTo address the increasing needs of our stakeholders, and to enhance our ESG disclosures we have included a full table of the Group's performance against various ESG indices, which includes our 2020 CDP (formerly Carbon Disclosure Project) rating, in the Lloyds/uni00A0Banking Group ESG Report.\n\n## Risk management\n\nThe Group has adopted a comprehensive approach to embedding climate-related risks into our Enterprise Risk Management Framework through:\n\n- Creation of a new principal risk for climate risk, in order to drive dedicated focus and a consistent approach, whilst enhancing Board-level insight",

Examples of this include the following.\n\n- Since 2018 the Group has supported renewable energy projects that could power the equivalent of 10.1 million homes, significantly exceeding our Helping Britain Prosper Plan 2020 target\n- We launched several new green finance products, tools and services: a Lloyds Bank and Bank of Scotland Green Buildings Tool; a\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- We launched our Green Living and Eco Home Hub for Halifax and Lloyds customers\n- To support Halifax customers with the cost of green home improvements, we have also\n\nSustainability Fixed Term Deposit and 95 Day Notice Account; and we also structured and co-ordinated the first Sterling Overnight Index Average (SONIA) Sustainability Linked Loan for Affinity Water\n\nintroduced a Green Living Reward under the UK Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) Green Home Finance Innovation Fund\n\n- In 2020, we more than doubled the number of electric vehicles financed through our Motor Finance and Leasing subsidiaries, Lex Autolease and Black Horse\n- We have launched our Responsible Investment Framework in March 2020 and our supporting Stewardship Policy\n- Our Exclusions Policy focuses on companies that have failed to meet our environmental, social and governance standards, namely manufacturers of controversial weapons, UN Global Compact violators and those deriving more than 10 per cent of their revenue from thermal coal and tar sands extraction. We are currently divesting an initial \u00a3440/uni00A0million from these companies, starting with those investments where we have direct control and are working to expand the application of this policy into external pooled funds that underpin our multi-asset funds as well. Early success of our engagement with one of our\n- We continue to partner with RedArc to operate a trauma helpline that aids customers needing extra help after a traumatic claim such as a fire or flood\n\npartner asset managers has led the investment manager to introduce an exclusions policy for all their Europe-domiciled passive funds totalling over \u00a320/uni00A0billion, leading to an additional divestment of approximately \u00a3280 million within our customer pension portfolios\n\n- Through our shareholder investments we provide direct loans for renewable energy, including for offshore wind and solar energy\n- We are also investing \u00a32/uni00A0billion of our Pension and Retirement Portfolio Pension Funds into a new fund, the ACS Climate Transition World Equity Fund, co-created with BlackRock that looks to increase investment in companies that are well prepared for the low carbon transition and to reduce exposure to those that are less so\n- We are also investing in ways to minimise the impact of flooding on our customers. For example, we continue to provide a Rapid Response Vehicle to quickly assess claims and release funds to customers in the worst affected areas\n- Since the launch of this ambition in 2016, we have maintained our role as a leader for our UK corporate clients between 2016 and 2020, raising around \u00a32.9 billion.\n- We continue to improve the sustainability of our own operations and have recently updated our operational climate pledges (see page 22)\n- This year we have calculated and disclosed the emissions associated with increased homeworking as a result of COVID-19, and sponsored a white paper in this area\n- Integration of climate risk into our existing principal risks, to ensure comprehensive consideration across all aspects of our business activity.\n\nClimate Risk is included as both a principal and emerging risk this year given it is such a new and fast moving area. We continue to ensure our approach for climate risk management has suitable Board-level visibility. The Board has approved a Risk Appetite Statement for climate risk, as well as an interim metric to ensure the Group continues to progress activities at pace,\n\nsupported by Board-level risk reporting.\n\nAs the understanding and importance of climate risk progresses, climate scenario analysis is becoming an essential capability and risk management tool. Scenario analysis assists the identification, measurement and ongoing assessment of climate risks over the longer-term, and the potential threats to the Group's strategic objectives. In 2020, the Group has developed its climate scenario analysis framework and will see outputs from this in 2021.\n\n- We have continued to reduce the energy and carbon intensity of our properties and have supported low carbon travel\n- Our overall location-based carbon emissions were 159,487 tonnes CO 2 e; a 24 per cent decrease since 2019 and 72 per cent since our 2009 baseline (legacy scope)\n\nTo further accelerate progress, we have engaged with third-party consultants to support the development of our climate risk management framework and high priority sector analysis, thereby extending our modelling and assessment capabilities for quantifying climate risk.\n\nClimate risk and sustainability has been a key consideration in the credit assessment process in recent years, and in 2020 we have deepened the integration of sustainability into our credit risk processes and appetite statements.

For more information on the Group's external sector statements see page/uni00A024. As part of the Group's credit risk policy, we have mandatory requirements to consider environmental risks in key risk management activities. In Commercial Banking, Relationship Managers must continue to ensure that sustainability risk is considered for all new and renewal facilities, and specifically commented on where credit limits exceed \u00a3500,000. We have also developed and are piloting a tool in Commercial Banking to help qualitatively assess our clients' physical and transition risks. In Retail, we consider exposure to physical risks, such as flooding, in our mortgages origination criteria and we have also introduced sustainability related criteria into our motor finance businesses. Within Insurance, an assessment of climate-related risks to General Insurance (GI) liabilities is integrated into the internal model governance process. We further developed our weather modelling capabilities in 2020 through completion of a research partnership between the Group's GI Weather Modelling Team and the University of Reading on extreme wind and flood risk in the UK.\n\n## Sectors with increased climate risk\n\nThe Group has identified those sectors where we have lending to customers that may likely contribute a higher share of Lloyds Banking Group's financed emissions (see Table/uni00A01). Not all customers in these sectors have high emissions or are exposed to significant transition risks. As discussed within our disclosure, we continue to enhance and refine this work at both counterparty and sector level, considering both risks and opportunities as we look to support our customers' responses to climate change.\n\n## Metrics and targets\n\n## Financed emissions\n\nLloyds Banking Group believes it is appropriate to provide more financial information on our financed emissions, although we also recognise this is a rapidly developing area, with evolving and sometimes limiting data availability, data completeness and calculation methodologies. We expect these to continue to improve in\n\n## Governance\n\nOur governance structure provides clear oversight and ownership of the Group's sustainability strategy and management of climate-related risks. Governance for climate-related risks is embedded into the Group's existing governance structure and is complementary to governance of the Group's sustainability strategy.\n\n## Lloyds Banking Group Board\n\nDivisional forums/ working groups\n\nGroup Sustainability forum\n\nClimate Risk Planning\n\n& Prioritisation\n\nClimate Risk Executive Management\n\nGroup Risk Committee\n\nBoard Risk Committee\n\nGroup Sustainability team\n\nGroup Executive Sustainability Committee\n\nGroup Executive Committee\n\nResponsible Business Committee\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2021 and beyond, helping us to refine our approaches, estimates and understanding of the climate risk within Lloyds Banking Group's portfolios. However, in order to enhance disclosure, whilst recognising these limitations, we detail in Table/uni00A02 an initial estimated view of the 2018 financed emissions baseline across the Group's own lending activity (excluding Insurance and Wealth).\n\nThis will serve as an initial basis for our goal of helping to reduce the emissions we finance by more than 50 per cent by 2030 and to help us better support customers in their transition plans to a low-carbon economy (see Table 2). We selected 2018 as there is more comprehensive company emissions reporting and UK Government Office of National Statistics (ONS) emissions data available at that time. We have used the emerging industry standard for calculating financed emissions developed by the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF). The baseline is an estimate, as client or asset level emissions data is currently not available in all cases and where appropriate, we have used internal and external data and proxies to fill these data gaps. Given this is a new discipline that will continue to develop and evolve, it is expected that our baseline will change in the future (perhaps materially), which may require restatement. We expect methodologies for calculating financed emissions to mature, with data availability and quality also improving from clients and Government sources.\n\nOur initial estimated view of the 2018 financed emissions baseline covers approximately 70/uni00A0per/uni00A0cent of the Group's balance sheet (excluding Insurance and Wealth) 1 comprised of:\n\n- Motor vehicle loans (Lex and Black Horse) at individual vehicle level, vehicle emission intensity and contracted (or estimated) miles driven per annum\n- Mortgages (Retail UK Mortgages) - from Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs) where available with estimates used for properties without EPC ratings\n- Business loans (Commercial Banking only) on client-level emissions data and asset-based estimates using ONS UK sector emissions\n- Cash balances - with no associated emissions\n\nProgress in 2020\n\nFor the remaining balance sheet, 26 per cent currently have no method for calculating emissions and 4 per cent do not have data readily available to enable emissions to be calculated. 2\n\nAs currently recommended by PCAF, the baseline only includes Scope 1 and 2 emissions of clients and does not include undrawn lending commitments, off balance sheet contingents or areas where there is no methodology.\n\nInsurance and Wealth financed emissions The financed emissions for the Insurance and Wealth division are not included in the Group's total financed emissions or the Group's target to reduce financed emissions by 50 per cent by 2030. Due to the different nature of banking and investment activity, the Insurance and Wealth division will be further developing its approach to reporting appropriate climate metrics and targets during 2021.\n\n## Power sector ambition\n\nIn Commercial Banking, we have been working to develop a power sector ambition as power sector decarbonisation is critical for the UK to achieve its Net Zero goal.\n\nWe have determined that our power generation portfolio, comprising Commercial Banking large corporate and project finance portfolio facilities, generated financed emissions of 0.7MtCO 2 e in 2018, with an emission intensity of 141gCO 2 e/kWh on a drawn basis, covering both UK and EU exposures. This is lower than the UK average grid emissions intensity of 283 gCO 2 e/ kWh in 2018, due to our market leading support for UK offshore and renewable energy.\n\nHaving assessed our Commercial Banking large corporate and project finance power generation portfolio against decarbonisation plans and our commitment to Help Britain Prosper, we are now setting an ambition to reduce the portfolio's emission intensity to less than 75gCO 2 e/kWh by 2030* This is in line with the UK's net zero ambition, but takes into account the combination of UK and European clients in our portfolio.\n\n*We have followed the PCAF recommendation to only account for drawn lending exposure in our financed emission disclosure. It is important to highlight that the undrawn portion of the power generation portfolio could result in fluctuations to the emission and power intensity baseline.\n\nAchieving our ambition will be dependent on the UK and European countries putting in place the policy frameworks to meet decarbonisation goals and major utilities achieving their decarbonisation objectives. We will work with the Government and our clients to help support this transition.\n\n## Green finance\n\nIn 2020, we provided over \u00a32.3 billion of green finance in Commercial Banking, through our Clean Growth Finance Initiative, Commercial Real Estate Green Lending Initiative, Renewable Energy Financing and Green Bond facilitation. This increased our total green finance to over \u00a37.3 billion since 2016. In addition, we have supported clients with over \u00a31.8 billion of Sustainability Linked Loans since 2017.\n\n## New climate pledges for our own operations\n\nIn 2019 we announced achievement of our 2030 carbon emission reduction goal for our own operations, 11 years early, having reduced carbon emissions by 63 per cent between 2009 and 2019, and exceeding our 60 per cent reduction target. We are now able to announce three new operational climate pledges which",

We plan to reduce our direct emissions (known as Scope 1 and 2 emissions) by at least 75 per cent (compared to 2018/9 levels)\n- We will reduce our total energy consumption by 50 per cent by 2030 (compared to 2018/9). Whilst we already procure zero carbon electricity, it remains crucial that we reduce the amount of power we consume to support the UK in meeting an increasing demand for renewable energy\n- We will maintain travel carbon emissions below 50 per cent of pre COVID-19 (2018/9) levels, embedding for the long-term the\n\nreduced levels of commuting and business travel seen during the pandemic and supporting colleagues to switch to low carbon transport.\n\nAchieving these goals will not be easy, and we will need to invest in our buildings over the next decade, supporting the UK to make a green recovery. We will continue to deploy energy efficient technology including LED lighting and improved building controls. We will remove all use of natural gas from our estate, replacing our gas boilers with zero carbon heating technologies and create more sustainable branches in communities across the UK. Many of the technologies we will need to use are still new and we will need to work closely with our partners and supply chain to innovate.\n\n## Looking forward\n\nIn 2021, we will continue to develop additional sector-based ambitions to support our goal to help reduce the emissions we finance by more than 50 per cent by 2030. We will continue to enhance our methodologies and framework for reporting climate risks and opportunities, taking into account relevant industry guidelines and regulatory reporting requirements. This will further advance our disclosures and respond to the evolving needs of both our shareholders and other stakeholders.\n\n- Read more on climate change related performance lloydsbankinggroup.com/who-we-are responsible-business/downloads.html\n\n## Table 1.

In 2020, we have developed and piloted a tool in Commercial Banking to help assess our clients' physical and transitions risks.\n- We have established a dedicated Responsible Investment team in our Insurance and Wealth division and have launched our Responsible Investment Framework and Stewardship policy through Scottish Widows.\n\nThe Group expects all of our customers to comply with applicable international conventions, sanctions and embargoes, legislation, and licensing requirements whilst showing a clear commitment to robust ESG/uni00A0performance and risk management.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## The Climate Transition World Equity fund\n\nScottish Widows partnered with BlackRock to create a new fund aligned to the goals of the Paris Agreement, helping mitigate climate change risks and benefiting from the opportunities relating to the low carbon transition. We have now initially committed \u00a32 billion from our default pension offering to be invested into this fund - the Climate Transition World Equity fund, which was launched in August. This will enable over 2.6/uni00A0million pension savers to invest more sustainably.\n\nWe are also expanding its use within our wider multi-asset fund range. Compared to benchmark, this fund could be expected to achieve a 50 per cent reduction in carbon emissions intensity and to achieve 60 per cent more revenue from 'green' technologies. We continue to integrate ESG factors into the rest of the default pension investment offering, with the underlying funds moving to introduce exclusions on companies which fail to meet our standards on United Nations Global Compact, Controversial Weapons, Thermal Coal and Tar Sands over the next year, as publicised in the Scottish Widows Exclusions Policy.\n\n## Lloyds Banking Group sector statements\n\nThe Group has identified selected sectors and defined specific risk appetites related to our financing activities.\n\nOur 2020 review of our sector statements has tightened our lending appetite for exposure to the coal sector even further. The Group will not:\n\n- Engage new Commercial Banking customers where any revenue is derived from operating thermal or metallurgical coal mines,\n- Directly finance new or existing UK coalfired power stations by the end of 2022,\n- Support new project finance or direct investment in coal power operations of diversified utility companies elsewhere in the world, unless the finance is used to decommission the coal power generation or convert to renewable power generation, or\n- Provide general purpose banking or lending to any new customers where any revenue is derived from operating coal-fired power stations in the UK.\n\nWe will continue to support existing customers in the coal industry to diversify their strategy to eliminate coal mining or coal power operations from their UK operations in line with the Government's 2024 phase-out target. We will also continue to encourage clients with international coal-related operations to reduce their exposure in line with the Paris Agreement.\n\nDuring 2020 we have placed additional emphasis on the importance of engagement with clients in the oil and gas sector to determine whether they have Paris-aligned transition plans in place.\n\nWe will continue to develop sector specific guidance to help relationship managers identify climate risks.\n\nOur full sector statements are available on our website, and further detail related to the sector statements can be found in the 2020 Lloyds Banking Group ESG report.\n\n## Sustainability risks and lending\n\nAs part of the Group's credit risk policy, we have mandatory requirements to consider environmental risks in key risk management activities. In Commercial Banking, Relationship Managers must continue to ensure that sustainability risk is considered for all new and renewal facilities, and specifically commented on where credit limits exceed \u00a3500,000.\n\nIn 2020, we have developed and piloted a tool in Commercial Banking to help assess our clients' physical and transition risks.\n\nThe Group is a signatory to The Equator Principles, a risk management framework for managing environmental and social risks in Project Finance transactions, such as large scale energy, industrial, or infrastructure projects.\n\nOur 2020 performance table related to The Equator Principles can be found in the 2020 Lloyds Banking Group ESG Report.\n\n## Responsible investment and stewardship\n\nOver the course of 2020 we have focused on building robust foundations for future responsible investment activity, launching our responsible investment framework in March and developing Stewardship and exclusions policies. We have also established a Responsible Investment (RI) team which is made up of professionals with diverse backgrounds in RI, policy, research, advocacy, data, and climate science.\n\nExecutive oversight is provided by a Responsible Investment Committee. This Committee, with strong Board support, plays a pivotal role in setting Scottish Widows' sustainability agenda and provides strategic direction to our responsible investment activity.\n\nAs an asset owner, we work with the largest of our investee companies to engender positive change and enhance their approach to climate and Board diversity issues. We ask all of our fund managers to comply with the UK Stewardship Code or an equivalent for their jurisdiction.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Group was the first FTSE 100 company to launch a new public goal to specifically increase Black representation in senior roles to align with the overall UK labour market.\n- We have published our first Ethnicity Pay Gap Report.\n- We have published our annual Gender Pay Gap Report.\n- We achieved the external HamptonAlexander goal of 33 per cent women in the combined Executive Committee and Direct Report population.\n\nLloyds Banking Group aims to create a fully inclusive environment that is representative of modern-day Britain and where everyone can reach their potential. We continue to invest in making the Group a leading inclusive employer, where the unique differences our colleagues bring to work every day are valued.\n\nBuilding a truly inclusive organisation also requires us to be an anti-racist organisation one where all colleagues speak up, challenge, and act to take an active stance against racism and discrimination of any kind.\n\nGetting this right is at the heart of our purpose to Help Britain Prosper - a more inclusive society is a more prosperous society, and a diverse business is a better business.\n\n## Ethnic diversity\n\nIn 2018 we made a public commitment to increase the ethnic diversity of both our overall and senior workforce, which has led to positive changes. Feedback from our Black colleagues however, demonstrated that there was still more to do.\n\nIn July 2020, our Group Chief Executive, Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio launched our Race Action plan. The Group was the first FTSE 100 company to make such a public commitment, which includes a new public goal to specifically increase Black representation in senior roles from 0.6 per cent at senior grades to at least 3/uni00A0per cent by 2025, to align with the overall UK labour market.

We have also appointed 23 Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic colleagues to form a Race advisory panel, who are already providing invaluable input into our plan.\n\nIn December 2020, we broadened our plan to go further and work beyond our own internal boundaries by actively supporting Black communities through our partnerships with Foundervine and the Black Business Network.\n\nFurther information and progress in relation to our implementation of our Race Action plan can be found in the 2020 Lloyds Banking Group ESG Report.\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

The Board currently meets, and will aim to continue to meet, the objectives of the Parker review for at least one Black, Asian or Minority Ethnic Board member.\n\n## Gender diversity\n\nWe champion gender equality through promoting a strong pipeline of executive female talent for the future. Our ambitious target to have 40 per cent of senior management roles filled by women by the end of 2020 has seen us advance from 28 per cent in 2014 to 37 per cent at the end of 2020. Our progress has been recognised externally for the second year in the 2020 Bloomberg Gender Equality Index, and for the 9th consecutive year in the Times Top 50 Employers for Women. We have also been recognised by Working Families as a Top 10 Employer for working families. We achieved both the external Hampton-Alexander goals of 33 per cent women in the combined Executive Committee and Direct Report population and 33 per cent female Board representation, and will aim to continue to do so.\n\n## Gender identity and sexual orientation\n\nWe are proud to have created an inclusive and open working environment for our LGBT+ colleagues. Our LGBT+ colleague network, Rainbow, plays a pivotal role in our approach, and with over 5,000 members and supporters, is one of the largest networks of its kind in the UK. In 2020, our Rainbow network celebrated their 10 year anniversary and held a series of virtual Pride events for colleagues spanning ten weeks, reaching over 1,600 colleagues and raising \u00a310,000 for LGBT+ charities.\n\n## Supporting disability\n\nThe Group is committed to creating an inclusive and diverse organisation where colleagues with disabilities or long-term health conditions feel valued and supported to reach their full potential. This has been recognised through the Group holding the Business Disability Forum Gold Standard accreditation and retaining Disability Confident Leader status from the Department for Work and Pensions, which recognise the inclusive culture of the Group and the support we provide our colleagues who identified as having a disability. The Group offers bespoke training, career development and adjustments for colleagues and applicants with disabilities, including those who became disabled while employed.\n\n- Read more on our progress and actions on supporting Inclusion and Diversity lloydsbankinggroup.com/who-we-are responsible-business/downloads.html\n\n## Assisting our customers\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Highlights\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- To assist our customers during the pandemic, we launched a number of financial, digital and mental health support initiatives.\n- We made it easier for our customers less able to see us in branch, to contact us by launching priority phone lines with increased telephony resource, allowing them to reach us quickly and to avoid the need for unnecessary journeys.\n- We made over 750,000 outbound wellbeing calls to customers to offer support in 2020 through our branch networks, and partnered with Mental Health UK to create a mental health support section to our customer-facing webpages.\n\nThe Group is committed to providing meaningful support to meet the needs of our customers, aiming to provide positive outcomes and working to mitigate or reduce the risk of financial harm. The COVID-19 pandemic has magnified existing challenges faced by customers, and brought new challenges affecting health, income, and relationships.\n\nWe have supported over a million customers with payment holidays across Mortgages, Credit Cards, Loans and Motor Finance. This has given customers the flexibility they need to help get them back on track and the comfort that their credit file will not be impacted.\n\nAcross Mortgages and Motor Finance, we remain committed to giving customers time to recover from the impact of the pandemic without losing their home or vehicle. Additionally, further support was provided to our current account customers, with all customers benefiting from an initial three month interest free buffer on their overdraft.\n\nWe made it easier for our customers less able to see us in branch, to contact us by launching a priority phone number. Priority lines have been set up for NHS workers and over 70's along with increased telephony resource, to support our customers, allowing them to reach us quickly and to avoid the need for unnecessary journeys. Our branch colleagues made over 750,000 outbound wellbeing calls to customers throughout the year not only to support customers with their banking needs but to check on their wellbeing, and in some cases connect customers to local support.\n\nProgress in 2020\n\nWe recognise that many customers have chosen to interact with us digitally through this period, and have developed a number of new online journeys which give customers access to set up and service forbearance plans with us. This also helps us to keep our phone lines available for those who need or want to speak to us. Further information on our digital support to customers is on page 28.\n\n- Read more on how we are supporting our customers lloydsbankinggroup.com/who-we-are responsible-business/downloads.html\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Customer mental health\n\nIt has never been more important to continue to work to support our customers' mental health and wellbeing, given the extra pressures the current pandemic has placed upon us all. During the pandemic, we have provided mental health support including funding for The Silverline, who support the over 55s who may be feeling lonely and isolated. In addition to this, we worked in partnership with our Charity Partner Mental Health UK to create bespoke mental health support for our website. Signposting for customers was introduced to mental health support available through our websites, mobile apps and direct mail.",

The pandemic has had a profound impact on the way we live our lives and on the global economy. We remain fully focused on helping our customers and the UK economy recover, in collaboration with Government and our regulators.\n\nThis year we have actively supported our clients with over \u00a312 billion of Government backed lending in addition to a range of propositions including approximately 34,000 capital repayment holidays and around 22,000 fee-free overdrafts as part of the Group's \u00a32/uni00A0billion COVID-19 fund. As the impact of the pandemic has been felt across the UK, we have also looked to address wider concerns related to the impact on businesses in a number of ways through providing online guides and a webcast series. Content has covered topics such as managing fraud risks, mental health, the road to a low carbon economy, optimising working capital and risk management.\n\nSince 2018, we have now helped over 265,000 businesses start up and re-affirmed our commitment to the UK's manufacturing sector providing \u00a33.7 billion of dedicated investment, whilst continuing to build on our financial commitments with our broader support for a range of issues that impact business skills and productivity every day.\n\nProgress in 2020\n\n## Helping Britain get a home\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Highlights\n\n- We have delivered close to \u00a39bn of finance for the Social Housing sector since 2018.\n- 1,900 new homes were built through The Housing Growth Partnership by SME's through our support.\n- We provided \u00a339.7 billion to first time home buyers since 2018.\n\nAs the largest lender to the UK housing sector we recognise the importance of home ownership and that a lack of affordable housing can lead to social disadvantage.

We have also increased the ways in which we support first time buyers in accessing the property market by welcoming applications from the new Scottish First Homes Fund, making it easier for those with little or no savings to buy their first home.\n\nFurther information on how we are helping Britain to get a home can be found in the 2020 Lloyds Banking Group ESG Report.\n\n- Read more on how we are helping Britain\n- to get a home lloydsbankinggroup.com/who-we-are responsible-business/downloads.html\n\nIn January 2020 we announced a new partnership with the Woodland Trust to plant ten million trees over the next ten years expanding the UK's carbon sink and helping to reforest the UK.

Through our annual investment in the AMTC, we have trained and upskilled 1,211 manufacturing apprentices, graduates and engineers in manufacturing since 2018.\n\nIn addition, by utilising our apprenticeship levy we have now committed in excess of \u00a35.4/uni00A0million supporting over 230 businesses and 450 apprentices to invest in critical science, technology, engineering, maths (STEM) and digital skills that will support the UK's recovery across London, West Midlands and Greater Manchester. This is part of a \u00a39/uni00A0million commitment by the Group over three years to help small and medium enterprises to develop apprenticeships through our Levy Transfer initiative.\n\n## Supporting businesses with digital skills\n\nFor over five years, Lloyds Banking Group has evidenced how crucial technology is for small businesses and the digital economy through the Business Digital Index reports. We partner with Be the Business, Google, Microsoft, Small Business Britain and others to support small businesses to gain skills and confidence to both recover and thrive, by adapting their businesses with technology. We have held free workshops, peer to peer networking sessions across all regions of the UK and have a range of free on-demand learning available, helping over 368,000 organisations since 2018, with more in plan for 2021.\n\nFurther information on how we are supporting businesses and SMEs as well as our strategic partnerships can be found in the 2020 Lloyds/uni00A0Banking Group ESG Report.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPartnering with the Woodland Trust\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

Through the latter, we have assisted over 8,000 people to learn digital skills to be able to access online services and connect virtually with family and friends.\n- We established a Domestic and Economic Abuse Team, conducted training for our colleagues on how to support customers facing these circumstances through strategic partnerships, and supported charities assisting victims.\n\n## The digital skills gap\n\n## Lloyds Bank Academy\n\nTo facilitate the shift to a more digital economy, the Group has developed the Lloyds Bank Academy. The Academy teaches basic digital and workplace skills through online and face-to face courses, aiming to provide support where, when and how people need it. During 2020 these courses shifted to online webinars due to lockdown restrictions.\n\nThe Group has facilitated digital training for 1.8 million people since 2018 through the Academy and the Academy curriculum continues to expand having a breadth of content and partners, including large corporates, charities, credit unions and job seekers. Our insight is used by both Government and other organisations in the UK. Our Consumer Digital Index was viewed in over 85 countries with over 37,000 views online.\n\n## FutureDotNow\n\nLloyds Banking Group is a founding organisation of FutureDotNow, a coalition of leading companies in the UK dedicated to accelerating the UK's digital skills at scale, with a focus on the employees and customers of large organisations. As the pandemic started to impact communities in the UK, the Group was heavily involved with the DevicesDotNow emergency campaign, helping with the call to industry for devices, data and support for people who were shielding. The campaign raised over \u00a31.5 million and funding secured to deliver over 11,500 devices, data and support to customers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Domestic and economic abuse\n\nThrough the year the UK has seen an increase in reports of economic and domestic abuse. We are proud of the support we have made available to victims and survivors. The introduction of the Domestic and Economic Abuse Team to help victims of financial and economic abuse was an important next step in both raising awareness and supporting our customers.\n\nOur engagement with the charity Surviving Economic Abuse has been critical to achieving this and working with them, we have developed an ability to support victims in separating financial affairs quickly and, where appropriate, to offer forbearance from debt incurred as a result of coercion.\n\nDuring 2020, to support our initiatives, we have partnered with the charities Surviving Economic Abuse and Tender to train our colleagues to support customers experiencing domestic and financial abuse, and have engaged with a number of charities to refer victims and survivors of abuse to our Domestic and Economic Abuse Team for support with their finances. We work very closely with the charity Safe Lives. Safe Lives have participated in our live broadcasts and colleague webinars which we run all year round to provide expert advice and guidance to colleagues.\n\n## Financial capability\n\nThe Group has a suite of financial capability resources available online. These interactive tools are designed to be an engaging and informative way of helping children and young people understand money and financial management.\n\nIn support of our communities and in the spirit of Helping Britain Recover from the ongoing pandemic, content has been made available to all via the Lloyds Bank Academy.

The Group has had a \u00a345.6 billion growth in open book assets 1 that we hold on behalf of customers in retirement and investment products since 2018.\n\n- 1  Growth in assets under administration on our front books\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## We Are Digital Helpline\n\nThe Group delivered a new dedicated phone line which provides guidance and remote training to customers less able to see us in branch, to help them stay connected with everyday digital activities, including online banking. Customers were contacted and able to access free and practical support to help them stay connected online. With guidance from We Are Digital's agents, users learn skills to help with everyday tasks such as online shopping, booking a doctor's appointment using the NHS website, connecting virtually with family and friends, as well as internet banking. The service provides not just remote help via a telephone, but has also allowed for customers and charities in need to be able to be provided with a basic tablet device. We provided over 1,000 devices and data, and helped 12,500 callers to the helpline.",

These charities are tackling issues such as domestic abuse, mental health, modern slavery and human trafficking, and employability. The Group's commitment to maintain its \u00a325.5 million in the Foundations funding in 2021 helps secure a more certain future for charities during these difficult times and safeguard the important work that they do.\n\nIn addition to adapting many of our community engagement initiatives to virtual delivery, we have responded directly to community needs through new investments. These investments included the expansion of our Mental Health and Money Advice lines, CLIC online chat services run by our Charity of the Year partner Mental Health UK (MHUK), and the provision of mobile devices through a partnership with We Are Digital (See page 28)\n\nOur total community investment in 2020 was \u00a351.2 million and includes our colleagues' time, direct donations, and a share of  the Group's profits given annually to the Foundations.\n\nFurther information related to how we are supporting our community initiatives can be found in the 2020 Lloyds Banking Group ESG Report.\n\n- Read more on how we are supporting our community initiatives lloydsbankinggroup.com/who-we-are responsible-business/downloads.html\n\nE\n\nS\n\nG\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Highlights\n\n- Health and safety of our colleagues and customers was a key COVID-19 response focus, ensuring our offices and branches were compliant with regulations, safe and able to remain open.\n- Over 50,000 colleagues were supported in converting to a working from home arrangement with technology, equipment and IT assistance.\n- Free access was provided for all colleagues to the Headspace app, and we have continued to train colleagues to become mental health advocates.\n- Our colleague engagement surveys indicated overall that colleagues felt supported, that the company culture was more positive and caring, and that there is an interest by colleagues to explore changing ways of working in the/uni00A0future.\n- 4.1 million hours of training were delivered to colleagues primarily via virtual training delivery.\n\n## Providing a safe work environment\n\nDuring 2020, a key challenge posed by the pandemic was for the Group to continue to provide essential financial services through its physical infrastructure and remain open to customers. The Group has been implementing business changes to manage the pandemic since early 2020, and has reviewed every iteration of the UK Government's advice. By the end of 2020, the Group had co-ordinated over 3,000 risk assessments across our operations to ensure all offices and branches are compliant with legislation and safe for our colleagues and customers.\n\n## Agile working\n\nWe have seen changing customer demands, changing colleague needs and expectations, a fluctuating and less stable business environment, and significant economic issues which have led the Group to consider how to reimagine the way we work.\n\nPrior to the pandemic, the Group had approximately 35 per cent of colleagues with an existing agile working arrangement however, due to national lockdown in early 2020, this extended to over 50,000 colleagues working from a home environment. During 2021 we will continue to reimagine ways of working and use behavioural experiments to test our thinking and identify the practicalities of various options.\n\n## Colleague mental health\n\nHighlights in 2020 related to our colleague mental health initiatives included the continued expansion of our 'Optimal Leadership Resilience Programme' to more of our leaders in order to help them build personal resilience. In addition, we continue to promote the 'Your Resilience' portal to all colleagues, including new content to support our colleagues with the additional challenges they may face as a result of the pandemic.\n\nWe have extended our partnership with Headspace, offering all colleagues a free subscription to the market leading meditation app, providing access to mindfulness modules covering a range of topics from stress to self-esteem.\n\n## Emergency support\n\nThe pandemic has brought the issue of domestic and economic abuse to the fore. In 2020, we launched an Emergency Assistance Programme covering the cost of emergency accommodation and one-to-one support. This is available to all Lloyds Banking Group colleagues and their children, at no cost to them. During this emergency stay, the colleague can receive additional support from our Employee Assistance Programme which will help them through their next steps and provide support.\n\n## Colleague engagement\n\nThe Group understands that engagement is a two-way process, so each year we ask colleagues to share their views via our independently-run colleague survey, and participate in the annual Banking Standards Board (BSB) Culture Assessment. Our Spring Pulse colleague survey had a 66 per/uni00A0cent response rate and indicated positive reflections related to colleagues feeling supported, the company culture being more positive and caring and indicated an interest by colleagues to explore changing ways of working in the future. Our Autumn survey was completed by 72 per cent of the organisation and showed further increases in pride, satisfaction and overall engagement.\n\n## Colleague remuneration\n\nA number of key decisions were taken to support colleagues in relation to pay and financial and non-financial recognition. All Group employees receive a competitive and fair reward package. To encourage ownership colleagues are eligible to participate in HMRCapproved share plans. Further information is provided on page 115.\n\n- Read more on how we support our colleagues lloydsbankinggroup.com/who-we-are responsible-business/downloads.html\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

        "page_content": "OUR ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL PERFORMANCE\n\n## Conducting our Business Responsibly\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Highlights\n\n- 482 concerns were raised through our Speak Up line of which 178 were formally investigated with 41 per cent of those investigations substantiated.\n- We became members of the United for Wildlife Financial Taskforce.\n- We co-sponsored the National Economic Crime Centre (NECC) initiative to tackle criminals seeking to exploit COVID-19.\n- Supplier expenditure was \u00a35.1 billion with over 95 per cent of our third-party supplier spend incorporated in the UK.\n- \u00a34 billion of taxes paid over to the UK Government.\n\n## Supporting colleagues to do the right thing\n\nOur Values and Behaviours alongside the Financial Conduct Authority's Conduct rules set out the expectations of colleagues and colleagues are encouraged to make decisions aligned to these. The Group's Code of Ethics and Responsibility is available on our website.\n\n## Speak Up\n\nColleagues are encouraged to speak up, challenge and act if they witness anything inappropriate and we provide colleagues with a variety of channels to do this. They can report the matter directly to Group Conduct Investigations, or make use of our independent and confidential Speak Up service, that is operated by a third party. All concerns are taken seriously and if an investigation is required, it will be conducted sensitively by an independent party. In 2020 colleagues reported 482 concerns, of which 178 were formally investigated following triage, with 41 per cent of those investigations substantiated, resulting in remedial action. Other Group services also exist to support colleagues in trying to informally resolve grievances. In addition, a new informal resolution channel 'Let's Talk' was launched to support colleagues to reflect on their concerns and understand their rights and options so that grievances can be effectively and appropriately resolved through formal and informal channels.\n\n## Human rights and modern slavery\n\nThe Group believes in the importance of doing business in ways that value and respect the human rights of our colleagues, customers, business partners and communities affected by our business. We are guided by the International Bill of Human Rights as well as the International Labour Organisation's (ILO) Core Labour Standards and its Tripartite Declaration of Principles.\n\nAs signatories to the United Nations (UN) Global Compact, we are aligned with its human rights and labour standards and report on our progress annually. We also recognise the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the UN's Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.\n\nPursuant to the UK Modern Slavery Act, we produce a Modern Slavery Statement on an annual basis. The Statement outlines the steps we take to combat modern slavery and human trafficking in our business and supply chains and the steps we take to respond and support survivors and is available on our website.\n\n## Conduct risk\n\nThe Group takes a range of mitigating actions with respect to conduct risk and remains focused on delivering a leading customer experience. The Group's ongoing commitment to fair customer outcomes sets the tone from the top and supports the development of our Values led culture which puts customers at the heart, strengthening links between actions to support conduct, culture and customers and enabling more effective control management.\n\nMore information related to our approach and management of Conduct Risk can be located on page 197.\n\n## Customer complaints\n\nOur goal, in line with our purpose of Helping Britain Prosper, is to support customers whenever they have cause to complain.\n\nTo ensure that we supported our customers, we introduced prioritisation principles to ensure customers in challenging financial situations were prioritised. We reviewed approximately 35,000 complaints and prioritised over 2,300 to our highest category, aiming to make contact with the customer within 24 hours. Where we noted a concentration of complaints, we reviewed our working patterns to ensure those customers were supported.\n\nWe evolved our method of customer communication by contacting our customers via SMS to reduce the time they would need to wait for an update, and to minimise our colleagues' need to visit an office. We will review on an ongoing basis how we can continue to help our customers.\n\n## Protecting customer data and finances\n\n## Cyber security\n\nCustomers trust us to keep their money and data safe, and the Group deploys sophisticated technology to protect both. We recognise the importance of secure behaviours and continue to educate our customers and colleagues on cyber threats.\n\nWe continue as a founding member of the Financial Services Cyber Collaboration Centre, working with the Government's National Cyber Security Centre, and the Cross-Market Operational Resilience Group. We work closely with other banks recognising the importance of collaboration when it comes to security, including as part of the Cyber Defence Alliance (CDA). Recognising cyber security as a non-competitive issue, we continue to collaborate externally to protect the Group and the wider industry.\n\n## Fraud and financial crime\n\nThe financial crime landscape is undergoing unprecedented change in terms of both regulatory reform and evolving crime threats. The Group's adoption of a risk-based approach to managing and mitigating fraud and financial crime risk ensures compliance with applicable regulations via a control framework which focuses on those customers, products, channels, and jurisdictions that carry heightened risk.\n\nThere are core Group wide policies within the Group's risk management framework relating to fraud, anti-money laundering, counter terrorist financing, sanctions and prohibitions, and anti-bribery. A combined fraud and financial crime mandatory training course reflecting key policy requirements is undertaken by all colleagues annually.\n\nFurther information related to how we are conducting our business responsibly can be found in the 2020 Lloyds Banking Group ESG/uni00A0Report.\n\n- Read more on information related to our progress in Fraud and Financial Crime initiatives\n- lloydsbankinggroup.com/who-we-are responsible-business/downloads.html",

We work with approximately 3,000 active suppliers of varying sizes, with the majority in the professional services sectors such as management consultancy, legal, HR, IT, operations, marketing and communication. In 2020 our supplier expenditure was \u00a35.1/uni00A0billion with over 95 per cent of our third-party supplier spend incorporated in the UK.\n\nThe Group requires suppliers to adhere to relevant Group policies, and suppliers are additionally required to comply with our Code of Supplier Responsibility which outlines our expectations for responsible business, sustainability practice and behaviour. Our suppliers are asked in addition to this, to comply with specific third-party supplier policies as applicable to the services they provide to the Group.\n\nAny supplier related grievances or concerns can be raised using our confidential SpeakUp whistleblowing service. Further information related to key Board decisions on supplier management are located on page 51.\n\n## Tax\n\nAppropriate, prudent and transparent tax behaviour is a key component of corporate responsibility. Tax is one of the ways in which businesses contribute to the societies in which they operate, and we are proud to be among the UK's highest payers of corporate taxes.\n\nIn 2020 we paid \u00a32.1 billion of cash taxes. This was primarily on business profits, VAT on goods and services needed to run our business, bank levy and employer social security on staff salaries. In addition, we collected \u00a31.9 billion of cash taxes primarily from payroll taxes and customer product taxes. We comply with/uni00A0the HMRC Code of Practice on Taxation for Banks.\n\nFor further information about the taxes we pay, and the economic value we generate for the UK, please refer to our annual Tax Strategy document on the Lloyds Banking Group website.\n\nAdditional information on how we are conducting our business responsibly can be found in the 2020 Lloyds Banking Group ESG Report.\n\n- Read more on how we are conducting our business responsibly lloydsbankinggroup.com/who-we-are responsible-business/downloads.html\n\n## NON-FINANCIAL INFORMATION STATEMENT\n\nThis section of the strategic report constitutes Lloyds Banking Group's Non-Financial Information Statement, produced to comply with/uni00A0sections 414CA and 414CB of the Companies Act.

There are uncertainties in both directions.\n- Our low risk business model and focus on efficiency serves us well in an uncertain environment. Nevertheless, improving Group financial performance is heavily dependent on economic recovery.\n\n## Overview\n\n2020 was an extraordinarily difficult year for the UK economy with GDP falling by almost 10/uni00A0per/uni00A0cent due to the restrictions on activity necessary to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. Emergency action from the Government and banks was key in limiting long-term damage, but the pace and extent of recovery are uncertain, dependent crucially on how quickly and how completely vaccine programmes in the UK and abroad can be delivered and suppress mutating variants of COVID-19. Significant restrictions on activity are expected to ease only/uni00A0gradually through 2021, and unemployment and business closures will drag on the economy's ability to return to the pre-COVID level of output, which we expect to take until during 2024.\n\nThe economy could perform better than this central expectation, if there is a quicker impact of vaccines on the ability to ease activity restrictions or a sudden release of unexpected savings that some households have accrued. On the other hand, difficulties in deploying effective vaccines and consequences on spending plans of the sharp rise in Government and companies' debt could lead to an even weaker economic recovery than expected. Uncertainty for the longer-term outlook has also increased, around the ability of productivity growth to improve, the impact of increased indebtedness on future interest rates and Government policy reaction to the deep and unequal societal impacts of the COVID-19 recession.\n\n## Market dynamics\n\nThe 2020 recession has been unlike any previous recession, driven by mandated restrictions on activity focused on sectors where social contact is highest, but accompanied by unprecedented policy support. The younger and lower-paid have been at greatest risk of lost employment or reduced income, while some others have had their financial position improved by a period of continued income but reduced spending.\n\nThis recession has impacted our markets very differently to previous recessions. Consumer credit fell sharply as spending was constrained, but growth in households' deposits was buoyed to over 10 per cent from 4 per cent in 2019. Mortgage balance growth slowed only slightly to 3.0 per cent from 3.4 per cent in 2019, companies lending rose strongly by over 9 per/uni00A0cent driven by the Government's guaranteed lending schemes, and companies deposits growth was also boosted to a very strong 28/uni00A0per cent. The rise in unemployment, of 1.2/uni00A0per cent by November has been much less than would normally be expected for such a deep fall in GDP, due to Government support via the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme and the Jobs Support Scheme. The housing market has also been more buoyant through the second half of 2020 than expected, with prices rising by almost 6 per cent in 2020, benefiting from employment support, from the temporary cut in stamp duty, and from unexpected households' savings.\n\n2021 is expected to see the start of unwinding of many of these impacts as consumer spending recovers further and businesses begin to pay down some of the debt recently accrued. Unemployment is expected to rise further to a peak around 8 per cent during the second half of 2021 as furlough support is withdrawn. We expect average house prices to fall 4 per cent in 2021, as the stamp duty reduction expires and as first time buyer demand is constrained by a lower employment rate amongst the young and very limited pay growth. Mortgages growth is expected to weaken to its slowest in seven years. Consumer credit growth is expected to remain subdued, and growth in households' deposits to slow sharply from its high rate of 2020. Balances of companies' lending and deposits are both expected to fall in 2021 after their large increases of 2020. Interest rates are likely to stay very low near-term, to help the economy recover at a time when Government and companies' debt has increased significantly.\n\nUncertainty for the longer-term growth outlook has increased. Productivity growth averaged just 0.4 per cent per annum over the five years to 2019, compared with nearly 2 per cent per annum before the 2008 financial crisis, and it is unclear how it will evolve in future. The postfinancial-crisis recovery in business investment was weak, and investment fell very sharply again during the pandemic. Additionally, the change in our trading relationship with the EU has introduced additional processes and costs for some businesses. The pandemic may have provided an opportunity to boost productivity through more rapid changes to working practices, preferences for living locations, and accelerated adoption of online purchasing than would have happened otherwise. More positively, the Government's plans to 'level-up' the UK across its regions via a step-change in infrastructure investment could help to spur improved productivity growth.\n\nUncertainty for the longer-term outlook for interest rates has also increased. If high indebtedness drags on growth it may keep interest rates very low for a long time. However, it could also spur a change in policymakers' frameworks for managing economies, towards higher inflation targets and higher nominal interest rates, although this is unlikely for the UK over the coming year at least in our view. An early return to austerity or significant fiscal tightening represents a risk to the outlook.\n\n## Our response\n\nGiven our UK focus, the Group's prospects are closely linked to the performance of the UK economy. Our low risk, stable business model and focus on efficiency positions us well to continue to support customers irrespective of macro conditions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Link to principal risks\n\nCredit\n\nCapital\n\nFunding and liquidity Market",

Customers are increasingly shopping online and turning to digital channels to meet everyday banking needs, while continuing to value human interaction and more direct support for more complex and immediate needs, such as addressing financial difficulties.\n\nCustomer expectations continue to be shaped by experiences outside financial services, with speed, convenience and greater levels of personalisation, based on more sophisticated data insight, becoming ever more important in an increasingly competitive market.\n\n## Our response\n\nDuring the COVID crisis, we have been fully focused on providing the necessary financial and practical support in an empathic way to our personal and business customers.\n\nWe have introduced a range of measures to alleviate the most immediate financial pressures and provided support through dedicated Government backed schemes.\n\nWe have ensured that our customers could continue to benefit from our multi-channel model and have maintained good access to our banking services. We have also set up dedicated phone lines to give priority access to NHS staff and our more elderly customers.\n\nLooking beyond our customers' financial needs, we have provided digital skills training to help more of our personal and business customers get online, mentoring support to our business customers, and increased support for our customers' mental health needs.\n\nIn addition to these more immediate priorities, we have continued to invest in our capabilities, improve our service and support, develop new propositions and deliver a number of significant enhancements, especially to the digital propositions available to our personal and business customers.\n\nThe COVID-19 crisis has impacted our customers in different ways and we need to ensure we are able to respond to everyone's circumstances and needs. From helping customers in financial difficulties to get back on track, to building their financial resilience and supporting the achievement of their life-goals across generations, we will continue to leverage our unique data and insights, capabilities and multi-channel business model, to deliver personalised and fit-for purpose propositions.\n\nNow more than ever it is vital that we address our customers' needs holistically and leverage our unique reach, strength of our franchise as well as capabilities, such as Single Customer View. An end-to-end focus on customers' life-time needs will create additional value for our customers and strengthen our competitive advantages.\n\nIn order to meet all our customers' evolving payment needs in their channel of choice, we will need to continue modernising our payments infrastructure to deliver a seamless customer experience. Our unparalleled market position and strong participation across the payments ecosystem mean we can support our clients in improving their payments systems for their customers, while simplifying the retail experience.\n\nOur commercial clients have also seen their businesses being impacted in different ways and we will continue to support them through the crisis and get back on their feet, whatever their circumstances might be. We are also looking to help our business customers adapt and grow back stronger and more sustainably, introducing new value adding services and improving our capabilities. As businesses are increasingly looking to self-serve their simple banking needs, we are enhancing our digital offering and improving our product portfolio to deepen our client relationships through the cycle.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

Key areas of focus for 2021 are below:\n\n## Customer treatment\n\nFair treatment of customers continues to be a priority for the FCA, with particular focus on those in vulnerable circumstances as well as long standing customers.\n\n## Capital regulation\n\nThe Group continues its implementation of regulatory capital developments including the final Basel III reforms.\n\n## IBOR transition\n\nProgress continues, with alternative products delivered and transfer of clients to updated products underway.\n\n## Other\n\nA number of other regulatory initiatives are underway which seek to address, amongst other things; operational resilience, climate change, general insurance pricing, onshoring EU regulations, strong customer authentication, culture and fraud. The Group also continues to respond to regulatory initiatives in respect of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n## Our response\n\nAs a Group we always seek to comply with all applicable regulation. Given the Group's customer focused, sustainable and low risk business model, it is well placed to meet these requirements and welcomes the positive effect that they have on the industry, its customers and other stakeholders.\n\n## Link to principal risks\n\nRegulatory and legal\n\nConduct\n\nCredit\n\nCapital\n\nMarket\n\nOperational resilience\n\n- Climate\n\n## COMPETITION\n\n## Highlights\n\n- Our competitive landscape continues to broaden with an increasing number of digital-only providers, although the current environment has increased scrutiny on the profitability and sustainability of these business models\n- Established competitors continue to re-focus on core business areas, with some restructuring exercises accelerated to offset increasing revenue headwinds in the low-rate environment. More diversified peers have benefited through the COVID-19 crisis to date due to a reduced reliance on interest income and increased market volatility\n- Threat from big-tech and large international peers remains\n\n## Market dynamics\n\nThe Group continues to operate in competitive markets, with competition supported by regulatory change, ongoing shifts in customer behaviours and increasing levels of innovation. Against this backdrop the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly accelerated the pace of change in numerous areas.\n\nDigital-only providers have continued to gain traction with customers. Neobanks, in particular, have replicated a more traditional customer offering alongside strong digital functionality, while marketplace models enable collaboration and provide customers access to a broader suite of products and services.\n\nHowever, the COVID-19 crisis has had a meaningful impact on a number of these businesses, slowing growth and limiting revenue streams. This has created a heightened focus on the profitability and sustainability of these models, with greater levels of uncertainty reflected in lower valuations in a number of recent funding rounds. While these pressures have the potential to limit disruptive threats over the near to medium-term, the threat from more differentiated businesses, often those who pursue a more traditional banking model, are likely to persist.\n\nBeyond this, more traditional competitors have continued to re-focus on core business areas while also improving their own digital offerings. During the COVID-19 crisis, peers with more diversified revenue streams that are less dependent on interest income have tended to perform more resiliently, although the sustainability of these trends is uncertain given market volatility levels. In addition, some peers have accelerated existing restructuring exercises as a means to offset future revenue headwinds.\n\nFinally, we continue to see a threat from leading technology companies and international incumbents, with these well positioned to potentially capture opportunities in the UK market with digital only offerings, and we have seen some emerging signs of this.\n\n## Our response\n\nWe continue to respond effectively to the threats posed by increasing levels of competition and a more challenging operating environment by offering products and services that our customers value.\n\nOur strong franchise, combined with an ongoing focus on innovation, provide us with the ability to not only be relevant but also deepen relationships with our customers as we effectively respond to the changing environment.\n\nAcross our core markets we have remained open for business across all channels at a time when our customers have needed support, in line with our purpose of Helping Britain Prosper. Our multi-channel offering, including our leading branch network, allows us to reach a broad variety of customers and enables them to interact with us in whichever manner they prefer. This model, combined with the breadth of our offering as the UK's only integrated financial services provider, drives customer value, engagement and trust. This remains an important competitive advantage, which we will continue to strengthen and enhance, as we are looking to further deepen relationships with our customers through delivering holistic propositions across Retail, Insurance and Wealth.\n\nLooking specifically at our non-physical channels, we remain committed to investing in our digital offering. We continue to respond to functionality developments from neo-bank and big-tech peers that our customers expect to be replicated, and have a strong pipeline of developments for 2021, with faster time-to-market thanks to ongoing investment in technology. Our market leading, simple, low risk business model, and integrated financial services offering position us strongly to compete with a variety of other players in the market. It is therefore crucial that we further strengthen our competitive advantages and develop new ones by diversifying our business, expand our value-adding offering to our customers and capture new growth opportunities.\n\n## Link to principal risks\n\nRegulatory and legal\n\nConduct\n\nOperational\n\nPeople",

This has been underpinned by increasing similarities in customer behaviours and preferences across multiple geographies, heightened expectations of service based on experiences outside of financial services and continued improvements in functionality and capabilities within digital channels. Moreover, the pace of change has accelerated significantly in 2020 as lockdown measures reduced interactions through physical channels, despite these remaining available to customers should they be needed. This trend appears to have continued throughout the year, suggesting a more profound shift rather than a temporary one.\n\nThis continued change in channel preference has created an ongoing need for investment in technology across the sector. This investment often includes but is not limited to enabling the delivery of innovative new features for the benefit of customers, the upgrading and modernising of legacy systems, and the adoption of new technologies such as machine learning, artificial intelligence and cloud based solutions in order to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of an organisation.\n\nBanks have also continued to invest significantly in their data capabilities in order to harness insights and utilise these in order to further improve customer experience. By having a better understanding of customer trends and expectations, banks are able to increase their relevance and offer greater levels of personalisation, replicating experiences that are commonplace in other digitally focused industries. The increased focus on the sharing and utilisation of data has created a growing onus on the safeguarding of this, with this of particular importance given that trust remains a key differentiator between established banks and newer, digital-only financial service providers.\n\n## Our response\n\nTo support our position as the largest digital bank in the UK, we have continued to invest heavily in technology and digital initiatives to ensure that we can continue to deliver a leading customer experience across our differentiated multi-brand, multi-channel model. While the COVID-19 pandemic has led to some slowdown in overall investment spend, we have continued to prioritise digital initiatives, with our technology spend remaining weighted towards creating new capabilities and enhancing existing ones to improve the overall customer experience. During the course of the year we have continued to improve our digital functionality and have simplified digital journeys for our customers, and we expect to further develop these areas in 2021 with a customer-centric pipeline of updates.\n\nDuring the course of 2020, we have also continued to embrace the use of new technologies to improve processes and deliver productivity enhancements, which in turn deliver improved experiences for both customers and colleagues.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis includes using robotics to process over 90 per cent of Bounce Back Loan applications, having built this process from scratch, using technology to accurately and at scale provide credit decisions at a time when customers required urgent support. The use of robotics has significantly improved colleague capacity to focus on providing additional customer support. Across the Group, we have saved more than 1.8 million hours through the use of robotics over the last three years, including over 700,000 in 2020 alone.\n\nIn addition to improving outcomes for customers, significant investment in new technologies and the modernisation of our existing IT architecture have supported our ongoing focus on efficiency, with business as usual costs down 4 per cent in 2020. This relentless focus on efficiency continues to create capacity for future investment, helping us to future-proof our business.\n\nGiven the ongoing shift to digital, ensuring that customer data remains safe is becoming increasingly important. We are therefore continuing to invest in the resilience and security of our systems.\n\n## Link to principal risks\n\nData\n\n- Change/execution\n- Operational resilience\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

Over the past two years we have considered how we can build on the Group's successful transformation, with a defining purpose further embedded in a refreshed strategy that can be at the heart of Britain's recovery while delivering enduring value to all our stakeholders.\n\nUp to June 2019\n\n## Review of strategic progress and look ahead to the next strategic plan\n\nAs part of our strategic cycle, the Board and Executive Management team attend an annual two-day strategy meeting.\n\nIn June 2019, the Board discussed how recent and expected trends across customer behaviours, technology and competition pointed to a narrowing of scenarios for the banking sector's longer-term evolution. In addition, the Board considered the key societal and environmental challenges facing the UK and the Group's role in addressing them.\n\nThese assessments led to the identification of the key emerging priorities for the next strategic plan.\n\nUp to June 2020\n\nUp to February 2021\n\n2021 focus\n\n## Development of highlevel strategic options with Helping Britain Recover at their heart\n\nWhile these priorities remain relevant for the Group's long-term strategic focus, the significant impacts of COVID-19 on the UK and our stakeholders, have become the most important drivers of our shorter-term response and strategic priorities.\n\nIn light of this, the Board and Executive Management team agreed in June 2020 that the Group's purpose should be firmly embedded at the heart of our strategy, with our immediate focus on Helping Britain Recover framing our strategic plan for 2021 as well as the associated priorities regarding our customer propositions, colleagues and Group capabilities.\n\n## Finalisation of strategy and communication\n\nTeams across the Group then helped translate these priorities into more detailed initiatives, ensuring that Helping Britain Recover remains the key focus.\n\nAt an extended Board session in November, attended by both the then incumbent and incoming Chair, these initiatives were subsequently discussed in the context of the investment required in 2021 and the Group's longer-term financial plan.\n\nSince then, the Board have supported the development of detailed plans, with measurable outcomes designed to support successful delivery and mitigate execution risks, as well as the communication approach for our evolution of strategy.\n\n## Building the UK's preferred financial partner\n\nOver the following pages, we outline our strategic priorities for 2021 and beyond, and how they have both been shaped by and will be instrumental in Helping Britain Recover.\n\n## Why the change?\n\nSince 2011, we have significantly transformed our business for the benefit of our customers and other key stakeholders, while also positioning us well to succeed in a digital world. We are not complacent, however, and recognise that we need to continually evolve in response to increasing customer and societal expectations, new technologies and a rapidly changing competitive environment. Most importantly, we also recognise that we have a critical role to play in Helping Britain Recover from the COVID pandemic.",

As the UK's largest financial services provider, we have a unique opportunity to meet  more of our customers' broader financial needs and improve their overall resilience throughout their  lifetime, with personalised and valueadding products and services that are relevant to them.\n\n## Long-term vision\n\nLeveraging our unique capabilities to meet more of our customers' needs\n\n## 2021 investment focus\n\nTo achieve our vision and become the preferred financial partner for personal customers, we are focusing on three key areas of investment in 2021:\n\n- Enable financial resilience and wellbeing through dedicated customer assessment and  support\n- Significantly deepen relationships with priority segments through enhanced journeys and new capabilities\n- Digitise to reduce cost to serve\n\n## Measures of success:\n\n- Net open book mortgage growth in 2021\n- Maintain record all channel net promoter score in 2021\n- Increase priority segment customers with needs met by both Retail and Insurance and Wealth\n- Positive annual net new money in Insurance and Wealth open book assets; to deliver a \u00a325/uni00A0billion increase by 2023\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Enable financial resilience and wellbeing through dedicated customer assessment and support\n\nConsistent with our broader societal and strategic focus on Helping Britain Recover, we will use our unique position as the UK's only integrated financial services provider to address both the short-term financial challenges facing our customers and build longer-term resilience, with products and services relevant to their changing needs.\n\nOver the course of 2021, we will support our customers, with a dual focus on building short-term resilience through savings and borrowings, and on strengthening long-term resilience by broadening access to protection and other insurance coverage against unforeseen life events. As part of our overall approach, in 2021 we will launch a range of tools that enable a better assessment of financial wellbeing, while also building on our strong track record in supporting our most vulnerable customers by simplifying our customer treatment approaches and deploying specialist vulnerable customer support where needed.\n\n## Significantly deepen relationships with priority segments through enhanced journeys and new capabilities\n\nWe have the largest personal customer franchise for financial needs in the UK, with approximately 50 per cent of UK adults having a relationship with the Group and 17.4/uni00A0million digitally-active customers. We have a considerable opportunity to build on these strong foundations and significantly deepen our customer relationships, especially within our priority segments.\n\nWe will meet more of our customers' broader banking, insurance and wealth needs throughout their lifetime, making better use of our unique scale and data insights to develop a more personalised approach and offering products and services that meet their specific needs at a time and via channels that are relevant to them. Consistent with this focus, we will make a number of further enhancements to our customer journeys, building on the significant improvements already delivered during our most recent strategic plan.\n\nWe will also broaden customer access to long-term financial planning and long-term saving with priorities including the better integration of our Schroders Personal Wealth offering across our Retail branch network. Through these and other initiatives, we expect to achieve net growth in open book mortgage balances in 2021. Looking beyond this, we are aiming to increase priority segment customers with needs met by both Retail and Insurance and Wealth propositions and expect to generate positive annual net new money into our open book Insurance and Wealth propositions, delivering a \u00a325 billion increase by 2023.\n\n## Digitise to reduce cost to serve\n\nWe have a strong track record in simplifying customer processes to improve their overall experience and satisfaction, while also capturing operational efficiencies and cost savings. Looking ahead, we remain focused on improving the experience of all our customers, with increasing levels of datadriven personalisation being accompanied by other improvements that provide them with richer insights and put them more in control of their finances.\n\nTo achieve this and drive further improvements in operational efficiency, in 2021 we will continue to utilise the latest technologies to digitise key customer journeys and support greater levels of self-service, while also migrating high volume telephony users to digital services to reduce failure demand and improve the customer experience. In doing this, we recognise that our multichannel approach remains important for a large number of our customers.\n\nWe will therefore continue to offer our customers a seamless experience across channels, with our branch network increasingly optimised to meet more complex needs. Taking all these elements together, in 2021 we are aiming to maintain our record all channel net promoter scores, following the all-time highs that were achieved in 2020.",

As we emerge from the COVID pandemic, we will need to continue supporting our clients, not only with their immediate financial needs, but with a focus on helping them adapt, grow and thrive as we transition to a low carbon economy.\n\n## Long-term vision\n\nLeading digital SME bank; disciplined and strengthened large client proposition\n\n## 2021 investment focus\n\nTo achieve our vision and become the best bank for all UK businesses, while also supporting a more sustainable UK economic recovery, we have identified three key areas of strategic focus and investment for 2021:\n\n- Enhance SME channel and service with increased digitisation\n- Automate recovery support and finance the green transition\n- Strengthen Corporate and Institutional product capabilities\n\n## Measures of success:\n\n- More than 50 per cent growth in SME products originated via a digital source in 2021\n- 5 point increase in SME and Retail Business Banking digital net promoter score by 2023\n- Profitably improve share in markets products for core clients in 2021\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Enhance SME channel and service with increased digitisation\n\nSMEs play a vital role in the UK economy and we have remained steadfast in our support to them, having achieved significant market share growth in recent years. We will build on this track record by ensuring that our products and services continue to respond effectively to their evolving needs.\n\nAs SMEs increasingly turn to digital channels for speed, convenience and control, we will expand our end-to-end digital origination for simple products, while also enhancing self-service capabilities for day-to-day banking, with priorities in 2021 including the delivery of a self-serve platform with automated decisioning for Asset Finance products. Looking beyond banking, we will extend the capabilities of our accountancy solution for SMEs, while also making this available to more clients. Through these initiatives, in 2021 we expect to achieve at least 50 per cent growth in SME products originated via a digital source and to increase our SME and Retail Business Banking digital net promoter score by 5 points by 2023.\n\nSMEs continue to value human interaction for their more complex needs. Through our strong network of relationship managers and leading branch network for smaller business clients we have a significant competitive advantage in responding to these needs, and will continue to upskill our colleagues to provide an enhanced service, while also delivering a more seamless experience across channels.\n\n## Automate recovery support and finance the green transition\n\nIn 2020, we stood firmly by the side of UK business, providing support to clients impacted by the pandemic. We will continue to work closely with these clients and the Government to ensure that businesses approaching the end of COVID capital support have the best chance to build resilience, adapt and return to growth. As part of this, we will roll out a digital-led BBLs engagement model enabling clients to access support and self-serve, while also working individually with clients requiring specialist help.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe strongly believe that there is a unique opportunity to rebuild the UK economy on a more sustainable and low-carbon basis and that, through our focus on Helping Britain Recover, we can be at the forefront of this. We have already started working with our clients, the Government and the market to help reduce the carbon emissions we finance by more than 50 per cent by 2030 on the path to net zero and, as part of this, in 2021 will expand our funding for green finance initiatives from \u00a33/uni00A0billion to \u00a35 billion.\n\nWe will also continue to help fund sustainable housing development, with other priorities including supporting the creation of national sustainability standards for new-build housing and working with housing associations to improve the energy efficiency of social housing accommodation.\n\n## Strengthen Corporate and Institutional product capabilities\n\nWe also have a significant presence at the larger end of the market, with over 60 per cent of FTSE 100 companies having an active relationship with the Group. We will build on the progress made in our previous strategic plan by continuing to deepen our relationships with these larger clients and strengthening our simple and low risk commercial banking offering. At the same time we will enhance our fee based client propositions, with the aim of diversifying our revenue generation.\n\nWe already provide our Corporate and Institutional clients with a personalised service proposition and tailored support: an approach which was incredibly effective as the impacts of the pandemic were felt very differently across the portfolio. We will build on these foundations by improving the alignment of our coverage model and creating an ecosystem for Corporate and Institutional clients. In addition we will modernise our markets capabilities, with areas of focus including the upgrading of our FX platform and digitisation of our rates capability. Through these initiatives, we are looking to profitably improve our share in markets products for core clients in 2021.\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

Through this, we aim to deliver a further step change in agility and responsiveness to customer trends, while also supporting our broader strategic priorities around enhanced data insights, improved customer experience and operational resilience and efficiency.\n\n## Long-term vision\n\nEfficient, scalable and resilient cloudbased architecture, supporting business transformation\n\n## 2021 investment focus\n\nWe have identified three key areas for strategic investment in 2021 to support our vision of delivering a modernised technology architecture:\n\n- Further broaden self-service capabilities through digitisation\n- Prove and leverage public cloud to create foundations for future technology architecture\n- Simplify legacy estate through technology optimisation\n\n## Measures of success\n\n- Mobile app releases to double year-onyear in 2021\n- Further mobile app enhancement to maintain record mobile-app net promoter score\n- c.30 per cent of technology applications and services migrated and c.20 per cent decommissioned by 2023\n- Deliver new technology architecture pilot\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Further broaden self-service capabilities through digitisation\n\nIn recent years we have made significant progress in the development of our technology platform and capabilities, having invested over \u00a34 billion cumulatively in these strategic priorities by the end of 2020.  This investment has, in turn, played a fundamental role in helping us to deliver a leading customer experience and in improving our operational agility, resilience and efficiency.\n\nOur successes in these areas are reflected, amongst other things, in our digital net promoter scores, which reached a record high in 2020, our year-on-year reductions in net costs, and our ability to now make simple changes to our digital propositions intraday, as opposed to our previous 30 day release cycles.\n\nLooking ahead, we will build on this strong track record and respond to the growing customer demand for convenience and control by broadening the self-service capabilities available to our digital customers. Consistent with this focus and our objective of maintaining our record mobile app net promoter score, we will double the number of enhancements we make to our mobile app i n 2021.\n\n## Prove and leverage public cloud to create foundations for future technology architecture\n\nTo support our long-term strategic vision of building and operating an efficient, scalable and resilient cloud-based architecture, we will increase our investment in R&D to assess the customer and business benefits that nextgeneration technologies could have on the organisation. In 2021 we will initially focus on proving the appropriateness of public cloud for our specific customer and operational needs, with a view to assessing how this can be leveraged to create the foundations for our future technology architecture and drive the next phase of our operational transformation.\n\nIn doing this, we will build on the next generation capabilities and insights that we are already developing through strategic partnerships with specialist partners such as Google Cloud, Thought Machine, Microsoft Azure and Form3, as well as the new insights and capabilities that we are developing ourselves.\n\nWhile our adoption of a cloud-based technology architecture is likely to be an ongoing area of focus into the long-term, we are confident that this will drive a step change in our customer propositions and efficiency.\n\n## Simplify legacy estate through technology optimisation\n\nThrough our investment in technology, we have a significant opportunity to simplify our estate, and by the end of 2023 expect to have migrated around 30 per cent and decommissioned about 20 per cent of our technology applications and services.\n\nTo achieve our longer-term ambitions, we will ultimately need to migrate our customers and relevant applications to this new environment.\n\nIn doing this, it is vitally important that our core systems and customer data remain protected and that operational continuity is maintained. To gain comfort in this regard, we will initially conduct a focused, pilot migration of our own back-book customers to the new cloud-based architecture in 2021. This will help us identify potential issues that can be effectively addressed before we replicate this migration on a much larger scale.\n\nBy the end of the year, we are aiming to have achieved a c.40/uni00A0per/uni00A0cent reduction in applications from our legacy architecture through this pilot exercise and to have safely migrated approximately 400,000 customer accounts to the new bank architecture.\n\nOur success in delivering these targeted milestones in 2021 will, in turn, help determine the pace and scale of our approach as we simplify our legacy estate, with a view to capturing the significant medium-term opportunities available to us, including transformed customer experiences and improved operational agility.",

Looking ahead, these trends are expected to continue, with the ability to offer a leading payments proposition vital in capturing this significant growth opportunity in the face of increased competitive disruption.\n\n## Long-term vision\n\nSeizing the payments growth opportunity in our customers' channel of choice\n\n## 2021 investment focus\n\nFor 2021 we have identified three key areas of focus:\n\n- Enhance card e-commerce and international payments experience to drive increased customer usage\n- Build capability and integration of new cash management and payments platform\n- Enhance merchant services proposition with improved distribution capabilities\n\n## Measures of success\n\n- Maintain leading card spend market share in 2021, with growth in credit card spend market share from 2022\n- 3x increase in corporate clients on new cash management and payments platform in 2021\n- 15 per cent to 20 per cent new client growth per annum in merchant services\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Enhance card e-commerce and international payments experience to drive increased customer usage\n\nAs a Group, we are well-positioned to capture the significant growth opportunity associated with the accelerated shift to digital payments. We are the largest card issuer in the UK and have over a 20 per cent share in card-based payments.\n\nIn addition, we have strong participation across the payments ecosystem, ranging from more traditional debit and credit card methods across our High Street banking brands to more emerging and innovative methods across APIs and Open Banking. To capture this opportunity, we will enhance the consumer payments experience, with a focus on speed, convenience, choice and security.\n\nAmongst other developments, in 2021 we will continue to expand real-time push notifications and will look to translate improvements in customer experience into improved loyalty, with a range of customer rewards and offers that are targeted, based on our rich data insights. Through these initiatives, our objective for 2021 is to maintain our leading share of card spend, with a longerterm objective of achieving market share growth in credit card spend from 2022.\n\n## Build capability and integration of new cash management and payments platform\n\nDuring the course of our most recent strategic plan, we significantly invested in the development of a new cash management and payments platform with leading API functionality for our corporate clients. To capitalise on this past investment, meet additional client needs across cash management and payments, and address the growing demand for payment solutions that are increasingly integrated into our clients' clients' business flows, we will continue to enhance our platform capabilities.\n\nAs part of this overall approach, we will continue to build out our international and complex liquidity capabilities, while also improving the integration between our payments platform and other digital channels used by our corporate clients. Through these initiatives, we have set an objective of achieving a threefold increase in the number of corporate clients using our new cash management and payments platform in/uni00A02021.\n\n## Enhance merchant services proposition with improved distribution capabilities\n\nAgainst a backdrop of ongoing and significant growth in e-commerce and digital payment volumes, our merchant customers are increasingly demanding the ability to accept multiple payment methods, with a view to improving checkout conversion rates and lower payment costs.\n\nTo address these needs, in 2021 we will modernise our payments gateway to offer integrated journeys across different payment types as well as a range of value-added services. In addition, this will form part of a strong merchant services proposition with key features including realtime data insights and customer analytics.\n\nTo ensure that we are able to meet more of our merchant customers' needs through these proposition enhancements, we are also focused on improving our distribution capabilities. In light of these developments, we are targeting new client growth of between 15/uni00A0and 20 per cent per year in this fast-growing and evolving market.\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

In an increasingly competitive market, it is vital that we are able to appropriately use this data to create insights that deliver better customer outcomes and strengthen our own risk management processes.\n\n## Long-term vision\n\nLeveraging our data proposition to create value for all stakeholders\n\n## 2021 investment focus\n\nWe have identified three key areas of strategic investment focus in 2021 to support our medium-term vision and become a data-driven organisation\n\n- Expand use of data to enable better customer and business propositions\n- Extend machine learning capabilities to drive faster and more accurate pricing and risk decisions\n- Deliver organisational reform of data strategy and management, supporting collaboration\n\n## Measures of success:\n\n- Increase in meeting personal customer needs using advanced analytics (e.g. 20 per cent increase in home insurance needs met)\n- >10 per cent increase in fraud detection rates from expansion of machine learning\n- 50 per cent return on investment from year 1 investment in advanced analytics\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Expand use of data to enable better customer and business propositions\n\nAs customers' expectations of financial services are increasingly being shaped by their experiences outside of the sector, personalisation has become an increasingly important differentiator. In our most recent strategic plan, we were able to successfully develop our data and advanced analytics capabilities to deliver more personalised propositions and improve the customer experience.\n\nWe will continue to enhance our data and advanced analytics capabilities to deliver better customer and business propositions. Through data-driven marketing we are already able to meet 20 per cent of customer needs, with the use of appropriate data insights helping to ensure that our propositions are more targeted to genuine needs and, through this, lead to better customer outcomes and response rates.\n\nThrough the further development of our capabilities in this area we are targeting a significant increase in personal customers' needs we can meet using advanced analytics, including for example, a 20 per cent increase in Home Insurance needs met.\n\n## Extend machine learning capabilities to drive faster and more accurate pricing and risk decisions\n\nThe potential benefits from improved data and analytics capabilities extend beyond customer outcomes and an improvement in the overall customer experience, with significant efficiency and risk opportunities also available through the further development and deployment of our machine learning across key business processes.\n\nIn 2021, we will increase the use of machine learning to drive faster and more accurate pricing and risk decisions, while also expanding its usage to cover at least 50 per cent of customer transactions. We expect this approach to achieve at least a 10 per cent increase in fraud detection rates and therefore play an important role in our ongoing efforts to protect our customers and the Group from this growing threat.\n\nIn addition, advanced analytics will be used to deliver early insights into financial vulnerabilities, which is particularly important as our personal customers and business clients recover from the effects of pandemic.\n\n## Deliver organisational reform of data strategy and management, supporting collaboration\n\nIn order to realise these significant customer and organisational benefits, we will need to access our data more efficiently and flexibly, while also ensuring that we adhere to the highest standards of data management and protection. To achieve this, we will implement organisational changes in respect of our data strategy and management and will establish centralised centres of excellence to help drive innovation and develop best data practice that can be consistently deployed across the Group.\n\nIn addition, we will further embed data and analytics capabilities within our business functions, with the aim of achieving a more effective alignment between our technical and business expertise. Through this approach, we also expect to be able to direct our strategic investment in a more effective and immediate way, in turn helping us to deliver greater financial and operational benefits. Through this and our broader approach to data, we expect to be able to deliver a 50 per cent return on our investment in advanced analytics in the first year.",

To retain this source of competitive advantage, we must evolve our colleague proposition to reflect new working patterns  and colleague expectations post COVID, while also delivering a sustainable workspace that supports  increased collaboration and innovation. We must also invest in developing future skills, ensuring that  everything we do is underpinned by a purpose-driven and inclusive culture.\n\n## Long-term vision\n\nPurpose-led future ready and inclusive workforce in a transformed workspace\n\n## 2021 investment focus\n\nIn order to evolve to a future-ready workplace, ways of working and workforce, our activity and investment will centre around three areas i n 2021:\n\n- Further build our purpose-led culture through refreshed values and behaviours\n- Build career pathways to attract and retain a more diverse, skilled and future ready workforce\n- Deliver sustainable workplace solutions, including reduced office footprint\n\n## Measures of success:\n\n- Maintain leading Employee Engagement Index\n- Aspiration of 50 per cent of senior roles held by women and 13 per cent senior roles held by Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic colleagues by 2025\n- 8 per cent reduction in office space in 2021, with c.20 per cent cumulative reductions by 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Further build our purpose-led culture through refreshed values and behaviours\n\nHelping Britain Prosper is at the heart of everything we do. We want all of our colleagues to be able to identify with this purpose, while also recognising how they are contributing to Britain's recovery.\n\nTo achieve this and ensure that our culture continues to accurately reflect our purpose, we will rollout a new behaviours framework and aligned purpose driven values. Our colleagues continue to demonstrate great determination, flexibility and mutual support during the pandemic as they adapt to new circumstances and new ways of working. We recognise the importance of retaining the positive learnings and behaviours from this challenging period as we continue to explore new ways of working.\n\nDuring the pandemic, we increased the support available to our colleagues for their physical and mental health, with the wellbeing of our people remaining a key priority going forward. Through all of these initiatives, we are aiming to maintain our leading employee engagement scores in 2021 and beyond.\n\n## Build career pathways to attract and retain a more diverse, skilled and future ready workforce\n\nWe were the first FTSE100 company to introduce targets for senior roles held by female and Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic colleagues and have made significant progress towards these ambitious goals. We will build on this, with the goal of ensuring our workforce is more diverse and mirrors the society we serve. Consistent with this, we will increase female and Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic representation at the most senior levels, with the aspiration of increasing this to 50 per cent and 13 per cent respectively by 2025.\n\nAs our business becomes increasingly technology-driven, we will need to continue attracting and developing future skills. We have already exceeded our recent colleague training targets and reduced our dependency on external contractors.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe will build on this, with a range of initiatives designed to help us attract targeted skills. We will also continue to encourage our colleagues to develop future-ready skills, while providing them with tailored and easily-accessible content to achieve this. In addition, we recognise that new ways of working, hybrid workplaces and more agile working patterns will also require softer skills and leadership capabilities, and we will work with all our colleagues to ensure they have the right foundations to succeed in this new normal.\n\n## Deliver sustainable workplace solutions, including reduced office footprint\n\nThe pandemic has led to unprecedented change in the way companies operate, while also accelerating the shift to more agile working patterns. While recent internal surveys show that the vast majority of our colleagues would like to retain some form of home working, offices will undoubtedly remain important for colleague interaction, collaboration and innovation.\n\nIn response, we will deliver a reduced, sustainable and future ready office footprint, with activity expected to commence in several of our collaboration hubs as we emerge from the COVID crisis. These programmes, which are expected to deliver an 8 per cent reduction in our office space in 2021 as well as cumulative reductions of c.20 per cent by 2023, will be informed by behavioural experiments and pilots that will help us determine the future look of our offices and ways of working.\n\nWe will also reduce our own carbon footprint, with key initiatives including improved energy efficiency across our office and branch real estate, new ways of working and reduced travel requirements. Consistent with this focus, we have set a target of achieving net zero carbon operations by 2030.\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

The Board's understanding of stakeholders' interests is central to these responsibilities, crucial to the Company's success, and informs key aspects of Board decision-making as set out in this statement.\n\nStakeholder engagement is embedded in all aspects of the Board's decision-making and can be seen in the range of tailored activities across the stakeholder groups. It is also embedded in the Board's delegation of the management of the business to the Executive, with examples of related action taken included across the report, in particular the sections referenced under 'More Detail'.\n\nThe Executive, including the Group Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer, provide the Board with details of material stakeholder interaction and feedback, through regular business updates. Stakeholder interests are also identified by the Executive in the wider proposals put to the Board.\n\nThis year interaction with stakeholders was adapted to comply with the Government's measures in relation to COVID-19, and has been undertaken virtually as necessary.\n\nThis section (pages 46 to 51) acts as our Section 172(1) statement; but, given the importance of stakeholder interests, our reputation for high standards of business conduct and a long-term perspective, these matters are discussed where relevant throughout the report.\n\n## Section 172(1) Statement\n\nIn accordance with the Companies Act 2006 (the 'Act'), the Directors provide this statement describing how they have had regard to the matters set out in section 172(1) of the Act, when performing their duty to promote the success of the Company, under section 172. Further details on key actions in this regard are also contained within the Corporate Governance Report on pages 81 to 110 and the Directors' Report on pages 111 t o 114.\n\nThis statement also provides details of how the Directors have engaged with and had regard to the interests of our key stakeholders.\n\n## CUSTOMERS\n\nThe Board's deep understanding of customers' needs is vital in setting and achieving the Company's goals. Customer needs and a customer-centric approach remain therefore a key consideration in Board decisions.\n\n## COVID-19 response\n\nThe Group's response to the COVID pandemic has been a central focus for the Board since the start of the outbreak. The Board has sought to take all possible steps to support customers through these challenging times.\n\nRegular Board updates from across the Group identified key areas of customer concern. In addition, the Group Chief Executive attended virtual customer engagement events, which provided an important opportunity for customers to raise directly any concerns on the matters of most significance to them. Areas of worry included customers' ability to meet their ongoing financial commitments, and to continue to operate their businesses as the extent of the economic impacts emerged.\n\nThe Board considered and approved the Group's vital role in the Government's COVID related business loan schemes, which provided funding to a range of client businesses across a number of economic sectors. Customer payment holidays were also introduced, complementing other means of Group support, including removing fees for missed payments and access to fixed term accounts without charge.\n\nThe Board supported further key actions, including the launch of two initiatives with digital inclusion training provider, We Are Digital. These included providing tablet devices free of charge to over-70s isolated by COVID, and a dedicated phone line giving vulnerable customers support in staying connected with digital activities, including managing online banking. The Board was also keen that the Group play a part in tackling the isolation many feel as a result of the crisis. The Group was therefore pleased to partner with Age UK in providing The Silver Line, a 24/7 helpline for those aged 55 and over who may be feeling lonely or isolated.\n\nThe essential nature of a deep understanding of challenges faced by customers in financial difficulty was also highlighted by the pandemic. The Board was updated regularly on the needs of these customers, which resulted in the provision of additional support. This included increasing our capacity to serve customers who needed the help of a colleague, and delivering related self-serve  functionality where preferred by customers.\n\n## Customer feedback\n\nCustomer feedback is always a priority for the Board. Regular updates are provided which give valuable insight into the Group's performance in delivering on our customer-related objectives, and on improving customer outcomes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWith Board oversight, new means of sharing customer views were developed for use over the coming year. These will provide greater insight not only on customer experience, but also on the progress being made to improve customer satisfaction in the areas of most importance. This will in turn help in ensuring the Board can continue to focus on the things that matter most to our customers and our clients.\n\nThe Board recognises the importance of understanding our performance in supporting customers, including how the Group performs relative to our peers. Related updates covered a range of internal and external measures, including customer indices and market share updates. Such updates provided important insight, and enabled the Board to recommend suitable customer related actions.\n\n## Helping Britain Recover\n\nThe needs of customers once the pandemic abates has also been a focus for the Board. This has included providing direction for the development of our Helping Britain Recover ambitions, building on the Group's purpose of Helping Britain Prosper.\n\nThese ambitions seek to address the changes in priorities for our stakeholders, including our customers, as the country emerges from the pandemic.\n\nThe Board oversaw the development of these ambitions, which aim to make sure the Group's purpose remains aligned to a changing society, fully integrating our societal objectives with our business objectives. Read more on the Board's role in this process on page 49.\n\n## Technology transformation\n\nThe Board has taken steps to make sure the Group continues to build on its response to customer demand for technology.  Digital transformation has therefore remained a key focus, including supporting the development of the Group's Cloud strategy, and the ongoing roll-out of technological developments for customers, discussed further on page 51.\n\n## More detail\n\nCOVID-19 response Read more on pages 1 to 3 Helping Britain Recover Read more on pages 38 to 39 Technology transformation Read more on page 18",

        "page_content": "## KEY BOARD DECISION DIVIDENDS\n\nDespite the challenging economic environment, the Group has delivered a robust financial performance, and demonstrated resilience and ability to continue to generate capital. This has been supported by our customercentric strategy and the strength of our balance/uni00A0sheet.\n\nAt the end of March, in response to a request from the PRA the Board took the decision not to make quarterly or interim dividend payments, accrual of dividends, or share buybacks on ordinary shares. While the Board understood this was a difficult decision from the perspective of the Group's stakeholders, it was nonetheless important in helping the Group serve the needs of businesses and households through the extraordinary challenges of COVID-19.\n\nIn addition, to preserve additional capital for use in serving our customers, the Board agreed to cancel the final 2019 dividend on ordinary shares.\n\nThese were hard decisions for the Board. They involved balancing the interests of our shareholders, for whom regular distributions are important, and those of our customers, many of whom needed additional support during the pandemic.\n\nThe Board has recommended a final ordinary dividend of 0.57 pence per share, the maximum allowed under the Prudential Regulation Authority's temporary framework on 2020 distributions.\n\nThe decision is supported by the regulator, and follows extensive shareholder feedback and discussion with other stakeholders. Read more about our approach to dividends on page 68.\n\nLink to strategic priorities\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLeading customer experience\n\nThe Board is pleased that despite the challenges which the year has presented, the Group's strong performance has enabled us to recommence dividend payments, and recommend to shareholders a final ordinary dividend of 0.57 pence per share. Robin Budenberg\n\nChair\n\n## ECONOMY SHAREHOLDERS\n\nThe Group has the largest shareholder base in the UK, with around 2.3 million shareholders including most employees.\n\nThe Board recognises the importance of understanding the priorities of different shareholder groups when developing and implementing strategy, with ongoing engagement  with both institutional and retail shareholders.\n\nThe Group places great importance on making sure shareholders are effectively briefed on strategic and financial progress, in addition to considering their valued feedback. Comprehensive disclosure is provided with results and, given the increasing focus of investors on ESG matters, we now issue a specific ESG-focused presentation for investors 'Our approach to ESG'.\n\nThe Group undertook more than 340/uni00A0institutional investor meetings in 2020, many of which were with management, and also hosted a retail investor event. In addition, various Non-Executive Directors engaged directly with shareholders through the year, including the Chair and the Remuneration Committee Chair. Meetings held by the Chair largely focused on corporate strategy, governance and sustainability, while the Remuneration Committee Chair consulted extensively on the new remuneration policy, both pre and post the 2020 AGM.\n\nTo ensure investors were fully briefed on Group governance initiatives a Governance event was also held in November, hosted by the Chair and the Chairs of all the Board Committees. Key topics discussed included governance, sustainability and remuneration, and it provided an excellent forum for Board members to hear directly investor views on key topics.\n\nBoard members are also kept up to date on market views and shareholder sentiment by Investor Relations, including an annual presentation with the Group's corporate brokers on market dynamics and corporate perception. The Board's Nomination and Governance Committee considers correspondence received from institutional shareholders, with feedback provided to the Board on material retail shareholder correspondence.\n\n## The Annual General Meeting\n\nThe Board recognises that the Annual General Meeting ('AGM') is an important opportunity for shareholders, institutional and retail alike, to hear from and engage with the Board.\n\nThe Board was keen that 2020's AGM adapt to the challenges of the pandemic, and provision was made so shareholders could access as many of the benefits of an AGM as possible.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe opportunity was provided for shareholders to hear from and put questions to the Board, on a virtual basis in line with safety guidance. Answers to questions, and remarks from the Chair and Group Chief Executive were also made available online.\n\nGiven the importance of the AGM in shareholder engagement, the Board continues to consider what will be possible for the 2021 meeting. The Board is especially keen to make sure the best possible engagement is safely available for shareholders.\n\n## Succession planning\n\nThe Board recognises the key role played by the Chair and the Group Chief Executive in the Group's future success, and the relevance of these important appointments to all of the Group's stakeholders, including to our many shareholders.\n\nConsiderable time was therefore given to the processes relating to succession and recruitment to these positions, which concluded in the appointment of Robin/uni00A0Budenberg as Chair, and confirmation that Charlie Nunn would be appointed as Group Chief Executive. These processes are discussed in greater detail in the report of the Board's Nomination and Governance Committee on page 98.\n\n## Future strategy\n\nThe Board considered the development of the next phase of the Group's strategy, to be implemented during 2021. To help in this, dedicated sessions were held with the Executive in both June and November, to shape strategic priorities and agree how these would be implemented.\n\nConsideration was given to feedback from key stakeholders, including understanding the priorities of the Group's shareholders in respect of our strategic direction. The Group's approach to the environment and climate change was of particular importance in shaping strategy, and is discussed further on page 50.\n\n## More detail\n\nAnnual General Meeting\n\nRead more on page 344\n\nAppointment of new Chair\n\nRead more on page 99\n\nAppointment of new Chief Executive\n\nRead more on page 99\n\nFuture strategy\n\nRead more on pages 36 to 45\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

        "page_content": "## Our key stakeholders and Board engagement continued\n\n## COLLEAGUES\n\nColleagues are vital to the delivery of the Group's strategy and ambitions. This is recognised by the Board in its engagement with colleagues throughout the year.\n\nThe Board considers that maintaining open dialogue is crucial in informing its thinking, allowing Directors to hear first-hand the varied colleague views on the matters most important to them, and to the Group.\n\nThe Board agreed in 2019 its approach to workforce engagement, which has remained unchanged during the year. The definition of workforce agreed by the Board is our permanent colleagues, contingent workers and third-party suppliers that work on the Group's premises delivering services to our customers and supporting key business operations.\n\nThe Board continues to receive Workforce Engagement reports which comprises two component parts, a summary of the Board's engagement activity with colleagues, and key themes raised by colleagues and trends on people matters. These covered all matters of colleague engagement, in particular key and emerging issues for colleagues, including Group culture and our response to the COVID pandemic.\n\nDuring the year the Board communicated with colleagues through a number of means. These included informal colleague lunch and breakfast meetings, held by the Group Chief Executive and the Chair, and attended by Non-Executive Directors.\n\nVirtual Town Hall sessions were hosted by both the Chair and the Group Chief Executive. These were complemented by engagement sessions led by other senior leaders, with feedback from all sessions shared with the Board. Town Hall sessions were particularly helpful in allowing colleagues the opportunity to ask questions, share their views, and receive a direct answer in real time.\n\nDuring the year the Board gained further understanding of colleague views through a number of surveys completed by colleagues across the Group. These included the annual colleague survey, ad hoc 'Pulse' surveys, and participation by colleagues in the survey of the Banking Standards Board.\n\nThe Board considers these arrangements invaluable in giving them an understanding of the views of the workforce and encouraging meaningful dialogue between the Board and the workforce.\n\nDuring the year the Group also communicated directly with colleagues detailing Group performance, changes in the economic and regulatory environment and updates on key strategic initiatives.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMeetings were also held throughout the year between Group representatives and our recognised unions.\n\nThe Group offers a competitive and fair reward package. Colleagues are eligible to participate in HMRC-approved share plans which promote share ownership by giving employees an opportunity to invest in Group shares. Further information can be found on page 136 in the Directors' Remuneration Report.\n\n## Culture acceleration\n\nFollowing engagement, cultural acceleration initiatives have been a focus for the Board as the Group looks to accelerate the cultural change started in 2019.\n\nThe Board reviewed plans to further improve ways of working, encourage greater collaboration, and continue the reduction in bureaucracy. Opportunities were encouraged to promote simplicity in process and practice wherever possible.\n\nA number of related initiatives were successfully completed during the year. These included a project to simplify the Group's Committee structure, and retain a more agile approach to decision-making which had been necessary during the pandemic.\n\n## Diversity\n\nThe Board believes a diverse workforce is vital to the Group's success, and values the differences each colleague brings to their role, making the Group stronger and better able to meet the needs of our customers.\n\nIn support of this the Board approved in July 2020 the introduction of our Race Action plan, designed to drive race related cultural change, recruitment and progression across the Group. The plan will be taken forward by a dedicated team, who will work with a newly formed Race Advisory Panel to further develop and implement the plan over the coming year.\n\nThe Board also approved a target to increase Black representation in senior roles to at least 3 per cent by 2025. This complemented the Group's broader 2018 Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic representation targets of 10 per cent overall, and 8 per cent at senior management/uni00A0levels.\n\n## More detail\n\nColleague engagement Read more on page 29\n\n## Diversity\n\nRead more on page 25\n\n## Speak Up\n\nRead more on page 30\n\n## KEY BOARD DECISION COVID RESPONSE\n\nWhile the COVID pandemic has been challenging for our customers, it has also posed challenges for our colleagues. The Board was therefore keen to ensure colleagues received all the support the Group could give.\n\nRegular and open engagement with colleagues was crucial, with the Group Chief Executive undertaking a series of related video broadcasts, keeping colleagues informed of developments.\n\nThis was supported by other members of the Executive, including colleague Q&A sessions held by the Group's People Director, where colleagues posed the questions which mattered to them most.\n\nThe Board agreed various measures of support for colleagues in response to the crisis. These included the temporary suspension of staff reductions, enhancements to working environment safety, flexible holiday entitlement and a commitment to pay colleagues in full, regardless of how their work had been impacted.\n\nThe Board took steps to ensure along with the Executive that colleague wellbeing was prioritised. Resources were made available to help colleagues in adjusting to the changing circumstances, including support in areas such as work life balance, health and financial management.\n\nThe Board considered it important that priority continue to be given to supporting colleague mental health. A number of related steps were taken, including support via the Group's 'Your Resilience' portal, with new content to address the challenges colleagues faced as a result of the pandemic. The Group's partnership with Headspace was also extended, offering all colleagues a free subscription to an app providing access to modules covering a range of mental health related topics.\n\nThe Board was also keen the Group's response should include faster roll-out of our Digital Workplace programme, which on completion allowed the majority of colleagues to work from home. The Board in addition approved a recognition payment to frontline colleagues, in thanks for their efforts in supporting our customers during the pandemic.\n\nThe Board has considered how colleague working practices will develop beyond the COVID crisis, in particular how more flexible and efficient ways of working seen during 2020 could be retained.\n\nThis included the agreement of steps to be taken by the Executive to ensure the Group's workplace continues to evolve with both the needs of the business, and the changing ways in which colleagues wish to work.",

As such, the Group places great importance on engagement and action to help these communities prosper, and build a more sustainable future. This has been a core consideration for the Board in the development of the Group's next strategic phase.\n\nThe Board is supported in environmental and community matters by its Responsible Business Committee. This Committee supports the Board with consideration of stakeholder views on all matters relating to the Group's goals to be a trusted, sustainable and responsible business.\n\n## Helping Britain Recover\n\nThe Board has given much focus to overseeing the development of the Group's Helping Britain Recover ambitions. This continues our strategy of Helping Britain Prosper, designed to play a part in the UK's recovery from the COVID pandemic, and is discussed in more detail below.\n\nThe views of stakeholders have informed the development of these ambitions, which aim to integrate fully the Group's societal objectives with its business objectives, and will be key in the next phase of our strategy.\n\n## Environmental ambitions\n\nDuring the year the Board approved an ambitious goal, working with customers, Government and the market to help reduce the carbon emissions the Group finances by at least 50 per cent by 2030. With the Group's 2030 carbon emission reduction goal for our own operations met, the Board also considered the development of new internal carbon, energy and travel targets. Consideration was also given to the development of several new green finance products, tools and services.\n\nA commitment was approved to invest \u00a32/uni00A0billion in BlackRock's ACS Climate Transition World Equity Fund, via Scottish Widows' default fund offering. The Group's investment will make up 10 per cent of the equities portion of our default pension investment approach within Scottish Widows, focused on investing in the companies already at the forefront of decarbonisation and responsible use of natural resources. The Board's consideration of environmental ambitions is discussed further on page 50.\n\n## Regional Ambassadors\n\nThe Board continues to value the support provided by the Group's ten regional ambassadors, who between them help in establishing strong relationships with local politicians, councils and other community institutions across the UK.\n\n## KEY BOARD DECISION HELPING BRITAIN RECOVER\n\nThe Board considered it vital that the Group as one of the UK's main financial services providers plays a key role in the country's plan to rebuild the economy.\n\nIn September 2020 the Group launched The Big Conversation: Helping Britain Recover. A three-month series of roundtable discussions were held across all nations and regions of the UK, which encouraged open debate of the challenges facing the country during the pandemic, and how the UK could emerge with an economy that is more resilient and more sustainable.\n\nThe Big Conversation brought together many of the Board's key stakeholders, including businesses, community members, policy makers and subjectmatter experts across the UK's nations and regions. Focus was given to discussing the support and policy interventions that these stakeholders considered necessary for a strong recovery from the pandemic.\n\nA final report, published in December 2020, was shared with all participants as well as with key politicians and policy makers, and is available on the Group's website. The Board was pleased the Group was in this way able to amplify its stakeholders' voices to those who can make a difference. We anticipate extending this initiative in 2021 to encompass more topics of importance to our stakeholders.\n\nIn addition, the Board agreed in June that it was important to build a longterm framework which would help the Group more fully integrate its business ambitions with its societal objectives, acting wherever possible as a positive driver for change.\n\nAfter considering recommendations from the Executive, built around feedback from stakeholders, the Board concluded the plan would focus on five key areas of stakeholder priority. These included Help rebuild households' financial health and wellbeing, Support businesses to recover, adapt and grow, Expand availability of affordable and quality homes, Accelerate the transition to a low carbon economy and Build an inclusive society and organisation.\n\nIn 2021, we'll continue to listen to our key stakeholders from across the UK to understand what local communities and economies need to emerge from the pandemic stronger and more resilient.\n\nLink to strategic priorities\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe feedback of these ambassadors informs not only the Board's view of stakeholder priorities, but allows the Group to offer locally its insight on the major economic and social debates the country faces.\n\n## Charitable Foundations\n\nThe Board continued to support the work of the Group's charitable Foundations. Together during the year they have funded local charities in tackling issues ranging from financial disadvantage and social exclusion, to domestic abuse and modern slavery.\n\nAs well as grant funding, the Foundations offer charities additional support, with mentoring, learning, training and networking support also provided.\n\nThe Board was particularly pleased at the positive impact of the Foundations in helping charities respond locally to the COVID crisis. During the year the Board agreed the Group would continue to fund the important work of the Foundations in 2021, at levels of funding in line with those of 2020.\n\nThe Chair undertook virtual visits to several charities supported by the Foundations, including the Tom Harrison House in Liverpool, providing important insight into the role of the Group in supporting communities across the UK.\n\n## More detail\n\nEnvironmental ambitions\n\nRead more on pages 20 to 24\n\nHelping Britain Recover\n\nRead more on pages 38 to 39\n\nCharitable Foundations\n\nRead more on page 29\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

This helped ensure the Group's response could both best support our customers, but also remain in step with Government priorities for supporting the stability of the wider UK economy.\n\nSenior leaders worked closely with the FCA, PRA and representatives of HM Treasury to agree the Group's participation in the COVID related support schemes, keeping the Board apprised of all developments.\n\nFollowing these interactions, the Board approved the Group's participation in the Government's economic response, successfully providing our customers with access to the Government's support measures and loan schemes.\n\nThe Board continued to review the provision of this support as the year progressed, remaining close to the developing priorities of Government and of our regulators, as well as the impact on our customers and business.\n\n## Regulatory agenda\n\nThe Chair and individual Directors, in particular the Chairs of the Board's Committees, have in the ordinary course of business had continuing discussions with the FCA and PRA on a number of aspects of the regulatory agenda.\n\nThe Board in turn reviewed regular updates on this and wider Group regulatory interaction. This provided a view of key areas of regulatory focus, alongside progress being made in addressing key regulatory priorities.\n\nKey areas of regulatory interest for the Board have included ensuring robust prudential standards, the fair treatment of customers, and the Group's ongoing response to market changes. During the year such changes have included not only the response to COVID, but the UK's exit from the EU, in addition to climate change responsibilities, and ensuring the Group's ongoing financial and operational resilience.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBoard members proactively engage with the regulators across all these areas, in addition to a standing programme of monthly updates, including to the Board's Risk Committee.\n\nThese updates cover all aspects of the regulatory agenda, with emerging regulatory and legal risks, in addition to an overview of the Group's wider regulatory interaction. This provides a focused view of areas of priority, alongside detail of regulatory actions, and enforcement activity.\n\nThe Board continues to closely monitor the status of the Group's regulatory relationship, seeking to enhance engagement particularly in key areas of regulatory change. During the coming year this is expected to include the ongoing impacts of COVID, including customer relief, in addition to EU exit transition, climate risk management, dividend distribution and remuneration policy.\n\n## More detail\n\nCOVID-19 response Read more on pages 1 to 3\n\nEnvironmental ambitions\n\nRead more on pages 20 to 24\n\nAs the amount of new regulation continues to increase, and uncertainty remains about the impact of the UK's exit from the EU on regulatory frameworks, the Board recognises the importance of continuing to strengthen the Group's relationships with our key regulators.\n\nSara Weller\n\nIndependent Director\n\n## KEY BOARD DECISION ENVIRONMENTAL AMBITIONS\n\nAs a signal of the Group's commitment to sustainability, the Board approved an ambitious goal to reduce the emissions we finance by 2030, on the path to net zero by 2050 or sooner.\n\nAchieving these goals will not be easy, and the Board recognises the Group will need to take a number of actions.\n\nThese will over the coming years include investing in our buildings, removing the use of natural gas from our estate, and progressing our plans for zero carbon branches in communities across the UK. Many of the technologies needed are still new. The Board therefore recognises that close work will be needed with our partners and suppliers in developing innovative new solutions.\n\nSome initiatives were however approved for 2020, including the launch of a number of green finance products, tools and services. These included the Green Buildings Tool, a free to use insight tool, launched specifically for Commercial Banking clients. The tool helps clients identify energy efficiency improvements relating to both commercial and residential buildings, along with the associated costs and benefits of those improvements.\n\nThe tool also complements the existing Green Lending Initiative in the real estate and housing sectors, and our Clean Growth Finance Initiatives across all of Commercial Banking's sectors.\n\nThe Board was also pleased that the Group was able to launch its Green Living and Eco Home Hub for Halifax and Lloyds Bank customers. This online tool is first in the market amongst lenders, providing mortgage customers with a tailored action plan on home improvements which can help improve sustainability.\n\nFurther initiatives included the introduction of the Sustainability Fixed Term Deposit and 95 Day Notice Accounts, where deposited funds are used to support sustainability ambitions.\n\nThe Board will continue to oversee initiatives to help the Group achieve its sustainability goals, which will form a core part of the Group's strategy in the coming years.\n\nLink to strategic priorities\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLeading customer experience",

The Board reviewed updates on material related actions.\n\n## Supplier payment\n\nThe Board recognises that late payment of suppliers can represent a significant financial impact for them.\n\nAs such the Board seeks to ensure the Group's supplier payment practices continue to meet wider industry standards.\n\nTo that end, the Board's Audit Committee considered reports from the Group's Sourcing and Finance teams on the efficiency of supplier payment practices, including those relating to the Group's key supplier relationships.\n\n## Supply Chain Resilience\n\nThe impacts of the COVID crisis have been no less material within the Group's supply chain, with the Board keen to ensure these important relationships were not unduly impacted. The Board has also been mindful of the effects of the EU Exit on the Group's supply chain, as the UK approached the deadline of the related transition period.\n\n## KEY BOARD DECISION DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION\n\nAs part of how the Group can continue to Help Britain Recover, the Board agreed that digital investment played a key role, enabling the Group to best adapt to and support our stakeholders' developing priorities.\n\nThe Board agreed that as we prepare for the next phase of our strategy, acceleration of our approach to the public cloud was central in further digitising our business, enabling us to greatly improve the experience of both our customers and of our colleagues.\n\nWhile the Group has already taken some big steps in digital transformation, modernising how we serve customers, and changing how we work, the Board agreed that cloud technology was key to building on this progress.\n\nThis will include continuing to simplify our IT systems, and enhancing our IT architecture. Combining future-proofed cloud technology with smart customer data and insight, we want to deliver an even better and more personalised experience, regardless of the channel a customer chooses to do business with/uni00A0us.\n\nProgress overseen by the Board has included the mobilising of the Group's new Cloud Centre of Excellence, an important step in harnessing the opportunities cloud technology presents.\n\nThe Board held two deep dive sessions in June and October to review the Group's cloud strategy in detail. This allowed debate and challenge of the risks and further development of plans. The Board also participated in an insights programme on cloud technology to augment their current knowledge and understanding.\n\nThe Board has also overseen progress in the Group's use of external platforms, key in establishing our cloud services. The Board's IT and Cyber Advisory Forum has assisted in this by reviewing detailed aspects of the cloud strategy.\n\nThe Board was pleased that, despite the challenges of the pandemic, progress was also made in delivering technological developments which have helped to further improve our customer experience. These included industry leading capability for customers to view and cancel subscription services for items such as their monthly TV streaming and broadband service providers, paid for via their current account.

In particular the Board considered the work of the Group's Incident Management process and the contribution from sourcing and supply chain SME's from across the Group, an important means of support to key suppliers in managing the impacts of COVID on their relationships with the Group.\n\nThe Board recognised the challenge of preparations by suppliers for finalisation of the EU Exit, in particular when combined with the pressures of the COVID crisis. This included regular related updates for suppliers provided using the Group's website.\n\n## Modern slavery\n\nThe Board continues to have a zero tolerance attitude towards modern slavery in the Group's supply chain, receiving updates on progress made in the ongoing enhancements to our supplier practices.\n\nThese included measures which address the risk of human trafficking and modern slavery in our wider supply chain.\n\n## More detail\n\nResponsible sourcing Read more on page 31\n\nThe Board recognises that the Group's supply chain, and ensuring strong and mutually beneficial relationships with our suppliers, are key to the Group's ongoing success.\n\nCatherine Woods Independent Director\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

Both measures were impacted by the significant impairment charge taken during the year, the majority of which was recognised during the first half and reflected the Group's revised economic outlook for the UK, following the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. In the fourth quarter, statutory profit before tax was \u00a3792/uni00A0million and statutory profit after tax was \u00a3680 million, both benefiting from improved business conditions and a reduced impairment charge.\n\nTrading surplus for the year was \u00a36,440 million, a reduction of 27 per cent on 2019, reflecting the challenging external environment. Net income was down 16 per cent to \u00a314,404/uni00A0million, driven by both lower net interest income and lower other income. The Group has maintained its focus on delivering cost savings, with total costs down 4 per/uni00A0cent, while continuing to invest in the Group's digital propositions.\n\nThe Group's underlying profit was \u00a32,193/uni00A0million for the year, compared to an underlying profit of \u00a37,531 million in 2019, reflecting lower net income and the significant/uni00A0impairment charge of \u00a34,247 million taken in 2020.\n\nThe Group's balance sheet remains very strong. Loans and advances to customers were flat on prior year at \u00a3440 billion. This includes an increase in open mortgage book net lending of \u00a37.2 billion in the year, with \u00a36.7/uni00A0billion growth in the fourth quarter, reflecting the strength of the UK housing market. Total customer deposits increased by \u00a338.9 billion in the year, to \u00a3450.7 billion. Retail current account growth was \u00a320.5/uni00A0billion in 2020 and ahead of the market, driven by lower levels of customer spending during the pandemic and inflows to the Group's trusted brands.

Continue to target becoming a top 3 financial planning business\n\nFor 16 years, Scottish Widows has been researching the savings habits of women in the UK. Tracking retirement planning over the years means we can see patterns of behaviour evolve over a long period of time.\n\nThe good news is that the gender pensions gap is now the narrowest on record, with just a 1 per cent difference between the proportion of men and women putting enough money aside for a comfortable retirement. Almost three in five (59 per cent) women - the highest since we began this research - are saving adequately, compared to 60 per cent of men.\n\n## Financial performance\n\n- Underlying profit fell to \u00a3338 million, driven by impact of reduced market activity, lower non-recurring items and adverse assumption changes in 2020 (versus net positive in 2019)\n- Sales in individual annuities, non-branch protection, and workplace, planning and retirement, excluding auto-enrolment step-ups, have increased despite pandemic headwinds\n- Life and pensions experience and other items includes adverse impacts from assumption changes (further details of which are included in Other Financial Information) and the response to the Asset Management Market Review\n- General insurance combined operating ratio remains strong at 85 per cent in the context of absorbing \u00a336 million claims due to storms in 2020. Total gross written premiums remain resilient despite the reduction in branch footfall\n- Reduction in Wealth income reflects the transfer of business to Schroders Personal Wealth in 2019, and lower net interest income as a result of the lower rate environment. Stockbroking other income more than double prior year\n- Costs reduced by \u00a380 million, c.\u00a360/uni00A0million of which reflects the transfer of business to Schroders Personal Wealth\n\n## Insurance capital\n\n- Estimated Solvency II ratio of 151 per cent, reflects the dividend paid in February 2020, continued investment in new business, and the impact of lower interest rates\n- Credit asset portfolio is average 'A' rated, well diversified and non-cyclical, with less than 1 per cent sub investment grade or unrated. No Insurance ordinary dividend will be paid for 2020\n\nScottish Widows is continuing its call for a series of pension reforms to remove the persistent barriers to more women saving more money for retirement. This includes enhanced pensions for those on maternity leave, the mandatory inclusion of pensions in divorce proceedings and scrapping the minimum earnings threshold for of autoenrollment to make pensions more inclusive for part-time workers.\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

Board-level metrics are cascaded into more detailed business appetite metrics and limits. Regular close monitoring and comprehensive reporting to all levels of management and the Board ensures appetite limits are maintained and subject to stress analysis at a risk-type and portfolio level, as appropriate.\n\nGovernance is maintained through delegation of authority from the Board down to individuals. Senior executives are supported by a Committee based structure which is designed to ensure open challenge and enable effective decision-making. More information on our Risk Committees can be found on pages 150 to 152.\n\n## Simplified approach to managing risks\n\nOver the course of the year, there has been a strong focus on simplifying and enhancing the enterprise risk management framework. A One Risk and Control Self Assessment (One RCSA) approach to managing risks across the Group has been adopted, which supports the proactive identification of risks to customers and the Group's business objectives, as well as enabling a strong control framework. More information on One RCSA is available on/uni00A0page/uni00A0145.\n\n## Risk culture and the customer\n\nA transparent risk culture resonates across the organisation and is supported by the Board and its tone from the top.\n\nRisk management requires all colleagues to play their part with individuals taking responsibility for their actions.\n\nWithin our approach there is a strong focus on building and sustaining long-term relationships with customers through the economic cycle.\n\nSenior Management articulate the core risk values to which the Group aspires, based on the Group's conservative business model, prudent approach to risk management and the Board's guidance.\n\nAs a Group, we are open, honest and transparent with colleagues working in collaboration with business areas to:\n\n- support effective risk management and provide constructive challenge\n- share lessons learned and understand root causes when things go wrong\n- consider horizon risks and opportunities\n\n## Connectivity of risks and our strategic risk management framework\n\nThe unprecedented events of this year have demonstrated how individual risks in aggregate can place significant pressure on the Group's strategy, business model and performance. It is essential that we not only manage our individual risks, but understand how emerging and strategic risks are connected, and how they impact either existing principal risks or create new risks. By doing so we can ensure we continue to respond dynamically and protect our customers and support our colleagues and stakeholders.\n\nConnectivity of risks is very much at the forefront of the Group's thinking and additional work is being launched in 2021 to further embed this into our risk management framework.\n\nConnectivity of risks: The impact of emerging and strategic risks on the Group's principal risks\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Principal Risks\n\nThe Board-approved enterprise-wide risk categories used to monitor and report the risk exposures posing the greatest impact to the Group.\n\n## Emerging Risk\n\nA future internal or external event or trend, which could have a material positive or adverse impact on the Group and our customers, but where the probability, timescale and/ or materiality may be difficult to accurately assess.\n\n## Strategic Risk\n\nA principal risk arising from:\n\n- A failure to understand the potential impact of strategic responses on existing risk types\n- Incorrect assumptions about internal or external operating environments\n- Inappropriate strategic responses and business plans",

        "page_content": "## Principal risks\n\n2020 has been a year of significant uncertainty, including the spread of COVID-19 and its impact on global and domestic economies and the UK's exit from the European Union.\n\nCOVID-19 has had a significant impact on all risk types in 2020. Understanding and managing its impacts dynamically has been a major area of focus. The Group has responded quickly to the challenges faced, putting in place risk mitigation strategies and refining its investment and strategic plans.\n\nAll of the Group's principal risks, which are outlined on this page, are reported regularly to the Board.\n\nThe risk management section from pages 143 to 204 provides a more in-depth picture of how risk is managed within the Group.\n\n## Key focus areas during 2020\n\n## Climate - new\n\nThe Group recognises the evolving pace of climate risk and has adopted a comprehensive approach to embedding this risk within its enterprise risk management framework. This includes the creation of a new principal risk as well as its integration into our existing principal risks. Work has also continued to develop scenario modelling and other analytical tools and to increase the level of external disclosure to further align to the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations.\n\n## Market\n\nThe Group's structural hedge, nominal balance \u00a3186 billion (2019: \u00a3179 billion), provides protection against margin compression caused by falling interest rates. In addition, customer deposits have seen significant growth in 2020 which creates near-term interest rate exposure. Customer behaviour and hedging of these balances are reviewed regularly.\n\nThe Group's defined benefit pension schemes have seen an improvement in IAS19 accounting surplus to \u00a31.6 billion (2019:/uni00A0\u00a30.5/uni00A0billion), as a result of deficit reduction contributions and greater than expected asset returns partially offset by the impact of the Retail Price Index (RPI) reform announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in November 2020.\n\n## Credit\n\nA range of measures have been deployed to help support customers, including around 1.3/uni00A0million of payment holidays, over \u00a312 billion of additional Government support scheme lending through the Bounce Back Loan (BBLS) and Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan (CBILS) schemes, together with liquidity facilities for larger clients.\n\nThis support together with the wide array of public policy interventions, such as the job retention scheme, has limited the increase in unemployment, and helped to suppress credit defaults and business failures.\n\nThe Group has responded dynamically to mitigate and address credit risk, with specific focus on higher risk segments, sectors and counterparties, as well as undertaking extensive preparation to support the expected increase in customers who may experience financial difficulty.\n\nThe 2020 full year impairment charge of \u00a34,247 million (2019: \u00a31,291 million) reflects the\n\nweaker economic outlook, with reserves built in anticipation of an increase in losses during 2021 as unemployment increases and more business failures are seen.\n\n## Funding and liquidity\n\nThe Group maintained its strong funding and liquidity position in 2020, with the loan to deposit ratio decreasing to 98 per cent (2019: 107 per cent). Customer deposits increased significantly as spending reduced and customers deposited Government lending scheme balances. During the year, the Group repaid all outstanding amounts of its Term Funding Scheme (TFS) and Funding for Lending Scheme (FLS) drawings and drew \u00a313.7 billion from the Term Funding Scheme with additional incentives for SMEs (TFSME).\n\nTotal wholesale funding reduced by \u00a314.8/uni00A0billion principally as a result of the growth in customer deposits.\n\n## Capital\n\nCapital build was adversely impacted by impairment provisions in 2020, however the year end capital position is significantly strengthened due to the earlier reversal of the 2019 full year ordinary dividend accrual and enhanced IFRS 9 transitional relief, which partially offset the increase in impairment provisions. Closing CET1 ratio of 16.2 1 per cent (15.0 1 per cent excluding transitional relief). The Group's capital requirements have reduced in 2020 due to lower Pillar 2A requirements and the reduction in the UK countercyclical capital buffer rate in response to the impact of COVID-19. The Group therefore has significant headroom to absorb further potential losses and to continue to support households and businesses as they recover from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n## Insurance underwriting\n\nLower market activity as a result of the pandemic and noting the one-off 2019 benefit from workplace auto-enrolment step-ups, saw Life and Pensions present value of new business premium fall to \u00a314.5/uni00A0billion in 2020 (2019: \u00a317.5/uni00A0billion). Near-term underwriting risk increased, reflecting policyholder behaviour on workplace savings products. Significant amounts of life and morbidity risk continued to be re-insured. No material change to General Insurance underwriting risk in 2020, with total gross written premium falling slightly to \u00a3662/uni00A0million (2019:/uni00A0\u00a3671/uni00A0million) due to the reduction in branch footfall.\n\n## Change/execution\n\nThe Change/execution risk profile has remained stable in the year. The Group's change portfolio was reprioritised at pace to support critical and COVID-19 related activities. Enhanced, targeted control monitoring was implemented to ensure safe delivery of change during the year.\n\n## Conduct\n\nThe Group has adapted quickly to the impacts of the pandemic, providing significant support to impacted customers. Comprehensive preparations have been undertaken to help identify and further support those customers in financial difficulty.\n\n## Data\n\nThe Group continues to improve its capabilities in the management of data risk, with an improvement seen in the regular half yearly capability assessment.\n\nAreas of improvement include delivery of a new data risk and control library, embedding data by design and ethics principles into the data science lifecycle, increasing capabilities and broader awareness.\n\n## Governance\n\nGovernance risk has remained stable, despite the need for accelerated decision-making and a significant increase in the amount of remote working, together with a number changes to GEC and Board members throughout the year. Ensuring appropriate and efficient governance remains a key priority.\n\n## People\n\n2020 has seen increased colleague workloads and significant changes to ways of working, with more than 50,000 colleagues working from home. Improved colleague sentiment demonstrates that the extensive support measures deployed by the Group, with a continued focus on colleague wellbeing and resilience, are helping to mitigate these risks.\n\n## Operational resilience\n\nBusiness continuity plans have proved resilient, with particular attention applied to heightened risks in the supply chain.\n\n## Operational\n\nDespite anticipated heightened operational risks in the areas of cyber, fraud and technology, the volume of operational loss events has remained broadly consistent in 2020 compared to 2019.\n\n## Model\n\nModel risk has increased due to the nature and uncertainty of the economic outlook. The effect of Government-led customer support initiatives have weakened established relationships between model inputs and outputs, reducing the ability to forecast using models alone. While underlying model drivers are expected to remain valid in the longerterm, year end impairment reporting contains a greater element of governed judgement to reflect current conditions.\n\n## Regulatory and legal\n\nRegulatory risk has been impacted by a small number of instances of non-compliance, requiring forbearance from regulators. Forbearance requirements have been due to the reprioritisation of resource to support the provision of essential services to customers and to respond to new regulatory requirements, such as payment holidays. Legal risk has been impacted by the UK's exit from the EU, in particular continued uncertainty of the future UK legal and regulatory financial services framework.\n\n## Strategic\n\nStrategic risk is a significant source of risk for the Group, influencing the Group's strategy, business model, performance and risk profile. The development of our strategic risk framework is a key priority for the Group.\n\nSignificant work has been undertaken during 2020 to understand the risk implications of the Group's strategy and the key drivers of strategic risk. These are outlined in more detail on the following pages and will be further developed and embedded across the Group during 2021.\n\n- 1  Includes a 0.5/uni00A0per cent benefit following the implementation of the revised capital treatment of intangible software assets which the PRA is proposing to reverse.\n\ns\n\nt\n\ns",

        "page_content": "## Risk overview continued\n\n## Emerging risks\n\nIn addition to the principal risks, the Group takes a proactive approach to horizon scanning and assessing the potential impact of an existing or future trend which could have a material impact on the Group, where the probability, timescale and/or materiality may be difficult to accurately assess.\n\nThe Board Risk Committee approved the Group's enhanced definition for emerging risks in October 2020.\n\nInternal working groups have been established to regularly scan the horizon and identify emerging risks. In addition the working groups have sought to analyse the impact of material events, such as COVID-19, on those trends and assess whether those have accelerated the impact of existing risks on our customers, colleagues and wider stakeholders.\n\nThe key areas of focus in 2020 are broadly unchanged from 2019. In addition, three themes have been magnified and exacerbated as a result of the pandemic:\n\nTechnology: Which considers the long-term technology changes disrupting the industry, the emergence of new technology-driven business models, and the likely impact of technology change on our customers.\n\nSocietal expectations: Which reflects the expectations of the role the Group can play in supporting society across a range of issues such as housing, environmental sustainability and helping customers in financial difficulty.\n\nPeople, ways of working and skills: Trends include the significant acceleration in remote working due to COVID-19 and higher demand for workers with digital and analytical skills.\n\nSome emerging risks, such as data, have materialised and are recognised by the Group as principal risks. However, with risks continuing to evolve there will be important aspects of these risks that will need to continue to be captured through our emerging risks framework.\n\nThe emerging risks that the Group have monitored during 2020 are outlined in more detail in pages 147 to 149 of the risk management section.\n\n## ILLUSTRATIVE MAP OF EMERGING RISKS - NON EXHAUSTIVE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEmerging risks are assessed through an impact/likelihood matrix whereby the most pertinent trends are considered when shaping and refreshing our major strategic priorities and responses.\n\nKey emerging risks are outlined in more detail in pages 147 to 149 of the risk management section.\n\n## Internal\n\n## External\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPeople/Ways of Working and Skills IT and Data/Cyber\n\nGeopolitical\n\nFinancial and macroeconomic\n\nCompetition and customer trends\n\nNatural environment/climate\n\nSocietal expectations\n\n## Strategic risk\n\n## Risk view of key Strategic Review 2021 themes\n\nThe Group's strategy plays an important role in managing our strategic risks, responding to the priorities identified by the Board, and transforming our capabilities to deliver on these priorities. Some of the key themes from our strategy, as outlined on pages 36 to 45, represent new opportunities, while also posing corresponding risks that need to be understood.\n\nIn 2020 the Group undertook an initiative to enhance our framework and approach for identifying and understanding our strategic risks, with particular focus on the connectivity of risks.\n\nOur understanding of the relationship and impact amongst emerging risks, strategic responses and principal risks played a key role in the development of our strategy. This was supplemented with engagement across the Group's businesses and functions, to establish a strong understanding of the Group's strategic challenges.\n\nIn line with the Group's strategy to gain greater organisational value from data and advanced analytics, we are also developing a quantitative approach to further strengthen our strategic risk management framework.\n\nThe health of the UK economy and the financial health and wellbeing of our customers are core influences on the Group's principal and strategic risks. We are therefore committed to Helping Britain Prosper and placing this purpose at the heart of our strategy.\n\nWe are well-positioned to respond to potential challenges posed by increased customer financial vulnerability and societal disparity, ensuring our proposition resonates with evolving customer needs.\n\nSignificant investment is planned to reimagine our customer offerings. Transforming our technology architecture, appropriately and securely using data science and upskilling our colleagues, we aim to deliver a holistic proposition, together with an excellent customer experience.\n\nThe Group's strategy aims to support a more sustainable future, while diversifying our income streams. The Group is working hard to ensure that our purpose, commitment to Helping Britain Prosper and delivery are harmonious with the expectations of our colleagues, customers and other key stakeholders, all the while adapting to changing societal expectations and customer and colleague preferences.",

        "page_content": "## Summary of Group results\n\n## Financial performance reflects the challenging economic environment\n\nThe Group's statutory profit before tax for the year was \u00a31,226 million with statutory profit after tax of \u00a31,387 million. Both measures were impacted by the significant impairment charge taken during the year, the majority of which was recognised during the first half and reflected the Group's revised economic outlook for the UK, following the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. In the fourth quarter, statutory profit before tax was \u00a3792 million and statutory profit after tax was \u00a3680 million, both benefiting from improved business conditions and a reduced impairment charge.\n\nTrading surplus for the year was \u00a36,440 million, a reduction of 27 per cent on 2019, reflecting the challenging external environment. Net income was down 16 per cent to \u00a314,404 million, driven by both lower net interest income and lower other income. The Group has maintained its focus on delivering cost savings, with total costs down 4 per cent, while continuing to invest in the Group's digital propositions.\n\nThe Group's underlying profit was \u00a32,193 million for the year, compared to an underlying profit of \u00a37,531 million in 2019, reflecting lower net income and the significant impairment charge of \u00a34,247 million taken in 2020.\n\nThe Group's balance sheet remains very strong. Loans and advances to customers were flat on prior year at \u00a3440 billion. This includes an increase in open mortgage book net lending of \u00a37.2 billion in the year, with \u00a36.7 billion growth in the fourth quarter, reflecting the strength of the UK housing market. Total customer deposits increased by \u00a338.9 billion in the year, to \u00a3450.7 billion. Retail current account growth was \u00a320.5 billion in 2020 and ahead of the market, driven by lower levels of customer spending during the pandemic and inflows to the Group's trusted brands. Commercial Banking current account growth also illustrates the Group's strong customer relationships and a proportion of the Government-backed lending being retained on deposit by SME customers.\n\nThe Group's CET1 capital ratio post dividend increased 242 basis points over the year, from 13.8 per cent (on a pro forma basis) to 16.2 per cent, or 16.4/uni00A0per cent pre dividend accrual.\n\n## Net income\n\n|                                         | 2020   \u00a3m/uni00A0   | 2019  \u00a3m   | Change  %/uni00A0   |\n|-----------------------------------------|---------------------|------------|---------------------|\n| Net interest income                     | 10,773              | 12,377     | (13)                |\n| Other income                            | 4,515               | 5,732      | (21)                |\n| Operating lease depreciation            | (884)               | (967)      | 9                   |\n| Net income                              | 14,404              | 17,142     | (16)                |\n| Banking net interest margin             | 2.52%               | 2.88%      | (36)  bp            |\n| Average interest-earning banking assets | \u00a3435.0bn            | \u00a3434.7bn   | -                   |\n\nNet income of \u00a314,404 million was 16 per cent lower than in the prior year, reflecting both lower net interest income and lower other income in the period, partially offset by a decrease in operating lease depreciation.\n\nNet interest income of \u00a310,773 million was down 13 per cent, driven by a reduction in the banking net interest margin and stable average interestearning banking assets. The net interest margin was down 36 basis points to 2.52 per cent. This reflected the lower rate environment, actions taken during the year to support customers and a change in asset mix, largely as a result of reduced levels of customer activity and demand during the coronavirus pandemic. The net interest margin in the fourth quarter of 2.46 per cent, up 4 basis points on the third quarter, reflected the positive impact of deposit repricing and improved mortgage pricing, together with reduced funding costs, partially offset by lower income from the Group's structural hedge.\n\nIn 2021, based on current economic assumptions, the Group expects a net interest margin of in excess of 240 basis points.\n\nThe Group manages the risk to its earnings and capital from movements in interest rates centrally by hedging the net liabilities which are stable or less sensitive to movements in rates. As at 31 December 2020 the Group's structural hedge had an approved capacity of \u00a3210 billion (increased from the prior year reflecting account management and core deposit growth in 2020), a nominal balance of \u00a3186 billion (31 December 2019: \u00a3179 billion) and a weighted-average duration of around two and a half years (31 December 2019: around three years). The Group generated \u00a32.4 billion of gross income from the structural hedge balances in 2020 (2019: \u00a32.7 billion). In 2021, based on current economic assumptions, the Group expects c.\u00a360 billion of maturities and c.\u00a3400 million lower income from the structural hedge, with lower maturities in 2022 and 2023.\n\nAverage interest-earning banking assets were stable compared to prior year at \u00a3435 billion, with growth due to Government-backed lending to support business clients through the coronavirus crisis, open mortgage book growth and the full impact of the 2019 Tesco mortgage book acquisition. This was offset by lower balances in the closed mortgage book and in credit cards, as well as reductions in revolving credit facilities (RCFs) and the continued optimisation of the Corporate and Institutional book within Commercial Banking. Average interest-earning banking assets in the fourth quarter increased marginally to \u00a3437 billion as the Group continued to benefit from strong growth in the open mortgage book (lending balances up \u00a36.7 billion in the fourth quarter), offset by further RCF reductions in Commercial Banking. The Group expects average interest-earning assets in 2021 to be flat to modestly higher than in 2020.\n\nOther income of \u00a34,515 million in 2020 was 21 per cent lower than in 2019 reflecting lower levels of customer activity across the Group's main business lines, largely due to the coronavirus pandemic, combined with an adverse impact from assumption changes in Insurance and Wealth and lower non-recurring items. Within Retail, other income fell as a result of reduced customer spending and the continuing impact of a lower Lex fleet size. Commercial Banking saw lower transaction banking income as a consequence of coronavirus-related activity levels, with resilience in markets income. Insurance and Wealth income was lower than the prior year, impacted by reduced new business given the effects of the pandemic, the nonrecurrence of c.\u00a3140 million of new business income associated with workplace pensions auto-enrolment benefits in 2019 and \u00a360 million of negative methodology and assumption changes in 2020 versus \u00a3336 million of positive assumption changes, including the benefit of the change in investment management provider in 2019. In addition, across the Group a \u00a377 million charge was incurred as a consequence of the response to the Asset Management Market Review, largely incurred in Insurance and Wealth. Income associated with the Group's equity investments business, including Lloyds Development Capital, was \u00a3281 million (2019: \u00a3341 million), with \u00a3166 million recognised in the fourth quarter.\n\nOther income includes a gain of \u00a3149 million (2019: \u00a3185 million) on the sale of gilts and other liquid assets. 2019 also benefited from the nonrecurrence of a \u00a350 million performance related earn-out following the sale of Vocalink.\n\nOperating lease depreciation reduced to \u00a3884 million (2019: \u00a3967 million) as a result of the continued impact of a smaller Lex fleet size, combined with the benefit of resilient used car prices.",

Operating costs of \u00a37,585 million were 4 per cent lower, in the context of continued investment in the Group's digital transformation. Business as usual costs were down 4 per cent, driven by ongoing cost management as well as lower remuneration and reduced travel costs, partially offset by increased pension costs and coronavirus-related expenses.\n\nTotal investment spend in 2020 amounted to \u00a32.0 billion, down 14 per cent on 2019. This included \u00a30.9/uni00A0billion relating to strategic investment, taking the cumulative strategic spend since the start of GSR3 to \u00a32.8/uni00A0billion. Although investment spend continues to be managed carefully in response to the current operating environment, the Group has continued to prioritise technology and digital projects and will continue to invest in the long-term success of the business.\n\nDuring 2020 the Group capitalised c.\u00a31.3 billion of investment spend, of which c.\u00a30.9 billion related to intangible assets. Total capitalised spend was equivalent to c.60 per cent of above the line investment, in line with prior periods.\n\nDespite the continued delivery of cost savings, the lower net income over the period meant that the Group's cost:income ratio of 55.3 per cent was higher than in 2019.\n\nThe Group now expects operating costs to reduce further to c.\u00a37.5 billion in 2021.\n\nRemediation charges were \u00a3379 million (2019: \u00a3445 million) and down 15 per cent on 2019, including additional charges of \u00a3125 million in the fourth quarter relating to pre-existing programmes. During the year additional charges, both redress and operational costs, of \u00a3159 million, have been taken in relation to HBOS Reading, as well as further costs in relation to arrears handling, packaged bank account complaints and various settlements in relation to historic claims. A number of programmes are now close to conclusion. Others, such as HBOS Reading, including the conclusion of the recommendations from the Cranston Review, are still ongoing and further costs are likely to be incurred.\n\n## Impairment\n\nThe impairment charge for the year was \u00a34,247 million, an increase of \u00a32,956 million compared to 2019. This was primarily driven by the charge in the first half reflecting potential future losses in light of the Group's revised economic outlook for the UK as a consequence of the coronavirus pandemic. The charge of \u00a3128 million taken in the fourth quarter was below typical pre-crisis levels and reflected the relative economic stability in the quarter.\n\nThe Group's net asset quality ratio was 0.96 per cent compared with 0.29 per cent in 2019, largely driven by increases in expected credit loss (ECL) allowance in the first half of the year. Excluding the updated economic assumptions and coronavirus-impacted restructuring cases, the asset quality ratio would not have been materially higher than in 2019.\n\nCharges of \u00a3403 million were taken in the year on restructuring cases whose recovery strategies were affected more immediately by the coronavirus pandemic. Aside from these cases, observed credit performance has remained stable, in part as a result of the continued effectiveness of Government support schemes and payment holidays extended by the Group. Additional funding has been made available by those schemes to businesses impacted by lockdown restrictions which has prevented a more material increase in business failures and unemployment.\n\nObserved credit quality remains stable with the flow of assets into arrears, defaults and write-offs remaining at low levels. The Group has built a significant ECL allowance in the expectation that when the support schemes unwind, insolvencies and unemployment will consequently increase. The Group's total ECL allowance across all asset classes has increased from \u00a34.2 billion to \u00a36.9 billion in the year, with the majority of the increase in provisions established for up to date assets in Stage 1 and Stage 2. This increase was established in the first half of 2020 in response to changes in the Group's economic outlook. Subsequent improvements to the economic outlook are redicated upon coronavirus vaccine developments which have emerged, reversing some of the ECL increases in the second half, including in the fourth quarter.\n\nOverall the Group's loan portfolio continues to be well-positioned, reflecting a prudent through-the-cycle approach to credit risk and high levels of security. The Retail portfolio is heavily weighted toward high quality mortgage lending where low loan-to-value ratios provide security against potential risks. The prime consumer finance portfolio also benefits from high quality growth in past periods in the context of the Group's prudent risk appetite. The commercial portfolio reflects a diverse client base with relatively limited exposure to the most vulnerable sectors so far affected by the coronavirus outbreak. Within Commercial Banking, the Group's management of concentration risk includes single name and country limits as well as controls over the overall exposure to certain higher risk and vulnerable sectors or asset classes.\n\n|                                                   | 2020  \u00a3m   | 2019  \u00a3m   | Change  %/uni00A0   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|---------------------|\n| Charges pre-updated multiple economic scenarios 1 |            |            |                     |\n| Retail                                            | 1,359      | 1,038      | (31)                |\n| Commercial Banking                                | 252        | 306        | 18                  |\n| Other                                             | (1)        | (53)       | 98                  |\n|                                                   | 1,610      | 1,291      | (25)                |\n| Coronavirus impacted restructuring cases 2        | 403        | -          | -                   |\n| Updated economic outlook                          |            |            |                     |\n| Retail                                            | 1,025      | -          | -                   |\n| Commercial Banking                                | 809        | -          | -                   |\n| Other                                             | 400        | -          | -                   |\n|                                                   | 2,234      | -          | -                   |\n| Impairment charge                                 | 4,247      | 1,291      | (229)               |\n| Asset quality ratio                               | 0.96%      | 0.29%      | 67bp                |\n| Gross asset quality ratio                         | 0.99%      | 0.37%      | 62bp                |\n\nt\n\nt\n\ns",

Refer to basis of presentation.\n- 2  Expected credit loss allowances on loans and advances to customers (drawn and undrawn).\n- 3  Total and Stage 3 ECL allowances as a percentage of drawn balances are calculated excluding loans in recoveries in Retail of \u00a3179/uni00A0million (31 December 2019: \u00a3205 million).\n- 4  Includes reverse repos of \u00a358.6 billion (31 December 2019: \u00a354.6 billion).\n\nThe updated economic outlook in the fourth quarter drove a \u00a3659 million ECL release which was partially offset by a central overlay of \u00a3400 million. This overlay was added in recognition of the significant uncertainty that remains as to the efficacy of the vaccine, the vaccination programme, potential virus mutation, further lockdowns and economic performance post lockdown restrictions and Government support, recognising that the full range of these risks is not captured in the Group's method of generating alternative scenarios around its base case. The previous \u00a3200 million central overlay noted at the halfyear for the severe scenario is now included in model outputs within divisional ECL provisions. The scale of the current uncertainty overlay approximately equates to a c.1 percentage point increase in unemployment allied with a 5 per cent lower HPI in 2021, or a c.10 percentage point higher weighting of the severe downside scenario.\n\nThe resulting ECL on drawn and undrawn loans and advances to customers of \u00a36.8 billion represents 1.4 per cent coverage of gross loans and advances to customers, up 0.6 percentage points from 0.8 per cent at 31 December 2019. The ECL allowance remains high by historical standards and consistent with the Group's updated macroeconomic projections, assumes that a large proportion of expected losses will crystallise over the next 12 to 18 months as support measures subside and unemployment increases.\n\nThe ECL allowance continues to reflect a probability-weighted view of future economic scenarios with a 30 per cent weighting applied to base case, upside and downside scenarios and a 10 per cent weighting to the severe downside. All scenarios have deteriorated since the start of the year, following the changes made to the base case. They also reflect a widening of the range of potential outcomes, following changes to the generation of scenarios around the base case.\n\nStage 2 loans and advances increased to \u00a360.5 billion (31 December 2019: \u00a338.4 billion), equivalent to 12.0 per cent (31 December 2019: 7.7 per cent) of total loans and advances to customers, as a result of the deterioration in economic outlook. Of these, 89 per cent are up to date (31 December 2019: 79 per cent, 30 September 2020: 89 per cent). Stage 3 loans and advances as a proportion of the portfolio have remained stable at 1.8 per cent in 2020 with limited increase in flows to default, given the availability of Government support and payment holidays. Approximately 90 per cent of payment holidays have now recommenced payment, with only \u00a35.8 billion outstanding as at 16 February 2021. At 31 December \u00a36.4 billion remained outstanding, of which 31 per cent was included in the \u00a360.5 billion of Stage 2 assets. If those Retail customers in Stage 1 with payment holidays still in place at 31 December 2020 were moved to Stage 2, the impact on ECL would be less than \u00a350 million.\n\nThe Group's ECL coverage of Stage 2 assets increased to 4.5 per cent (31 December 2019: 3.7 per cent), again reflecting the updated economic outlook. Coverage of Stage 3 assets has also increased to 28.1 per cent (31 December 2019: 22.5 per cent) primarily due to an increase in ECL of \u00a3403 million on distressed existing clients whose recovery strategies were affected by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nDespite action taken to mitigate the significant levels of uncertainty through the use of the central overlay, the extent of the impairment charge in 2021 will depend on the potential severity and duration of the economic shock in the UK. Based on current macroeconomic assumptions, the Group expects the 2021 net asset quality ratio to be below 40 basis points.\n\n## Commercial Banking lending in key coronavirus-impacted sectors 1\n\n|                          | At 31 December 2020   | At 31 December 2020   | At 31 December 2020    | At 31 December 2020                  | At 30 June 2020   | At 30 June 2020   | At 30 June 2020        | At 30 June 2020                      |\n|--------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n|                          | Drawn \u00a3bn             | Undrawn \u00a3bn           | Drawn and  undrawn \u00a3bn | Drawn as a % of loans and advances % | Drawn \u00a3bn         | Undrawn \u00a3bn       | Drawn and  undrawn \u00a3bn | Drawn as a % of loans and advances % |\n| Retail non-food          | 2.2                   | 1.7                   | 3.9                    | 0.5                                  | 2.4               | 1.8               | 4.2                    | 0.5                                  |\n| Automotive dealerships 2 | 1.8                   | 2.0                   | 3.8                    | 0.4                                  | 2.4               | 1.5               | 3.9                    | 0.5                                  |\n| Oil and gas              | 1.1                   | 2.7                   | 3.8                    | 0.2                                  | 1.4               | 2.7               | 4.1                    | 0.3                                  |\n| Construction             | 1.2                   | 1.7                   | 2.9                    | 0.2                                  | 1.3               | 1.7               | 3.0                    | 0.3                                  |\n| Passenger transport      | 1.2                   | 1.1                   | 2.3                    | 0.2                                  | 1.3               | 0.6               | 1.9                    | 0.4                                  |\n| Hotels                   | 1.9                   | 0.3                   | 2.2                    | 0.4                                  | 1.9               | 0.3               | 2.2                    | 0.3                                  |\n| Leisure                  | 0.7                   | 0.7                   | 1.4                    | 0.1                                  | 0.8               | 0.5               | 1.3                    | 0.2                                  |\n| Restaurants and bars     | 0.7                   | 0.5                   | 1.2                    | 0.1                                  | 0.8               | 0.5               | 1.3                    | 0.2                                  |\n| Total                    | 10.8                  | 10.7                  | 21.5                   | 2.1                                  | 12.3              | 9.6               | 21.9                   | 2.7                                  |\n\n- 1  Lending classified using ONS SIC codes at legal entity level.\n- 2  Automotive dealerships includes Black Horse Motor Wholesale lending (within Retail Division).",

Payment holidays of up to three months have been granted across Retail mortgages, personal loans, credit cards and motor finance, with extensions available of up to three months should customers request them. There are c.44,000 (\u00a31.7 billion) payment holidays where the first payment holiday is still in force and 1.2 million (\u00a366.6 billion) that have matured, including c.64,000 (\u00a34.1 billion) that have then been extended.\n\nThe vast majority of first payment holidays (98 per cent) have now matured, of which 89 per cent by value have restarted payments, 6 per cent have been extended and 5 per cent have missed payment when due.\n\nMortgages account for the largest proportion of payment holidays, with a total of around 489,000 having been granted, equating to customer balances of \u00a361.9 billion. As at 16 February 2021, 98 per cent, or c.479,000, have matured with 89 per cent, or 428,000, of those having resumed repayments, 5 per cent having extended and 5 per cent having missed payment. The average LTV of customers extending their mortgage payment holidays and still in extension remains relatively low at 50 per cent, compared to 44 per cent for the total mortgage book.\n\nThe Group also granted c.338,000 payment holidays on \u00a31.7 billion of credit card balances, 298,000 payment holidays on \u00a32.4 billion of unsecured personal loans and c.155,000 payment holidays on \u00a32.3 billion of motor finance products. These products have experienced c.85 per cent of customers resuming payments at the end of their payment holidays. Only \u00a30.1 billion of credit card balances have been subject to a payment holiday extension and are still in extension. \u00a30.2 billion of total credit card payment holidays granted have missed payment.\n\nAcross all products, customers who are in extension remain of a typically lower credit quality than the wider book and tend to have higher average balances than customers who have not requested payment holidays. It should also be noted that of the customers missing payments after conclusion of the payment holiday, typically one third were in arrears at the start of the payment holiday.\n\nFollowing the announcement of the latest national coronavirus-related lockdown, since 1 January 2021, the Group has granted c.28,000 new payment holidays on \u00a30.8 billion of Retail balances.\n\nFor the duration of the payment holiday the Group continues to recognise interest on the loan under the effective interest rate method.\n\nThe Group has approved c.337,000 loans with a total value of \u00a312.4 billion to customers under Government-backed loan schemes including c.327,000 loans totalling \u00a39.3 billion approved under the Bounce Back Loan Scheme.\n\nt\n\nt\n\ns",

The Group expects to increase its investment in technology research and development in 2021 and as a result expects restructuring costs to be higher in 2021 than in 2020.\n\nVolatility and other items at a net loss of \u00a3361 million in 2020 comprised \u00a359 million of negative market volatility and asset sales, \u00a369 million of amortisation of purchased intangibles and \u00a3233 million of fair value unwind. Market volatility and asset sales included \u00a3222 million of negative insurance volatility, driven mainly by falling equity markets and a loss of \u00a3106 million relating to liability management exercises largely occurring in the fourth quarter. This was offset against positive banking volatility of \u00a3392 million, primarily reflecting exchange rate and interest rate movements. Comparatives for 2019 include a one-off charge for exiting the Standard Life Aberdeen investment management agreement.\n\nThe Group recognised a charge of \u00a385 million for PPI in the final quarter of the year. This charge was driven by the impact of coronavirus delaying operational activities during 2020, the final stages of work to ensure operational completeness and final validation of information requests and complaints with third parties that resulted in a limited number of additional complaints to be handled. Of the approximately six million enquiries received predeadline, more than 99 per cent have now been processed. A small part of the costs incurred during the year also reflect the costs associated with litigation activity to date.\n\nThe return on tangible equity for 2020 was 3.7 per cent (2019: 7.8 per cent) and earnings per share were 1.2 pence (2019: 3.5 pence). In the fourth quarter of the year, return on tangible equity was 7.2 per cent.\n\nGoing forward and in order to aid comparability across the banking sector, the Group will report its statutory return on tangible equity without adding back the post-tax amortisation of intangible assets to the return. On this new basis and given improving profitability, the Group is targeting a return on tangible equity of between 5 and 7 per cent in 2021 and in excess of the cost of equity in the medium-term.\n\n## Tax\n\nThe Group recognised a tax credit of \u00a3161 million in the period, which was impacted by an uplift in the value of deferred tax assets of c.\u00a3350 million recognised in the first half of 2020. This credit reflected the UK corporation tax rate being held at 19 per cent, as substantively enacted on 17/uni00A0March/uni00A02020. The Group continues to expect a medium-term effective tax rate around 25 per cent.",

Within Retail, the open mortgage book increased by \u00a310.2 billion in the second half of 2020 with \u00a36.7 billion in the fourth quarter, reflecting the strength of the UK housing market. Commercial Banking loans, including Retail Business Banking, reduced by \u00a32.2 billion in 2020 as the continued optimisation of the portfolio and reduced revolving credit facilities balances more than offset support provided to clients through Government-backed lending schemes.\n\nTotal customer deposits increased by \u00a338.9 billion in the year, to \u00a3450.7 billion. The Group continues to target current account balance growth and optimise funding with Retail current accounts up 27 per cent at \u00a397.4 billion (31 December 2019: \u00a376.9 billion), having grown ahead of the market in the year. The Group's loan to deposit ratio of 98 per cent, down 9 percentage points on 2019, was driven by increased customer deposits and evidences a strong liquidity position and significant potential to lend into an economic recovery. The Group continues to access wholesale funding markets across a variety of currencies and markets. During the year, the Group repaid all outstanding amounts of its Term Funding Scheme (TFS) drawings of \u00a315.4 billion and the remaining \u00a31 billion outstanding of its Funding for Lending Scheme (FLS) drawings. In addition to the \u00a31 billion drawn in the first half of the year, the Group has made drawings of \u00a312.7 billion in the second half from the new Term Funding Scheme with additional incentives for SMEs (TFSME), taking the total outstanding amount to \u00a313.7 billion at 31 December 2020. Overall, total wholesale funding has reduced to \u00a3109.4 billion at 31 December 2020 (31 December 2019: \u00a3124.2 billion) principally as a result of the growth in customer deposits.\n\n## Capital\n\n|                                               | At 31 Dec/uni00A0 2020   | At 31 Dec 2019   | Change  %/uni00A0   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------|------------------|---------------------|\n| CET1 ratio 1,2                                | 16.2%                    | 13.8%            | 2.4pp               |\n| CET1 ratio pre IFRS 9 transitional relief 1,2 | 15.0%                    | 13.4%            | 1.6pp               |\n| Transitional total capital ratio 1,2          | 23.3%                    | 21.5%            | 1.8pp               |\n| Transitional MREL ratio 1,2                   | 36.4%                    | 32.6%            | 3.8pp               |\n| UK leverage ratio 1,2                         | 5.8%                     | 5.2%             | 0.6pp               |\n| Risk-weighted assets 1                        | \u00a3203bn                   | \u00a3203bn           | -                   |\n| Shareholders' equity                          | \u00a343bn                    | \u00a342bn            | 4                   |\n| Tangible net assets per share                 | 52.3p                    | 50.8p            | 1.5p                |\n\n- 1  The CET1, total capital, MREL and leverage ratios and risk-weighted assets at 31 December 2019 are reported on a pro forma basis, reflecting the dividend paid up by the Insurance business in the subsequent first quarter period.

        "page_content": "## Summary of Group results continued\n\nThe Group's CET1 capital ratio post dividend increased 242 basis points over the year, from 13.8 per cent on a pro forma basis to 16.2 per cent. Capital build prior to the dividend accrual of 21 basis points, the impact of the revised treatment of intangible software assets of 51 basis points and the 2019 full year dividend reversal of 83 basis points, was 129 basis points. Banking business capital build of 192 basis points was largely offset by the 174 basis point impact of impairment in the year, mitigated by the benefit of the IFRS 9 transitional relief (83 basis points). RWA and other movements contributed 28 basis points, with pension contributions (equivalent to 46 basis points) more than offset by reductions in underlying risk-weighted assets and excess expected losses as well as favourable market and other movements.\n\nThe increase in the CET1 ratio of 118 basis points in the fourth quarter (pre dividend accrual) reflected underlying profitability, risk-weighted asset reductions and the introduction of the revised capital treatment of intangible software assets.\n\nThe PRA is consulting on a proposal to reverse the revised capital treatment of software assets (which currently follows EU capital regulations). Should the PRA proceed with their proposal then the reinstatement of the original requirement to deduct these assets from capital will come into force during 2021. This could lead to a c.50 basis points reduction in the Group's CET1 capital ratio (net of a reduction in associated RWAs), and based on the position at 31 December 2020 the ratio would reduce to 15.7 per cent.\n\nThe Group applies the revised IFRS 9 transitional arrangements for capital as set out under current capital regulations. The arrangements provide for temporary capital relief for the increase in accounting impairment provisions following the initial implementation of IFRS 9 ('static' relief) and subsequent relief for any increases in Stage 1 and Stage 2 expected credit losses since 1 January 2020 ('dynamic' relief). The transitional arrangements do not cover Stage 3 expected credit losses.\n\nWhilst the net increase in IFRS 9 transitional relief over the year amounted to 83 basis points, the Group's total relief recognised at 31 December 2020 amounted to 115 basis points, including static relief.\n\nRisk-weighted assets reduced by \u00a30.7 billion over the year from \u00a3203.4 billion to \u00a3202.7 billion. Increases were from credit migrations and model calibrations (c.\u00a32.5 billion); regulatory changes, including the revised capital treatment of intangible software assets (net \u00a32.2 billion); and other movements, including Retail model updates (c.\u00a31.9 billion). In addition, there were increases in risk-weighted assets attributable to deferred tax assets and the risk-weighted element of the Group's investment in Insurance following the increase in the Group's capital base (\u00a31.6 billion). These were more than offset by reductions in lending balances outside Government-backed schemes (\u00a33.6 billion) and optimisation activity undertaken in Commercial Banking (c.\u00a35.3 billion).\n\nRisk-weighted assets reduced by \u00a32.5 billion in the fourth quarter, largely reflecting reductions from credit migrations and model calibrations (including HPI improvement), continued optimisation of the Commercial Banking portfolio and the disposal of a legacy equity investment in Visa Inc., offset in part by an increase as a result of the revised capital treatment of intangible software assets.\n\nWhilst credit migration in 2020 has been less than expected, it is expected to have a fuller impact in 2021 and into 2022, consistent with economic forecasts. It is also expected that a material part of the Group's IFRS 9 dynamic relief that built up during 2020 will unwind in 2021 with the remainder expected to largely unwind in 2022, impacting CET1 ratios. As a result, based on current economic forecasts, the Group expects capital build in 2021 to be impacted by the expected unwind of IFRS 9 transitional relief, as well as profitability.\n\nThe deferral of the UK implementation of the remainder of CRR 2 means that expected risk-weighted asset inflation driven by changes to the new standardised approach for calculating counterparty credit risk exposure (SA-CCR) will now impact in 2022, with no significant regulatory changes expected in 2021, other than the PRA's proposed reversal of the revised treatment of software assets. Given these movements, as well as continued optimisation in the Commercial Banking portfolio, the Group expects risk-weighted assets in 2021 to be broadly stable on 2020, but with headwinds from regulatory changes in/uni00A02022.\n\nDuring the first half of 2020 the PRA reduced the Group's Pillar 2A CET1 requirement from 2.6 per cent to 2.3 per cent. In December 2020 the PRA further reduced the requirement to c.2.1 per cent in the context of a higher UK countercyclical capital buffer rate, which in normal conditions will be set at 2 per cent (currently set at zero per cent). In line with PRA policy, the latter reduction is currently fully offset by other regulatory capital requirements at the CET1 level.\n\nFollowing the decision by the PRA to reduce the UK countercyclical capital buffer rate to zero earlier in the year, combined with the initial Pillar 2A reduction noted above, the Group's CET1 capital regulatory requirement has reduced to c.11 per cent. Consequently, current CET1 headroom over requirements has increased.\n\nThe Board's view of the ongoing level of CET1 capital required by the Group to grow the business, meet regulatory requirements and cover uncertainties remains at c.12.5 per cent, plus a management buffer of c.1 per cent.\n\nThe transitional total capital ratio increased to 23.3 per cent (31 December 2019: 21.5 per cent on a pro forma basis) and the Group's transitional minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL), which came into force on 1 January 2020, is 36.4 per cent (31 December 2019: 32.6 per cent on a pro forma basis). The UK leverage ratio increased to 5.8 per cent.\n\n## Pensions\n\nTerms have now been agreed in principle with the Group Pensions Trustee in respect of the valuations of the Group's three main defined benefit pension schemes. The valuations showed an aggregate ongoing funding deficit of \u00a37.3 billion as at 31 December 2019 (\u00a37.3 billion deficit at 31 December 2016). The revised deficit now includes an allowance for the impact of RPI reform announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in November 2020.\n\nUnder the previous recovery plan, deficit contributions were committed of c.\u00a30.8 billion in 2020 and c.\u00a31.3 billion per annum from 2021 to 2024. Under the new recovery plans, c.\u00a30.8 billion was paid in 2020 with contributions looking forward equating to c.\u00a30.8 billion per annum, plus a further 30 per cent of in year capital distributions to ordinary shareholders, up to a limit on total deficit contributions of \u00a32.0 billion per annum payable until this deficit has been removed. The Group continues to provide security to these pension schemes, with corporate guarantees and collateral pledged, while also making additional annual contributions for future service and scheme running costs.\n\n## Dividend\n\nFollowing a request made by the PRA to large UK banks in March 2020, the Group suspended the payment of dividends on ordinary shares for the remainder of the year and cancelled the payment of the final dividend for 2019. These actions were undertaken as a precautionary measure to preserve capital as the spread of the coronavirus pandemic led to a UK-wide lockdown, with the potential to create a significant and prolonged downturn.\n\nIn December 2020, the PRA announced that dividend payments could recommence, provided that this was subject to a prudent framework for the setting of such distributions. As a result the PRA has established a cap on distributions for year end 2020.\n\nGiven the Group's strong capital position at the year end and the regulator's clarification that banks may resume capital distributions, the Board has recommended a final ordinary dividend of 0.57 pence per share, the maximum allowed under the PRA's guidelines.\n\nThe PRA has additionally noted its intention to provide a further update on distributions ahead of the 2021 half year results for the large UK banks. It is expected that the PRA will take account of the outcome of the first stage of the Bank of England 2021 solvency stress test exercise in informing its approach to half year distributions. Ahead of the update at half year, dividends may be accrued for via capital, provided this is undertaken on an appropriately prudent basis, but may not be paid.\n\nThe Group will update the market on interim dividend payments with the half year results, following receipt of the update from the regulator and based on macroeconomic conditions at the time.\n\nThe Board remains committed to future capital returns. In 2021, the Board intends to accrue dividends and resume its progressive and sustainable ordinary dividend policy with the dividend at a higher level than 2020. As normal, the Board will give due consideration at year end to the size of the final dividend payment and any return of surplus capital in addition to the ordinary dividend, based on circumstances at the time.",

The benefit through CET1 capital is reflected through the MREL and leverage ratios.\n\nt\n\nt\n\ns",

Volatility arising in the insurance business\n\nVolatility included in the Group's statutory results before tax comprises the following:\n\n|                                   | 2020/uni00A0 \u00a3m/uni00A0   | 2019/uni00A0 \u00a3m/uni00A0   |\n|-----------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Insurance volatility              | (220)                     | 230                       |\n| Policyholder interests volatility | (74)                      | 193                       |\n| Total volatility                  | (294)                     | 423                       |\n| Insurance hedging arrangements    | 72                        | (347)                     |\n| Total                             | (222)                     | 76                        |\n\nThe Group's insurance business has policyholder liabilities that are supported by substantial holdings of investments. IFRS requires that the changes in both the value of the liabilities and investments are reflected within the income statement. The value of the liabilities does not move exactly in line with changes in the value of the investments. As the investments are substantial, movements in their value can have a significant impact on the profitability of the Group. Management believes that it is appropriate to disclose the division's results on the basis of an expected return. The impact of the actual return on these investments differing from the expected return is included within insurance volatility.\n\nInsurance volatility movements in 2020 were largely driven by significant movements in global equity markets, credit spreads and interest rate movements. Although the Group manages its exposures to equity, interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate, inflation and market movements within the Insurance division, it does so by balancing the importance of managing the impacts on both capital and earnings volatility. For example, equity market movements are hedged within Insurance on a Solvency II capital basis and whilst this also reduces the IFRS earnings exposure to equity market movements, the hedge works to a lesser extent from an IFRS earnings perspective.\n\n## 4. Changes in Insurance assumptions\n\nThe following impacts from assumption changes are included within Insurance and Wealth other operating income.\n\n|                                    | 2020/uni00A0 \u00a3m/uni00A0   | 2019/uni00A0 \u00a3m/uni00A0   |\n|------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Persistency                        | (74)                      | (67)                      |\n| Mortality, longevity and morbidity | 52                        | 164                       |\n| Expense assumptions                | (124)                     | 208                       |\n| Other                              | (5)                       | 31                        |\n| Total                              | (151)                     | 336                       |\n\nKey life and pensions assumptions and methodologies are reviewed through the annual basis review in the fourth quarter of each year, however assumptions are monitored continuously and updated when necessary.\n\nCurrent year changes reflect the macroeconomic impacts of the pandemic such as redundancies and furlough; prior year included annuitant longevity benefit from updates to the industry standard model for the projection of future mortality rates. The changes in expense assumptions reflect lower in-year new business volumes impacting average per policy administration costs, reallocation of costs between business lines and future short-term committed expenditure on specific projects. 2019 included the benefit of the change in investment management provider.\n\nThe above table excludes a c.\u00a391 million benefit from methodology changes recognised in the first half of 2020.",

In these times, the Board believes that good governance and stakeholder engagement are more important than ever and key to the Group achieving its purpose of Helping Britain Prosper and to the successful delivery of its strategy. Further information about our oversight of the Group's response to the pandemic can be found on pages 90 to 91.\n\nSet out below are some of the Group's key corporate governance activities during the year.\n\n## Stakeholder engagement\n\nWhile supporting customers and colleagues has been a key focus during these troubling times, the Board has remained aware of the need for the Group to continue to engage effectively with all its stakeholders. Meeting the Group's responsibilities and duties both to shareholders and the communities we serve is central to our purpose of Helping Britain Prosper. Details of how the Board takes account of shareholder and wider stakeholder interests in its strategic planning and decision-making processes are set out on pages 46 to 51.\n\n## Succession planning\n\nSuccession planning, both in respect of Non-Executive Directors and the executive, is a key component of good governance and was in focus during 2020 when the Board approved the appointment of a new Group Chair and Group Chief Executive. Further information about these appointment processes and succession planning can be found on/uni00A0pages/uni00A099 to 100.\n\n## Culture\n\nThe Board supports the Group's aim to develop its values-led culture. That culture needs to continue to develop to ensure that the business can adapt rapidly to a changing environment while delivering the best outcome for customers. During the year, the Board has regularly assessed and monitored the Group's progress on culture. Further information about our oversight of the Group's culture journey can be found on page 92.\n\n## Inclusion & Diversity\n\nApproaching diversity as a business issue reflects our firm view that diverse teams, working within inclusive environments, are more innovative, engaged and deliver better outcomes for our customers. The Board was pleased to endorse a Race Action plan in support of Black colleagues to drive cultural change, recruitment and progression across the Group. Further information about the Race Action plan can be found on page/uni00A025.\n\n## Climate change\n\nThe Board is conscious of the impact of climate change on the Group's business and how the Group's activities affect the environment. These topics have been discussed by the Board and a number of its Committees. Further information about the Group's new pledges to reduce the emissions that the Group finances and the carbon footprint and energy consumption of its own operations can be found on pages/uni00A020/uni00A0to/uni00A024.\n\n## Board and Committee changes\n\nThere have been a number of changes to the Board and its Committees during 2020.\n\nCatherine Woods joined the Board as a Non-Executive Director in March and I joined the Board as a Non-Executive Director in October ahead of succeeding Lord Blackwell as Chair of the Group on his retirement on 1/uni00A0January/uni00A02021.\n\nJuan/uni00A0Colomb\u00e1s retired as Chief Operating Officer in September. Juan played key roles in turning the Group around after the financial crisis and in the Group's initial response to the pandemic. Juan left with our thanks and we wish him every success for the/uni00A0future.\n\nAnita Frew retired as Deputy Chair and a Non-Executive Director at the Company's AGM in May 2020 and was succeeded by Alan/uni00A0Dickinson. As part of these changes, Nick Prettejohn took on Alan's previous role as Chair of the Board Risk Committee for a limited time. Catherine Woods succeeded Nick Prettejohn in that role on 1/uni00A0January 2021. Simon Henry retired as a Non-Executive Director in September and was succeeded as Chair of the Audit Committee by Sarah Legg. Anita and Simon both made significant contributions to the Board and left with our thanks and best wishes.\n\nFull details of the changes are set out on page/uni00A098.\n\nAlthough this is the Company's Corporate Governance Report, I would also like to take the opportunity to thank Nigel Hinshelwood, Sarah Bentley and Brendan Gilligan for their huge contribution as ongoing board members of Lloyds Bank plc and Bank of Scotland plc.\n\n## Board evaluation\n\nThe Board carried out an annual evaluation of its effectiveness during the year. This year's was an internal evaluation overseen by the Nomination and Governance Committee. The process which was undertaken, and the findings of the review, can be found on pages/uni00A094 to 95, together with information about our progress against the 2019 review/uni00A0actions.\n\n## Corporate Governance Code\n\nDuring the year under review, the UK Corporate Governance Code 2018 applied to the Company. Our statement of compliance with the Code and a summary of the requirements of the Code can be found on pages 96 to 97. Details of the Group's approach to workforce engagement and further information on this can be found on/uni00A0page 48.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRobin Budenberg\n\nChair",

This enables the Board to spend a greater proportion of its time on strategic, forward-looking agenda items. Each Board Committee comprises Non-Executive Directors only and has an experienced Chair. Each Committee Chair reports to the Board on the activities of their Committee at a subsequent Board meeting.\n\n## CHAIR INDUCTION\n\nRobin Budenberg Non-Executive Director and Chair\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRobin Budenberg, an experienced NonExecutive Director with extensive financial services experience, received a tailored induction that focused on the Group's culture and values, stakeholders, strategy, structure, operations and governance. As Chair Designate, Robin worked closely with Lord Blackwell, the Group's former Chairman, in ensuring an effective handover of responsibilities.\n\nThe management of all Committees is on the same basis as the Board. Each of the Committees' structures facilitates open discussion and debate, and ensures adequate time for members of the Committees to consider all proposals.\n\nThe Executive Directors make decisions within the parameters and principles set out in the Corporate Governance Framework. However, where appropriate, any activity can be brought to the full Board for consideration, even if the matter falls within agreed parameters. The Corporate\n\nGovernance Framework seeks to ensure that decisions are made by management under the correct authority. In the rare event of a Director being unable to attend a meeting, wherever possible the Chair of the meeting discusses the matters proposed with the Director concerned, seeking their views. The Chair subsequently represents those views to the meeting.\n\nA full schedule of matters reserved can be found at https://www.lloydsbankinggroup. com/who-we-are/group-overview/ corporate-governance.html\n\nRobin's induction included:\n\n- An Induction Pack containing key corporate documents and information relating to the Group covering aspects such as the role of a director (including relevant Group policies such as anti-bribery, conflicts of interest, expenses, gifts and hospitality and share dealing), the Board and its Committees, financials and strategy, governance, risk management, culture, shareholders and training.\n- Meetings with Senior Management and Board Directors held in October through December 2020 with all GEC members, Board Directors, the Group Company Secretary and other senior managers to discuss aspects including:\n- - The UK banking regulatory framework and corporate governance including ring-fencing requirements, the Senior Managers and Certification Regime, culture and conduct expectations and whistleblowing\n- - Strategic challenges facing the Group (including, for example, the impact of COVID-19 and the operational and conduct challenges it presents and targets and risks associated with managing the Group's response to climate change)\n- - Culture and values\n- - Group Operations\n- - Risk Management (including consideration of operational risk, conduct risk and customer outcomes)\n- - Financials (including meetings with internal and external auditors)\n- - Capital management and liquidity\n- - Inclusion & Diversity\n- - Retail Banking (including Digital Transformation) and Wealth Management\n- - Commercial Banking\n- - Scottish Widows Group Limited and the Insurance sub-group\n- - Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets plc and the Non Ring-Fenced Bank sub-group\n- - LBG Equity Investments and the Equity sub-group\n- Meetings with Major Shareholders held in October and November 2020\n\nDuring 2021, Robin will continue his programme of visits (either in person or virtually) with customers, service providers and key stakeholders across the retail, commercial and insurance sectors to build upon and deepen his understanding of the customer offering and experience. Robin will continue to develop his knowledge of the Group and its people through site visits (either in person or virtually) to the Group's regional offices as well as through focused discussions with smaller teams and individual colleagues.",

The Board has monitored the impact of the pandemic on the Group's business and its stakeholders and the Group's response as the situation evolved, seeking to ensure that the risks posed by the pandemic are mitigated. All Board meetings have been held virtually since (and including) the March Board meeting with Board and Board Committee agendas flexed to consider COVID-related matters. The Board considered frequent COVID updates from management (both formally and informally) as events unfolded covering matters such as the impact on customers, colleagues, suppliers and other stakeholders and on funding and liquidity. These pages provide an overview of how the Board has overseen the Group's response to the pandemic.\n\n## FEBRUARY\n\nGradual increase in UK confirmed cases with 23/uni00A0UK/uni00A0confirmed cases as/uni00A0at/uni00A0month end\n\n## MARCH\n\nBank of England made emergency base rate cuts, Chancellor announced furlough scheme and Prime Minister announced UK/uni00A0lockdown/uni00A0measures\n\n## APRIL\n\nUK lockdown measures continued with a three week extension announced and daily testing capacity was ramped up as the total number of recorded deaths passed 20,000\n\n## MAY\n\nThe Prime Minister announced plans to gradually ease restrictions and contact tracing systems went live in England/uni00A0and/uni00A0Scotland\n\n- 3 February the Group invoked its incident management process to co-ordinate Group activity relating to the coronavirus with the incident team providing weekly updates to the Group/uni00A0Executive Committee.\n- 19 February the Board considered an update indicating that the coronavirus outbreak was being closely monitored, including the impact on industry sectors and that a scenario exercise had been undertaken to simulate the Group's response. The Board emphasised at its Board meeting the need for contingency plans for staff protection and mass absences to be in place, the importance of maintaining IT resilience and the potential impact on the financial systems in terms of cash flow, supply chain and commodities.\n- 4 March the Board considered the first of many updates dedicated to the Group's response to the pandemic focusing on business continuity plans to ensure that the Group could continue to serve customers and co-ordination of responses to a series of localised scenarios.\n- 5 March the Board reviewed an update from the Group Corporate Treasurer on the Group's funding position and capital contingency level.\n- 26 March the Board Risk Committee discussed the Group's operational response to the pandemic and highlighted the importance of continued focus on customers and colleagues (in particular colleague mental and physical wellbeing) and regular communication to colleagues as well as contingency planning on the Group's ways of working.\n- 31 March the Board met at short notice to discuss the PRA's request to banks to suspend dividend payments and share buybacks. The Board agreed to suspend dividends and buybacks on ordinary shares until the end of 2020.\n- 8 April the Board held an informal update call to discuss the Group's response to the crisis, including business continuity planning and operational impact and to provide a briefing on customer support and business support schemes as well as on economic and financial projections.\n- 28 April the Board Risk Committee extensively discussed the impact of the pandemic at its meeting. The Audit Committee discussed at its meeting the Group's draft Q1 interim management statement (including COVID-related disclosures) and recommended that the Board approve the statement.\n- 29 April the Board discussed the Government schemes for SME, business and corporate support at its Board meeting and the Group's operational approach to implementing the schemes and approved the Group's participation in each of the CBILS, CLBILS and BBL schemes and equivalent Government backed support schemes. The Board approved the Group's Q1 interim management statement, which, given the significant change in the operating environment and economic expectations, withdrew the Group's previous guidance in light on the ongoing uncertainty caused by the pandemic.\n- 1 May the Group announced that its Chief Operating Officer and Director, Juan Colomb\u00e1s, had agreed to delay his retirement and to remain in post and on the Board until 18 September 2020 to enable him to continue to play a key role in the Group's response to the pandemic.\n- 12 May COVID-compliant AGM arrangements were announced following Board approval.\n- 19 May the Board Risk Committee discussed the impact of the pandemic with a focus on the economic impact.\n- 20 May the Board discussed a proposed multi-step transition back to the office in line with Government guidance and noted the importance of wellbeing desks for colleagues struggling to work from home and of support for customers, in particular personal customers in financial difficulty and SMEs.",

Our values and behaviours are the foundation of our culture, providing us with a clear framework to ensure we understand what we expect of each other. During 2020 the Board has sponsored a plan of initiatives led by the Group Chief Executive to accelerate our cultural change across the business, which will be crucial to the delivery of our Group strategy and to ensure we continue to respond to the evolving needs of our customers, colleagues and the communities we serve.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## January 2020\n\nThe Board endorsed a number of Culture Change Acceleration initiatives.\n\n- These focus on greater empathy, promoting empowerment and simplicity, pioneering new ways of working to remove barriers to cultural change, encouraging contrary positions to be advocated to promote rounded decision-making and reviewing the tone of our communications.\n\nThe Group Chief Executive established an executive Culture Working Group to oversee the Culture Change Acceleration initiatives.\n\n## February 2020\n\nThe Board reviewed the results of recent colleague surveys.\n\n- Performance against key metrics remained encouragingly stable given the circumstances, with scores remaining high and above UK high performing norms; areas of improvement identified with respect to bureaucracy and the requirement to continue to simplify our ways of working.\n\n## April 2020\n\nThe Board considered progress on the Culture Change Acceleration initiatives.\n\n- Colleague response to the pandemic demonstrated how the Group was able to adapt and work together to support our customers, colleagues and communities through rapid decision-making.\n- Increased two-way communication from the Group Chief Executive and broader Group Executive Committee focused on supporting colleagues has been very positively received.\n\n## June 2020\n\nThe Board received highlights from the colleague Pulse Survey designed to help leaders to understand the impact of the pandemic on colleague sentiment and behaviours.\n\n- Colleagues reported positive shifts in culture, identifying greater support, collaboration, flexibility and innovation.\n\n## July 2020\n\nThe Board evaluated progress on the Culture Change Acceleration initiatives that incorporated the impact of the pandemic.\n\n- The Board agreed that positive cultural changes triggered by the pandemic needed to be permanently embedded within the business.\n- Behavioural changes of greater empathy, open communication, collaboration, and agile decision making have helped to advance our cultural development and have complemented our ambition to accelerate culture change.\n\n## November 2020\n\nThe Board discussed a further update on the progress made across the Culture Change Acceleration initiatives and proposed 2021 Culture Change Acceleration Plan to embed improvements and accelerate transition towards our desired culture.\n\n- The Board has encouraged Group Executives and Senior Leaders to role model and pioneer new ways of working and encourage simplicity, facilitated through the rollout of new technology.\n- Empathetic tone from the top has been adopted in leaders' communications, with colleagues noticing the change and more human, transparent tone used.\n- The Board reviewed results from the recent colleague surveys where colleagues reported a more agile working environment with faster decision-making and less bureaucracy.\n\n## OVERSIGHT & DIRECTION\n\nThe Board provides oversight and direction in relation to culture activities and believes that establishing the right culture is important to ensure we are building an environment where colleagues are empowered and inspired to do the right thing for customers.\n\n## IMPACT OF COVID-19\n\nIn addition to substantial delivery across our culture change initiatives in 2020, we have also experienced positive cultural impact as a result of the many changes accelerated by the pandemic.\n\n## CULTURE HIGHLIGHTS FROM 2020\n\n- Building empathy, including the rewrite of 60 per cent of our customer communications and new training for colleagues.\n- Promoting simplicity through new principles for committees and governance.\n- New ways of working have been pioneered, tested and implemented to support and embed our culture change, enabled by the accelerated delivery and adoption of technology improvements to support remote working and collaboration.\n- Continued embedding of Your Best, our award winning approach to performance management and career development which was rolled out in 2019.\n- Building skills for the future through focus on continued learning .\n\n## KEY METRICS\n\nAll indices and metrics have risen since 2019:\n\n- Employee engagement index 81/uni00A0per cent (up 7 pts)\n- Performance excellence index 82 per cent (up 3 pts)\n- Confidence and trust index 78 per cent (up 4 pts)",

        "page_content": "## GROUP STRUCTURE AND RING-FENCING GOVERNANCE ARRANGEMENTS\n\nSince 1 January 2019 UK legislation has required large UK banks to separate personal banking services, such as current and savings accounts, from riskier activities, such as investment banking, in other parts of their business. This is called ring-fencing. The Group's structure and governance arrangements meet these regulatory requirements. Lloyds Bank plc and Bank of Scotland plc are the banks, within the Group, which have been included within the ringfence (together, the Ring-Fenced Banks). The governance structure focuses on ensuring:\n\n- Independent decision-making by the Ring-Fenced Bank Boards - on any matters where there might be a conflict between the interests of the Ring-Fenced Banks and the interests of another part of the Group.\n- Risks affecting the Ring-Fenced Banks are considered and managed from the RingFenced Banks' perspective - including maintenance of the capital adequacy and liquidity of the Ring-Fenced Banks.\n- Clear and effective governance at both Ring-Fenced Bank and Lloyds Banking Group plc level - including second and third lines of defence in respect of risk management.\n\n## CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n## INCLUSION & DIVERSITY\n\n## Board oversight of sustainability and climate-related risks\n\nThe Board has a key role in overseeing how the Group's activities affect the environment and the impact of climate change on the Group's business. The Responsible Business Committee oversees and monitors the Group's sustainability strategy and the Board Risk Committee oversees and monitors the Group's approach to managing risks arising from climate change, with both Committees reporting regularly to the Board.  Further details of the governance structure for the oversight and ownership of the Group's sustainability strategy and management of climate-related risks can be found on/uni00A0page/uni00A022.\n\n## During the year the Board approved:\n\n- an ambitious goal, working with customers, Government and the market to help reduce the emissions we finance by more than 50/uni00A0per cent by 2030, on the path to net zero by 2050 or sooner - read more on this Key Board Decision on page 50 and read more on the Metrics and Targets on page 22.\n- three new operational pledges to accelerate the Group's plan to tackle climate change - read more on pages 22 to 23.\n- the creation of a new principal risk for climate risk in the Group's Enterprise Risk Management Framework and integration of climate risk into all existing principal risks -/uni00A0read more on page 57.\n\nIn addition, in January 2021 the Board approved a Risk Appetite metric for climate risk to ensure the Group continues to progress activities at pace.\n\n## Board oversight of Inclusion & Diversity initiatives\n\nThe Board believes an inclusive and diverse workforce is vital to the Group's success, and values the differences each colleague brings to their role, making the Group stronger and better able to meet the needs of our customers.\n\nIn support of this the Board approved in July 2020 the introduction of our Race Action plan, designed to drive racerelated cultural change, recruitment and progression across the Group.\n\nThe Board also approved a target to increase Black representation in senior roles to at least 3 per cent by 2025. This complemented the Group's broader 2018 Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic representation targets of 10 per/uni00A0cent overall, and 8 per cent at senior roles.\n\n## More detail\n\nChampioning Inclusion & Diversity Read more on pages 25 to 26 Board Diversity Policy Read more on page 100\n\n## WORKFORCE ENGAGEMENT\n\nPlease refer to page 48 for details of how the Board engages with the Group's workforce and why the Board considers these arrangements to be effective.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Group Structure\n\nThe subsidiaries of the Group are structured into the following sub-groups under Lloyds/uni00A0Banking Group plc providing effective governance for the business undertaken in each sub-group:\n\n- Ring-Fenced Banks sub-group containing Lloyds Bank plc and Bank of Scotland plc (including the Halifax and MBNA businesses), serving both their UK personal and commercial customers.\n- Non Ring-Fenced Bank sub-group - Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets plc which provides products and services to Group customers that are not allowed within the ring-fence as well as serving Financial Institutions customers and holding certain of the Group's subsidiaries and branches outside the UK.\n\nThe Board Risk Committee receives regular detailed updates regarding the Group's climate risk management and key developments and will continue to closely monitor climate change and sustainability risks, looking at the impact on both the Group and our customers, and the delivery of/uni00A0the Task Force on Climate-related Financial/uni00A0Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations and other commitments.\n\nThe Audit Committee considers climaterelated/uni00A0disclosures in the Group's financial statements.\n\n## More detail\n\nGroup's environmental and social progress\n\nRead more on pages 20 to 31 and in our 2020 Lloyds Banking Group\n\n- ESG/uni00A0Report.\n\nClimate change impacts are becoming ever clearer and need urgent action.

Performance evaluation of the Chair is carried out by the Non-Executive Directors, led by the Senior Independent Director, taking into account the views of the Executive/uni00A0Directors.\n\n## INTERNAL EVALUATION PROCESS\n\n## November 2020\n\nDetailed online questionnaire issued to all Directors by the Group Company Secretary.\n\n## November 2020 to January/uni00A02021\n\nIndividual meetings held between each Director and the Group Company Secretary or Corporate Governance Director to discuss responses and opportunity for Directors to raise any other matters concerning the Board or its Committees.\n\nThe Board is in the final year of the three year evaluation cycle recommended by the UK Corporate Governance Code 2018. An external evaluation was last conducted in 2018, facilitated by Egon Zehnder 1 , an external board review specialist, with internal evaluations being carried out in 2020 and 2019. The 2021 evaluation is currently expected to be externally facilitated, with the Nomination and Governance Committee beginning the search process for the external facilitators in the due course.\n\n## 2020 evaluation of the Board's performance\n\nThe 2020 evaluation was conducted internally between November 2020 and January 2021 by the Group Company Secretary, and was overseen by the Nomination and Governance Committee.\n\nThe 2020 review sought the Directors' views on a range of topics including: strategy; planning and performance; risk and control; Board composition and size; balance of\n\n## December 2020 to January/uni00A02021\n\nskills, experience and knowledge; diversity; culture; how members work together, and with executive management, to achieve objectives; the Board's calendar and agenda; the quality and timeliness of information; and support for Directors and Committees. The topics were selected by the Chair of the Nomination and Governance Committee and the Group Company Secretary as being the most pertinent when considering the Board's effectiveness, and also referenced previous years' topics to track trends and improvements.\n\nIf Directors have concerns about the Company or a proposed action which cannot be resolved, their concerns are recorded in the Board minutes. Also on resignation, Non-Executive Directors are encouraged to provide a written statement of any concerns to the Chair, for circulation to the Board. No such concerns were raised in 2020 and up to the date of this report.\n\n## January 2021\n\nReport prepared by the Group Company Secretary based on the questionnaire results and matters raised in individual meetings.\n\nDraft report discussed by the Group Company Secretary with the Chair.\n\nFinal report reviewed at a meeting of the Board, following its consideration by the Nomination and Governance Committee.\n\n## HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE 2020 BOARD EVALUATION\n\nThe evaluation concluded that the performance of the Board, its Committees, the Chair and each of the Directors continues to be effective. All Directors demonstrated commitment to their roles and contributed effectively. The Board is also regarded as very able, collegiate and well-run, with an open and supportive culture and strong governance relating to risks and controls and managing the regulatory requirements of the ring-fencing regime.\n\nThe key findings and areas for consideration include the following:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Theme                         | Findings                                                                  | Areas for consideration                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Board  discussion and  debate | Call for further strategic, forward-looking discussion.                   | Further refine Board and Committee meetings in terms  of timings, agendas, papers and discussions to permit  greater strategic and forward-looking discussion and  debate.                                                          |\n| Board papers                  | Improve quality of Board papers.                                          | Sharpen the focus of papers to:    show more of the thinking behind proposals, including  trade-offs and options considered and give unvarnished  accounts, always sharing bad news as well as good.    be less formal and shorter. |\n| Training                      | Further formal technical training for members of Boards   and Committees. | To leverage internal and external expertise, as well  as to widen existing Non-Executive Director training  curriculum, both online and (when conditions permit) in  person.                                                        |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1  At the time of the 2018 review Egon Zehnder provided certain Board and senior management level services from time to time, including in respect of succession planning as detailed on page 67 of the 2018 Annual Report and Accounts, otherwise Egon Zehnder had no other connection with the Group.",

Enhancements to Board and Committee meeting technology, tools and procedures were accelerated as a result of the pandemic, with considerable success and without impact on the twin focus on streamlining meeting agendas, papers and presentations to allow deeper strategic discussion by the Board.

In addition, the Non-Executive Director training curriculum was  delivered online for the majority of the/uni00A0year. | Virtual Board  and Committee  meetings |\n\n## Internal control Board responsibility\n\nThe Board is responsible for the Group's risk management and internal control systems, which are designed to facilitate effective and efficient operations and to ensure the quality and integrity of internal and external reporting and compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and for the determination of the nature and extent of the principal risks the Group is willing to take in order to achieve its strategy. The Directors and senior management are committed to maintaining a robust control framework as the foundation for the delivery of effective risk management. The Directors acknowledge their responsibilities in relation to the Group's risk management and internal control systems and for reviewing their effectiveness.\n\nIn establishing and reviewing the risk management and internal control systems, the Directors carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks facing the Company, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity and reputation, the likelihood of a risk event occurring and the costs of control. The process for identification, evaluation and management of the emerging and principal risks faced by the Group is integrated into the Group's overall framework for risk governance. The risk identification, evaluation and management process also identifies whether the controls in place result in an acceptable level of risk. At Group level, a consolidated risk report and risk appetite\n\ndashboard are reviewed and regularly debated by the Group Risk Committee, Board/uni00A0Risk Committee and the Board to ensure that they are satisfied with the overall risk profile, risk accountabilities and mitigating actions. The report and dashboard provide a monthly view of the Group's overall risk profile, key risks and management actions, together with performance against risk appetite and an assessment of emerging risks which could affect the Group's performance over the life of the operating plan. Information regarding the main features of the internal control and risk management systems in relation to the financial reporting process is provided within the risk management report on pages/uni00A0143 to 204. The Board concluded that the Group's risk management arrangements are adequate to provide assurance that the risk management systems put in place are suitable with regard to the Group's profile and strategy.\n\n## Control effectiveness review\n\nAll key controls are recorded and assessed on a regular basis, either in response to triggers or at a minimum annually. Control assessments consider both the adequacy of the design and operating effectiveness. Where a control is not effective, the root cause is established and action plans implemented to improve control design or performance. Control Effectiveness against all residual risks is reported and monitored via the monthly Consolidated Risk Report (CRR). The CRR is reviewed and independently challenged by the Risk Division and provided to the Risk Division Executive Committee and Group\n\nRisk Committee. On an annual basis, a point in time assessment is made for control effectiveness against each risk category and across the 4 sub-groups. The CRR data is the primary source used for this point in time assessment and a year on year comparison on control effectiveness is reported to the Board.\n\n## Reviews by the Board\n\nThe effectiveness of the risk management and internal control systems is reviewed regularly by the Board and the Audit/uni00A0Committee, which also receive reports of reviews undertaken by the Risk Division and Group Internal Audit. The Audit Committee receives reports from the Company's auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (which include details of significant internal control matters that they have identified), and has a discussion with the auditor at least once a year without executives present, to ensure that there are no unresolved issues of concern.\n\nThe Group's risk management and internal control systems are regularly reviewed by the Board and are consistent with the Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and Business Reporting issued by the Financial Reporting Council and compliant with the requirements of CRD IV. They have been in place for the year under review and up to the date of the approval of the annual report. The Group has determined a pathway to compliance with BCBS 239 risk data aggregation and risk reporting requirements and continues to actively manage enhancements.",

        "page_content": "## Complying with the UK Corporate Governance Code 2018\n\nThe UK Corporate Governance Code 2018 (the 'Code') applied to the financial year ended 31 December 2020. The Company confirms that it applied the principles and complied with all the provisions of the Code throughout the year except in relation to that part of provision 36 that provides that the remuneration committee should develop a formal policy for post-employment shareholding requirements encompassing both unvested and vested shares and, in one instance, in relation to that part of provision 15 that provides that additional external appointments should not be undertaken without prior approval of the Board. In relation to provision 36, while the Remuneration Committee has not introduced a formal post-employment shareholding policy, the existing reward structure ensures that Executive Directors will continue to meet the Group's shareholding requirements for a minimum of two years after leaving the Group. On this basis, the Group believes that it already complies with best practice and with the spirit of provision 36 notwithstanding the fact that a specific formal policy has not been introduced. Please refer to the Directors' Remuneration Policy which is set out in the 2019 annual report and accounts (pages 115 to 123) which is available at: www.lloydsbankinggroup.com/investors/annual-report/ annual-report-archive.html for a more detailed explanation of the Group's approach to post-employment shareholding requirements. In relation to provision 15, the Chair approved Nick Prettejohn taking on the role of Chairman of the charity, Prisoners Abroad, but due to timing constraints, the Board did not approve the appointment in advance but ratified it after Nick Prettejohn had taken on the role. The role is not considered a significant appointment for the purposes of provision 15 of the Code.\n\nThe Code is publicly available at www.frc.org.uk. This page and the following page, together with the rest of the Corporate Governance Report, explain and illustrate how we have applied the principles and related provisions of the Code during the year. The alphabetical references in the paragraphs below correspond to the principles, and related provisions, of the Code. The Group has adopted the UK Finance Code for Financial Reporting Disclosure and its 2020 financial statements have been prepared in compliance with its principles.\n\n## 1.

The Group Company Secretary maintains  the Group's Corporate Governance Framework and organises Directors' induction and training. Both the  appointment and removal of the Group Company Secretary is a matter for the Board as a whole.                                                                                                                                                                              |\n\n- A. The Group is led by an effective, committed Board, which is collectively responsible for the long-term, sustainable success of the Group, ensuring due regard is paid to the interests of the Group's stakeholders, with its effectiveness assessed annually, discussed further on page 94 to 95. The Group's Corporate Governance Framework, which is reviewed annually by the Board, sets out the key decisions and matters reserved for the Board's approval, which includes matters relating to the Group's long-term strategy and priorities. Further details of the Corporate Governance Framework can be found on page 99.\n- B. The Board assumes responsibility for establishing the purpose of the Company, setting its strategy, establishing its culture, and determining the values to be observed in achieving that strategy. Central to this is the Company's role as a trusted and responsible business, with the Board's Responsible Business Committee overseeing the Group's ambitions in this regard. The Group's approach to acting as a responsible business is discussed in detail on pages 20 to 31, and in the report of the Responsible Business Committee on page 110.\n- C. The Board retains ultimate responsibility for ensuring adequate resource is available to meet agreed objectives and strategy, and ensures such resources are responsibly and effectively deployed. The effective management of risk is central to the Company's strategy, supported by the Group's enterprise risk management framework, as discussed in the risk management report on pages 144 to 204.\n- D. The Board recognises that engaging with and acting on the needs of the Group's stakeholders is key to achieving the strategy and long-term objectives of the Company. Engagement with stakeholders, across the organisation and including that of the Board, is discussed further on pages 46 to 51, and in the Directors' statement of compliance with their duties under section 172 of the Companies Act 2006, also on pages/uni00A046 to 51. A final summary of the impact of the voting outcomes at the 2020 AGM for the Group's Directors' Remuneration Policy and Long Term Share Plan has had on the decisions the Board has taken and the actions or resolutions now proposed are set out on pages 118 and 119.\n- E. All policy and practice relating to Group colleagues is developed and implemented in a way which is consistent with the Group's purpose and values, with the Board receiving regular updates on matters relevant to colleagues. The Board has appointed Alan Dickinson as its whistleblowing champion, with responsibility for overseeing the integrity, independence and effectiveness of the Group's whistleblowing procedures. In addition, the Audit Committee reviews reports on whistleblowing to ensure there are arrangements in place which colleagues can use in confidence to report relevant concerns, as discussed on page 104 and reports on its review to the Board.",

The Chair has overall responsibility for the leadership of the Board and for ensuring its effectiveness in all aspects of its operation. These responsibilities are formalised within the Corporate Governance Framework. Lord Blackwell and Robin Budenberg were both independent on appointment.\n- G. The balance of skills, experience, independence and knowledge on the Board is the responsibility of the Nomination and Governance Committee, and is reviewed annually or whenever appointments are considered. Having the right balance of skills and experience helps to ensure Directors discharge their duties effectively. The Nomination and Governance Committee monitors whether there are any relationships or circumstances which may affect a Director's independence. Following the most recent review of independence, the Committee concluded that all Non-Executive Directors are independent in character and judgement, as shown on page/uni00A099. As of 1 February 2021, Sara Weller had spent nine years on the Board and will retire at the AGM in May. In relation to the period from 1/uni00A0February 2021, being the ninth anniversary of Sara Weller's appointment to the Board, to retirement at the AGM in May, the Board considered and agreed the continuing independence of Sara as a Non-Executive Director of the Company for that period. The decision was based on a number of factors including the continued challenge and oversight Sara provides in the role and the other external roles she holds, while noting the benefits of enabling the transition of her responsibilities as Chair of the Responsible Business Committee during this short period. More information on the annual Board evaluation can be found on pages 94 to 95 and information on the Board Diversity Policy can be found on page 100.\n- H. Non-Executive Directors are advised of time commitments prior to their appointment and are required to devote such time as is necessary to discharge their duties effectively. The time commitments of the Directors are considered by the Board on appointment and annually thereafter, and, following the most recent review, the Board is satisfied there are no directors whose time commitments are considered to be a matter for concern. External appointments, which may affect existing time commitments relevant to the Board, must be agreed with the Chair, and prior Board approval must be obtained before taking on any new external appointments. The Chair approved Nick Prettejohn taking on the role of Chairman of the charity, Prisoners Abroad, but due to timing constraints, the Board did not approve the appointment in advance but ratified it after Nick Prettejohn took on the role. The role is not considered a significant appointment. During 2020, Stuart Sinclair was appointed a Non-Executive Director and subsequently Chairman of each of International Personal Finance plc and Willis Limited and Sara Weller a Non-Executive Director of BT/uni00A0Group plc. The Board considered the time commitments and potential conflicts involved in Stuart and Sara taking up these significant roles prior to them accepting the roles and were satisfied that they would continue to have sufficient time to commit to their respective Group Board and Committee appointments. No Executive Director has taken up more than one Non-Executive Director role at a FTSE100 company or taken up the chair of such a company. More information on Directors' attendance at meetings can be found on page 86.\n- I. The Chair, supported by the Group Company Secretary, ensures that Board members receive appropriate and timely information. The Group provides access, at its expense, to the services of independent professional advisers in order to assist Directors in their role. Board Committees are also provided with sufficient resources to discharge their duties.\n\n## 3. Composition, Succession and Evaluation\n\n- J. The process for Board appointments is led by the Nomination and Governance Committee, which makes recommendations to the Board. Open advertising and/or an external search consultancy is used for the appointment of the Chair and Non-Executive Directors. More details about the appointment process for the Chair and Group Chief Executive and succession planning can be found on pages 98, 99 and 100. More information about the work of the Nomination and Governance Committee can be found on pages 98 to 100.\n- K. The Chair leads the training and development of Directors and the Board regularly reviews and agrees with each Director their individual and combined training and development needs. The Chair personally ensures that on appointment each Director receives a full, formal and tailored induction. The emphasis is on ensuring the induction brings the business and its issues alive, taking account of the specific role the Director has been appointed to fulfil and their skills and experience to date. More information on the new Chair's tailored induction programme can be found on page 87. Directors who take on or change roles during the year attend induction meetings in respect of those new/uni00A0roles.\n\nAt the 2021 AGM all Directors will seek re-election or election save for Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, who will be stepping down with effect from 30 April 2021 and Sara Weller, who will be stepping down at the 2021 AGM. The Board believes that all Directors continue to be effective and committed to their roles.\n\n- L. An internally facilitated Board evaluation was completed in 2020, with an externally facilitated evaluation last having taken place in 2018. Individual evaluation is carried out by the Chair on behalf of the Board. Performance evaluation of the Chair is carried out by the Non-Executive Directors, led by the Senior Independent Director, taking into account the views of the Executive Directors. More information on the 2020 Board evaluation can be found on pages 94 to 95, along with the findings, actions, and progress made during the year.\n\n## 4. Audit, Risk and Internal Control\n\n- M. The Board has delegated a number of responsibilities to the Audit Committee, including oversight of financial reporting processes, the effectiveness of internal controls and the risk management framework, whistleblowing arrangements and the work undertaken by the external and internal auditors. The Audit Committee reports regularly to the Board on its activities, and its report for 2020, confirming how it has discharged its duties can be found on pages 101 to 104.\n- N. Requirements that the Annual Report is fair, balanced and understandable are considered throughout the drafting and reviewing process and the Board has concluded that the 2020 Annual Report meets this requirement. The Board is supported in this by its Audit Committee and a sign off process involving different sections of the annual report being approved for inclusion by senior management, with additional review by the Group Disclosure Committee. The Directors' and Auditor's Statements of Responsibility can be found on page 114 and page 206 respectively. Related information on the Company's business model and strategy can be found on pages 1 to 59.\n- O. The Board is responsible for the Group's risk management and internal controls systems, including the determination of the nature and extent of risk the Company is willing to take. Risk is further managed through the Board approved Risk Control Framework, as discussed in the risk management report on pages 144 to 204. The Audit Committee assumes further responsibility for the effectiveness of internal controls, with the Board Risk Committee assuming responsibility for the review of the risk culture of the Group, ensuring the correct 'tone from the top' in respect of risk management. The related Directors' Viability Statement can be found on pages 112 to 113 and confirmation that the business is a going concern can be found on page 113.\n\n## 5. Remuneration\n\n- P. The Group is committed to offering all colleagues a reward package that is competitive, performance-driven and fair and its Remuneration Policy is designed to promote the long-term and sustainable success of the Company. The Directors' Remuneration Report on pages 115 to 142 provides further details regarding the remuneration of Directors. The current Remuneration Policy can be found in the 2019 Annual Report and Accounts and remains unchanged since last approved by shareholders at the 2020 AGM.\n- Q. The Remuneration Committee seeks to ensure all remuneration policy, including that relevant to executive remuneration, is fair and transparent. The work of the Remuneration Committee during the year is discussed further in its report on page 115.\n- R. The Remuneration Policy seeks to ensure all remuneration decisions made by Directors fully consider the wider circumstances as relevant to that decision, including, but not limited to, individual performance.

As the new Chair of the Nomination and Governance Committee (the 'Committee'), and the Group, what do you see as being the Board's key strengths?\n\nCollectively the Board has excellent breadth and depth of experience and strong commitment to the Group's strategic aims. This commitment has helped to ensure that the Group plays a successful role in Helping Britain Prosper and, more immediately, recovering from the pandemic.\n\n## Q. How will your appointment, and that of the new Group Chief Executive, further complement these qualities?\n\nAt the time of my appointment, Lord Blackwell commented on my knowledge of the Group combined with broad experience in both financial services and other strategic roles. This, together with Charlie Nunn's vision for the Group, passion and commitment to our purpose of Helping Britain Recover and Prosper, and his track record which brings world class operational, technology and strategic expertise, will all help build on the strengths of the existing management team in continuing to drive forward the strategic transformation of the Group.\n\n## Q. What are the key areas of focus for the Committee in 2021?\n\nGiven the remit of the Committee, the core areas of focus for 2021 will continue to be succession planning at both Board and executive level, managing Board (and Committee) composition and skills, driving diversity and inclusion at Board level and beyond, and overseeing Board effectiveness.\n\n## Key activities in 2020\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Succession planning and Board and executive changes\n- Board effectiveness and training\n- Corporate governance review\n- Diversity and inclusion\n\n## Introduction\n\nIn the months since my appointment to the Board and, more recently, as Chair of the Committee I have been impressed by the level of commitment shown by Board members, the executive and colleagues in delivery of the Group's aims, and support for customers and each other during these unprecedented times. These qualities, together with our focus on diverse teams and inclusive environments, will help to drive the continued transformation of the Group and the best outcomes for customers.\n\n## Succession planning\n\nMy introduction to the Governance Report on page 81 highlighted  a number of changes to the Board and its Committees during the year; all of these have been overseen by the Committee. Strong succession planning has been a key focus in helping to ensure the appropriate mix of skills, experience and backgrounds has continued. Further details on the Committee's approach to succession planning can be found on page 100.\n\nConsideration was given to planned Board retirements and the impact of these on membership of the Board and its Committees. The Committee's ongoing review of the structure, size and composition of the Board and its Committees helps ensure that the appropriate mix of knowledge, skills, experience and diversity is maintained. A number of other changes, beyond those set out below, have also been made to the membership of Board Committees during the year as a result of this ongoing review.\n\nAs indicated in last year's report, Catherine Woods formally joined the Board on 1 March 2020, as a Non-Executive Director. Anita Frew retired from the Board at the AGM in May as planned, with Alan Dickinson succeeding her as Deputy Chair in addition to his existing role of Senior Independent Director. Nick Prettejohn temporarily took on Alan's role as Chair of the Board Risk Committee, with this role having now passed to Catherine Woods with effect from 1 January 2021. Simon/uni00A0Henry retired as a Non-Executive Director in September, with Simon's role as Audit Committee Chair passing to Sarah Legg. The experience which Catherine and Sarah bring to the Board, made them ideal candidates to Chair these important Committees. As announced on 29 January 2021, Sara Weller will retire from the Board, and as Chair of the Responsible Business Committee, at the AGM in May 2021. Amanda Mackenzie will take on the role of Chair of the Responsible Business Committee following Sara's retirement.\n\nAfter kindly agreeing to delay his departure, allowing him to continue to play a key role in the Group's response to the pandemic, Juan Colomb\u00e1s retired from his role as the Chief Operating Officer with effect from 18/uni00A0September 2020.\n\nAs also discussed in last year's report, Lord Blackwell announced his plan to retire as Group Chairman in 2021. The Committee undertook a thorough search process which culminated in my appointment as his successor. I was appointed as a Non-Executive Director effective from 1/uni00A0October 2020. Subsequently, Lord Blackwell's retirement and my succession both as Group Chair and Chair of the Committee, became effective on 1 January 2021.\n\nAlongside confirmation of my appointment, Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio's decision to step down as Group Chief Executive in 2021 was also announced. The Committee undertook a similarly thorough process to identify Ant\u00f3nio's successor, culminating in the decision to appoint Charlie/uni00A0Nunn as Group Chief Executive. Subject to regulatory approval, Charlie will join the Board in August 2021. As announced on 1/uni00A0December 2020 Ant\u00f3nio will step down from his role on 30/uni00A0April 2021. The Board has agreed that during any interim period between Ant\u00f3nio stepping down and Charlie joining the Board, William/uni00A0Chalmers, Chief Financial Officer will, subject to regulatory approval, take on the role of acting Group Chief Executive in addition to his ongoing responsibilities, with a range of measures put in place to provide appropriate support. Further details of the selection process for these appointments can be found on page/uni00A099.\n\nIn addition to a focus on succession planning at Board level, the Committee also has a strong focus on succession planning at an executive level. The Committee continues to consider the overall health of the executive talent pipeline, together with detailed executive succession planning. Key considerations include, for example, cultural and strategic capabilities which will help ensure the continued transformation of the Group and the delivery of its strategic aims.\n\n## Board effectiveness and training\n\nAs referred to in my introduction to the Governance Report on page 81, this year an internal Board Evaluation has been undertaken, overseen by the Committee. The Committee also considered, and recommended to the Board, actions arising from the previous internal review undertaken in 2019. Full details are provided on pages/uni00A094 and 95. The 2021 Board Evaluation is currently expected to be facilitated externally, in line with the recommended approach set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code.\n\nAnnually, as part of the Board Evaluation, the Committee also undertakes a review of its own effectiveness. The findings of this review, which were considered by the Committee at its meeting in January 2021, found that the Committee had met its key objectives and carried out its responsibilities effectively.",

Learning and engagement opportunities have been undertaken by all Non-Executive Directors in relation to material aspects of the Group's business.\n\n## Independence and time commitments\n\nBased on its assessment for 2020, the Committee is satisfied that, throughout the year, all Non-Executive Directors remained independent 1 in character and judgement. The Committee, and the Board, gave specific consideration to Sara Weller's continuing independence as detailed on page 97.\n\nIn recommending Directors for election and re-election at the AGM, the Committee has reviewed the performance of each Non-Executive Director and their ability to continue meeting the time commitments required, taking into consideration individual capabilities, skills and experiences and any potential conflicts of interest that have been disclosed. The external roles held by all Directors were considered to be appropriate. Fuller details of any conflicts of interest can be found on page 111.\n\n## The Group's Corporate Governance Framework\n\nThe annual review of the Corporate Governance Framework was undertaken during the year. There were no material changes, with updates this year focusing on simplification and clarity, together with various other minor amendments, and revision of committee terms of reference driven by recommended best practice and the aim of maintaining good governance standards.\n\nAs part of its broader governance responsibilities, the Committee considered regular updates on developments in corporate governance, including BEIS and FRC guidance on shareholder meetings and FRC views on corporate reporting, and also considered correspondence with shareholders.\n\n## UK Corporate Governance Code\n\nThe Company applied the UK Corporate Governance Code 2018 for the year-ending 31 December 2020 and complied with all the provisions with two exceptions. A detailed summary setting out the Company's compliance, together with details of these exceptions, can be found on pages 96 and 97.\n\n## Committee purpose and responsibilities\n\nThe purpose of the Committee is to keep the Board's governance, composition, skills, experience, knowledge, independence and succession arrangements under review and to make appropriate recommendations to the Board to ensure the Company's arrangements are consistent with the highest corporate governance standards.\n\nThe Committee reports to the Board on how it discharges its responsibilities and makes recommendations to the Board, all of which have been accepted during the year. The Committee's terms of reference can be found at www.lloydsbankinggroup.com/who-weare/group-overview/corporate-governance. html\n\n## Appointment Process - Chair and Group Chief Executive\n\nFollowing the announcement of Lord Blackwell's intention to retire, the Board initiated a search process at the start of 2020, led by the Senior Independent Director, to identify his successor. Following a competitive tender process, Heidrick & Struggles were appointed to assist the Board in identifying a diverse list of potential candidates with the experience and personal qualities to become Chair. The Senior Independent Director kept the Board and the Committee informed on progress, with regular discussions being held throughout. A long list of candidates was considered and narrowed down to a diverse short list. All interested candidates had preliminary meetings with the Senior Independent Director and were interviewed by Heidrick & Struggles. Further detailed consideration of each of the interested candidates led to a final shortlist of three for interview, with each being scored and assessed formally against defined competencies. Robin Budenberg was identified as the preferred candidate on the basis of his broad experience in both financial services and other strategic\n\nadvisory roles, combined with his knowledge of the Group and leadership qualities. Lord Blackwell was not involved in the selection or appointment of his successor.\n\nOnce the Chair succession was in place, Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio informed the Board of his intention to step down as Group Chief Executive during 2021. Timing of this would help support a smooth transition and allow the new Group Chief Executive to work with the new Chair in the next stage of the Group's development and transformation. The Committee delegated authority to the (now former) Chairman and Deputy Chair, working closely with Robin Budenberg, to begin the process. After a competitive tender process Russell Reynolds were appointed, with an instruction to produce a diverse list of individuals with the experience and personal qualities to become Group Chief Executive.  Emphasis was also placed on strategic capabilities and relevant experience to lead the organisation through the significant technology transformation currently in progress. A long list of potential candidates was identified\n\n## Committee composition, skills and experience\n\nTo ensure a broad representation of experienced and independent Directors, membership of the Committee currently comprises the Chair, Deputy Chair (who is also the Senior Independent Director), the Chairs of each of the Remuneration Committee and the Responsible Business Committee, and the Chair of our Insurance sub-group.\n\nThe Group Chief Executive attends meetings as appropriate. Details of Committee membership and meeting attendance can be found on page 86.\n\nThe Group's commitment to building a diverse Board and workforce will help support the continuing transformation of the Group and strengthen the embedding of cultural change.\n\n## Robin Budenberg\n\nChair, Nomination and Governance Committee\n\nand narrowed down to an initial short list with diverse backgrounds, characteristics and experience. A series of rounds of interviews led to a final shortlist of three, who were further considered by Committee members. Following this process, the Committee recommended to the Board that Charlie Nunn be appointed as the new Group Chief Executive, recognising the particular strengths that Mr. Nunn would bring to the role including his world class operational, technology and strategic expertise, combined with his passion for and commitment to the Group's purpose and strategic aims.\n\nThroughout each of these formal, rigorous and transparent appointment processes, consideration was given to a broad range of factors such as merit and objective criteria, consideration of diversity of gender, social and ethnic backgrounds, cognitive and personal strengths, and the Group's future strategic direction. Neither search firm has any further connection with the Group or individual Directors beyond undertaking search and recruitment related activity.",

With the appointment of a new Chair and the announcement of a new Group Chief Executive during the year, this has been a particular area of focus for the Committee. The arrangements being put in place to cover any interim period before Charlie Nunn joins the Group help illustrate how effective succession planning can be used to address short-term requirements. Effective succession planning also contributes to the ability of the Group to deliver on its strategic objectives by ensuring the desired mix of skills and experience of Board members now and in the future. The Board is also committed to recognising and nurturing talent within the executive and management levels across the Group to ensure that the Group creates opportunities to develop current and future leaders.\n\nThe Committee supports the Chair in keeping the composition of the Board and its Committees under regular review and in leading the appointment process for\n\n## Board Diversity Policy\n\nThe Board Diversity Policy (the 'Policy') sets out the Board's approach to diversity and provides a high level indication of the Board's approach to inclusion and diversity in senior management roles which is governed in greater detail through the Group's policies.\n\nThe Board places great emphasis on ensuring that its membership reflects diversity in its broadest sense. Consideration is given to the combination of demographics, skills, experience, race, age, gender, educational and professional background and other relevant personal attributes on the Board to provide the range of perspectives, insights and challenge needed to support good decision-making.\n\nNew appointments are made on merit, taking account of the specific skills and experience, independence and knowledge needed to ensure a rounded Board and the diverse benefits each candidate can bring to the overall Board composition.\n\nObjectives for achieving Board diversity may be set on a regular basis. In January 2021 the Board considered and approved updates to aspirations set out in the Board Diversity Policy relating to gender diversity and the number of senior roles held by Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic executives.\n\nnominations to the Board. This helps ensure continued focus on increasing the overall diversity of the Board, and capacity for future succession planning. The appointment process for the new Chair and Group Chief Executive, set out on the previous page, helps illustrate how the appointment process works in practice.\n\nCentral to the Group's approach to succession planning is an ongoing assessment, led by the Chair, of the collective Board's technical and governance skill set. From this, the Chair creates a Board skills matrix which is used to track the Board's strengths and identify any gaps in the desired collective skills profile of the Board. Various factors are taken into consideration such as the Group's future strategic direction, and helping  ensure due weight is given to diversity in its broadest sense. The skills matrix is considered in the appointment of all Board members. The Group's diversity commitments and outcomes of the annual Board Evaluation process are also taken into consideration.\n\nOn gender diversity the Board is committed to maintaining at least three female Board members and over time will aim to reach 50/uni00A0per cent female representation on the Board to match the 50 per cent ambition that the Group has set for female senior roles.\n\nReflecting these aspirations, the Board will aim to continue to meet the HamptonAlexander objective of 33 per cent female representation. Female representation on the Board is currently 36.4 per cent (based on 4/uni00A0female Directors and 7 male Directors).\n\nThe Group has also set a target of 13/uni00A0per cent of senior roles to be held by Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic executives by 2025. The Board currently meets, and will aim to continue to meet, the objectives of the Parker review with at least one Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic Board member.\n\nThe Board places high emphasis on ensuring the development of diversity in senior management roles within the Group and supports and oversees the Group's ambition of achieving 50 per cent of senior roles held by female executives by 2025, and of 13/uni00A0per/uni00A0cent of senior roles held by Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic executives by 2025. This is underpinned by a range of policies within the Group to help provide mentoring and development opportunities for female and Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic executives\n\nThe role of succession planning in promoting diversity is fully recognised. The Group has a range of policies which promote the engagement of under-represented groups within the business in order to build a diverse talent pipeline.\n\nThe Committee also continued to consider the adequacy of succession arrangements for key senior management roles. During the year, additional focus was given to development plans together with cultural and capability assessments, which will help nurture talent and drive cultural transformation across the Group, and support the ongoing delivery of the Group's strategy.\n\nThe Chair is responsible for developing and maintaining a succession plan for the Group Chief Executive who is, in turn, primarily responsible for developing and maintaining succession plans for key leadership positions in the senior executive team.\n\nand to ensure unbiased career progression opportunities. Progress on this objective is monitored by the Board and built into its assessment of executive performance.\n\nAs at 31 December 2020, female representation within Group Executive Committee and their direct reports was 32.3/uni00A0per cent in total (with 26.7 per cent for Group Executive Committee and 33.0/uni00A0per/uni00A0cent for their direct reports ). Female representation across all senior roles was 37.0/uni00A0per cent, and Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic representation in senior roles was 7.7/uni00A0per cent. The Group also launched its Race Action plan during 2020, which aims to drive cultural change, recruitment and progression across the Group, including a new public goal to increase Black representation in senior roles from 0.6 per cent to at least 3 per cent by 2025, aligning the Group with the overall UK labour market. Further details of the Race Action plan, and the Group's further achievements in championing inclusion and diversity in its widest sense can be found on pages 25.\n\nA copy of the Policy is available on our website at www.lloydsbankinggroup.com/who-weare/responsible-business.html and further information on the Board's broader approach to diversity and inclusion as part of its strategic priorities, and continued investment in being a leading inclusive employer can be found on pages 25 and 26.",

How has the work of the Audit Committee (the 'Committee') supported the Group's response to the pandemic?\n\nHaving effective controls is invaluable in times such as these, ensuring we mitigate the impacts of the pandemic wherever it's possible to do so. The Committee's work in this regard has therefore been particularly important. This, along with our review of the implications of the pandemic from a disclosure perspective, have been key contributions to the considerable Group wide efforts to respond to the crisis.\n\n## Q. What have been the other significant challenges the Committee has faced this year?\n\nThe Committee has spent a significant amount of time considering the key judgements in respect of financial reporting matters, including economic assumptions. Our oversight of the control environment and the Group's internal and external auditors has had the added challenge of remote working, where the response has been both agile and adaptive. The Committee has continued to oversee the transition from our existing external auditor to our new external auditors, Deloitte, with focus on the 2021 audit plan in support of a smooth transition.\n\n## Q. What do you see as the Committee's key priorities and challenges in the coming year?\n\nAssessing the ongoing impact of the pandemic on the Group's reporting and controls will, of course, continue to be a priority in 2021. In addition to the Committee's standing obligations, I expect there to be increased focus on the evolving areas of climate-related disclosures and audit reform. Continuous improvement in our ability to report in an agile and well-controlled manner will also be a priority.\n\n## Introduction\n\nI am pleased to report, for the first time since assuming the role of Chair of the Audit Committee, on how the Committee has discharged its responsibilities during what has and continues to be very challenging times. I assumed the role of Chair of the Committee in October 2020, following a comprehensive handover of responsibilities from Simon\n\n## Key activities in 2020\n\n- Responding to the pandemic, including assessing its impact on loan loss provisions, and other key aspects of the Group's financial reporting.\n- Ensuring the effectiveness of the Group's internal control systems, and of the Group's Internal Audit function, key in delivering the Group's strategic priorities.\n- Overseeing the important relationship with the Group's external auditor, and ensuring a smooth transition to our new external auditor, Deloitte.\n\nHenry to myself, and I would like to take the opportunity to note my thanks to Simon on behalf of the Board and the Company for his excellent work in chairing the Committee over the preceding three years.\n\nThe impacts of the COVID pandemic have been a key focus during the year across the Group, and continue to be felt as we go into 2021, and I am pleased to report that the Committee has played its part in supporting the Group's response to the crisis. I am also pleased to report that the opinion of the Audit Committee continues to be that the Company has met its obligations for financial reporting and disclosure, and that the internal control framework is both effectively designed and operated.\n\n## Committee purpose and responsibilities\n\nThe purpose of the Committee is to monitor and review the Group's financial and narrative reporting arrangements, the effectiveness of the internal controls (including over financial reporting) and the risk management framework, whistleblowing arrangements and each of the internal and external audit processes, including the statutory audit of the consolidated financial statements and the independence of the statutory external auditor.\n\nThe Committee reports to the Board on how it discharges its responsibilities and makes recommendations to the Board, all of which have been accepted during the year. A full list of responsibilities is detailed in the Committee's terms of reference, which can be found at www.lloydsbankinggroup.com/ who-we-are/group-overview/corporategovernance.html. In satisfying its purpose, the Committee undertakes the functions detailed within Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rule 7.1.3R.\n\nDuring the year the Committee considered a number of issues relating to the Group's financial reporting. These issues are summarised on the following pages, including discussion of the conclusions the Committee reached, and the key factors considered in reaching these conclusions.\n\nIn addition, the Committee considered a number of other issues not related directly to financial reporting, including internal controls, internal\n\naudit and external audit. These issues are also discussed in detail on the final page of the report.\n\n## Committee composition, skills, experience and operation\n\nThe Committee acts independently of the executive to ensure the interests of the shareholders are properly protected in relation to financial reporting and internal/uni00A0control.\n\nAll members of the Committee are independent Non-Executive Directors with competence in the financial sector, and their biographies can be found on pages 82 to 83.\n\nSarah Legg is a Fellow of the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants and of the Association of Corporate Treasurers, with extensive knowledge of financial markets, treasury, risk management and international accounting standards. She is a member having recent and relevant financial experience for the purposes of the UK Corporate Governance Code, and is the Audit Committee financial expert for SEC purposes.\n\nDuring the course of the year, the Committee held separate sessions with the internal and external audit teams, without members of the executive management present. For details of how the Committee was run, see page 87.\n\nThe Committee undertakes an annual review of its effectiveness, the review forming part of the Board evaluation process with Directors being asked to complete parts of the questionnaire relating to the Committees of which they were members. The findings of the review were considered by the Committee at its January 2021 meeting. On the basis of the evaluation, the feedback was that the performance of the Committee continues to be effective.\n\nWhile the Committee's membership comprises the Non-Executive Directors noted on page/uni00A086, all Non-Executive Directors may attend meetings as agreed with the Chair of the Committee. The Group Financial Controller, Chief Internal Auditor, the external auditor, the Group Chief Executive, the Chief Financial Officer and the Chief Risk Officer also attend meetings as appropriate. Details of Committee membership and meeting attendance can be found on page 86.\n\nThe strength of the Group's internal control environment and our ongoing commitment to improving this end to end will be key in supporting the Group's ongoing transformation.\n\n## Sarah Legg\n\nChair, Audit Committee",

These are discussed below in more detail, together with other key issues which have impacted the Group's financial statements in 2020.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Activities for the year                           | Key issues                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Committee review and conclusion                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Allowance for  impairment  on loans and  advances |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | The Group's impairment provision  is dependent on management's  judgements on matters such as  future interest rates, house prices  and unemployment rates, as well  as its assessment of a customer's  current financial position and  whether the exposure has suffered  a significant increase in credit risk.

The most significant assumptions were in  respect of workplace pension persistency, annuitant longevity, and expenses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| liabilities                                | Determining the value of the VIF  asset and insurance liabilities  requires management to make  significant estimates for both  economic and non-economic  actuarial assumptions.

Where control  issues do arise, they are addressed  appropriately.   Balance Sheet Substantiation and  During the year the Committee reviewed key balance sheet substantiation metrics,  covering ownership of general ledger balances, reconciliation, and independent  quality review status. The Committee noted the improvement in these metrics over  the last few years. The Committee also considered a summary of a small number of  specific key control matters, including remediation thereof. Consideration was given to the Group's approach to financial control, which has  been enhanced in the year due to the rollout of a number of thematic initiatives. This  review of the Group's Financial Control and Reporting Framework focused on areas  such as data and metrics, basis of substantiation, End User Computing and manual  workarounds, 3rd party and non-finance reconciliation activity. Conclusion:  The Committee was satisfied with the approach to Balance Sheet  Substantiation and Control. |",

        "page_content": "## Other significant issues\n\nThe following matters were also considered by the Committee.\n\n## Risk management and internal control systems\n\nFull details of the internal control and risk management systems in relation to the financial reporting process are given within the risk management section on pages/uni00A0144/uni00A0to 204. Specific related matters that the Committee considered for the year included:\n\n- The effectiveness of systems for internal control, financial reporting and risk management\n- The extent of the work undertaken by the Finance teams across the Group to ensure that the control environment continued to operate effectively\n- The major findings of internal investigations into control weaknesses, fraud or misconduct and management's response along with any control deficiencies identified through the assessment of the effectiveness of the internal controls over financial reporting under the US/uni00A0Sarbanes-Oxley Act\n\nThe Committee was satisfied that internal controls over financial reporting were appropriately designed and operating effectively.\n\n## Risk-weighted assets (RWA) and regulatory reporting\n\nIn 2019, the Committee commissioned work to commence on external RWA Assurance and a programme of agreed internal second and third line activity.  In addition to this, following the industry wide Dear CEO letter on Regulatory Reporting, management also commissioned a programme to review and strengthen the quality of Regulatory Reporting across the Group. Management provided regular updates to the Committee over the year. These highlighted the progress made in both the development of a principles based framework and improvements in the reporting control environment across a number of regulatory reports.\n\n## Group Internal Audit\n\nIn monitoring the activity, role and effectiveness of the internal audit function and their audit programme the Committee:\n\n- Monitored the effectiveness of Group Internal Audit and their audit programme through quarterly reports on the activities undertaken and a report from the Quality Assurance function within Group Internal Audit\n- Considered the major findings of significant internal audits, and management's response\n- Monitored the progress of internal audit's coverage of key risk themes across the Group, including Delivery of Strategic Change, Cyber & Information Security, Data Management, Operational Resilience, Third Party Management and Credit Risk Management\n- Approved the annual audit plan and budget, including resource and reviewed progress against the plan through the year\n- Assessed Group Internal Audit's resources and skills (supplemented by externally sourced subject matter experts as required) as adequate to fulfil its mandate. Group Internal Audit reports on its detailed internal skills assessment including on the availability of specialist skills. The Group Internal Audit Quality Assurance function separately reports to the Committee giving a view on the adequacy of Group Internal Audit resource and skills.\n- Monitored and assessed the independence of Group Internal Audit\n\n## Speak Up (the Group's whistleblowing service)\n\nThe Committee received and considered reports from management on the Group's whistleblowing arrangements.\n\nThe Committee reviewed the reports to ensure there are arrangements in place which colleagues can use in confidence to report concerns about inappropriate and unacceptable practices, and that there is proportionate and independent investigation of such matters or appropriate follow up.\n\nThe Committee reported on its consideration of whistleblowing arrangements to the Board. The Committee also continued to operate an interim sub-committee to consider whistleblowing cases where allegations relate to Material Risk Takers or Senior Managers, and to oversee improvements being made to the Group's whistleblowing arrangements.\n\n## Auditor independence and remuneration\n\nBoth the Board and the external auditor have policies and procedures designed to protect the independence and objectivity of the external auditor. In January 2020, the Committee amended its non-audit service policy (the Policy) to reflect changes to the FRC's rules on auditor independence and to require Deloitte, who will be appointed as the Group's auditors during 2021, to comply with the Policy.\n\nIn addition to detailing those services that the Committee prohibits the external auditor from providing to the Group, the Policy preapproves certain services provided the fee is below a threshold; all other permitted services must be specifically approved in advance by the Committee. The Policy will be reviewed again in April 2021. Prior to engagement of the auditor for a permitted service, the Policy requires that senior management confirms whether the Committee has pre-approved the service or specific approval is required. The total amount of fees paid to the auditor for both audit and non-audit related services in 2020 and further information on the Policy is disclosed in note 12 to the financial statements.\n\n## External auditor\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) has been the auditor of the Company and the Group since 1995, and in accordance with legal and regulatory requirements, will be resigning as auditor following completion of the audit for the year ended 31 December 2020. Following a tender process in 2018, the Committee recommended to the Board that Deloitte be appointed as the Group's auditor for the financial year beginning on 1 January 2021.\n\nThe Committee received confirmation from Deloitte that it was independent of the Group as at 1 January 2020 and, as a result, Deloitte was able to commence its planning activities in the first half of 2020. During the year, regular meetings have been held with Deloitte's audit engagement team to assist in its development of the 2021 external audit plan. The Committee has recommended to the Board that Deloitte be recommended for appointment at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.\n\nThe Committee oversees the relationship with the external auditor including its terms of engagement and remuneration, and monitors its independence and objectivity; PwC was the Group's auditor for the year ended 31 December 2020. Mark Hannam has been PwC's senior statutory audit partner for the Group and the Company since the beginning of 2016, and attends all meetings of the Committee. During 2020, the Committee reviewed PwC's audit plan, including the underlying methodology, and PwC's risk identification processes. In its assessment of PwC's performance and effectiveness, the Committee has considered: PwC's interactions with the Committee; the responses to a questionnaire issued to the Group's businesses, Finance, Risk and Internal Audit; and the Financial Reporting Council's (FRC) Audit Quality Inspection Report published in July 2020. In addition, the FRC's Audit Quality Review team reviewed PwC's audit of the Group's 2019 financial statements as part of its latest annual inspection of audit firms. The Committee received a copy of the findings and discussed them with PwC. While there were no significant findings, some areas of PwC's audit procedures were identified as needing limited improvements only. The Committee concluded that it was satisfied with the auditor's performance.\n\n## Statutory Audit Services compliance\n\nThe Company and the Group confirm compliance with the provisions of The Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender Processes and Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014 for the year to 31 December 2020.\n\nSubject to shareholder approval, Deloitte will undertake the audit of the Company and the Group for the year ended 31 December 2021. There are no plans as at the date of this report to conduct a tender exercise for external audit services.",

How has the Board Risk Committee (the 'Committee') responded to the additional challenges faced during 2020 arising from the pandemic?\n\nA. As identified in the following pages, the Committee has considered the impacts of the pandemic on the existing risk profile, and reviewed actions taken by management to mitigate. The most significant areas have included the financial impacts for our customers, the wellbeing and resilience of our colleagues, and ensuring their ability to continue to safely help and support our/uni00A0customers.\n\n## Q. How is the Committee addressing risks associated with climate change which the Group will face?\n\nA. Climate change is a top issue for the Group and the Committee. The Committee continues to increase its focus on climate risk, ensuring that the Group's risk management capabilities are developed at pace. This helps ensure a proactive response overall, and allows the Committee to closely monitor impacts for both the Group and its customers, together with delivery of climate change commitments by the Group.\n\n## Q. What are the key areas of focus for the Committee in 2021?\n\nA. The Committee will continue to consider the following important areas:\n\n- Broader impacts of the pandemic on the Group's risk profile.\n- Macroeconomic factors including the impact from the UK's exit from the EU.\n- The treatment of customers in financial difficulty where increased focus is required.\n- The management of Cyber and Technology risks.\n- The strengthening of the Group's risk culture and control environment.\n- Effective control of Change and Execution risk.\n- Management of strategic and emerging risks for the Group in support of the Group's strategic aims.\n\n## Key activities in 2020\n\n- Considering the impacts of the pandemic on credit quality and customers in financial difficulty\n- Focusing on the operational resilience of the Group and strengthening of the Group's control environment\n- Reviewing the Group's response to the heightened People risks, and colleague impacts, of the pandemic\n- Continued focus on the Group's management of customer rectifications and complaints\n\n## Introduction\n\nI was delighted to take on the role of Chair of the Committee with effect from 1 January 2021, and am pleased to report on how the Committee has discharged its responsibilities throughout 2020.\n\nThe past year has been unprecedented with the impacts of the pandemic being felt by all. The Group, and the Committee, have responded to the additional challenges which this has driven, taking actions to mitigate the impacts for the Group, and its customers, wherever possible. These areas, together with the impacts of EU exit, will continue to be a key focus for the Committee in the near term.\n\nI would also like to place on record my thanks to Alan Dickinson and Nick Prettejohn for their chairmanship of the Committee, particularly during what has been an unprecedented year, and for the support provided during the transition of the Chair role.\n\n## Committee purpose and responsibilities\n\nThe overriding purpose of the Committee is to assist the Group's Board in fulfilling its risk governance and oversight roles and responsibilities. The Committee is also responsible for ensuring the risk culture is fully embedded and supports at all times the Group's agreed risk appetite, covering the extent and categories of risk which the Board considers as acceptable for the Group.\n\nIn seeking to achieve this, the Committee is responsible for reviewing and reporting its conclusions to the Board on the Group's risk management framework, which embraces risk principles, policies, methodologies, systems, processes, procedures and people. It also includes the review of new, or material amendments to risk principles and policies, and overseeing any action resulting from material breaches of such policy.\n\nMore details on the Group's wider approach to risk management can be found in the risk management section on pages 143 to 204. Full details of the Committee's responsibilities are set out in its terms of reference, which can\n\nbe found at https://www.lloydsbankinggroup. com/who-we-are/group-overview/corporategovernance.html\n\n## Committee composition, skills, experience and operation\n\nThe Committee is composed of NonExecutive Directors, who provide core banking and risk knowledge, together with breadth of experience which brings knowledge from other sectors, and a clear awareness of the importance of putting the customer at the centre of all that the Group/uni00A0does.\n\nAll Non-Executive Directors are members of the Committee, and the three/uni00A0designated independent Non-Executive Directors of the Ring-Fenced Banks also attend. The Chief Risk Officer has full access to the Committee and attends all meetings. The Chief Internal Auditor and members of the executive also attend meetings, as appropriate.\n\nThe Committee undertakes an annual effectiveness review. This review forms part of the Board Evaluation process with Directors being asked to complete parts of the questionnaire relating to the Committees of which they were members. The findings of the review were considered by the Committee at its January 2021 meeting. On the basis of the evaluation, the feedback was that the performance of the Committee continues to be effective. Details of Committee membership and meeting attendance can be found on page 86.\n\nAs the most senior risk committee in the Group, the Committee interacts with other related risk committees, including the executive Group Risk Committee. These interactions assist with the agenda planning process, where matters considered by the Group Risk Committee are reviewed to ensure escalation of all relevant matters to the/uni00A0Committee.\n\nThe Committee continues to closely monitor emerging risks, including those impacted by the pandemic, and the potential impacts for both the Group and its customers\n\n## Catherine Woods\n\nChair, Board Risk Committee",

Set out below and on the following pages is a summary of these risks, with an outline of the material factors considered by the Committee, and the conclusions which were ultimately reached.\n\nDuring 2020, the Committee continued to use established sub-committees and fora to provide additional focus on areas such as IT resilience and cyber, and stress testing and recovery planning. These sub-committees\n\nand fora enable members of the Committee to dedicate additional time and resource to achieving a more in-depth understanding of the topics covered, and enable further review and challenge of the associated risks. The Committee also reviewed regular updates from the Non Ring-Fenced Bank and Insurance sub-groups, headed up by Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets plc and Scottish Widows Group Limited respectively, summarising key discussions and decisions taken at the relevant entities' risk committees.\n\n| Activities during the year   | Key issues

The planning process takes account of the Group's business objectives, the risks taken to seek to meet those objectives and the controls in place to mitigate those risks to remain within the Group's overall risk appetite.\n\nThe Group's annual planning process comprises the following key stages:\n\n- The Board reviews and revises the Group's strategy, risk appetite and objectives in the context of the operating environment and external market commitments\n- The divisional teams develop their operating plans based on the Board's objectives ensuring that they are in line with the Group's strategy and risk appetite\n- The financial projections and the underlying assumptions in respect of expected market and business changes, and future expected legal, accounting and regulatory changes are subject to rigorous review and challenge from both divisional and Group executives\n- In addition, the Board obtains independent assurance from Risk Division over the alignment of the plan with Group strategy and the Board's risk appetite. This assessment performed by Risk Division also identifies the key risks to delivery of the Group's operating plan\n- The planning process is also underpinned by a robust capital and funding stress testing framework. This framework allows the Group to assess compliance of the operating plan with the Group's risk appetite\n- The scenarios used for stress testing are designed to be severe but plausible, and take account of the availability and likely effectiveness of mitigating actions that could be taken by management to avoid or reduce the impact or occurrence of the underlying risks. In considering the likely effectiveness of such actions, the conclusions of the Board's regular monitoring and review of risk and internal control systems, as discussed on page 95, is taken into account. Further information on stress testing and reverse stress testing is provided on pages 152 to 153\n- In 2020, the operating plan has been subject to revision to reflect the volatility in the economic environment. This has allowed the Board to consider in November 2020 a scenario which recognised the downside impacts from further lockdowns and the positive aspects from the vaccine rollout, and a further refresh in January 2021 recognising the latest assessment of the economy\n- The final operating plan, Risk Division assessment and the results of the stress testing are presented to the Board for approval. Once approved, the operating plan drives detailed divisional and Group targets for the following year",

        "page_content": "The Directors have specifically assessed the prospects of the Company and the Group over the current plan period. The Board considers that a three year period continues to present a reasonable degree of confidence over expected events and macroeconomic assumptions, while still providing an appropriate longer-term outlook. Information relevant to the assessment can be found in the following sections of the annual report and accounts:\n\n- The Group's principal activities, business and operating models and strategic direction are described in the strategic report on/uni00A0pages/uni00A01/uni00A0to/uni00A059\n- Emerging risks are disclosed on pages 147 to 149\n- The principal risks, including the Group's objectives, policies and processes for managing credit, capital, liquidity and funding, are provided in the risk management section on pages 144 to 204\n- The Group's approach to stress testing and reverse stress testing, including both regulatory and internal stresses, is described on/uni00A0pages/uni00A0152 to 153\n\nBased upon this assessment, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the next three years to 31 December 2023.\n\n## Going concern\n\nThe going concern of the Company and the Group is dependent on successfully funding their respective balance sheets and maintaining adequate levels of capital. In order to satisfy themselves that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue to operate for the foreseeable future, the Directors have considered the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic upon the Group's performance and projected funding and capital positions and also taken into account the impact of further stress scenarios as well as a number of other key dependencies which are set out in the risk management section under principal risks and uncertainties: funding and liquidity on page/uni00A057 and pages 183 to 187 and capital position on pages 188 to 196. Additionally, the Directors have considered the capital and funding projections of the Company and Group. Accordingly, the Directors conclude that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for a period of at least 12 months from the date of the approval of the financial statements and therefore it is appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts.\n\n## Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions Greenhouse gas emissions\n\nThe Group has reported greenhouse gas emissions and environmental performance since 2009, and since 2013 this has been reported in line with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and its applicable regulations. Our total emissions, in tonnes of CO2 equivalent, are reported in the table below. Deloitte LLP has provided limited level ISAE 3000 (Revised) assurance over selected non-financial indicators as noted by . Their full, independent assurance statement is available online at www.lloydsbankinggroup.com/who-we-are/responsible-business/ downloads.html\n\n## Methodology\n\nThe Group follows the principles of the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard to calculate Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions from our worldwide operations. The reporting period is 1 October 2019 to 30 September 2020, which is different to that of our Directors' report (January to December 2020). This is in line with the regulations in that the majority of the emissions reporting year falls within the period of the Directors' Report. Emissions are reported based on the operational control approach.\n\nReported Scope 1 emissions are those generated from gas and oil used in buildings, emissions from fuels used in UK company owned vehicles used for business travel and fugitive emissions from the use of air conditioning and chiller/refrigerant plant. Reported Scope 2 emissions are generated from the use of electricity and are calculated using both the location and market-based methodologies. Reported Scope 3 emissions relate to business travel and commuting undertaken by colleagues, waste and the extraction and distribution of each of our energy sources - electricity, gas and oil. This year, in light of the coronavirus pandemic's impacts on Group operations, we have included the emissions of colleagues working from home before and during the pandemic in our Scope 3 totals.\n\n## Intensity ratio\n\n| Legacy Scope                                                                             | Oct19- Sep20   | Oct18- Sep19   | Oct17- Sep18   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|\n| GHG emissions (CO 2 e) per \u00a3m of  underlying income (Location Based)*                    | 10.4           | 11.5           | 13.0           |\n| GHG emissions (CO 2 e) per \u00a3m of  underlying income (Market Based)*                      | 4.7            | 5.6            | 6.2            |\n| Expanded Scope                                                                           | Oct19- Sep20   | Oct18- Sep19   | Oct17- Sep18   |\n| GHG emissions (CO 2 e) per \u00a3m of  underlying income (Market Based) -  expanded scope**   | 13.6           | 15.8           | 17. 3          |\n| GHG emissions (CO 2 e) per \u00a3m of  underlying income (Location Based) -  expanded scope** | 7.9            | 9.9            | 10.6           |\n\nThis year, our overall location-based carbon emissions were 159,487 tCO 2 e; a 24 per cent decrease since 2019 and 72 per cent against our 2009 baseline (legacy scope). Significant reductions were achieved between October and March of this reporting year. These are attributable to our programme of environmental action since 2010, which has delivered a reduction in gas and electricity consumption through extensive energy management, alongside decarbonisation of the UK electricity grid from October to March 2020. Further reductions have been caused by the impact of coronavirus on our operations and reported emissions. A large proportion of our colleagues worked from home in 2020 in line with travel restrictions and advice, which has led to a considerable reduction in both scope 1 and 3 business travel numbers reported. Group building energy, gas and electricity, also reduces in part due to the impacts of this operational shift, though impacts are not as significant.\n\nOur scope 2 market-based emissions figure is zero tCO 2 e, as we have procured renewable energy certificates equal to our total electricity consumption in each of the markets we operate since January 2019.\n\n## Omissions\n\nEmissions associated with joint ventures and investments are not included in this disclosure as they fall outside the scope of our operational boundary. The Group does not have any emissions associated with imported heat, steam or imported cooling and is not aware of any other material sources of omissions from our reporting.",

Deloitte's 2020 assurance statement and the 2020 Reporting Criteria are available online at www.lloydsbankinggroup.com/who-we-are/ responsible-business.html\n\n## Energy efficiency\n\nWhile coronavirus has significantly impacted our energy performance year on year, we did see a 4 per cent year to year energy consumption reduction achieved in a 6 month period prior to the impacts of coronavirus, largely due to our energy reduction initiatives. These initiatives include an energy optimisation programme; an energy intervention scheme that includes remote and onsite optimisation and strategic alterations of BMS and controls systems to match the run hours of plant to core operating hours and ensure temperature settings are aligned with Group comfort guidelines. In 2020, 89 deep-dives, 88 onsite optimisations, 13 remote optimisations and 550 bank holiday programming were completed, which resulted in a 105 GWh saving. Additionally, the Group saw a 14% year to year energy reduction in our company owned vehicles energy usage in the 6 month period prior to April 2020, due to our ongoing focus on reducing business travel.\n\n## Independent auditor and audit information\n\nEach person who is a Director at the date of approval of this report confirms that, so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company's auditor is unaware and each Director has taken all the steps that he or she ought to have taken as a Director to make himself or herself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Company's auditor is aware of that information.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. Resolutions concerning the appointment of Deloitte LLP as auditor and authorising the Audit Committee to set its remuneration will be proposed at the AGM.\n\n## Statement of directors' responsibilities\n\nThe Directors are responsible for preparing the annual report, including the Directors' remuneration report, and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations. Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law, the Directors have prepared the Group and parent Company financial statements in accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. Additionally, the Financial Conduct Authority's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules require the Directors to prepare the group financial statements in accordance with international financial reporting standards adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union.\n\nUnder company law, the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company and Group for that period. In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to: select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and state whether for the Group and Company, international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, for the Group, international financial reporting standards adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union have been followed.\n\nThe Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and the Group and enable them to ensure that the financial statements and the Directors' remuneration report comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial statements, international financial reporting standards adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union.

We recognise the need for restraint in the remuneration outcomes for Executive Directors and other senior colleagues, while ensuring additional support was targeted toward our customerfacing colleagues in recognition of their tremendous efforts in continuing to support our customers.\n\nAs we move into the next phase of the Group's strategy, we recognise more than ever the need to incentivise and retain critical talent while maintaining a direct alignment to the experience of our shareholders and responding to the broader societal challenges we face.\n\n## 2020 - an unprecedented year\n\nWe knew as the pandemic developed that in order to support our customers in the best possible way, we would first need to support our colleagues through the uncertainty that they were facing. We therefore confirmed in March 2020 that all colleagues would continue to be paid in full, no matter how the pandemic affected them. This meant that colleagues who were sick or shielding and unable to work at all, or had to change their working arrangements for caring responsibilities or their personal wellbeing, were able to do so whilst continuing to be paid and receiving the support they needed.\n\nMembers of our Group Executive Committee confirmed in April 2020 that, regardless of Group and individual performance through the remainder of 2020, they would waive their right to be considered for a bonus award; an early decision that the Committee welcomed.\n\nConsistent  with the framework set by the Remuneration Committee at the start of the year, the impact of the pandemic on our financial results means that there will be no annual bonus pool (Group Performance Share) for 2020 as the profit threshold has not been met. Full details are provided on page 121. In keeping with our approach to timely, open and honest communication with colleagues, we communicated this outcome in December\n\n## Directors' remuneration report\n\n## Remuneration Committee Chair's statement\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn this unprecedented year, we continue to strive for a simple reward package with clear alignment to our purpose that rewards and drives the right behaviours and outcomes.\n\nStuart Sinclair\n\nChair, Remuneration Committee\n\n## Q. How has the Remuneration Committee and the Group supported colleagues through COVID-19?\n\nWe committed to colleagues that we would support them during this unprecedented time. Our priority was to take away as much uncertainty as possible when it came to work, their families and remuneration. This at times meant making some difficult but important decisions, but ones we feel were in the interest of shareholders, colleagues and the communities we serve.\n\nThe Group is continuing to provide support on mental and physical wellbeing as well as continuing to pay colleagues their full salary, no matter how the outbreak affects what they do for the Group or what their personal circumstances are.\n\nIn July, 40,000 predominantly customerfacing colleagues, received a \u00a3250 award to say thank you for the support and to recognise the incredible commitment shown to our customers and communities throughout the pandemic.\n\n## Q. How have we responded to shareholder concerns following the 2020 AGM?\n\nDuring 2020 in total we engaged with shareholders representing more than 60 per cent of our register, as well as the proxy agencies, including both those who voted 'for' and 'against' our remuneration resolutions at the 2020 AGM.\n\nI am very grateful to shareholders for their engagement on a broad range of remuneration issues including our new Policy. Following extensive and productive discussions additional clarity has been provided regarding the discount applied to the Long Term Share Plan (LTSP), as well as detail regarding our simplified balanced scorecard for 2021.\n\n## 2020 IN SUMMARY\n\n- There are no annual bonus (Group Performance Share) awards for 2020\n- Group Chief Executive total remuneration is down 22 per cent yearon-year\n- We have protected the total remuneration for our lowest paid colleagues and are awarding above-inflation pay increases in April/uni00A02021\n- All eligible colleagues will receive a \u00a3400 recognition share award\n- 2018 Executive Group Ownership Share vesting at 33.75 per cent reflecting strong strategic progress\n\n2020. This outcome is in no way reflective of the hard work, commitment and sacrifice our colleagues have made throughout the year to keep our business running and help our customers.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee acknowledges that colleague reward was considerably affected by external factors in 2020 and intends that for fairness, just as colleague awards absorbed the impact of the fall in profitability, they should participate in any recovery in profitability in 2021.\n\n## Our wider workforce\n\nMeasured against our core principle of ensuring there is fairness in our remuneration structure, the Remuneration Committee has paid particular regard to the impact its decisions have had for all colleagues. We made an above inflation pay award to our lowest paid colleagues in April 2020, and paid a one-off \u00a3250 cash recognition award to nearly 40,000 predominantly customer-facing colleagues in July 2020. This means for almost half of our colleagues, their total remuneration has stayed flat from 2019 to 2020 despite the absence of any bonus pool.\n\nFor the April 2021 pay review, the average pay award for our lowest-paid colleagues will be 1.7 per cent and up to 2.2 per cent again, above inflation. There are no increases for Executive Directors.\n\nTo recognise further the considerable role that all colleagues have played in supporting customers in 2020, and the part they will play in delivering the next phase of the Group's strategy, every permanent eligible colleague across the Group will receive a \u00a3400 share award. These free shares that vest after three years ensure that each and every colleague has a personal interest in the longer-term success of the Group.\n\nFi\n\nn\n\na\n\nnc\n\ni\n\na\n\nl\n\nr\n\ne\n\nsu\n\nl\n\nt\n\ns",

        "page_content": "## Executive Director remuneration decisions and outcomes\n\nThe Remuneration Committee considers the need for significant restraint in respect of remuneration outcomes. There are no pay increases proposed for Executive Directors and only limited awards made to other senior colleagues where they are paid below market rate, creating a retention risk.\n\nIn order to ensure the continued long-term motivation and retention of key staff the Remuneration Committee supported making awards under the new Long Term Share Plan (LTSP) introduced at the AGM in May 2020. The LTSP is subject to underpins for three years, with vesting spread between the third and seventh anniversary of award for Executive Directors.\n\nAwards will be granted to a small number of senior colleagues, to ensure there is alignment to shareholder experience and retain critical talent through the next phase of the Group's strategic delivery. In deciding to make the LTSP awards, the Remuneration Committee has taken into account the Group's performance during 2020 (as set out in full on pages 121 to 122) and the current share price.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee carefully considered the impact of a lower share price on award sizes in assessing the 'pre-grant test' as outlined and explained in more detail on page 118. The decision has been taken that adjusting awards upfront for a potential increase in the share price over time would not be appropriate, but instead took the decision that the level of LTSP awards should be reduced by 40 per cent to reflect the Group's performance in 2020, the current share price and the wider experience of shareholders.\n\nThis in-year adjustment applies in addition to the 50/uni00A0per cent discount applied from the previous long term incentive plan as explained on page 118. In making this assessment, the Committee reviewed the scorecard outcome (see pages 121 to 122) and took into account the fact that while there has been weak performance against financial metrics set before the true impact of the pandemic was known, the overall performance against customer and other non-financial metrics is strong. In particular, the Committee considered that risk and conduct have been adequately reflected in the scorecard outcome and the Group has lived up to its ambition to be the Best Bank for Customers, as evidenced by performance against the Customer and Conduct dimension of the scorecard, and materially lower conductrelated costs for 2020. The purpose of the LTSP is to reward long-term performance rather than short-term financial outcomes.\n\nThere is no LTSP award for the Group Chief Executive as he will leave the Group in April 2021./uni00A0 In setting the award size for the Chief Financial Officer, the Remuneration Committee considered the award range for normal performance of 125 per cent to 150/uni00A0per cent (see page 132) and considered an award of 125/uni00A0per cent was appropriate to reflect Group and individual contribution in 2020 (see page/uni00A0122) alongside the need to incentivise delivery of the next phase of strategy aligned to long-term shareholder returns. A further adjustment of 40 per cent was applied to scale the award in line with the overall budget for LTSP awards, resulting in a final award of 75/uni00A0per/uni00A0cent of salary for the Chief Financial Officer. This adjustment ensures there is a consistent approach applied for all recipients of LTSP awards and supports a 'one team' ethos across the Group's senior management team.\n\nFull details of the 2021 LTSP award, including the factors supporting the pre-grant assessment and the underpins that apply, are included on page 132.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee has been mindful that in-flight awards made under the Group Ownership Share plan for performance in 2019 to 2020 remain in place (and will run until the end of 2022) and the Committee has confirmed that there has not been, nor will be, any softening of the performance measures for these awards despite the unprecedented impact of external events and economic volatility. Under these circumstances, we believe that re-alignment of these targets would compromise the alignment of these awards with the interests of our shareholders.\n\nStrong delivery of the non-financial measures in the Executive Group Ownership Share awards made in 2018 resulted in vesting at 33.75/uni00A0per/uni00A0cent as shown in the table on page/uni00A0123.\n\n## Board changes\n\nWith the departure of the Chief Operating Officer in September 2020 and the announcement of the Group Chief Executive's retirement in 2021, supporting the Board in the search for a new Chief Executive has been a significant focus for the Remuneration/uni00A0Committee.\n\nThe Committee was mindful of the need to keep narrowing the gap in total remuneration between Executive Directors and the wider workforce, while not compromising on the quality of the candidate pool. The total maximum reward package for the new Group Chief Executive has therefore been reduced by approximately 20 per cent from the current Directors' Remuneration Policy maximum that was approved at the 2020 AGM and is a total reduction of over 40 per cent from the Policy in force until as recently as 2019.\n\nEach component of the package for the new Group Chief Executive, Charlie Nunn, has been set in accordance with the approved Policy.\n\n## Responding to shareholder feedback and the challenges ahead\n\nIn addition to our deliberate efforts to support and reward our colleagues during this unprecedented time, 2020 has also marked the first year of implementation of our updated Directors' Remuneration Policy. We welcomed receiving majority votes in support of both the Policy and Long Term Share Plan, though recognise that there were a significant number of votes opposing both these resolutions. As a result, we have consulted widely on the changes we are making to the implementation of the approved Policy in 2021 and thank those shareholders and proxy agencies that we have met for their feedback.\n\nWhen designing the new Policy, we thought carefully about how we could achieve our core aim of creating a simple reward package with clear alignment to our Group's purpose and shareholders' interests. On page 118 under 'Engaging with our shareholders and responding to feedback', we explain the main feedback received and our response.\n\nIn particular, I would like to draw your attention to the new approach to the Group balanced scorecard on page 119 where I hope you will agree we have taken on board specific feedback that we should have fewer and simpler quantitative metrics that have clear alignment to the purpose of the Group and shareholders' interests. We have also responded to feedback that there should be specific and identifiable measures of performance against our inclusion and diversity objectives (in support of our ethnic and gender diversity goals) and our long-term sustainability agenda.\n\nWe know that 2021 will not be a normal year as we start delivering on our revised strategy and Help Britain Recover, while adapting to the changing needs of our customers, colleagues and societal expectations resulting from the pandemic. We believe that our balanced scorecard for 2021, which will drive the reward outcomes for our whole Group Executive Committee, not just the Group Chief Executive, ensures that management is focused as 'one team' on the right behaviours and delivering sustainable results.\n\nTogether with my Committee members, I/uni00A0look forward to hearing your views on the remuneration arrangements outlined in the report and hope we will receive your support at the upcoming AGM.\n\nOn behalf of the Board\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Stuart Sinclair\n\nChair, Remuneration Committee",

The Policy became effective for 2020 however we recognise that there were a significant number of votes opposing these resolutions indicating that there were concerns with some aspects of our policy's design.\n\nDuring 2020 we engaged with shareholders representing more than 60 per cent of our register, which has provided us with a thorough indication of the main areas of concern to reflect on. We value the opinions of all our stakeholders and thank all our shareholders, regulators, Unions and others for their input and collaboration. As a result we have made some key changes to how we intend to implement the Policy in 2021 and\n\n## 1. THE NEW LONG TERM SHARE PLAN\n\n## The discount applied to the new LTSP award\n\nA number of shareholders expressed concern over the way in which the discount of 50 per cent from the previous Group Ownership Share (GOS) was applied to reach the maximum opportunity under the new plan. Under the previous GOS plan, the Remuneration Committee had the right to grant an award of up to 400 per cent in\n\n## The inclusion of the pre-grant test\n\nA number of shareholders expressed confusion over the need for, and operation of, the pre-grant test to determine LTSP award levels, particularly as other companies have recently introduced restricted share plans that do not include this feature.\n\nUnder the regulatory requirements that apply to large UK banks, in order for variable remuneration to count within the 'bonus cap' for the year of grant it must include in some way a measure of the performance of the year of grant, among other gateways which will normally be conduct risk and\n\n## The use of the balanced scorecard in determining LTSP/uni00A0awards\n\nThe balanced scorecard will continue to play a role, however the long-term focus of this plan means that there would be only limited variability in the size of the award based on performance in the year of grant. We expect that this approach will provide greater clarity to the way in which awards are determined, whilst bringing it closer to the 'restricted share' model and reflecting regulatory\n\n## Scorecard outcomes\n\nPerformance outcome\n\nAll LTSP grant (up to % of Base Salary)\n\nexceptional circumstances (for example, in the context of hiring a new CEO), or where individual performance had been deemed exceptional, and therefore the normal maximum award level under the GOS plan was 300/uni00A0per/uni00A0cent. We acknowledge that a 50/uni00A0per/uni00A0cent discount from that level would mean that the LTSP policy should provide for a normal maximum award of no more than 150/uni00A0per/uni00A0cent.\n\ncustomer outcomes. Under the GOS plan, this resulted in the possibility of awards to the Group Chief Executive being lower than 300/uni00A0per/uni00A0cent, notably for 2019 when to reflect the reduction in statutory profit his award was reduced to 250/uni00A0per/uni00A0cent. We will reflect this approach under the LTSP, with awards, subject to appropriate gateways, expected to be in the range of 125/uni00A0per/uni00A0cent to 150/uni00A0per/uni00A0cent as shown in the table below.\n\nWhen considering the use of discretion in conjunction with the balanced scorecard assessment, the Committee will consider the following key questions:\n\nrequirements. We are now focusing on how we can improve the simplicity and transparency of the way in which the pre-grant test is set out as outlined above.\n\nThe following table provides an indication of scorecard performance outcomes and resulting LTSP awards. The Remuneration Committee will use this as a guide although will make any discretionary adjustment to the final grant size based on factors that are considered important outside of the scorecard.\n\n0% - 50%\n\n0% - 125%\n\nbeyond that seek to address these concerns and continue to support our aim of delivering a simple reward package with clear alignment to the Group's purpose. The main concerns related to the new Long Term Share Plan and also a simpler performance assessment approach with clear alignment to reward outcomes.\n\nWe have confirmed that the maximum opportunity for the Group Chief Executive will be 150 per cent of salary not 200 per cent. Our Policy maximum will continue to be 200/uni00A0per/uni00A0cent, however any awards made above 150/uni00A0per/uni00A0cent of salary would be reserved for truly exceptional circumstances only, and with clear justification.\n\n- Do the Group's financial results and capital position adequately reflect risk, conduct and any other non-financial considerations?\n- Has the Group suffered a serious conduct event or has severe reputational damage arisen from the Group not living its values?\n- Has the bank lived up to its ambition to be the Best Bank for Customers?\n\nThese same questions are repeated at vesting to ensure that performance has been sustainable, and nothing has subsequently arisen that would give a different outcome if known at the point of award.\n\nFor 2021 LTSP awards, performance was measured against the 'old style' scorecard for 2020, as outlined in full on page 121. The Remuneration Committee considered that the performance outcome was at the lower end of the range of normal performance (a score of 3 to 4) and accordingly set the award at 125/uni00A0per cent before adjusting for other factors in the pre-grant assessment, as outlined on page 132. By comparison, the award for similar performance in 2019 under the GOS was 250/uni00A0per cent, demonstrating a real discount of 50/uni00A0per cent has been applied.\n\n50% - 100%\n\n125% - 150%*\n\n- *  Awards above 150 per cent and up to 200 per cent in line with Policy maximum reserved for exceptional circumstance or exceptional performance for all eligible colleagues other than the incoming Group Chief Executive who has agreed to cap his maximum award at 150 per cent of salary.",

        "page_content": "## R i s k / C o n d u c t\n\n## 2. A SIMPLE PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT APPROACH WITH CLEAR ALIGNMENT TO REWARD OUTCOMES\n\nWe know that most shareholders would like to see further simplification of the balanced scorecard and the way in which variable pay awards are decided, with greater weighting to financial performance.\n\nAs the Group moves towards a new strategic phase, we have thought carefully about how we should design a new, simplified balanced scorecard, with the objective of having simple metrics that incentivise the right behaviours and/uni00A0results.\n\n## Clearer alignment to purpose\n\nConsistent feedback suggested the structure of our balanced scorecard with 15 equally weighted measures, made it difficult for shareholders to determine how these measures clearly linked to the Group's strategy and performance. Providing equal weighting to all measures was criticised, with the view that some measures, in particular the core financial measures, should have greater influence on reward outcomes. We have thought hard about the right choice and balance of measures for 2021 and have consulted with a large proportion of shareholders and other stakeholders to get input into the design./uni00A0 As a result, we have significantly reduced the number of measures and rebalanced the scorecard to ensure there is a clear weighting between financial and non-financial metrics while appropriately capturing ESG and customer dimensions. In addition all measures are subject to consideration of risk and conduct.\n\nThe targets and the level of performance achieved, will be disclosed in the 2021 Annual Report and Accounts.\n\n## Our 2021 balanced scorecard\n\n## Financial (50%)\n\nDelivery of core financial measures is key to the sustainability of our business and to delivering long-term shareholder value. We/uni00A0have therefore increased the weighting for Financial measures from 33 per cent to 50/uni00A0per/uni00A0cent and each of the three simple measures chosen for 2021 will have their own individual weighting for additional transparency on pay for performance alignment.\n\n## Strategic (50%)\n\nAs the Group moves into a new strategic phase (see pages 36 to 45 for full details), focused in 2021 on our 'Helping Britain Recover' priorities, we have chosen four measures that we consider best demonstrate delivery against and alignment to our strategic ambitions.\n\nWe have consulted widely on the use of ESG metrics and whether these should be captured within our overall strategy or separately identifiable. On balance, we have determined that these measures should be separately identified and quantifiable to ensure we are specifically held to account for delivery against these factors. For 2021, we believe this focus should be ensuring management delivers its commitments centred around making the Group an inclusive and diverse workplace and our journey toward delivering zero carbon operations by 2030. We expect the specific measures for these commitments to evolve over time, most notably to reflect our increasing role in supporting the UK's climate change goals.\n\n## Greater transparency to substantiate our performance assessment\n\nWe have always tried to be as transparent as possible to disclose all our Group scorecard measures and what would be required to meet threshold or maximum performance.\n\nWe accept however that the presentation of our scorecard outputs in the past has made it difficult for our shareholders to comfortably come to the same performance conclusion as the Remuneration Committee using simply the level of information previously disclosed. This is particularly the case where internally-facing measures have been used.\n\nMoving forward we would like to present a far more qualitative disclosure to support our predominantly quantitative metrics, to provide key insights into how the Remuneration Committee has chosen certain measures and how performance has been assessed.\n\nWe hope you find the disclosure of our old style 2020 balanced scorecard assessment on page 121 has improved in this regard and we will continue to focus on improving the quality of our disclosure in the 2021 Annual Report and Accounts when the new scorecard structure is presented in full.\n\n## Clearer pay for performance alignment\n\nWe hope the proposed changes will be supported by our shareholders as they will provide further clarity that performance outputs and GPS and LTSP award outcomes directly align. However, we have also accepted the feedback that the four step approach we have used to go from a Group balanced scorecard score to a final award as a percentage of maximum for our Executive Directives could be simplified/uni00A0further. For 2021, all Executive Directors and the Group Executive Committee will be assessed based on the same single Group balanced scorecard.\n\nThis supports a 'one team' ethos in the Group's leadership team. GPS awards as a percentage of maximum will then directly correlate to final performance outcomes. The Remuneration Committee will continue to be able to use their discretion to adjust awards should they believe other factors outside of the scorecard measures should be considered when determining a final award and we will always disclose this rationale as part of the remuneration report. This judgment may include consideration of performance against personal and business area objectives and long-term strategic ambitions.\n\n| Measure                             | Weighting   | Quantitative   |\n|-------------------------------------|-------------|----------------|\n| Statutory Profit After Tax          | 20%         | Yes            |\n| Statutory ROTE                      | 20%         | Yes            |\n| Operating Costs (excl. remediation) | 10%         | Yes            |\n\n| Measure                   |                                                                                                                                  | Weighting   | Quantitative   |\n|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|----------------|\n| Helping  Britain  Recover | Reducing operational carbon  emissions                                                                                           | 7. 5 %      | Yes            |\n| Helping  Britain  Recover | Increasing our gender and ethnic  representation in senior roles                                                                 | 7. 5 %      | Yes            |\n|                           | Group Customer Dashboard - our assessment  of how effectively we are serving customers  across all brands, products and services | 25%         | Yes            |\n|                           | Colleague engagement - our performance  relative to external benchmark scores                                                    | 10%         | Yes            |\n\nFi\n\nn\n\na\n\nnc\n\ni\n\na\n\nl\n\nr\n\ne\n\nsu\n\nl\n\nt\n\ns",

The Group's underlying profit was \u00a32.2bn, 62/uni00A0per cent below the \u00a35.7bn target. The threshold was not met and therefore there are no GPS awards for 2020 performance.\n- 2  The 2018 Group Ownership Share (GOS) vesting (see page 123) at 33.75 per cent was confirmed by the Remuneration Committee at its meeting on 19/uni00A0February 2021. The total number of shares vesting were 2,269,762 for Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio and 1,177,883 shares vesting for Juan Colomb\u00e1s. This award was pro-rated to reflect Juan Colomb\u00e1s leaving date. The average share price between 1 October 2020 and 31 December 2020 32.62 pence has been used to indicate the value. No part of the reported value is attributable to share price appreciation.  Shares were awarded based on a Share price of 68.027, as regulations prohibited the payment of dividend equivalents on awards in 2018 and subsequent years, the number of Shares subject to award was determined by applying a 25 percentage discount factor to the Share price on award, as previously disclosed.\n- 3  LTIP and dividend equivalent figures for 2019 have been adjusted to reflect the share price on the date of vesting (6 March) 49.48 pence instead of the average price 59.34 pence reported in the 2019 report.\n- 4  Other remuneration payments comprise income from all employee share plans, which arises through employer matching or discounting of employee purchases.\n- 5  In June 2020, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) fined the Group for failures in relation to the handling of mortgage customers in payment difficulties or arrears. As a result, the Committee decided to apply a performance adjustment in respect of bonuses awarded to the Chief Risk Officer (among other senior colleagues) from 2011 to 2015 given his ultimate oversight. The number of shares adjusted was 68,536, and the value shown is calculated using the relevant deferred bonus award share price for each respective year.\n\n## Pension and benefits (audited)\n\n| Pension/Benefits \u00a3                             | Ant\u00f3nio   Horta-Os\u00f3rio 2020   | William Chalmers 2020   | Juan Colomb\u00e1s 2020   |\n|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|\n| Cash allowance in lieu of pension contribution | 194,201                       | 121,028                 | 85,456               |\n| Car or car allowance                           | 12,000                        | 12,000                  | 8,636                |\n| Flexible benefits payments                     | 50,772                        | 31,798                  | 23,848               |\n| Private medical insurance                      | 20,980                        | 1,130                   | 20,980               |\n| Tax preparation                                | 39,600                        | -                       | 14,640               |\n| Transportation (Chauffeur)                     | 35,908                        | -                       | 3,358                |\n| Subtotal for Total Benefits less pension       | 159,260                       | 44,928                  | 71,462               |\n\n## Defined benefits pension arrangements (audited)\n\nAnt\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio has a conditional unfunded pension commitment. This was a partial buy-out of a pension forfeited on joining from Santander/uni00A0Group. It is an Employer-Financed Retirement Benefits Scheme (EFRBS). The EFRBS provides benefits on a defined benefit basis at a normal retirement age of 65. The benefit in the EFRBS accrued during the six years following commencement of employment, therefore ceasing to accrue as of 31 December 2016.\n\nThe EFRBS was subject to performance conditions and it provided for a percentage of the Group Chief Executive's base salary or reference salary in the 12 months before retirement or leaving. No additional benefit is due in the event of early retirement. The rate of pension accrued in each year depended on, share price conditions being met. In March 2019, the Group Chief Executive asked that his defined benefit pension be based on a percentage of his pensionable salary in 2014. The total pension due is now fixed at 6 per cent of his 2014 reference salary of \u00a31,220,000, or \u00a373,200.\n\nThere are no other Executive Directors with defined benefit pension entitlements.\n\nUnder terms agreed when joining the Group, Juan Colomb\u00e1s is entitled to a conditional lump sum benefit of \u00a3718,996 on reaching normal retirement age of 65.",

5 is attributed to each scorecard measure based on its performance relative to target, resulting in an overall score ranging from a minimum of 1 to a maximum of 5, and hence with 3 being classed as 'at target'.\n\n## 2020 Group balanced scorecard\n\n15 equally weighted measures\n\n## Financial measures Weighting 33%\n\n| Measure                                                                                                              | Target   performance   | Actual   performance   |   Performance  score | Performance commentary                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Total block  score   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|\n| Cost:Income Ratio:  Total Cost as a % of  net income                                                                 | 48.2%                  | 55.3%                  |                    1 | The Finance measures were heavily impacted by  COVID-19 and the resulting economic downturn, resulting  in income being \u00a32.1bn below budget.                                                                                                                                           |                      |\n| Statutory Profit after tax:  Statutory  measure of Group profitability after costs  incl. tax                        | \u00a34,677m                | \u00a31,387m                |                    1 | The most significant impact is seen in the impairment  charge of \u00a34.3billion, which includes \u00a32.9billion not in  budget.                                                                                                                                                               |                      |\n| Capital Build:  Basis points of capital  build (excl. intangibles)                                                   | 181bps                 | 129bps                 |                    1 | The Group's balance sheet remains strong, with capital  build of 129bps before dividend accrual (excluding any  benefit from the revised treatment of intangible software  assets or reversal of the FY2019 dividend) and CET1 ratio  remaining well ahead of regulatory requirements. | 1.40                 |\n| Statutory Return on Tangible Equity: Statutory measure of shareholder value  creation                                | 12.6%                  | 3.7%                   |                    1 | The Return on Tangible Equity was impacted by COVID-19  in terms of both lower income and higher impairment  charges as the economic outlook deteriorated.                                                                                                                             |                      |\n| Investment Performance:  Measures the  Group's investment portfolio through 3  lenses of Benefits, Cost and Delivery | 11                     | 8                      |                    3 | The Investment Performance measure was impacted  by the Group's decision to re-prioritise the investment  portfolio and divert resources to support the response to  the pandemic.                                                                                                     |                      |\n\n## Customer measures Weighting 33%\n\nChosen to align to our KPI's and strategic objective of delivering a leading customer experience.

The closing market price of the Group's ordinary shares on that date was 45.68 pence. Shares vested are subject to a further two-year holding period. Remaining shares will vest over a period of 4 years and are subject to holding periods.\n- 2  2017 GOS award was eligible to receive an amount equal in value to any dividends paid during the performance period. Dividend equivalents have been paid based on the number of shares vested and have been paid in shares. The dividend equivalent shares were paid on 6 March 2020. The closing market price of the Group's ordinary shares on that date was 45.68 pence. The dividend equivalent shares are not subject to any holding period.\n- 3  All GOS have performance periods ending 31 December at the end of the three-year period. Awards were made in the form of conditional rights to free shares.\n- 4  In 2020, awards (in the form of conditional rights to free shares) were made with a value of 250 per cent of salary for Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio (8,281,379 shares with a face value of \u00a34,093,453) and 237.5/uni00A0per cent for William Chalmers (4,927,191 shares with a face value of \u00a32,435,491). No award was made to Juan Colomb\u00e1s. The share price used to calculate face value was 49.429 pence, the average mid market closing share price over the five days prior to grant (27 February to 4 March 2020). As regulations prohibit the payment of dividend on such awards, the number of shares awarded has been determined by applying a share price adjusted to exclude the value of estimated future dividends (38.3175 pence).\n- 5  2016 Sharesave options were not exercised due to the prevailing share price and lapsed on 1 July 2020.\n- 6  Part of GPS deferred into shares. The face value of the share awards in respect of deferred GPS granted in March 2020 was \u00a3156,423 (316,456 shares) for William Chalmers. The share price used to calculate the face value is the average price over the five days prior to grant (27 February to 4 March 2020), which was 49.4296 pence.

Shares vested are subject to a further one-year holding period.\n- 7  William Chalmers joined the Group on 3 June 2019 and was appointed as Chief Financial Officer on 1 August 2019 on the retirement of George Culmer. He was granted deferred cash of \u00a32,046,097 and deferred share awards over 4,086,632 Shares, to replace unvested awards from his former employer, Morgan Stanley, that were forfeited as a result of him joining the Group. The deferred cash and the number of Shares over which the deferred share awards were granted was calculated using the USD:GBP exchange rate of 1.2664 and the respective mid-market closing prices of William Chalmers' previous employer and the Group on 3 June 2019 (57.05 pence) resulting in a face value of the awards of \u00a34,377,521. The award is subject to vesting terms in line with those forfeited as set out above, and is on materially the same terms as the Executive Group Ownership Share (GOS), including the discretions as summarised on page 93 of the 2017 Annual Report, but as the award is a buy-out it is not subject to performance conditions and is not subject to time pro-rating in a good leaver circumstances.

The minimum shareholding requirements Executive Directors are expected to meet are as follows: 350 per cent of base salary for the Group Chief Executive and 250 per cent of base salary for other Executive Directors. Newly appointed individuals will have three years from appointment to achieve the shareholding requirement. In the event that exceptional individual circumstances exist resulting in an Executive not being able to comply with the Policy, the Remuneration Committee will consider whether an exception should apply.\n\nIn addition to the Group's shareholding requirements, shares vesting are subject to holding periods in line with regulatory requirements. For the year ending 31 December 2020, the Group Chief Executive continued to meet his shareholding requirements, as detailed within the illustration below. The Chief Financial Officer currently holds 153 per cent of his salary in shares and has until 2 June 2022 to achieve the requirement. At the time of his departure in September 2020 the Chief Operating Officer, Juan Colomb\u00e1s held 531 per cent of his salary in shares.\n\nThe Group does not operate a formal post-employment shareholding policy. Existing reward structures and the Long Term Share Plan under the proposed new Policy have been designed in line with regulatory requirements and ensure that a substantial proportion of variable reward for Executive Directors and other senior employees takes the form of shares deferred and held over a period of up to eight years. These structures already ensure that Executive Directors continue to meet our shareholding requirements for a minimum of two years after leaving the Group.\n\nNone of those who were Directors at the end of the year had any other interest in the capital of Lloyds Banking Group plc or its subsidiaries.\n\n| Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio   | Shareholding requirement Actual shareholding 1   | 350% 643%   |\n|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------|\n| Juan Colomb\u00e1s          | Shareholding requirement                         | 250%        |\n|                        | Actual shareholding 1                            | 531%        |\n| William Chalmers       | Shareholding requirement 2                       | 250%        |\n|                        | Actual shareholding 1                            | 153%        |\n\n- 2  The Chief Financial Officer has until 2 June 2022 to achieve the requirement.\n\nR\n\nis\n\nk\n\nm\n\na\n\nn\n\na\n\ng\n\nemen\n\nt",

The threshold was not met and therefore there are no GPS awards for 2020 performance.\n- 4  Lloyds Banking Group is not a contracting entity but considered this population to be appropriate for purposes of a 'All employees' calculation.\n\n## Gender pay\n\nWhile we have further reduced the mean pay gap this year to 30.5 per cent from 32.8 per cent in 2017 the pay gaps are still larger than we would like.\n\nOur ambitious goal of women comprising 40 per cent of our senior management by the end of 2020 has seen us advance from 27 per cent in 2014 to 37 per cent at the end of 2019. This demonstrates the significant progress we have made, and it would not have happened without the goal and all the measures we put into place. Further information is available at https://www.lloydsbankinggroup.com/assets/pdfs/who-we-are/responsible-business/ downloads/lbg-gender-pay-gap-report-2019-20.pdf/lloydsbankinggroup.com)\n\nFigures for 'All employees' are calculated using figures for all colleagues eligible for the GPS plan. This population is considered to be the most appropriate group of employees for these purposes because its remuneration structure is consistent with that of the Group Chief Executive. For 2020, 69,147 colleagues were included in this category.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|   Mean pay gap % |       |   Mean bonus gap % |       |\n|------------------|-------|--------------------|-------|\n|             2020 | 30.5% |               2020 | 62.5% |\n|             2019 | 30.9% |               2019 | 64.2% |\n\n## Ethnicity pay\n\nWhile there is currently no legal requirement to publish Ethnicity Pay Data in the UK, we are publishing this data not only because it is the right thing to do, but it also holds us to account for the goals we have set.\n\nOn average, and at all grades within Lloyds Banking Group, our Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic colleagues are not paid less than White colleagues. Instead our Ethnicity pay and bonus gaps reflect our organisational makeup.

The table below shows the ratios of the Group Chief Executive's total remuneration to the remuneration of colleagues since 2017. The change in the pay ratios for 2020 is explained in more detail below.\n\n|               | Total Compensation   | Total Compensation    | Total Compensation   | Total Compensation    | Fixed pay             | Fixed pay     | Fixed pay             |\n|---------------|----------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|---------------|-----------------------|\n| Year          | Methodology          | P25  (Lower Quartile) | P50  (Median)        | P75  (Upper Quartile) | P25  (Lower Quartile) | P50  (Median) | P75  (Upper Quartile) |\n| 2020          | A                    | 132:1                 | 95:1                 | 54:1                  | 103:1                 | 75:1          | 42:1                  |\n| 2019          | A                    | 179:1                 | 128:1                | 71:1                  | 114:1                 | 82:1          | 47:1                  |\n| 2018          | A                    | 237:1                 | 169:1                | 93:1                  | 113:1                 | 81:1          | 48:1                  |\n| 2017          | A                    | 245:1                 | 177:1                | 97:1                  | 113:1                 | 82:1          | 48:1                  |\n| Y-o-Y         |                      |                       | (26%)                |                       |                       | (9%)          |                       |\n| (2019 v 2020) |                      |                       |                      |                       |                       |               |                       |\n\n## Notes to the table:\n\n- The 2020 total remuneration for the colleagues identified at P25, P50 and P75 are as follows: \u00a326,135, \u00a3 36,165, \u00a363,522\n- The 2020 base salary for the colleagues identified at P25, P50 and P75 are as follows: \u00a322,617, \u00a331,953, \u00a353,857\n- The P25, P50 and P75 colleagues were determined on 31 December 2020 based on calculating total remuneration for all UK employees for the 2020 financial year. Payroll data from 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2020.\n- Methodology option A has been used and was selected on the basis that it provided the most accurate means of identifying the median, lower and upper quartile colleagues.\n- Colleague total remuneration has been calculated in line with the single total figure of remuneration. The single total figure of remuneration has been calculated for 64,767 UK colleagues within the Group for a full year including full-time equivalent base pay, vesting Group Ownership Share awards (for eligible colleagues), core benefits, pension, overtime and shift payments, travel/relocation payments (for eligible colleagues) and private medical benefit.\n- The average share price between 1 October 2020 and 31 December 2020 (32.62 pence) has been used to indicate the value of vesting Group Ownership Share awards.\n- The colleague identified at P50 did not receive a separate car benefit and does not participate in the long term incentive plan. As a result, the ratio does not provide a direct comparison to the total remuneration of the Group Chief Executive.\n- Due to operational constraints, the calculation of the colleague Pension Input Figure excludes inflationary adjustments for those on the defined benefit scheme. The omission of this factor does not materially affect the outcome of the ratio and/or distort the validity of the valuation.\n- All other data has been calculated in line with the methodology for the single total figure of remuneration for the Group Chief Executive.\n\nThe median ratio has decreased 26 per cent year-on-year. The reduction can be  attributed to the decision not to make awards under the Group Performance Share Plan; the reduction in the performance of vesting LTIP; reduced performance in the vesting of the 2018 Group Ownership plan compared to 2017 and the reduction in the Group Chief Executive's pension allowance from 33 per cent to 15 per cent of salary.\n\nThe Committee is thoughtful of the volatility in pay ratios due to variable reward outcomes. Although the pay ratio is used as a useful reference point to inform policy-setting, the Committee takes into account a number of other factors to assess colleague pay progression.\n\nFor the majority of colleagues, year-on-year changes in remuneration are principally driven by pay increases and the impacts of Group performance and collective adjustment which has resulted in a reduction in the bonus pool. The Group has a commitment to pay progression and a continued focus on ensuring higher pay awards for colleagues who are lower paid, or paid lower within their pay range. We are committed to reducing the pay gap between executives and wider colleagues and continue to remain focused on addressing the gap from the bottom up and not just from the top down. To support, the Group has a commitment to pay progression and a continued focus on ensuring higher pay awards for colleagues who are lower paid, or paid lower within their pay range.\n\nFor 2021, the pay budget has been set at 1.2 per cent, with the vast majority of colleagues receiving an above inflation pay increase. In addition a minimum pay award of \u00a3400 will apply for all eligible colleagues and pay awards of up to 2.2 per cent for the lowest paid colleagues. There was no pay budget for senior colleagues.\n\nWe believe our approach to pay progression has contributed to the reduction of the 2020 median pay ratio and supports reducing the gap  between executive and wider colleague pay over time.\n\nWe are proud to be an accredited Living Wage employer since 2015, and from April 2021 we will go further and raise the minimum salary for all fulltime colleagues to \u00a318,385, reflecting a rate of \u00a310.10 per hour which is 16 per cent greater than the National Living Wage 1 and 60 pence greater than current Living Wage Foundation's UK wide real Living Wage 2 .\n\n- 1  National Living wage rate of \u00a38.72 per hour\n- 2  National Real Living Wage  rate of \u00a39.50 per hour",

The Group proposes to operate the policy in the following way for 2021. No decisions have been reached on how the current Group Chief Executive will be treated for variable remuneration during 2021 (prior to departure), and this will be communicated in the normal course of business during 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Base Salary\n\nThe Group has applied a total pay budget of 1.2 per cent including a minimum pay award of \u00a3400 for eligible colleagues. The approach focuses on lower paid colleagues and colleagues lower in their pay range.\n\nIt was agreed that no salary increases would apply for the Group Chief Executive (GCE) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO). Salaries will therefore be as follows: Current Group Chief Executive: \u00a31,294,674 Chief Financial Officer: \u00a3810,837\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Fixed Share Award\n\nAwards remain unchanged from 2020\n\nas/uni00A0follows: Current Group Chief Executive: \u00a31,050,000 Chief Financial Officer: \u00a3504,000\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Pension\n\nPension allowances for all Executive Directors is set at 15 per cent of base salary. Any new Executive Director appointments in 2021 will also attract a maximum allowance of 15 per cent of base salary, this include the incoming/uni00A0Group Chief Executive.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Benefits\n\nBenefits remain unchanged from 2020. Executive Directors receive a flexible benefit allowance in line with colleagues, (4 per cent of base salary).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nShares will be released in equal tranches over three years. (See page 135 for further details).\n\nOver 50,000 colleagues participate in the Group's Defined Contribution (DC) Pension scheme where the maximum opportunity for the workforce is 15 per cent of base salary. Executive Directors employer pension contributions are therefore aligned with those available to the majority of the workforce.\n\nThis can be used to select benefits including life assurance and critical illness cover. Other benefits include car allowance, transportation, tax preparation and private medical cover.\n\n## Group Performance Share (Bonus)\n\nThe performance measures for determining any individual 2021 Group Performance Share awards for Executive Directors are outlined in the 2021 balanced scorecard below.\n\nIndividual maximum opportunities for Executive Directors remain unchanged from 2020 at 140 per cent of base salary for the current and incoming Group Chief Executive and 100 per cent for other Executive Directors.\n\nIndividual awards as a percentage of maximum will directly correlate to the overall performance assessment outcome.\n\nFor the 2021 performance year, any Group Performance Share opportunity will be awarded in March 2022 in a combination of cash (up to 50 per cent) and shares.\n\nIn accordance with the Policy, deferral and vesting of any Group Performance Share awards will be structured so that in\n\n## Incoming Group Chief Executive\n\nSalary: \u00a31,125,000 a reduction of 13 per cent compared to current incumbent.\n\n## Incoming Group Chief Executive\n\nFixed Share Award: \u00a31,050,000 no change compared to current incumbent.\n\nIn addition to the DC arrangement, the Group currently has almost 14,000 active members in defined benefit plans, with the effective cost of employer contributions into these arrangements being 38 per cent of salary.\n\ncombination with any award under the Long Term Share Plan, there will be a deferral of variable remuneration in line with applicable regulatory requirements (currently requiring a deferral of 60 per cent of variable remuneration for executive directors).\n\nFi\n\nn\n\na\n\nnc\n\ni\n\na\n\nl\n\nr\n\ne\n\nsu\n\nl\n\nt\n\ns",

        "page_content": "## Directors' remuneration report continued\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Long Term Share Plan\n\nIt is an important feature of the LTSP that performance is assessed and appropriately recognised upfront in the award size as there are no performance conditions that apply after the award is granted (only underpins see below). This is not however a mechanical outturn, as with GPS, and the Remuneration Committee may exercise its judgement.\n\n## Pre-grant test\n\nThe decision to award Long Term Share Plan awards for 2021 is based on the performance assessment from the 2020 balanced scorecard provided on page 121.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee concluded that the Group's score of 3.13 (out of 5) and specifically the performance of non-financial and strategic components within the scorecard which remain strong, supported making awards at the lower end of the range for normal expected performance (125 - 150 per cent of salary for Executive Directors). However, the Remuneration Committee considers that restraint should be shown in any reward for 2020 performance, and therefore has reduced the award recommended for the Chief Financial Officer from 125 per cent of salary to 75/uni00A0per/uni00A0cent of salary. This reduction of 40/uni00A0per cent is consistent with awards made to other members of senior management and applies in addition to the 50 per cent discount applied in setting the policy maximum when converting from the old LTIP to the new LTSP awards. There is no award for the Group Chief Executive.\n\n## Incoming Group Chief Executive\n\n## Salary:\n\nsee table above\n\n## Fixed Share Award:\n\nsee table above\n\n## Pension:\n\n15 per cent of salary, in accordance with the level set in the Directors' Remuneration Policy that aligns with arrangements for the majority of the workforce.\n\n## Group performance share:\n\nMaximum Group Performance Share award of 140 per cent of base salary.\n\n## Long Term Share Plan:\n\nMaximum award of 150 per cent of base salary.\n\nIn deciding to make this reduction in award size, the Group's share price was considered, as well as the following three questions:\n\n- Do the Group's financial results and capital position adequately reflect risk, conduct and any other non-financial considerations, including ESG?\n- Has the Group suffered a serious conduct event or has severe reputational damage arisen from the Group not living its values?\n- Has the bank lived up to its ambition to be the Best Bank for Customers?\n\nThe Committee concluded that the Group's strong capital position, positive reputation through 2020 and the support for customers and businesses during 2020 supported the making of awards. Risk was well managed and there was a material reduction in conductrelated costs. The Committee noted that there was still work to do toward achieving the Group's gender and diversity goals, but felt comfortable that these were reflected in stretch targets in the 2021 balanced scorecard.\n\n## Underpins\n\nThe underpins that will apply to the 2021 LTSP awards are:\n\n- CET 1 ratio - Group CET1 ratio above the guided management target each year, including all regulatory buffers\n- ROTE - Group ROTE exceeds the average for UK peer banks over the three years\n- Ordinary Dividend - Increased ordinary dividend payments over the plan period (subject to any further sector-wide regulatory constraints).\n\nThe peer comparator group for the ROTE underpin is set at Barclays Group PLC, HSBC Holdings PLC, Natwest Group PLC, Santander UK PLC and Virgin Money UK PLC. ROTE will be measured on the new basis adopted from 2021 and will take into\n\n## Buy out / lost opportunity award:\n\nOn appointment, Mr. Nunn will be granted deferred cash and share awards to replace, like for like, unvested HSBC awards that are forfeited as a result of him joining Lloyds Banking Group. The awards to be granted match the vesting and retention period attached to the awards being forfeited.\n\nIn addition, to acknowledge the loss in expected bonus awards from HSBC for the 2020 performance year, a 'lost opportunity' bonus award will be made on hire or as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter./uni00A0 The value of this award will be calculated by reference to the 2019 bonus, adjusted as appropriate by reference to HSBC's total Group bonus pool as disclosed in their 2020\n\naccount adjustments (as appropriate) for methodology differences between peers and any other factors the Remuneration Committee considers should reasonably be reflected, including relative under or outperformance or change in business mix.\n\nAwards will not be subject to further performance conditions however vesting will be subject to three underpins thresholds applicable for the first three years from grant. Each year the Remuneration Committee will monitor the Group's progress in relation to the underpins. An assessment will be made at the end of the three year period to determine whether the underpins have been successfully maintained over the three years and to what extent the LTSP award should vest. The Remuneration Committee also will retain the right to consider other factors and apply discretion prior to making a decision on vesting.\n\n## Pre-vest test\n\nIn conjunction with the assessment of performance against the underpins, the Remuneration Committee will consider the three core questions above to satisfy itself that the performance considered in the pre-grant test has been sustainable. The Remuneration Committee will retain the right to consider other factors and apply general discretion in making a decision on the vesting of awards.

The Committee will explain its reasons for applying discretion in either direction, or for not doing so\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts. The awards granted will be delivered in a mixture of cash and shares in accordance with the rules generally applicable to Lloyds Banking Group awards.\n\nDetails of these awards will be published during 2021.\n\n## Total reward:\n\nThe total maximum reward package for the incoming Group Chief Executive has been reduced by approximately 20 per cent from the current Directors' Remuneration Policy maximum that was approved at the 2020 AGM and is a total reduction of over 40/uni00A0per cent from the Policy in force until as recently as 2019.",

When determining the final outcome, the Remuneration Committee may consider any personal or business area objectives and whether there has been effective, consistent and proactive risk management and conduct outcomes across all dimensions.\n\nWhen assessing performance, the Committee can exercise its judgment to determine the appropriate outcome. This helps to avoid any potential unintended outcomes that might arise from the application of formulaic performance criteria.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                                       | Proposed measures and weightings                                                              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Targets        |\n|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|\n|                                       | Statutory ROTE Statutory profit after tax 20%                                                 | retrospectively in the 2021 Annual  Report alongside the level of  performance achieved, as the  plan and, where applicable, forward- looking guidance.

Individual adjustment may be applied\n\nthrough adjustments to balanced scorecard assessments and/or through reducing the variable remuneration outcome.\n\nAwards are subject to clawback for a period of up to seven years after the date of award which may be extended to 10 years where there is an ongoing internal or regulatory investigation.\n\nThe application of clawback will generally be considered when:\n\n- there is reasonable evidence of employee misbehaviour or material error; or\n- there is material failure of risk management at a Group, business area, division and/or business unit level.",

Lord Blackwell retired from the Board and the Committee on 1 January 2021. Anita Frew retired from the Board and the Committee on 21 May 2020. Stuart Sinclair has been Chair of the Committee since 1 September 2018 and has been a member of the Committee since January 2016. For further details of Committee membership and attendance at meetings, please see page 86.\n\nThe purpose of the Committee is to set the remuneration for all Executive Directors and the Chair, including pension rights and any compensation payments. It recommends and monitors the level and structure of remuneration for senior management and material risk takers. It also considers, agrees and recommends to the Board an overall remuneration policy and philosophy for the Group that is aligned with its long-term business strategy, its business objectives, its risk appetite, purpose and values and the long-term interests of the Group, and recognises the interests of relevant stakeholders, including the wider workforce. The Committee's operation is designed to ensure that no conflicts of interest arise, and in particular, the Committee ensures that no individual is present when matters relating to their own remuneration are discussed.\n\nMercer was appointed by the Committee in 2016 following a competitive tender process and was retained for 2020. The Committee is of the view that Mercer provides independent remuneration advice to the Committee and does not have any connections with the Group or any director that may impair its independence. The broader Mercer company provides unrelated advice on accounting and investments. During the year the Committee requested advice and independent research on market and best practice in relation to fixed and variable reward structures to support formulating the Policy. Mercer attended Committee meetings upon invitation and fees payable for the provision of services in 2020 were \u00a314,921.\n\nHow the Remuneration Committee spent its time in 2020 and compliance with the 2018 Corporate Governance Code\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                                                                                                                                                                                           | Key Highlights                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Oversight and approval                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| The total maximum reward  package for the new Group  Chief Executive has been  reduced by approximately  20 per cent from the  current Policy maximum  that was approved at the  2020 AGM | The search for a new Chief Executive has been a significant focus for the Remuneration Committee.

It is intended that approval of the remuneration policy will be sought at three-year intervals, unless amendments to the policy are required, in which case further shareholder approval will be sought; no changes are proposed for 2020. The full policy is set out in the 2019 annual report and accounts (pages 115 to 123) which is available at: 2019\\_lbg\\_annual\\_report.pdf (lloydsbankinggroup.com)\n\nThe tables in this section provide a summary of the Directors' remuneration policy. There is no significant difference between the policy for Executive Directors and that for other colleagues. Further information about the remuneration policy for other colleagues is set out in section 'Other remuneration disclosures' on page 138.\n\n## Remuneration policy table for Executive Directors\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Base salary\n\n## Purpose and link to strategy\n\nTo support the recruitment and retention of Executive Directors of the calibre required to develop and deliver the Group's strategic priorities. Base salary reflects the role of the individual, taking account of market competitiveness, responsibilities and experience, and pay in the Group as a/uni00A0whole.\n\n## Operation\n\nBase salaries are typically reviewed annually with any increases normally taking effect from 1 April for Executive Directors. When determining and reviewing base salary levels, the Committee takes into account base salary increases for employees throughout the Group and ensures that decisions are made within the following two parameters:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Fixed share award\n\n## Purpose and link to strategy\n\nTo ensure that total fixed remuneration is commensurate with role and to provide a competitive reward package for Executive Directors with an appropriate balance of fixed and variable remuneration, in line with regulatory requirements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Pension\n\n## Purpose and link to strategy\n\nTo provide cost effective and market competitive retirement benefits, supporting Executive Directors in building long-term retirement savings.\n\n## Operation\n\nExecutive Directors are entitled to participate in the Group's defined contribution scheme with company contributions set\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Benefits\n\n## Purpose and link to strategy\n\nTo provide flexible benefits as part of a competitive remuneration package.\n\n## Operation\n\nBenefits may include those currently provided and disclosed in the annual report on remuneration.\n\nCore benefits include a company car or car allowance, private medical insurance, life insurance and other benefits that may be selected through the Group's flexible benefits plan.\n\nAdditional benefits may be provided to individuals in certain circumstances such as\n\n- An objective assessment of the individual's responsibilities and the size and scope of their role, using objective job-sizing methodologies.\n- Pay for comparable roles in comparable publicly listed financial services groups of a similar size.\n\nSalary may be paid in sterling or other currency and at an exchange rate determined by the Committee.\n\n## Maximum Potential\n\nThe Committee will make no increase which it believes is inconsistent with the two parameters above. Increases will normally be in line with the increase awarded to the overall employee population. However, a\n\n## Operation\n\nThe fixed share award will be delivered entirely in Lloyds Banking Group shares, released over three years with 33 per cent being released each year following the year of award.

An individual may elect to receive some or all of their pension allowance as cash in lieu of pension contribution.\n\n## Maximum Potential\n\nThe maximum allowance for all Executive Directors is 15 per cent of base salary. All future appointments as Executive Directors will also attract a maximum allowance\n\nrelocation. This may include benefits such as accommodation, relocation, and travel. The Committee retains the right to provide additional benefits depending on individual circumstances.\n\nWhen determining and reviewing the level of benefits provided, the Committee ensures that decisions are made within the following two parameters:\n\n- An objective assessment of the individual's responsibilities and the size and scope of their role, using objective job-sizing methodologies.\n\ngreater salary increase may be appropriate in certain circumstances, such as a new appointment made on a salary below a market competitive level, where phased increases are planned, or where there has been an increase in the responsibilities of an individual. Where increases are awarded in excess of the wider employee population, the Committee will provide an explanation in the relevant annual report on remuneration.\n\n## Performance measures\n\nN/A\n\n## Maximum Potential\n\nThe maximum award is 100 per cent of base salary.\n\nPerformance measures N/A\n\nof 15/uni00A0per cent of base salary in line with the majority of the workforce.

The normal 'target' level of the Long Term Share award is 150 per cent of base salary.\n\nNo further performance conditions will apply.

        "page_content": "## Other remuneration disclosures\n\nThis section discloses the remuneration awards made by the Group to Material Risk Takers (MRTs) in respect of the 2020 performance year. Additional information summarising the Group's remuneration policies, structure and governance is also provided. These disclosures should be read in conjunction with the disclosures for Executive Directors contained in the Directors' Remuneration Report (DRR) on pages 115 to 137 and the Directors' Remuneration Policy (DRP) on pages 115 to 123 of the 2019 Annual Report. Together these disclosures comply with the requirements of Article 450 of the Capital Requirements Regulation (EU) No./uni00A0575/2013 (CRR).\n\nThe remuneration principles and practices detailed in the DRR apply to MRTs and non-MRTs in the same way as to Executive Directors (other than where stated in this disclosure).\n\nThe Group has applied the EBA Delegated Regulation (EU) No 604/2014 to determine which colleagues should be identified as MRTs. MRTs are colleagues who are considered to have a material impact on the Group's risk profile, and include, but are not limited to:\n\n- Senior management, Executive Directors, members and attendees of the Group Executive Committee (GEC) and their respective executive level direct reports\n- Non-Executive Directors\n- Approved persons performing significant influence functions (SIFs) and/ or all colleagues performing a senior management function\n- Other highly remunerated individuals whose activities could have a material impact on the Group's risk profile\n\n## Decision making process for remuneration policy\n\nThe Group has a strong belief in aligning the remuneration delivered to the Group's executives with the successful performance of the business and, through this, the delivery of long-term, superior and sustainable returns to shareholders. It has continued to seek the views of shareholders and other key stakeholders with regard to remuneration policy and seeks to motivate, incentivise and retain talent while being mindful of the economic outlook.\n\nThe overarching purpose of the Remuneration Committee is to consider, agree and recommend to the Board an overall remuneration policy and philosophy for the Group that is defined by, supports and is closely aligned to its long-term business strategy, business objectives, risk appetite and values and recognises the interests of relevant stakeholders. The remuneration policy governs all aspects of remuneration and applies in its entirety to all divisions, business units and companies in the Group, including wholly-owned overseas businesses and all colleagues, contractors and temporary staff. The Committee reviews the policy\n\nannually and Committee pays particular attention to the top management population, including the highest paid colleagues in each division, those colleagues who perform senior management functions for the Group and MRTs. During 2020 the Committee had 7/uni00A0scheduled meetings. Further details on the operation of the Remuneration Committee and independent advise received during the year can be found on page 134 of the DRR.\n\nThe Group has a robust governance framework, with the Remuneration Committee reviewing all compensation decisions for Executive Directors, senior management, senior risk and compliance officers, high earners and any other MRTs. This approach to governance is cascaded through the Group with the Group People Committee having oversight for all other colleagues.\n\n## Governance and risk management\n\nAn essential component of the approach to remuneration is the governance process that underpins it. This ensures that the policy is robustly applied and risk is managed appropriately. In addition to setting the overall remuneration policy and philosophy for the Group, the Remuneration Committee ensures that colleagues who could have a material impact on the Group's risk profile are provided with appropriate incentives and reward to encourage them to enhance the performance of the Group and that they are recognised for their individual contribution to the success of the organisation, whilst ensuring that there is no reward for excessive risk taking. The Remuneration Committee works closely with the Risk Committee in ensuring the Group Performance Share (GPS) plan outcome is moderated. The two Committees determine whether the proposed GPS outcome and performance assessments adequately reflect the risk appetite and framework of the Group; whether it took account of current and future risks; and whether any further adjustment is required or merited. The Group and the Remuneration Committee are determined to ensure that the aggregate of the variable remuneration for all colleagues is appropriate and balanced with the interests of shareholders and all other stakeholders.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee's terms of reference are available from the Company Secretary and are displayed on the Group's website, www.lloydsbankinggroup.com/ ourgroup/ corporate-governance. These terms are reviewed each year to ensure compliance with the remuneration regulations and were last updated in November 2020.\n\n## Link between pay and performance\n\nThe Group's approach to reward is intended to provide a clear link between remuneration and delivery of its key strategic objectives, supporting the aim of becoming the best bank for customers, and through that, for shareholders. To this end, the performance management process has been developed,\n\nwith the close participation of the Group's Risk team, to ensure there is a clear alignment between award outcomes and individual performance, growth and development, whilst also reflecting divisional achievement.\n\nThe use of a balanced scorecard approach to measure performance enables the Remuneration Committee to assess the performance of the Group and its senior executives in a consistent and performancedriven way. The Group's remuneration policy supports the business values and strategy, based on building long-term relationships with customers and colleagues and managing the financial consequences of business decisions across the entire economic cycle. Further detail can be found in the DRR and the DRP. In particular, see pages 121 to 122.\n\n## Design and structure of remuneration\n\nWhen establishing the remuneration policy and associated frameworks, the Group is required to take into account its size, organisation and the nature, scope and complexity of its activities. For the purpose of remuneration regulation, Lloyds Bank/uni00A0plc is treated as a Proportionality level I firm and therefore subject to the more onerous remuneration rules.\n\nRemuneration is delivered via a combination of fixed and variable remuneration. Fixed remuneration reflects the role, responsibility and experience of a colleague. Variable remuneration is based on an assessment of individual, business area and Group performance. The mix of variable and fixed remuneration is driven by seniority, grade and role. Taking into account the expected value of awards, the performance-related elements of pay make up a considerable proportion of the total remuneration package for MRTs, whilst maintaining an appropriate balance between the fixed and variable elements. The maximum ratio of variable to fixed remuneration for MRTs is 200 per cent, which has been approved by shareholders (98.77/uni00A0per/uni00A0cent of votes cast) at the AGM on/uni00A015/uni00A0May 2014.\n\nRemuneration for control functions is set in relation to benchmark market data to ensure that it is possible to attract and retain staff with the appropriate knowledge, experience and skills. An appropriate balance between fixed and variable compensation supports this approach. Generally, control function staff receive a higher proportion of fixed remuneration than other colleagues and the aggregate ratio of fixed to variable remuneration for all control function staff does not exceed 100 per cent. Particular attention is paid to ensure remuneration for control function staff is linked to the performance of their function and independent from the business areas they control.",

        "page_content": "## Risk management\n\n## Risk management is at the heart of Helping Britain Recover and building the UK's preferred financial partner.\n\nOur mission is to protect our customers, shareholders, colleagues and the Group, while enabling sustainable growth in targeted segments. This is achieved through informed risk decisions and robust risk management, supported by a consistent risk-focused culture.\n\nThe risk overview (pages/uni00A056 to 59) provides a summary of risk management within the Group and the key focus areas for 2020, including the significant impact that COVID-19 has had on all principal risks faced by the Group. The risk overview also highlights the importance of the connectivity of principal, emerging and strategic risks and how they are embedded in to the Group's strategic risk management framework.\n\nThis full risk management section provides a more in-depth picture of how risk is managed within the Group, detailing the Group's emerging risks, approach to stress testing, risk governance, committee structure, appetite for risk and a full analysis of the principal risk categories (pages/uni00A0153 to 204), the framework by which risks are identified, managed, mitigated and monitored.\n\nEach principal risk category is described and managed using the following standard headings: definition, exposures, measurement, mitigation and monitoring.\n\n## The Group's approach to risk\n\nThe Group operates a prudent approach to risk with rigorous management controls to support sustainable business growth and minimise losses. Through a strong and independent risk function (Risk division), a robust control framework is maintained to identify and escalate current and emerging risks, support sustainable growth within the Group's risk appetite, and to drive and inform good risk reward decision-making.\n\nTo meet ring-fencing requirements, core UK retail financial services and ancillary retail activities are ring-fenced from other activities of the Group. The Group's enterprise risk management framework (ERMF) and Group risk appetite apply across the Group and are supplemented by risk management frameworks and risk appetites for the sub-groups to meet sub-group specific needs. In each case these operate within the Group parameters. The Group's corporate governance framework applies across Lloyds Banking Group plc, Lloyds Bank plc, Bank of Scotland plc and HBOS plc. It is tailored where needed to meet the entity specific needs of Lloyds Bank plc and Bank of Scotland plc, and supplementary corporate governance frameworks are in place to address sub-group specific requirements of the other sub-groups (Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets, Insurance and Lloyds Banking Group Equity Investments).\n\nThe Group's ERMF is structured to align with the industry-accepted internal control framework standards.\n\nThe ERMF applies to every area of the business and covers all types of risk. It is reviewed, updated and approved by the Board at least annually to reflect any changes in the nature of the Group's business and external regulations, law, corporate governance and industry best practice. The ERMF provides the Group with an effective mechanism for developing and embedding risk policies and risk management strategies which are aligned with the risks faced by its businesses. It also seeks to facilitate effective communication on these matters across the Group.\n\n## Role of the Board and senior management\n\nKey responsibilities of the Board and senior management include:\n\n- approval of the ERMF and Board risk appetite\n- approval of Group-wide risk principles and policies\n- the cascade of delegated authority (for example to Board subcommittees and the Group Chief Executive)\n- effective oversight of risk management consistent with risk appetite\n\n## Risk appetite\n\nRisk appetite is defined within the Group as 'the amount and type of risk that the Group is prepared to seek, accept or tolerate' in delivering its strategy.\n\nGroup strategy and risk appetite are developed in tandem. Business planning aims to optimise value within the Group's risk appetite parameters and deliver on its promise to Help Britain Prosper.\n\nThe Group's risk appetite statement details the risk parameters within which the Group operates. The statement forms part of the Group's control framework and is embedded into its policies, authorities and limits, to guide decision-making and risk management. The Board is responsible for approving the Group's risk appetite statement at least annually. Group Board-level metrics are cascaded into more detailed business appetite metrics and limits.\n\nGroup risk appetite includes the following areas:\n\nClimate: the Group takes action to identify, manage and mitigate its climate risk and support the Group and its customers in transitioning to a low carbon economy\n\nMarket: /uni00A0the Group has robust controls in place to manage its inherent market risk and does not engage in any proprietary trading, reflecting the customer focused nature of the Group's activities\n\nCredit: /uni00A0the Group has a conservative and well balanced credit portfolio through the economic cycle, generating an appropriate return on equity, in line with the Group's target return on equity in aggregate\n\nFunding and liquidity: the Group maintains a prudent liquidity profile and a balance sheet structure that limits its reliance on potentially volatile sources of funding\n\nCapital: /uni00A0the Group maintains capital levels commensurate with a prudent level of solvency to achieve financial resilience and market confidence\n\nChange/execution: /uni00A0the Group has limited appetite for negative impacts on customers, colleagues, or the Group as a result of change activity\n\nConduct: the Group delivers fair outcomes for its customers\n\nData: /uni00A0the Group has zero appetite for material regulatory breaches and/uni00A0material legal incidents\n\nPeople: the Group leads responsibly and proficiently, manages people resource effectively, supports and develops colleague talent, and meets legal and regulatory obligations related to its people\n\nOperational resilience: /uni00A0the Group has a limited appetite for disruption to services to customers and stakeholders from significant unexpected events\n\nOperational: /uni00A0the Group has robust controls in place to manage operational losses, reputational events and regulatory breaches. It identifies and assesses emerging risks and acts to mitigate these\n\nModel:/uni00A0 material models are performing in line with expectations\n\nRegulatory and legal: the Group interprets and complies with all relevant regulation and all applicable laws (including codes of conduct which could have legal implications) and/or legal obligations",

        "page_content": "## Governance frameworks\n\nThe Group's approach to risk is founded on a robust control framework and a strong risk management culture which are the foundation for the delivery of effective risk management and guide the way all employees approach their work, behave and make decisions.\n\nGovernance is maintained through delegation of authority from the Board to individuals through the management hierarchy. Senior executives are supported where required by a committee based structure which is designed to ensure open challenge and support effective decision-making.\n\nThe Group's risk appetite, principles, policies, procedures, controls and reporting are regularly reviewed and updated where needed to ensure they remain fully in-line with regulation, law, corporate governance and industry good practice.\n\nThe interaction of the executive and non-executive governance structures relies upon a culture of transparency and openness that is encouraged by both the Board and senior management.\n\nBoard-level engagement, coupled with the direct involvement of senior management in Group-wide risk issues at Group Executive Committee level, ensures that escalated issues are promptly addressed and remediation plans are initiated where required.\n\nLine managers are directly accountable for identifying and managing risks in their individual businesses, ensuring that business decisions strike an appropriate balance between risk and reward and are consistent with the Group's risk appetite.\n\nClear responsibilities and accountabilities for risk are defined across the Group through a three lines of defence model which ensures effective independent oversight and assurance in respect of key decisions.\n\nThe risk committee governance framework is outlined on page 150.\n\n## Three lines of defence model\n\nThe ERMF is implemented through a 'three lines of defence' model which defines clear responsibilities and accountabilities and ensures effective independent oversight and assurance activities take place covering key decisions.\n\nBusiness lines (first line) have primary responsibility for risk decisions, identifying, measuring, monitoring and controlling risks within their areas of accountability. They are required to establish effective governance and control frameworks for their business to be compliant with Group policy requirements, to maintain appropriate risk management skills, mechanisms and toolkits, and to act within Group risk appetite parameters set and approved by the Board.\n\nRisk division (second line) is a centralised function, headed by the Chief Risk Officer, providing oversight and independent constructive challenge to the effectiveness of risk decisions taken by business management, providing proactive advice and guidance, reviewing, challenging and reporting on the risk profile of the Group and ensuring that mitigating actions are appropriate.\n\nIt also has a key role in promoting the implementation of a strategic approach to risk management reflecting the risk appetite and ERMF agreed by the Board that encompasses:\n\n- overseeing embedding of effective risk management processes\n- transparent, focused risk monitoring and reporting\n- provision of expert and high quality advice and guidance to the Board, executives and management on strategic issues and horizon scanning, including pending regulatory changes\n- a constructive dialogue with the first line through provision of advice, development of common methodologies, understanding, education, training, and development of new risk management tools\n\nThe primary role of Group Internal Audit (third line) is to help the/uni00A0Board and executive management protect the assets, reputation and sustainability of the Group. Group Internal Audit is led by the Group Chief Internal Auditor. Group Internal Audit provides independent assurance to the Audit Committee and the Board through performing reviews and engaging with committees and executive management, providing opinion, challenge and informal advice on risk and the state of the control environment. Group Internal Audit is a single independent internal audit function, reporting to the Audit Committee of the Group and the Audit Committees of the key subsidiaries.\n\n## Risk and control cycle from identification to reporting\n\nTo allow senior management to make informed risk decisions, the business follows a continuous risk management approach which includes producing appropriate, accurate and focused risk reporting. The risk and control cycle sets out how this should be approached, with the appropriate controls and processes in place. This cycle, from identification to reporting, ensures consistency and is intended to manage and mitigate the risks impacting the Group.\n\nThe process for risk identification, measurement and control is integrated into the overall framework for risk governance. Risk identification processes are forward-looking to ensure emerging risks are identified. Risks are captured and measured using robust and consistent quantification methodologies. The measurement of risks includes the application of stress testing and scenario analysis, and considers whether relevant controls are in place before risks are incurred.\n\nIdentified risks are reported on a monthly basis or as frequently as necessary to the appropriate committee. The extent of the risk is compared to the overall risk appetite as well as specific limits or triggers. When thresholds are breached, committee minutes are clear on the actions and time frames required to resolve the breach and bring risk within tolerances. There is a clear process for escalation of risks and risk events.\n\nAll key controls are recorded and assessed on a regular basis, in response to triggers or minimum annually. Control assessments consider both the adequacy of the design and operating effectiveness. Where a control is not effective, the root cause is established and action plans implemented to improve control design or performance. Control Effectiveness against all residual risks is reported and monitored via the monthly Consolidated Risk Report (CRR). The CRR is reviewed and independently challenged by the Risk Division and provided to the Risk Division Executive Committee and Group Risk Committee. On an annual basis, a point in time assessment is made for control effectiveness against each risk category and across sub-groups. The CRR data is the primary source used for this point in time assessment and a year on year comparison on control effectiveness is reported to the Board.\n\nOne Risk and Control Self-Assessment (One RCSA) is part of the Group's Risk and Control Strategy to deliver a stronger risk culture and simplified risk and control environment. The three lines of defence have worked together to identify improvements to the Group's approach to risk management. Following pilot activity, this new approach (One RCSA) is being adopted across the Group through a phased implemented plan. All aspects of the 2020 Plan for implementation of One RCSA have been delivered. The 2021 plans capture the remaining highest risks to customers and the business, and the Board will continue to review progress with embedding the cultural change and improving the risk and control environment.\n\n## Risk culture\n\nBased on the Group's prudent business model, prudent approach to risk management, and guided by the Board, the senior management articulates the core risk values to which the Group aspires, and sets the tone at the top. Senior Management establishes a strong focus on building and sustaining long-term relationships with customers, through the economic cycle. The Group's Code of Responsibility reinforces colleagues' accountability for the risks they take and their responsibility to prioritise their customers' needs.\n\n## Risk resources and capabilities\n\nAppropriate mechanisms are in place to avoid over-reliance on key personnel or system/technical expertise within the Group. Adequate resources are in place to serve customers both under normal working conditions and in times of stress, and monitoring procedures are in place to ensure that the level of available resource can be increased if required. Colleagues undertake appropriate training to ensure they have the skills and knowledge necessary to enable them to deliver fair outcomes for customers.\n\nThere is ongoing investment in risk systems and models alongside the Group's investment in customer and product systems and processes. This drives improvements in risk data quality, aggregation and reporting leading to effective and efficient risk decisions.",

It is fully embedded in the planning process of the Group and its legal entities as a key activity in medium-term planning, and senior management is actively involved in stress testing activities via a strict governance process.\n\nScenario stress testing is used for:\n\nRisk Identification:\n\n- Understand key vulnerabilities of the Group and its key legal entities under adverse economic conditions\n\nRisk Appetite:\n\n- Assess the results of the stress test against the risk appetite of all parts of the Group to ensure the Group and its legal entities are managed within their risk parameters\n- Inform the setting of risk appetite by assessing the underlying risks under stress conditions\n\nStrategic and Capital Planning:\n\n- Allow senior management and the Boards of the Group and its applicable legal entities to adjust strategies if the plan does not meet risk appetite in a stressed scenario\n- Support the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) by demonstrating capital adequacy, and meet the requirements of regulatory stress tests that are used to inform the setting of the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and management buffers (see capital risk on pages 188 to 196) of the Group and its separately regulated legal entities\n\nRisk Mitigation:\n\n- Drive the development of potential actions and contingency plans to mitigate the impact of adverse scenarios. Stress testing also links directly to the recovery planning process of the Group and its legal entities\n\n## Regulatory stress tests\n\nThe PRA have launched the 2021 Solvency Stress test which the Group will participate in./uni00A0Their objective is to update the Bank of England's Financial Policy Committee (FPC) view on how the banking system can support the economy, ensure banks have built up buffers of capital to be drawn on in a stress and input into the PRA's transition back to its standard approach to capital-setting and shareholder distributions through 2021. Industry level credit risk will be published in July with Bank level results published in December. The scenario requires the bank to show how resilient it is to a severe economic shock in addition to what has been experienced over 2020; House/uni00A0Price Index (HPI) and Commercial Real Estate (CRE) values fall a further 33 per cent and unemployment peaks at 11.9 per cent.\n\n## Internal stress tests\n\nOn at least an annual basis, the Group conducts macroeconomic stress tests of the operating plan, which are supplemented with higher-level refreshes if necessary. The exercise aims to highlight the key vulnerabilities of the Group's and its legal entities' business plans to adverse changes in the economic environment, and to ensure that there are adequate financial resources in the event of a downturn.\n\n## Reverse stress testing\n\nReverse stress testing is used to explore the vulnerabilities of the Group's and its key legal entities' strategies and plans to extreme adverse events that would cause the businesses to fail. Where this identifies plausible scenarios with an unacceptably high risk, the Group or its entities will adopt measures to prevent or mitigate that and reflect these in strategic plans.\n\n## Other stress testing activity\n\nThe Group's stress testing programme also involves undertaking assessments of liquidity scenarios, market risk sensitivities and scenarios, and business specific scenarios (see the principal risk categories on pages 153 to 204 for further information on risk-specific stress testing). If required, ad hoc stress testing exercises are also undertaken to assess emerging risks, as well as in response to regulatory requests. This wide ranging programme provides a comprehensive view of the potential impacts arising from the risks to which the Group is exposed and reflects the nature, scale and complexity of the Group./uni00A0The Group will undertake the Bank of England's Climate Biennial Exploratory Stress test in 2021 and will leverage the experience gained through that exercise to further embed climate risk into stress testing activities.\n\n## Methodology\n\nThe stress tests at all levels must comply with all regulatory requirements, achieved through the comprehensive construction of macroeconomic scenarios and a rigorous divisional, functional, risk and executive review and challenge process, supported by analysis and insight into impacts on customers and business drivers.\n\nThe engagement of all required business, Risk and Finance teams is built into the preparation process, so that the appropriate analysis of each risk category's impact upon the business plans is understood and documented. The methodologies and modelling approach used for stress testing ensure that a clear link is shown between the macroeconomic scenarios, the business drivers for each area and the resultant stress testing outputs. All material assumptions used in modelling are documented and justified, with a clearly communicated review and sign-off process. Modelling is supported by expert judgement and is subject to the Group Model Governance Policy.\n\n## Governance\n\nClear accountabilities and responsibilities for stress testing are assigned to senior management and the Risk and Finance functions throughout the Group and its key legal entities. This is formalised through the Group Business Planning and Stress Testing Policy and Procedure, which are reviewed at least annually.\n\nThe Group Financial Risk Committee (GFRC), chaired by the Chief Risk Officer and attended by the Chief Financial Officer and other senior Risk and Finance colleagues, is the committee that has primary responsibility for overseeing the development and execution of the Group's and Ring-Fenced Bank's stress tests. Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets (LBCM) Risk Committee performs a similar function within the scope of LBCM.\n\nThe review and challenge of the Group's and Ring-Fenced Bank's detailed stress forecasts, the key assumptions behind these, and the methodology used to translate the economic assumptions into stressed outputs conclude with the appropriate Finance and Risk Directors' sign-off. The outputs are then presented to GFRC and Board Risk Committee for review and challenge, before being approved by the Board. There is a similar process within LBCM for the governance of the LBCM-specific results.",

These losses may be realised from physical events, the required adaptation in transitioning to a low carbon economy, or as a consequence of the responses to managing these changes.\n\n## Exposures\n\nClimate risk can arise from:\n\n- Physical risks - changes in climate or weather patterns which are acute, event driven (e.g. flood), or chronic, longer term shifts (e.g. rising sea levels)\n- Transition risks - associated with the move towards a low carbon economy, e.g. changes to policy, legislation and regulation, technology and changes to customer preferences. Failure to manage these changes and adapt to climate change could then result in legal risks\n\nClimate risk manifests through, and has potential to impact, the Group's existing principal financial and non-financial risks. Climate risk is included as both a principal and emerging risk this year given it is such a new and fast moving area. The Group has undertaken an analysis of how the its principal risks are impacted by climate change. For further information see page/uni00A026 in the 2020 Lloyds Banking Group ESG Report.\n\nThe Group has identified loans and advances to customers in sectors at increased risk from the impacts of climate change, see page/uni00A023.\n\n## Measurement\n\nThe Group is continuing to develop its modelling and assessment capabilities for quantifying climate risk, including building a greater understanding through climate scenario analysis.\n\nIn 2020, the Group has approved a Risk Appetite Statement for climate risk, as well as an interim metric to ensure the Group continues to progress activities at pace, and also included commentary on climate-related risks as part of the Group's annual ICAAP, using expert judgement to assess the financial impacts under a number of different climate scenarios.\n\nThe Group has also developed and is piloting a tool in Commercial Banking to qualitatively assess the physical and transition risks relating to the Group's clients.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nThe Group has twelve external sector statements that help articulate appropriate areas of climate related risk appetite and the Group's approach to the risk assessment of its customers. The Group is continuing to refine and enhance these statements.\n\nAs part of the Group's credit risk policy, we have mandatory requirements to consider environmental risks in key risk management activities. In Commercial Banking, Relationship Managers must ensure that sustainability risk is considered for all new and renewal facilities, and specifically commented on where credit limits exceed \u00a3500,000.\n\nOther initiatives to further embed climate risk factors into the risk management activities across the Group include: development of a risk mitigation strategy for vehicle finance and home loans in Retail; and further development of the Group's weather modelling capabilities in Insurance, where an assessment of climate-related risks to General Insurance liabilities is integrated into the internal model governance process.\n\nThe Group is continuing to develop its climate risk management framework to ensure all activities consider the appropriate climate-related risks and opportunities and the Group's processes will continue to evolve as it embeds its approach.\n\n## Monitoring\n\nGovernance for climate-related risk is embedded into the Group's existing governance structure and is complementary to governance of the Group's sustainability strategy.\n\nClimate risk is monitored in the Group's risk reporting and more detailed updates are provided regularly to the Group and Ring-Fenced Banks Board Risk Committees regarding the Group's climate risk management activities and key developments.",

Within the Group's balance sheet these fall under the trading assets and liabilities and derivative financial instruments. The assets and liabilities are classified as trading book if they meet the requirements as set out in the Capital Requirements Regulation, article 104. Further information on these activities can be found under the Trading portfolios section on page 159.\n\nDerivative assets and liabilities are held by the Group for three main purposes; to provide risk management solutions for clients, to manage portfolio risks arising from client business and to manage and hedge the Group's own risks./uni00A0Insurance business assets and liabilities relate to policyholder funds, as well as shareholder invested assets, including annuity funds. The Group recognises the value of/uni00A0\n\nin-force business in respect of Insurance's long-term life assurance contracts as an asset in the balance sheet (see note/uni00A023, page/uni00A0267).\n\nThe Group ensures that it has adequate cash and balances at central banks and stocks of high quality liquid assets (e.g. gilts or US Treasury securities) that can be converted easily into cash to meet liquidity requirements. The majority of these assets are asset swapped and held at fair value through other comprehensive income with the remainder held as financial assets at fair value through profit and loss. Further information on these balances can be found under funding and liquidity risk on page 183.\n\nThe majority of debt issuance originates from the Group's capital and funding activities and the interest rate risk of the debt issued is hedged by swapping them into a floating rate.\n\nThe non-trading book primarily consists of customer on-balance sheet activities and the Group's capital and funding activities, which expose it to the risk of adverse movements in market rates or prices, predominantly interest rates, credit spreads, exchange rates and equity prices, as described in further detail within the Banking activities section (page/uni00A0156).",

        "page_content": "## Risk management continued\n\n## Measurement\n\nIn addition to measuring single factors, Group risk appetite is calibrated primarily to five multi-risk Group economic scenarios, and is supplemented with sensitivity-based measures. The scenarios assess the impact of unlikely, but plausible, adverse stresses on income with the worst case for banking activities, defined benefit pensions, insurance and trading portfolios reported against independently, and across the Group as a whole.\n\nThe Group risk appetite is cascaded first to the Group Asset and Liability Committee (GALCO), chaired by the Chief Financial Officer, where risk appetite is approved and monitored by risk type, and then to the Group Market Risk Committee (GMRC) where risk appetite is sub-allocated by division. These metrics are reviewed regularly by senior management to inform effective decision-making.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nGALCO is responsible for approving and monitoring group market risks, management techniques, market risk measures, behavioural assumptions, and the market risk policy. Various mitigation activities are assessed and undertaken across the Group to manage portfolios and seek to ensure they remain within approved limits. The mitigation actions will vary dependent on exposure but will, in general, look to reduce risk in a cost effective manner by offsetting balance sheet exposures and externalising to the financial markets dependent on market liquidity. The market risk policy is owned by Group Corporate Treasury (GCT) and refreshed annually. The policy is underpinned by supplementary market risk procedures, which define specific market risk management and oversight requirements.\n\n## Monitoring\n\nGALCO and GMRC regularly review high level market risk exposure as part of the wider risk management framework. They also make recommendations to the Board concerning overall market risk appetite and market risk policy. Exposures at lower levels of delegation are monitored at various intervals according to their volatility, from daily in the case of trading portfolios to monthly or quarterly in the case of less volatile portfolios. Levels of exposures compared to approved limits and triggers are monitored by Risk and appropriate escalation procedures are in place.\n\nHow market risks arise and are managed across the Group's activities is considered in more detail below.\n\n## Banking activities\n\n## Exposures\n\nThe Group's banking activities expose it to the risk of adverse movements in market rates or prices, predominantly interest rates, credit spreads, exchange rates and equity prices. The volatility of market rates or prices can be affected by both the transparency of prices and the amount of liquidity in the market for the relevant asset, liability or instrument.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nYield curve risk in the Group's divisional portfolios, and in the Group's capital and funding activities arises from the different repricing characteristics of the Group's non-trading assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet positions.\n\nBasis risk arises from the potential changes in spreads between indices, for example where the bank lends with reference to a central bank rate but funds with reference to LIBOR, and the spread between these two rates widens or tightens.\n\nOptionality risk arises predominantly from embedded optionality within assets, liabilities or off-balance sheet items where either the Group or the customer can affect the size or timing of cash flows. One example of this is mortgage prepayment risk where the customer owns an option allowing them to prepay when it is economical to do so. This can result in customer balances amortising more quickly or slowly than anticipated due to customers' response to changes in economic conditions.\n\n## Foreign exchange risk\n\nEconomic foreign exchange exposure arises from the Group's investment in its overseas operations (net investment exposures are disclosed in note 51 on page 314). In addition, the Group incurs foreign exchange risk through non-functional currency flows from services provided by customer-facing divisions, the Group's debt and capital management programmes and is exposed to volatility in its CET1 ratio, due to the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on the retranslation of non-sterling- denominated RWAs.\n\n## Equity risk\n\nEquity risk arises primarily from three different sources:\n\n- the Group's private equity investments held by Lloyds Development Capital within the Equities sub-group\n- the Group's strategic equity holdings, for example Visa Inc Preference Shares, now held in the Equities sub-group\n- a small exposure to Lloyds Banking Group share price through deferred shares and deferred options granted to employees as part of their benefits package\n\n## Credit spread risk\n\nCredit spread risk arises largely from (i) the liquid asset portfolio held in the management of Group liquidity, comprising of government, supranational and other eligible assets; (ii) the Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) and Debt Valuation Adjustment (DVA) sensitivity to credit spreads; (iii) a number of the Group's structured medium-term notes where the Group has elected to fair value the notes through the profit and loss account; and (iv) banking book assets in Commercial Banking held at fair value under IFRS 9.\n\n## Measurement\n\nInterest rate risk exposure is monitored monthly using, primarily:\n\nMarket value sensitivity: this methodology considers all repricing mismatches (behaviourally adjusted where appropriate) in the current balance sheet and calculates the change in market value that would result from an instantaneous 25, 100 and 200 basis points parallel rise or fall in the yield curve. GBP interest rates are modelled with a floor at zero per cent, with negative rate floors modelled for non-GBP currencies where appropriate (product-specific floors apply). The market value sensitivities are calculated on a static balance sheet using principal cash flows excluding interest, commercial margins and other spread components and are therefore discounted at the risk free rate.\n\nInterest income sensitivity: this measures the 12 month impact on future net interest income arising from various economic scenarios. These include instantaneous 25, 100 and 200 basis point parallel shifts in all yield curves and the five Group economic scenarios. GBP interest rates are modelled with a floor at zero per cent, with negative rate floors modelled for non-GBP currencies where appropriate (product-specific floors apply). These scenarios are reviewed every year and are designed to replicate severe but plausible economic events, capturing risks that would not be evident through the use of parallel shocks alone such as basis risk and steepening or flattening of the yield curve. Additional negative rate scenarios are also used, where floors are removed or lowered, to ensure that this risk is monitored; however these are not measured against the limit framework for the purposes of Risk Appetite.\n\nUnlike the market value sensitivities, the interest income sensitivities incorporate additional behavioural assumptions as to how and when individual products would reprice in response to changing rates. In addition a dynamic balance sheet is used which includes the run-off of current assets and liabilities and the addition of planned new business.\n\nReported sensitivities are not necessarily predictive of future performance as they do not capture additional management actions that would likely be taken in response to an immediate, large, movement in interest rates. These actions could reduce the net interest income sensitivity, help mitigate any adverse impacts or they may result in changes to total income that are not captured in the net interest income.\n\nStructural hedge: the structural hedging programme managing interest rate risk in the banking book relies on assumptions made around customer behaviour. A number of metrics are in place to monitor the risks within the portfolio.",

This provides a single consolidated tool to measure and manage interest rate repricing profiles (including behavioural assumptions), perform stress testing and produce forecast outputs.

A full behavioural review is performed annually, or in response to changing market conditions, to ensure the assumptions remain appropriate and the model itself is subject to annual re-validation, as required under the Group Model Governance Policy.

        "page_content": "## Risk management continued\n\nNet interest income sensitivity, to up 100bps, has increased year-on-year in part due to the growth in customer deposits and account management activity/uni00A0during 2020. This would result in widening margins in a rates up scenario, increasing net interest income.\n\nThe decrease in risk sensitivity year-on-year, to down 100bps, is driven by a reduction in modelled margin compression risk following the fall in interest rates in 2020. This is due to the Group's assumptions for modelling GBP interest rates with a floor of zero per cent (product-specific floors apply) which limits the down-shock applied./uni00A0\n\nBasis risk, foreign exchange, equity, and credit spread risks are measured primarily through scenario analysis by assessing the impact on profit before tax over a 12 month horizon arising from a change in market rates, and reported within the Board risk appetite on a monthly basis. Supplementary measures such as sensitivity and exposure limits are applied where they provide greater insight into risk positions. Frequency of reporting supplementary measures varies from daily to quarterly appropriate to each risk type.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nThe Group's policy is to optimise reward whilst managing its market risk exposures within the risk appetite defined by the Board. The Group Market Risk Policy and procedures outlines the hedging process, and the centralisation of risk from divisions into GCT, e.g. via the transfer pricing framework. GCT is responsible for managing the centralised risk and does this through natural offsets of matching assets and liabilities, and appropriate hedging activity of the residual exposures, subject to the authorisation and mandate of GALCO within the Board risk appetite. The hedges are externalised to the market by derivative desks within GCT and the Commercial Bank. The Group mitigates income statement volatility through hedge accounting. This reduces the accounting volatility arising from the Group's economic hedging activities and any hedge accounting ineffectiveness is continuously monitored.\n\nThe largest residual risk exposure arises from balances that are deemed to be insensitive to changes in market rates (including current accounts, a portion of variable rate deposits and investable equity), and is managed through the Group's structural hedge. Consistent with the Group's strategy to deliver stable returns, GALCO seeks to minimise large reinvestment risk, and to smooth earnings over a range of investment tenors. The structural hedge consists of longer-term fixed rate assets or interest rate swaps and the amount and duration of the hedging activity is reviewed regularly by GALCO.\n\nWhilst the bank faces margin compression in low rate environments, its exposure to pipeline and prepayment risk are not considered material and are hedged in line with expected customer behaviour. These are appropriately monitored and controlled through divisional Asset and Liability Committees (ALCOs).\n\nNet investment foreign exchange exposures are managed centrally by GCT, by hedging non-sterling asset values with currency borrowing. Economic foreign exchange exposures arising from non-functional currency flows are identified by divisions and transferred and managed centrally. The Group also has a policy of forward hedging its forecasted currency profit and loss to year end. The Group makes use of both accounting and economic foreign exchange exposures, as an offset against the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on the value of non-sterling-denominated RWAs. This involves the holding of a structurally open currency position; sensitivity is minimised where, for a given currency, the ratio of the structural open position to RWAs equals the CET1 ratio. Continually evaluating this structural open currency position against evolving non-sterling-denominated RWAs, mitigates volatility in the Group's CET1 ratio.\n\n## Monitoring\n\nThe appropriate limits and triggers are monitored by senior executive committees within the banking divisions. Banking assets, liabilities and associated hedging are actively monitored and if necessary rebalanced to be within agreed tolerances.\n\n## Defined benefit pension schemes\n\n## Exposures\n\nThe Group's defined benefit pension schemes are exposed to significant risks from their assets and liabilities. The liability discount rate exposes the Group to interest rate risk and credit spread risk, which are partially offset by fixed interest assets (such as gilts and corporate bonds) and swaps.\n\nEquity and alternative asset risk arises from direct asset holdings. Scheme membership exposes the Group to longevity risk.\n\nFor further information on defined benefit pension scheme assets and liabilities please refer to note 34 on page 277.\n\n## Measurement\n\nManagement of the schemes' assets is the responsibility of the Trustees of the schemes who are responsible for setting the investment strategy and for agreeing funding requirements with the Group. The Group will be liable for meeting any funding deficit that may arise. As part of the triennial valuation process, the Group will agree with the Trustees a funding strategy to eliminate the deficit over an appropriate period.\n\nLongevity risk is measured using both 1-in-20 year stresses (risk appetite) and 1-in-200 year stresses (regulatory capital).\n\n## Mitigation\n\nThe Group takes an active involvement in agreeing mitigation strategies with the schemes' Trustees. An interest rate and inflation hedging programme is in place to reduce liability risk. The schemes have also reduced equity allocation and invested the proceeds in credit assets. The Trustees have put in place a longevity swap to mitigate longevity risk. The merits of longevity risk transfer and hedging solutions are reviewed regularly.\n\n## Monitoring\n\nIn addition to the wider risk management framework, governance of the schemes includes two specialist pensions committees.\n\nThe surplus, or deficit, in the schemes is tracked monthly along with various single factor and scenario stresses which consider the assets and liabilities holistically. Key metrics are monitored monthly including the Group's capital resources of the scheme, the performance against risk appetite triggers, and the performance of the hedged asset and liability matching positions.\n\n## Insurance portfolios\n\n## Exposures\n\nThe main elements of market risk to which the Group is exposed through the Insurance business are equity, credit default spread, interest rate and inflation.\n\n- Equity risk arises indirectly through the value of future management charges on policyholder funds. These management charges form part of the value of in-force business (see note/uni00A023 on page 267. Equity risk also arises in the with-profits funds but is less material\n- Credit default spread risk mainly arises from annuities where policyholders' future cash flows are guaranteed at retirement. Exposure arises if the market value of the assets, which are mainly corporate bonds and loans, move differently to the liabilities they back. This exposure arises from credit downgrades and defaults\n- Interest rate risk arises through holding credit and interest assets mainly in the annuity book and also to cover general insurance liabilities, capital requirements and risk appetite\n- Inflation exposure arises from a combination of inflation linked policyholder benefits and inflation assumptions used to project future expenses\n\n## Measurement\n\nCurrent and potential future market risk exposures within Insurance are assessed using a range of techniques including stress, reverse stress and scenario testing, as well as stochastic modelling.\n\nRisk measures include 1-in-200 year stresses used for regulatory capital assessments and single factor stresses for profit before tax.\n\nThe table below demonstrates the impact of the Group's UK Recession scenario on the Insurance business' portfolio (with no diversification benefit). The amounts include movements in assets, liabilities and the value of inforce business in respect of insurance contracts and participating investment contracts.",

Unit matching is used to reduce the sensitivity of equity movements by matching unit-linked liabilities on a best-estimate view. Hedging strategies are also in place to reduce exposure from unit-linked funds and the with-profit funds.\n\nInterest rate risk in the annuity book is mitigated by investing in assets whose cash flows closely match those on the projected future liabilities. It is not possible to eliminate risk completely as the timing of insured events is uncertain and bonds are not available at all of the required maturities. The cash flows are matched within regulatory tolerance.\n\nOther market risks (e.g. interest rate exposure outside the annuity book and inflation) are also closely monitored and where considered appropriate, hedges are put in place to reduce exposure.\n\n## Monitoring\n\nMarket risks in the Insurance business are monitored by Insurance senior executive committees and ultimately the Insurance Board. Monitoring includes the progression of market risk capital against risk appetite limits, as well as the sensitivity of profit before tax to combined market risk stress scenarios and in year market movements. Asset and liability matching positions and hedges in place are actively monitored and if necessary rebalanced to be within agreed tolerances. In addition market risk is controlled via approved investment policies and mandates.\n\n## Trading portfolios\n\n## Exposures\n\nThe Group's trading activity is small relative to its peers and does not engage in any proprietary trading activities. The Group's trading activity is undertaken solely to meet the financial requirements of commercial and retail customers for foreign exchange, credit and interest rate products. These activities support customer flow and market making activities.\n\nAll trading activities are performed within the Commercial Banking division. While the trading positions taken are generally small, any extreme moves in the main risk factors and other related risk factors could cause significant losses in the trading book depending on the positions at the time./uni00A0The average 95 per cent 1-day trading VaR (Value at Risk; diversified across risk factors) was \u00a30.9 million for 31 December 2020 compared to/uni00A0\u00a30.9 million for 31 December 2019.\n\nTrading market risk measures are applied to all of the Group's regulatory trading books and they include daily VaR (see Trading Portfolios: VaR table), sensitivity based measures, and stress testing calculations.\n\n## Measurement\n\nThe Group internally uses VaR as the primary risk measure for all trading book positions.\n\nThe Trading Portfolios: VaR table shows some relevant statistics for the Group's 1-day 95 per cent confidence level VaR that are based on 300 historical consecutive business days to year end 2020 and year end/uni00A02019.\n\nThe risk of loss measured by the VaR model is the minimum expected loss in earnings given the 95 per cent confidence. The total and average trading VaR numbers reported below have been obtained after the application of the diversification benefits across the five risk types, but does not reflect any diversification between Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets and any other entities. The maximum and minimum VaR reported for each risk category did not necessarily occur on the same day as the maximum and minimum VaR reported at Group level.\n\n## Trading portfolios: VaR (1-day 95 per cent confidence level) (audited)\n\n|                                         | At 31 December 2020   | At 31 December 2020   | At 31 December 2020   | At 31 December 2020   | At 31 December 2019   | At 31 December 2019   | At 31 December 2019   | At 31 December 2019   |\n|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n|                                         | Close \u00a3m              | Average \u00a3m            | Maximum \u00a3m            | Minimum \u00a3m            | Close \u00a3m              | Average \u00a3m            | Maximum \u00a3m            | Minimum \u00a3m            |\n| Interest rate risk                      | 1.2                   | 0.9                   | 1.3                   | 0.6                   | 0.6                   | 0.8                   | 1.6                   | 0.4                   |\n| Foreign exchange risk                   | 0.3                   | 0.1                   | 0.3                   | -                     | 0.1                   | 0.1                   | 0.3                   | -                     |\n| Equity risk                             | -                     | -                     | -                     | -                     | -                     | -                     | -                     | -                     |\n| Credit spread risk                      | 0.2                   | 0.2                   | 0.3                   | 0.1                   | 0.1                   | 0.2                   | 0.3                   | 0.1                   |\n| Inflation risk                          | 0.1                   | 0.2                   | 0.4                   | 0.1                   | 0.4                   | 0.2                   | 0.6                   | 0.1                   |\n| All risk factors before diversification | 1.8                   | 1.4                   | 1.8                   | 1.0                   | 1.2                   | 1.3                   | 2.2                   | 0.9                   |\n| Portfolio diversification               | (0.7)                 | (0.5)                 |                       |                       | (0.4)                 | (0.4)                 |                       |                       |\n| Total VaR                               | 1.1                   | 0.9                   | 1.3                   | 0.6                   | 0.8                   | 0.9                   | 1.6                   | 0.5                   |\n\nFi\n\nn\n\na\n\nnc\n\ni\n\na\n\nl\n\nr\n\ne\n\nsu\n\nl\n\nt\n\ns",

        "page_content": "## Risk management continued\n\nThe market risk for the trading book continues to be low with respect to the size of the Group and in comparison to peers. This reflects the/uni00A0fact that the Group's trading operations are customer-centric and focused on hedging and recycling client risks.\n\nAlthough it is an important market standard measure of risk, VaR has limitations. One of them is the use of a limited historical data sample which influences the output by the implicit assumption that future market behaviour will not differ greatly from the historically observed period. Another known limitation is the use of defined holding periods which assumes that the risk can be liquidated or hedged within that holding period. Also calculating the VaR at the chosen confidence interval does not give enough information about potential losses which may occur if this level is exceeded. The Group fully recognises these limitations and supplements the use of VaR with a variety of other measurements which reflect the nature of the business activity. These include detailed sensitivity analysis, position reporting and a stress testing programme.\n\nTrading book VaR (1-day 99 per cent) is compared daily against both hypothetical and actual profit and loss. The 1-day 99 per cent VaR charts for Lloyds Bank Group and Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets can be found in the Group's Pillar 3 Report.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nThe level of exposure is controlled by establishing and communicating the approved risk limits and controls through policies and procedures that define the responsibility and authority for risk taking. Market risk limits are clearly and consistently communicated to the business. Any new or emerging risks are brought within risk reporting and defined limits.\n\n## Monitoring\n\nTrading risk appetite is monitored daily with 1-day 95 per cent VaR and stress testing limits. These limits are complemented with position level action triggers and profit and loss referrals. Risk and position limits are set and managed at both desk and overall trading book levels. They are reviewed at least annually and can be changed as required within the overall Group risk appetite framework.\n\n## Credit Risk\n\n## Definition\n\nCredit risk is defined as the risk that parties with whom the Group has contracted fail to meet their financial obligations (both on and off- balance sheet).\n\n## Exposures\n\nThe principal sources of credit risk within the Group arise from loans and advances, contingent liabilities, commitments, debt securities and derivatives to customers, financial institutions and sovereigns. The credit risk exposures of the Group are set out in note/uni00A051 on page 314.\n\nIn terms of loans and advances, (for example mortgages, term loans and overdrafts) and contingent liabilities (for example credit instruments such as guarantees and documentary letters of credit), credit risk arises both from amounts advanced and commitments to extend credit to a customer or bank. With respect to commitments to extend credit, the Group is also potentially exposed to an additional loss up to an amount equal to the total unutilised commitments. However, the likely amount of loss may be less than the total unutilised commitments, as most retail and certain commercial lending commitments may be cancelled based on regular assessment of the prevailing creditworthiness of customers. Most commercial term commitments are also contingent upon customers maintaining specific credit standards.\n\nCredit risk also arises from debt securities and derivatives. The total notional principal amount of interest rate, exchange rate, credit derivative and other contracts outstanding at/uni00A031 December 2020 is shown on page 175. The notional principal amount does not, however, represent the Group's credit risk exposure, which is limited to the current cost of replacing contracts with a positive value to the Group. Such amounts are reflected in note 51 on page 314.\n\nAdditionally, credit risk arises from leasing arrangements where the Group is the lessor. Note/uni00A02(J) on page 227 provides details on the Group's approach to the treatment of leases.\n\nCredit risk exposures in the Insurance and Wealth division relate mostly to bond and loan assets which, together with some related swaps, are used to fund annuity commitments within Shareholder funds; plus balances held in liquidity funds to manage Insurance division's liquidity requirements, and exposure to reinsurers.\n\nThe investments held in the Group's defined benefit pension schemes also expose the Group to credit risk. Note 34 on page 277 provides further information on the defined benefit pension schemes' assets and liabilities.\n\nLoans and advances, contingent liabilities, commitments, debt securities and derivatives also expose the Group to refinance risk. Refinance risk is the possibility that an outstanding exposure cannot be repaid at its contractual maturity date. If the Group does not wish to refinance the exposure then there is refinance risk if the obligor is unable to repay by securing alternative finance. This may occur for a number of reasons which may include: the borrower is in financial difficulty, because the terms required to refinance are outside acceptable appetite at the time or the customer is unable to refinance externally due to a lack of market liquidity. Refinance risk exposures are managed in accordance with the Group's existing credit risk policies, processes and controls, and are not considered to be material given the Group's prudent and through the cycle credit risk appetite. Where heightened refinance risk exists exposures are minimised through intensive account management and, where appropriate, are classed as impaired and/ or forborne.\n\n## Measurement\n\nThe process for credit risk identification, measurement, and control is integrated into the Board-approved framework for credit risk appetite and governance.\n\nCredit risk is measured from different perspectives using a range of appropriate modelling and scoring techniques at a number of levels of granularity, including total balance sheet, individual portfolio, pertinent concentrations and individual customer - for both new business and existing lending./uni00A0Key metrics, such as total exposure, expected credit loss (ECL), risk-weighted assets, new business quality, concentration risk and portfolio performance, are reported monthly to Risk Committees and Forums.\n\nMeasures such as ECL, risk-weighted assets, observed credit performance, predicted credit quality (usually from predictive credit scoring models), collateral cover and quality, and other credit drivers (such as cash flow, affordability, leverage and indebtedness) have been incorporated into the Group's credit risk management practices to enable effective risk measurement across the Group.\n\nIn addition, stress testing and scenario analysis are used to estimate impairment losses and capital demand forecasts for both regulatory and internal purposes and to assist in the formulation of credit risk appetite.\n\nAs part of the 'three lines of defence' model, Risk division is the second line of defence providing oversight and independent challenge to key risk decisions taken by business management. Risk division also tests the effectiveness of credit risk management and internal credit risk controls. This includes ensuring that the control and monitoring of higher risk and vulnerable portfolios and sectors is appropriate and confirming that appropriate loss allowances for impairment are in place. Output from these reviews helps to inform credit risk appetite and credit policy.\n\nAs the third line of defence, Group Internal Audit undertakes regular riskbased reviews to assess the effectiveness of Credit risk management and controls.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nThe Group uses a range of approaches to mitigate Credit risk.\n\nPrudent, through the cycle credit principles, risk policies and appetite statements: /uni00A0the independent Risk division sets out the credit principles, credit risk policies and credit risk appetite statements. These are subject to regular review and governance, with any changes subject to an approval process. Risk teams monitor credit performance trends and the outlook. Risk teams also test the adequacy of and adherence to credit risk policies and processes throughout the Group. This includes tracking portfolio performance against an agreed set of credit risk appetite tolerances.\n\nRobust models and controls: see model risk on page 203.\n\nLimitations on concentration risk: /uni00A0there are portfolio controls on certain industries, sectors and products to reflect risk appetite as well as individual, customer and bank limit risk tolerances. Credit policies and appetite statements are aligned to the Group's risk appetite and restrict exposure",

Note 51/uni00A0on page 314 provides an analysis of loans and advances to customers by industry (for commercial customers) and product (for retail customers). Exposures are monitored to prevent both an excessive concentration of risk and single name concentrations. These concentration risk controls are not necessarily in the form of a maximum limit on exposure, but may instead require new business in concentrated sectors to fulfil additional minimum policy and/or guideline requirements. The Group's largest credit limits are regularly monitored by the Board Risk Committee and reported in accordance with regulatory requirements.\n\nDefined country risk management framework: /uni00A0the Board sets a broad maximum country risk appetite. Risk based appetite for all countries is set within the independent Risk division, taking into account economic, financial, political and social factors as well as the approved business and strategic plans of the Group.\n\nSpecialist expertise: /uni00A0credit quality is managed and controlled by a number of specialist units within the business and Risk division, which provide for example: intensive management and control; security perfection; maintenance of customer and facility records; expertise in documentation for lending and associated products; sector-specific expertise; and legal services applicable to the particular market segments and product ranges offered by the Group.\n\nStress testing: the Group's credit portfolios are subject to regular stress testing. In addition to the Group led, PRA and other regulatory stress tests, exercises focused on individual divisions and portfolios are also performed. For further information on stress testing process, methodology and governance see page 152.\n\nFrequent and robust Credit risk assurance: /uni00A0assurance of credit risk is undertaken by an independent function operating within the Risk division which are part of the Group's second line of defence. Their primary objective is to provide reasonable and independent assurance and confidence that credit risk is being effectively managed and to ensure that appropriate controls are in place and being adhered to. Group Internal Audit also provides assurance to the Audit Committee on the effectiveness of credit risk management controls across the Group's activities.\n\n## Collateral\n\nThe principal types of acceptable collateral include:\n\n- residential and commercial properties\n- charges over business assets such as premises, inventory and accounts receivable\n- financial instruments such as debt securities vehicles\n- cash\n- guarantees received from third-parties\n\nThe Group maintains appetite parameters on the acceptability of specific classes of collateral.\n\nFor non-mortgage retail lending to small businesses, collateral may include second charges over residential property and the assignment of life cover.\n\nCollateral held as security for financial assets other than loans and advances is determined by the nature of the underlying exposure. Debt securities, including treasury and other bills, are generally unsecured, with the exception of asset-backed securities and similar instruments such as covered bonds, which are secured by portfolios of financial assets. Collateral is generally not held against loans and advances to financial institutions. However, securities are held as part of reverse repurchase or securities borrowing transactions or where a collateral agreement has been entered into under a master netting agreement./uni00A0Derivative transactions with financial counterparties are typically collateralised under a Credit Support Annex (CSA) in conjunction with the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) Master Agreement. Derivative transactions with nonfinancial customers are not usually supported by a CSA.\n\nThe requirement for collateral and the type to be taken at origination will be based upon the nature of the transaction and the credit quality, size and structure of the borrower. For non-retail exposures if required, the Group will often seek that any collateral include a first charge over land and buildings owned and occupied by the business, a debenture over the assets of a company or limited liability partnership, personal guarantees, limited in amount, from the directors of a company or limited liability partnership and key man insurance. The Group maintains policies setting out which types of collateral valuation are acceptable, maximum loan to value (LTV) ratios and other criteria that are to be considered when reviewing an application. The fundamental business proposition must evidence the ability of the business\n\nto generate funds from normal business sources to repay a customer or counterparty's financial commitment, rather than reliance on the disposal of any security provided.\n\nThe extent to which collateral values are actively managed will depend on the credit quality and other circumstances of the obligor and type of underlying transaction. Although lending decisions are primarily based on expected cash flows, any collateral provided may impact the pricing and other terms of a loan or facility granted. This will have a financial impact on the amount of net interest income recognised and on internal loss given default estimates that contribute to the determination of asset quality and returns.\n\nThe Group requires collateral to be realistically valued by an appropriately qualified source, independent of both the credit decision process and the customer, at the time of borrowing. In certain circumstances, for Retail residential mortgages this may include the use of automated valuation models based on market data, subject to accuracy criteria and LTV limits. Where third-parties are used for collateral valuations, they are subject to regular monitoring and review. Collateral values are subject to review, which will vary according to the type of lending, collateral involved and account performance. Such reviews are undertaken to confirm that the value recorded remains appropriate and whether revaluation is required, considering for example, account performance, market conditions and any information available that may indicate that the value of the collateral has materially declined. In such instances, the Group may seek additional collateral and/or other amendments to the terms of the facility. The Group adjusts estimated market values to take account of the costs of realisation and any discount associated with the realisation of the collateral when estimating credit losses.\n\nThe Group considers risk concentrations by collateral providers and collateral type with a view to ensuring that any potential undue concentrations of risk are identified and suitably managed by changes to strategy, policy and/or business plans.\n\nThe Group seeks to avoid correlation or wrong-way risk where possible. Under the Group's repurchase (repo) policy, the issuer of the collateral and the repo counterparty should be neither the same nor connected. The same rule applies for derivatives. Risk division has the necessary discretion to extend this rule to other cases where there is significant correlation. Countries with a rating equivalent to AA- or better may be considered to have no adverse correlation between the counterparty domiciled in that country and the country of risk (issuer of securities).\n\nRefer to note 51 on page 314 for further information on collateral.\n\n## Additional mitigation for Retail customers\n\nThe Group uses a variety of lending criteria when assessing applications for mortgages and unsecured lending. The general approval process uses credit acceptance scorecards and involves a review of an applicant's previous credit history using internal data and information held by Credit Reference Agencies (CRA).\n\nThe Group also assesses the affordability and sustainability of lending for each borrower. For secured lending this includes use of an appropriate stressed interest rate scenario. Affordability assessments for all lending are compliant with relevant regulatory and conduct guidelines. The Group takes reasonable steps to validate information used in the assessment of a customer's income and expenditure.\n\nIn addition, the Group has in place quantitative limits such as maximum limits for individual customer products, the level of borrowing to income and the ratio of borrowing to collateral. Some of these limits relate to internal approval levels and others are policy limits above which the Group will typically reject borrowing applications. The Group also applies certain criteria that are applicable to specific products for example applications for buy-tolet mortgages.\n\nFor UK mortgages, the Group's policy permits owner occupier applications with a maximum loan to value (LTV) of 95 per cent. This can increase to 100 per cent for specific products where additional security is provided by a supporter of the applicant and held on deposit by the Group. Applications with an LTV above 90 per cent are subject to enhanced underwriting criteria, including higher scorecard cut-offs and loan size restrictions.\n\nBuy-to-let mortgages within Retail are limited to a maximum loan size of \u00a31,000,000 and 75 per cent LTV. Buy-to-let applications must pass a minimum rental cover ratio of 125 per cent under stressed interest rates, after applicable tax liabilities.

In addition, the Group typically rejects applicants where total unsecured debt, debt-to-income ratios, or other indicators of financial difficulty exceed policy limits.\n\nWhere credit acceptance scorecards are used, new models, model changes and monitoring of model effectiveness are independently reviewed and approved in accordance with the governance framework set by the Group Model Governance Committee.\n\n## Additional mitigation for Commercial customers\n\nIndividual credit assessment and independent sanction of customer and bank limits: with the exception of small exposures to SME customers where certain relationship managers have limited delegated sanctioning authority, credit risk in commercial customer portfolios is subject to sanction by the independent Risk division, which considers the strengths and weaknesses of individual transactions, the balance of risk and reward, and how credit risk aligns to the Group and Divisional risk appetite. Exposure to individual counterparties, groups of counterparties or customer risk segments is controlled through a tiered hierarchy of delegated sanctioning authorities and risk based recommended maximum limit parameters. Approval requirements for each decision are based on a number of factors including, but not limited to, the transaction amount, the customer's aggregate facilities, any risk mitigation in place, credit policy, risk appetite, credit risk ratings and the nature and term of the risk. The Group's credit risk appetite criteria for counterparty and customer loan Underwriting is generally the same as that for loans intended to be held to maturity. All hard loan/bond Underwriting must be sanctioned by Risk division. A pre-approved credit matrix may be used for 'best efforts' underwriting.\n\nCounterparty credit limits: limits are set against all types of exposure in a counterparty name, in accordance with an agreed methodology for each exposure type. This includes credit risk exposure on individual derivatives and securities financing transactions, which incorporates potential future exposures from market movements against agreed confidence intervals. Aggregate facility levels by counterparty are set and limit breaches are subject to escalation procedures.\n\nDaily settlement limits:/uni00A0 settlement risk arises in any situation where a payment in cash, securities or equities is made in the expectation of a corresponding receipt in cash, securities or equities. Daily settlement limits are established for each relevant counterparty to cover the aggregate of all settlement risk arising from the Group's market transactions on any single day. Where possible, the Group uses Continuous Linked Settlement in order to reduce foreign exchange (FX) settlement risk.\n\n## Master netting agreements\n\nIt is credit policy that a Group approved master netting agreement must be used for all derivative and traded product transactions and must be in place prior to trading, with separate documentation required for each Group entity providing facilities. This requirement extends to trades with clients and the counterparties used for the Bank's own hedging activities, which may also include clearing trades with Central Counterparties (CCPs).\n\nAny exceptions must be approved by the appropriate credit sanctioner. Master netting agreements do not generally result in an offset of balance sheet assets and liabilities for accounting purposes, as transactions are usually settled on a gross basis. However, within relevant jurisdictions and for appropriate counterparty types, master nettings agreements do reduce the credit risk to the extent that, if an event of default occurs, all trades with the counterparty may be terminated and settled on a net basis. The Group's overall exposure to credit risk on derivative instruments subject to master netting agreements can change substantially within a short period, since this is the net position of all trades under the master netting agreement.\n\n## Other credit risk transfers\n\nThe Group also undertakes asset sales, credit derivative based transactions, securitisations (including Significant Risk Transfer transactions), purchases of credit default swaps and purchase of credit insurance/uni00A0as a means of mitigating or reducing credit risk and/or risk concentration, taking into account the nature of assets and the prevailing market conditions.\n\n## Monitoring\n\nIn conjunction with Risk division, businesses identify and define portfolios of credit and related risk exposures and the key behaviours and characteristics by which those portfolios are managed and monitored./uni00A0This entails the production and analysis of regular portfolio monitoring reports for review by senior management. Risk division in turn produces an aggregated view of credit risk across the Group, including reports on material credit exposures, concentrations, concerns and other management information, which is presented to the divisional risk committees and forums, Group Risk Committee and the Board Risk Committee.\n\n## Models\n\nThe performance of all models used in credit risk is monitored in line with the Group's model governance framework - see model risk on page 203.\n\n## Intensive care of customers in financial difficulty\n\nThe Group operates a number of solutions to assist borrowers who are experiencing financial stress. The material elements of these solutions through which the Group has granted a concession, whether temporarily or permanently, are set out below.\n\n## Forbearance\n\nThe Group's aim in offering forbearance and other assistance to customers in financial distress is to benefit both the customer and the Group by supporting its customers and acting in their best interests by, where possible, bringing customer facilities back into a sustainable position.\n\nThe Group offers a range of tools and assistance to support customers who are encountering financial difficulties. Cases are managed on an individual basis, with the circumstances of each customer considered separately and the action taken judged as being appropriate and sustainable for both the customer and the Group.\n\nForbearance measures consist of concessions towards a debtor that is experiencing or about to experience difficulties in meeting its financial commitments. This can include modification of the previous terms and conditions of a contract or a total or partial refinancing of a troubled debt contract, either of which would not have been required had the debtor not been experiencing financial difficulties.\n\nThe provision and review of such assistance is controlled through the application of an appropriate policy framework and associated controls. Regular review of the assistance offered to customers is undertaken to confirm that it remains appropriate, alongside monitoring of customers' performance and the level of payments received.\n\nThe Group classifies accounts as forborne at the time a customer in financial difficulty is granted a concession. However, where customers have been temporarily impacted by COVID-19, the Group has looked to follow regulator principles and guidance on the granting of concessions resulting from the impact of the pandemic.\n\nBalances in default or classified as Stage 3 are always considered to be non-performing. Balances are non-performing, but not in default or Stage 3, if they are greater than 90 days past due (compared with 180 days past due for Stage 3 mortgages) or if they are within their 12 month non-performing forbearance cure period.\n\nNon-performing exposures can be reclassified as Performing Forborne after a minimum 12 month cure period, providing there are no past due amounts or concerns regarding the full repayment of the exposure. A minimum of a further 24 months must pass from the date the forborne exposure was reclassified as Performing Forborne before the account can exit forbearance. If conditions to exit forbearance are not met at the end of this probation period, the exposure shall continue to be identified as forborne until all the conditions are met.\n\nThe Group's treatment of loan renegotiations is included in the impairment policy in note/uni00A02(H) on/uni00A0page 226.\n\n## Customers receiving support from UK Government sponsored programmes\n\nTo assist customers in financial distress, the Group participates in UK Government sponsored programmes for households, including the Income Support for Mortgage Interest programme, under which the Government pays the Group all or part of the interest on the mortgage on behalf of the customer. This is provided as a government loan which the customer must repay.",

The Group has also supported its customers through repayment holidays and its own COVID-19 fund which includes fee-free lending for new overdrafts or overdraft limit increases as well as new or increased invoice discounting and finance facilities. The Group is also offering SME customers a mentoring service to help navigate a path beyond the pandemic.\n\n## The Group credit risk portfolio in 2020\n\n## Overview\n\n- The Group has continued to actively support its customers during the crisis through a range of flexible options and payment holidays across major products, as well as lending through the various UK Government support schemes\n- With c.85 per cent of the Group's lending secured, with robust LTVs, and a prudent approach to credit risk appetite and risk management, the credit portfolios were well positioned entering the crisis. Considering the external environment, flows of accounts into arrears and defaults remain low\n- However, the Group recognises and has provisioned on the basis that payment holidays granted and other Government support measures mean that the true underlying risk is not reflected and there is an expectation of increased arrears and defaults as these various arrangements, designed to alleviate short term financial pressure, come to an end/uni00A0\n- The impairment charge for the year has increased significantly to \u00a34,247 million (2019: \u00a31,291 million). This is due to higher expected credit loss allowances taken predominantly in the first half of the year. These reflected the deterioration in economic outlook as a consequence of the coronavirus pandemic, as well as the charges taken on restructuring cases in the Commercial Business Support Unit (BSU)\n\n- As a result, expected credit losses on loans and advances to customers increased to \u00a36,832 million at 31 December 2020 (31 December 2019: \u00a34,142/uni00A0million). Notwithstanding the likelihood of rising defaults, the impairment impacts are expected largely to be covered by the forwardlooking provisions built up in 2020, subject to there being no material changes to the Group's overall expectations of the severity of the pandemic impact on the economy\n- Stage 2 loans and advances to customers as a percentage of total lending have increased by 4.3 percentage points to 12.0 per cent at 31 December 2020 (31 December 2019: 7.7 per cent), reflecting the deterioration of the Group's forward-looking economic assumptions. Of these, 88.9 per cent are up to date (31 December 2019: 78.9 per cent). Stage 2 coverage increased to 4.5 per cent (31 December 2019: 3.7/uni00A0per cent)\n- Stage 3 loans and advances increased by \u00a3335 million to \u00a39,089 million (31 December 2019: \u00a38,754 million), although as a percentage of total lending remained stable at 1.8 per cent. Stage 3 coverage increased by 5.6 percentage points to 28.1 per cent (31 December 2019: 22.5/uni00A0per cent) largely driven by additional provisions predominantly raised against preexisting restructuring cases in Commercial Banking's BSU and to a lesser extent in Retail, due to the change in the Group's economic forecast of collateral values for UK Mortgages and UK Motor Finance/uni00A0\n\n## Low risk culture and prudent risk appetite\n\n- The Group continues to take a prudent approach to credit risk and a through the cycle credit risk appetite, whilst working closely with customers to support them over this challenging period\n- Although not immune, the Group's credit portfolios are well positioned against an uncertain economic outlook and potential market volatility\n- The Group's effective risk management seeks to ensure early identification and management of customers and counterparties who may be showing signs of distress\n- Sector and asset class concentrations within the portfolios are closely monitored and controlled, with mitigating actions taken where appropriate. Sector and product caps limit exposure to certain higher risk and vulnerable sectors and asset classes",

Loans and advances to customers are categorised into the following stages:\n\nStage 1 assets comprise of newly originated assets (unless purchased or originated credit impaired), as well as those which have not experienced a significant increase in credit risk. These assets carry an expected credit loss allowance equivalent to the expected credit losses that result from those default events that are possible within 12 months of the reporting date (12 month expected credit losses).\n\nStage 2 assets are those which have experienced a significant increase in credit risk since origination. These assets carry an expected credit loss allowance equivalent to the expected credit losses arising over the lifetime of the asset (lifetime expected credit losses).\n\nStage 3 assets have either defaulted or are otherwise considered to be credit impaired. These assets carry a lifetime expected credit loss.\n\nPurchased or originated credit-impaired assets (POCI) are those that have been originated or acquired in a credit impaired state. This includes within the definition of credit impaired the purchase of a financial asset at a deep discount that reflects impaired credit losses.\n\n## Credit risk basis of presentation\n\nThe analyses which follow have been presented on two bases; the statutory basis which is consistent with the presentation in the Group's accounts and the underlying basis which is used for internal management purposes. Reconciliations between the two bases have been provided.\n\nIn the following statutory basis tables, purchased or originated creditimpaired (POCI) assets include a fixed pool of mortgages that were purchased as part of the HBOS acquisition at a deep discount to face value reflecting credit losses incurred from the point of origination to the date of acquisition. The residual ECL allowance and resulting low coverage ratio on POCI assets reflects further deterioration in the creditworthiness from the date of acquisition. Over time, these POCI assets will run off as the loans redeem, pay down or losses crystallise.\n\nThe Group uses the underlying basis to monitor the creditworthiness of the lending portfolio and related ECL allowances because it provides a better indication of the credit performance of the POCI assets purchased as part of the HBOS acquisition. The underlying basis assumes that the lending assets acquired as part of a business combination were originated by the Group and are classified as either Stage 1, 2 or 3 according to the change in credit risk over the period since origination. Underlying ECL allowances have been calculated accordingly.",

Includes forbearance, client and product-specific indicators not reflected within quantitative PD assessments.\n- 2  Includes assets that have triggered PD movements, or other rules, given that being 1-29 days in arrears in of itself is not a stage 2 trigger.\n- 3  Expected credit loss allowances on loans and advances to customers (drawn and undrawn).\n\nThe Group's assessment of a significant increase in credit risk, and resulting categorisation of Stage 2, includes customers moving into early arrears as well as a broader assessment that an up to date customer has experienced a level of deterioration in credit risk since origination. A more sophisticated assessment is required for up to date customers, which varies across divisions and product type. This assessment incorporates specific triggers such as a significant proportionate increase in probability of default relative to that at origination, recent arrears, forbearance activity, internal watch lists and external bureau flags. Up to date exposures in Stage 2 are likely to show lower levels of expected credit loss (ECL) allowance relative to those that have already moved into arrears given that an arrears status typically reflects a stronger indication of future default and greater likelihood of credit losses.\n\n## Additional information\n\n## ECL sensitivity to economic assumptions\n\nThe measurement of ECL reflects an unbiased probability-weighted range of possible future economic outcomes. The Group achieves this by generating four economic scenarios to reflect the range of outcomes; the central scenario reflects the Group's base case assumptions used for medium-term planning purposes, an upside and a downside scenario are also selected together with a severe downside scenario. The base case, upside and downside scenarios carry a 30 per cent weighting; the severe downside is weighted at 10 per cent./uni00A0",

The notional principal amount does not, however, represent the Group's credit risk exposure, which is limited to the current cost of replacing contracts with a positive value to the Group. Such amounts are reflected in note 51 on page 314.\n\n## Retail\n\n- The Retail portfolio has remained robust and well positioned throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Risk management has been enhanced since the last financial crisis, with strong affordability and indebtedness controls for both new and existing lending and a prudent risk appetite approach. This is evident in the significant improvement in credit quality and low arrears rates. However, customers have been significantly impacted by the pandemic and credit performance is expected to worsen as a result\n- The Group has provided significant levels of support to Retail customers through 2020. Since March 2020, the Group has approved over 1.3/uni00A0million payment holidays, while personal current accounts customers have had access to up to \u00a3500 interest free arranged overdrafts and repossession activity has been suspended\n- As a result of payment holidays, the arrears rate across the portfolios is below pre-crisis levels\n- The Group has taken targeted steps across the Retail product offering to implement tighter credit quality controls on key risk indicators such as indebtedness and credit scores to ensure that customers and the bank are protected\n- The Group has participated fully/uni00A0in the Bounce Back Loan Scheme (BBLS) and the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CBILS) for Retail Business Banking customers, where government guarantees are in place at 100 per cent and 80 per cent, respectively\n- The Retail impairment charge increased to \u00a32,384 million for 2020 compared to \u00a31,038 million for 2019, largely driven by updates to the Group's economic forecast following the coronavirus outbreak\n- Existing IFRS 9 staging rules and triggers have been maintained across Retail, with additional tightening on the credit cards portfolio. Transfers between stages have been primarily driven by credit risk rating movements and the estimated impact of the economic factors on a customer's forward-looking default risk\n- Total Retail expected credit loss (ECL) allowance as a percentage of drawn loans and advances (coverage) increased to 1.1 per cent (31 December 2019: 0.8 per cent) due to the updates in the Group's economic forecast. As at 31 December 2020, the majority of ECL increases are reflected within Stage 2 under IFRS 9, representing cases which have observed a Significant Increase in Credit Risk since origination (SICR). As such the proportion of Stage 2 loans and advances comprises 13.0 per cent of the Retail portfolio (31 December 2019: 9.4 per cent), of which/uni00A086.2/uni00A0per cent are up to date, performing loans\n- Stage 2 ECL coverage increased to 4.3 per cent (31 December 2019: 3.6 per cent), following updates to the Group's economic forecast. This was offset by a slight reduction in UK Mortgages Stage 2 ECL coverage where a greater proportion of Stage 2 balances was from lower risk and up to date accounts, transferred into Stage 2 based on the forward-looking view of their credit performance\n- Stage 3 loans and advances have remained flat at 1.5 per cent of total loans and advances (31 December 2019: 1.5 per cent, Stage 3 ECL coverage increased to 22.5 per cent (31 December 2019: 19.1 per cent) due to a combination of the UK Mortgages and Motor Finance portfolios where the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on collateral values is expected to result in increased loss given default (LGD), in addition to the impact of changes to collections processes within the credit cards portfolio",

        "page_content": "## Risk management continued\n\n## Portfolios\n\n## UK Mortgages\n\n- The UK Mortgages portfolio is well positioned with low arrears and a strong Loan to Value (LTV) profile./uni00A0The Group has actively improved the quality of the portfolio over the years using robust affordability and credit controls, whilst the balances of higher risk portfolios originated prior to 2008 have continued to reduce\n- Whilst the housing market has remained resilient throughout 2020 with strong customer demand, the Group has taken action to protect credit quality, for example by reducing the maximum LTV on new lending to 85 per cent for the majority of 2020\n- Total loans and advances increased to \u00a3295.4 billion (31 December 2019: \u00a3289.8 billion), with a small reduction in average LTV to 43.5 per cent (31 December 2019: 44.9 per cent). The proportion of balances with an LTV greater than 90 per cent decreased to 0.6 per cent (31 December 2019: 2.5 per cent). The average LTV of new business decreased to 63.9 per cent (31 December 2019: 64.3/uni00A0per cent)\n- The impairment charge was \u00a3478/uni00A0million for 2020 compared to a release of \u00a3167 million for 2019, reflecting charges due to the weaker economic outlook. Total ECL coverage increased to 0.5 per cent (31 December 2019: 0.4 per cent)\n- Stage 2 loans and advances increased to 12.8 per cent of the portfolio (31 December 2019: 9.3 per cent) which has contributed to a slight reduction in Stage 2 ECL coverage to 2.1 per cent (31 December 2019: 2.3 per cent) given a greater proportion of Stage 2 balances from lower risk up to date accounts, transferred into Stage 2 based on the forward-looking view of their credit performance\n- Stage 3 ECL Coverage increased to 15.6 per cent (31 December 2019: 13.6 per cent) largely due to the revised outlook for house prices across the multiple economic scenarios utilised for IFRS 9 provisioning\n\n## Credit cards\n\n/uni00A0\n\n- Credit cards balances decreased to \u00a315.1 billion (31 December 2019: \u00a318.1 billion) due to reduced levels of customer spend,/uni00A0resulting in a reduction in the volume of customers with highly utilised cards\n- The credit card book has performed well in recent years, with lower arrears rates compared to the High Street Bank peer group\n- The impairment charge was \u00a3800 million for 2020 (2019: \u00a3503 million), with overall ECL coverage increasing to 6.4 per cent (31 December 2019: 3.4 per cent) and Stage 2 ECL coverage increasing to 16.8 per cent (31 December: 14.1 per cent). The increases were largely due to the/uni00A0weaker outlook within our economic forecasts\n- In addition to increases caused by the weakening economic outlook, Stage 2 loans and advances also increased due to a stricter criteria adopted to trigger movements from Stage 1 to Stage 2. As a result, Stage 2 loans and advances as a percentage of total loans and advances increased to 21.7 per cent (31 December 2019: 9.2/uni00A0per cent)\n- Stage 3 ECL coverage increased to 58.8 per cent (31 December 2019: 46.2 per cent). This resulted from a refresh of data used to calculate loss rates that reflects changes in collections policy, some realignment of coverage across stages and a strengthening of coverage given the current environment\n\n## Loans and overdrafts\n\n- Loans and advances for personal current account and the personal loans portfolios decreased to \u00a39.5 billion (31 December 2019: \u00a310.2/uni00A0billion) due to reduced customer spend and demand for credit\n- The impairment charge was \u00a3739 million for the full year 2020 compared to \u00a3445 million for the full year 2019. This increase is primarily due to the weaker outlook within our economic forecasts, increasing both Stage 2 ECL coverage to 22.6 per cent (31 December 2019:/uni00A017.1 per cent) and overall ECL coverage to 7.6 per cent (31 December 2019:/uni00A04.6 per cent)\n\n## UK Motor Finance\n\n/uni00A0\n\n- The UK Motor Finance portfolio decreased slightly from \u00a316.0 billion for 2019 to \u00a315.2 billion for 2020 due to reduced market activity as a result of the pandemic\n- The impairment charge increased to \u00a3226 million for 2020 compared to \u00a3203 million for 2019, due to the weaker outlook within our economic forecasts. ECL coverage increased to 3.3 per cent (31 December 2019: 2.4 per cent)\n- Updates to Residual Value (RV) and Voluntary Termination (VT) risk held against Personal Contract Purchase (PCP) and Hire Purchase (HP) lending included within the impairment charge, however because the Group has adopted a prudent approach to modelling this risk in recent years, the updates to the Group's economic outlook have not resulted in a material change to provisions, which remained relatively unchanged at \u00a3192 million as at 31 December 2020 (31 December 2019: \u00a3201/uni00A0million)\n- Stage 2 ECL coverage increased to 7.7 per cent (31 December 2019: 4.5 per cent) and Stage 3 ECL coverage increased to 66.8 per cent (31 Dec 2019:/uni00A056.0 per cent) both of which were due principally to the impact on Credit ECL from updates to the Group's outlook on used car prices. Credit and RV provisioning are aligned in the assumption of an anticipated near-term reduction in car prices, with an expected slow recovery until 2024\n\n## Other\n\n- Other loans and advances increased to \u00a319.4 billion (31 December 2019: \u00a310.9 billion). The increase was largely driven by increased lending to Retail Business Banking customers; \u00a37.1/uni00A0billion Bounce Back Loans, which are fully guaranteed by the UK Government, and \u00a3254 million Coronavirus Business Interruption Loans which are 80 per cent guaranteed\n- The impairment charge was \u00a3141 million for 2020 compared to \u00a354 million for 2019, primarily due to the weaker outlook within our economic forecasts\n\n## Retail UK Mortgages loans and advances to customers (statutory basis)\n\n|            | At 31 Dec  2020 1 \u00a3m   | At 31 Dec  2019 1 \u00a3m   |\n|------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| Mainstream | 234,273                | 227,975                |\n| Buy-to-let | 49,634                 | 49,086                 |\n| Specialist | 10,899                 | 12,137                 |\n| Total      | 294,806                | 289,198                |\n\n- 1  Balances include the impact of HBOS related acquisition adjustments.",

At 31 December 2020, owner occupier interestonly balances as a proportion of total owner occupier balances had reduced to 21.6 per cent (31 December 2019: 23.9 per cent). The average indexed loan to value remained low at 39.0 per cent (31 December 2019: 41.2 per cent).\n\nFor existing interest-only mortgages, a contact strategy is in place during the term of the mortgage to ensure that customers are aware of their obligations to repay the principal upon maturity of the loan.\n\nTreatment strategies are in place to help customers anticipate and plan for repayment of capital at maturity and support those who may have difficulty in repaying the principal amount. A dedicated specialist team supports customers who have passed their contractual maturity date and are unable to fully repay the principal. A range of treatments are offered to customers based on their individual circumstances to create fair and sustainable outcomes.\n\n## Analysis of owner occupier interest-only mortgages (statutory basis)\n\n|                                             | At 31 Dec  2020 Total   | At 31 Dec  2019 Total   |\n|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Interest-only balances (\u00a3m)                 | 53,077                  | 57,437                  |\n| Stage 1 (%)                                 | 69.0                    | 75.6                    |\n| Stage 2 (%)                                 | 16.3                    | 10.0                    |\n| Stage 3 (%)                                 | 1.7                     | 1.2                     |\n| Purchased or originated credit-impaired (%) | 13.0                    | 13.2                    |\n| Average loan to value (%)                   | 39.0                    | 41.2                    |\n| Maturity profile (\u00a3m)                       |                         |                         |\n| Due                                         | 1,626                   | 1,459                   |\n| 1 year                                      | 2,045                   | 1,968                   |\n| 2-5 years                                   | 9,450                   | 9,852                   |\n| 6-10 years                                  | 18,351                  | 18,606                  |\n| >11 years                                   | 21,605                  | 25,552                  |\n| Past term interest-only balances (\u00a3m) 1     | 1,715                   | 1,677                   |\n| Stage 1 (%)                                 | 0.7                     | 0.9                     |\n| Stage 2 (%)                                 | 28.9                    | 23.9                    |\n| Stage 3 (%)                                 | 24.2                    | 21.8                    |\n| Purchased or originated credit-impaired (%) | 46.2                    | 53.4                    |\n| Average loan to value (%)                   | 34.4                    | 35.7                    |\n| Negative equity (%)                         | 2.5                     | 2.8                     |\n\n- 1  Balances where all interest-only elements have moved past term.

On an underlying basis, total forbearance for the major retail portfolios has improved by \u00a3286/uni00A0million to \u00a36.2 billion driven primarily by a reduction in customers where arrears are written on to the loan balance (capitalisations). On a statutory basis the equivalent total forbearance position improved by \u00a3259million to \u00a35.9/uni00A0billion.\n\nThe main customer treatments included are: repair, where arrears are written on to the loan balance and the arrears position cancelled; instances where there are suspensions of interest and/or capital repayments; past term interest-only mortgages; and refinance personal loans.\n\nAs a percentage of loans and advances, forbearance loans improved to 1.7/uni00A0per cent at 31 December 2020 (31 December 2019: 1.9 per cent).\n\nAs at 31 December 2020, 98.3 per cent of forbearance loans are captured in Stage 2 or Stage 3 for IFRS 9 and hold provision on a lifetime basis (31 December 2019: 98.8 per cent).\n\nTotal expected credit losses (ECL) as a proportion of loans and advances which are forborne has increased to 12.2/uni00A0per cent (31 December 2019: 9.3 per cent).\n\n## Retail forborne loans and advances (statutory basis) (audited)\n\n|                       | Total \u00a3m   | Of which  Stage 2 \u00a3m   | Of which  Stage 3 \u00a3m   | Of which  POCI \u00a3m   | Expected credit  losses as a % of  total loans and  advances which  are forborne 1 %   |\n|-----------------------|------------|------------------------|------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| At 31 December 2020 2 |            |                        |                        |                     |                                                                                        |\n| UK Mortgages          | 5,106      | 1,192                  | 823                    | 3,081               | 3.6                                                                                    |\n| Credit cards          | 356        | 130                    | 191                    | -                   | 40.0                                                                                   |\n| Loans and overdrafts  | 353        | 154                    | 146                    | -                   | 36.5                                                                                   |\n| UK Motor Finance      | 88         | 50                     | 34                     | -                   | 36.3                                                                                   |\n| Total                 | 5,903      | 1,526                  | 1,194                  | 3,081               | 7.0                                                                                    |\n| At 31 December 2019   |            |                        |                        |                     |                                                                                        |\n| UK Mortgages          | 5,559      | 1,156                  | 736                    | 3,659               | 2.1                                                                                    |\n| Credit cards          | 321        | 65                     | 210                    | -                   | 32.8                                                                                   |\n| Loans and overdrafts  | 219        | 103                    | 95                     | -                   | 28.8                                                                                   |\n| UK Motor Finance      | 63         | 35                     | 26                     | -                   | 30.4                                                                                   |\n| Total                 | 6,162      | 1,359                  | 1,067                  | 3,659               | 5.0                                                                                    |\n\n- 1  Expected credit loss allowance as a percentage of total loans and advances which are forborne is calculated excluding loans in recoveries for Credit cards, Loans and overdrafts (31 December 2020: \u00a375 million;

        "page_content": "## Risk management continued\n\n## Commercial Banking\n\n## Portfolio Management and Supporting the Group's Customers\n\n- Commercial Banking has actively supported its customers during this difficult time, through a range of propositions, including capital repayment holidays, working capital line increases and financial covenant waivers, as well as supporting small businesses and corporates through full use of UK Government schemes\n- The coronavirus has resulted in widespread industry disruption, with some sectors such as travel, transportation, non-essential retail and hospitality particularly impacted, although as a proportion of the Group's overall lending, these sectors remain relatively modest. The Group expects recovery to be slow in a number of vulnerable sectors and anticipates longer term structural changes in a number of these. Sector and credit risk appetite continue to be proactively managed to ensure the Group is protected and clients are supported in the right way\n- As the crisis has developed, Commercial Banking has continued to support its more vulnerable clients early through focused risk management via the Group's Watchlist and Business Support framework\n- With the exception of certain risk appetite extensions made to accommodate UK Government scheme guidelines, particularly Bounce Back Loans and to a lesser extent, Coronavirus Business Interruption Loans (where government guarantees are in place at 100 per cent and 80 per cent, respectively), lending continues to be in line with the usual approach to credit risk and through the cycle credit risk appetite: credit analysis is undertaken to ensure continued financial viability, notwithstanding any short-term coronavirus related pressure\n- Although the portfolios were well positioned pre crisis, as expected, deterioration has been seen with downgrades in credit risk ratings observed, although more so in the larger corporates segment, than in the SME book, which remains predominantly a secured portfolio. Risk rating downgrades to sub investment grade or equivalent have, however, been more modest\n- Credit impacts were relatively muted in the SME portfolio in 2020. Observed credit quality is likely to be influenced by the significant temporary support provided by the Government in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has the potential to distort underlying credit risk. The Group expects arrears and defaults to increase in 2021 as this support comes to an end. Crystallisation of these impacts is expected to start from the second quarter of 2021 as payments start to fall due, and are anticipated to be protracted over a number of years, given the flexible payment deferral options available under the various government lending schemes/uni00A0\n- Significant uncertainties remain, relating to both the coronavirus pandemic and the full impact of the UK's exit from the European Union on the portfolios. Notwithstanding this, the Group will continue to balance prudent risk appetite with ensuring support for financially viable clients on their road to recovery\n\n## Impairments\n\n- The net impairment charge increased to \u00a31,464/uni00A0million in 2020, compared with \u00a3306/uni00A0million in 2019. The increase largely reflects charges of \u00a3809/uni00A0million following updates to the economic outlook, together with \u00a3403/uni00A0million for a small number of existing Stage 3 large corporate restructuring cases in the Business Support Unit (BSU), where coronavirus has directly hampered the client's existing recovery strategy. The remaining charge of \u00a3252/uni00A0million was largely as a result of impairments crystallising on a small number of single name charges in the BSU/uni00A0\n- As a result, expected credit loss allowances increased by \u00a31,082/uni00A0million to \u00a32,395 million at 31 December 2020. The Group recognises that credit quality has been supported by the temporary measures provided by the UK Government schemes and the existing expected credit loss provision balance as at 31 December 2020 assumes additional losses will emerge as the support subsides and structural change emerges in some sectors\n- Stage 3 loans and advances remained broadly flat at \u00a33,524 million (31 December 2019: \u00a33,447/uni00A0million) although given the overall Commercial portfolio reduction, as a proportion of total loans and advances to customers, increased to 4.0 per cent (31 December 2019: 3.6/uni00A0per cent). SME flows to Stage 3 remain suppressed and non-SME flows were offset by repayments and write-offs. Stage 3 ECL coverage increased to 36.7/uni00A0per cent (31 December 2019: 27.4 per cent) predominantly driven by the additional provisions raised against the existing restructuring cases in the BSU\n- Stage 2 loans and advances have increased by \u00a38,339 million to \u00a314,316 million at 31 December 2020, largely driven by the IFRS 9 forward look PD staging trigger, rather than actual PD deterioration, with 98/uni00A0per cent of Stage 2 balances being current and up to date. As a result, Stage 2 loans as a proportion of total loans and advances to customers increased to 16.2 per cent (31 December 2019:/uni00A06.2 per cent). Stage 2 ECL coverage was higher at 5.2/uni00A0per cent (31 December 2019: 4.2 per cent) with the increase in coverage a direct result of the forward look multiple economic scenarios/uni00A0\n\n## Commercial Banking UK Direct Real Estate\n\n- Commercial Banking UK Direct Real Estate gross lending stood at \u00a313.1 billion at 31 December 2020 (net of exposures subject to protection through Significant Risk Transfer securitisations). The Group has a further \u00a31.0 billion of UK Direct Real Estate exposure in Business Banking within the Retail division\n- The Group classifies Direct Real Estate as exposure which is directly supported by cash flows from property activities (as opposed to trading activities, such as hotels, care homes and housebuilders). Exposures of \u00a36.0 billion to social housing providers are also excluded\n- Recognising this is a cyclical sector, appropriate caps are in place to control origination and exposure. Focus remains on the UK market and business propositions have been written in line with a prudent, through the cycle risk appetite with conservative LTVs, strong quality of income and proven management teams\n- Overall performance has remained generally acceptable, although an increase in cases moving to Watchlist has been seen, with some transfers to BSU concentrated in the retail/shopping centres sub sector. This is somewhat to be expected, as overall rent collection has been impacted by COVID-19, particularly in the retail space given the number of closed stores throughout the lockdowns, though the office sub sector has been reasonably resilient. Despite these challenges the portfolio is relatively well positioned and proactively managed with appropriate risk mitigants in place:\n- - Exposures over \u00a31 million continue to be heavily weighted towards investment real estate (c.90 per cent) over development. Of these investment exposures, over 75 per cent have an LTV of less than 60 per cent, with an average LTV of 50 per cent\n- - C.90 per cent of exposures greater than \u00a35 million have an interest cover ratio of greater than 2.0 times and in SME, LTV at origination has been typically limited to c.55 per cent, given prudent repayment cover criteria (including a notional base rate stress)\n- - Approximately 65 per cent of exposures over \u00a31 million relate to commercial real estate (with no speculative development lending) with the remainder related to residential real estate. The underlying sub-sector split is diversified with c.13 per cent of exposures secured by Retail assets, with appetite tightened since 2018\n- - The Office portfolio is focused on prime locations with strong sponsors and low LTVs, as well as no speculative commercial development\n- - Use of Significant Risk Transfer (SRT) securitisations also acts as a risk mitigant, with run off of these carefully managed and tracked\n- - Both investment and development lending is subject to specific credit risk appetite criteria. Development lending criteria includes maximum loan to gross development value and maximum loan to cost, with funding typically only released against completed work, as confirmed by the Group's monitoring quantity surveyor",

        "page_content": "## Risk management continued\n\n## Environmental risk management\n\nThrough 2020 the Group has strengthened capacity for identifying, assessing and managing environmental risks across its lending activity. Group-wide credit risk principles require all credit risk to be incurred with regard to environmental legislation and the Group's Code of Responsibility.\n\nEnvironmental risk is embedded in credit policy and must be assessed at origination and monitored on an ongoing basis throughout the customer lifecycle.\n\nThe Group continues to embed the risks and opportunities from climate change into its business and credit risk processes, with a robust programme underway to analyse and proactively manage business strategy and risk appetite response for financing high-carbon intensive sectors, while emphasising its commitment to support clients transitioning to more sustainable, low-carbon activities.\n\nIn 2020 the Group has developed and piloted a Climate Risk Assessment tool, and has continued to develop guidance and tools to help Relationship Managers and Credit Officers identify and manage the climate risk associated with its customers. This includes analysing actions being taken by customers to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, reviewing and responding to exposure to physical and transitional risks from climate change; and understanding and managing potential opportunities to support customers in their transition journey. Further detail is provided in the Responsible Business section (see pages 16 to 31).\n\nLloyds Banking Group is a signatory to the Equator Principles, which is a risk management framework for managing environmental and social risks in Project Finance transactions, such as large scale energy, industrial, or infrastructure projects. It ensures that such deals, where the Group provides finance or advice, meet minimum standards for due diligence and monitoring in keeping with responsible finance.\n\n## Environmental risk management approach\n\nIn 2020, the Group implemented the enhanced requirements of Equator Principles 4. This strengthens the due diligence requirements for signatories to consider the environmental and social risk impacts of projects specifically on human rights, climate change and biodiversity, including aligning climate change risk assessments with the physical and transition risk categories recommended by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures.\n\nThe Group has also been a signatory to the UN Principles for Responsible Investment (UNPRI) since 2012, which incorporate/uni00A0environmental, social and governance (ESG) risk considerations in asset management. Scottish Widows is responsible for the annual UNPRI reporting process.\n\nThe risk-based environmental policy was simplified in 2020, to ensure focus on higher risk sectors and transactions. All cases that are identified as higher risk are subject to further review. Where specific or material environmental risks or concerns are identified by the Group's in-house team, cases are referred to environmental risk consultants for an opinion on the adequacy of the mitigants in place or recommendations on managing the environmental risk. The key findings from such due diligence must be factored into credit applications which inform lending decisions.\n\nThe Group provides colleague training on environmental risk management as part of the standard suite of Commercial Banking credit risk courses. To support this training, a range of online resources are available to colleagues, including environmental risk theory, procedural guidance, and information on environmental legislation and sector-specific environmental impacts.\n\nThe Group continues to partner with the Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership to provide high quality training to executives and colleagues focused on risk management, product development and in client-facing roles.\n\nEnvironmental risk process flow\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Funding and liquidity risk/uni00A0\n\n## Definition\n\nFunding risk is defined as the risk that the Group does not have sufficiently stable and diverse sources of funding or the funding structure is inefficient./uni00A0Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Group has insufficient financial resources to meet its commitments as they fall due, or can only secure them at excessive cost.\n\n## Exposure\n\nLiquidity exposure represents the potential stressed outflows in any future period less expected inflows. The Group considers liquidity exposure from both an internal and a regulatory perspective.\n\n## Measurement\n\nLiquidity risk is managed through a series of measures, tests and reports that are primarily based on contractual maturities with behavioural overlays as appropriate. Note 51 on page 314 sets out an analysis of assets and liabilities by relevant maturity grouping. The Group undertakes quantitative and qualitative analysis of the behavioural aspects of its assets and liabilities in order to reflect their expected behaviour.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nThe Group manages and monitors liquidity risks and ensures that liquidity risk management systems and arrangements are adequate with regard to the internal risk appetite, Group strategy and regulatory requirements. Liquidity policies and procedures are subject to independent internal oversight by Risk. Overseas branches and subsidiaries of the Group may also be required to meet the liquidity requirements of the entity's domestic country. Management of liquidity requirements is performed by the overseas branch or subsidiary in line with Group policy. Liquidity risk of the Insurance business is actively managed and monitored within the Insurance business. The Group plans funding requirements over its planning period, combining business as usual and stressed conditions. The Group manages its liquidity position both with regard to its internal risk appetite and the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) as required by the PRA and Capital Requirements Directive and Regulation (CRD IV) liquidity requirements.\n\nThe Group's funding and liquidity position is underpinned by its significant customer deposit base, and is supported by strong relationships across customer segments. The Group has consistently observed that in aggregate the retail deposit base provides a stable source of funding. Funding concentration by counterparty, currency and tenor is monitored on an ongoing basis and where concentrations do exist, these are managed as part of the planning process and limited by the internal funding and liquidity risk monitoring framework, with analysis regularly provided to senior management.\n\nTo assist in managing the balance sheet, the Group operates a Liquidity Transfer Pricing (LTP) process which: allocates relevant interest expenses from the centre to the Group's banking businesses within the internal management accounts; helps drive the correct inputs to customer pricing; and is consistent with regulatory requirements. LTP makes extensive use of behavioural maturity profiles, taking account of expected customer loan prepayments and stability of customer deposits, modelled on historic data.\n\nThe Group can monetise liquid assets quickly, either through the repurchase agreements (repo) market or through outright sale. In addition, the Group has pre-positioned a substantial amount of assets at the Bank of England's Discount Window Facility which can be used to access additional liquidity in a time of stress. The Group considers diversification across geography, currency, markets and tenor when assessing appropriate holdings of liquid assets. The Group's liquid asset buffer is available for deployment at immediate notice, subject to complying with regulatory requirements.\n\nLiquidity risk within the Insurance business may result from: the inability to sell financial assets quickly at their fair values; an insurance liability falling due for payment earlier than expected; the inability to generate cash inflows\n\nas anticipated; an unexpected large operational event; or from a general insurance catastrophe, for example, a significant weather event. Liquidity risk is actively managed and monitored within the Insurance business to ensure that it remains within approved risk appetite, so that even under stress conditions, there is sufficient liquidity to meet obligations.\n\n## Monitoring\n\nDaily monitoring and control processes are in place to address internal and regulatory liquidity requirements. The Group monitors a range of market and internal early warning indicators on a daily basis for early signs of liquidity risk in the market or specific to the Group. This captures regulatory metrics as well as metrics the Group considers relevant for its liquidity profile. These are a mixture of quantitative and qualitative measures, including: daily variation of customer balances; changes in maturity profiles; funding concentrations; changes in LCR outflows; credit default swap (CDS) spreads; and basis risks.\n\nThe Group carries out internal stress testing of its liquidity and potential cash flow mismatch position over both short (up to one month) and longerterm horizons against a range of scenarios forming an important part of the internal risk appetite. The scenarios and assumptions are reviewed at least annually to ensure that they continue to be relevant to the nature of the business including reflecting emerging horizon risks to the Group. For further information on the Group's 2020 liquidity stress testing results refer to page/uni00A0186.\n\nThe Group maintains a Contingency Funding Framework as part of the wider Recovery Plan which is designed to identify emerging liquidity concerns at an early stage, so that mitigating actions can be taken to avoid a more serious crisis developing. Contingency Funding Plan invocation and escalation processes are based on analysis of five major quantitative and qualitative components, comprising assessment of: early warning indicators; prudential and regulatory liquidity risk limits and triggers; stress testing results; event and systemic indicators; and market intelligence.\n\n## Funding and liquidity management in 2020\n\nThe Group has maintained its strong funding and liquidity position with the loan to deposit ratio falling to 98 per cent (107 per cent as at 31 December 2019). This was largely driven by a \u00a338.9 billion increase in customer deposits given reduced customer spending and customers depositing government lending scheme balances.\n\nDuring 2020, the Group repaid all outstanding amounts of its Term Funding Scheme (TFS) drawings of \u00a315.4 billion and the remaining \u00a31 billion outstanding of its Funding for Lending Scheme (FLS) drawings. The Group has drawn \u00a313.7 billion from the Term Funding Scheme with additional incentives for SMEs (TFSME). Overall, total wholesale funding has reduced to \u00a3109.4 billion as at 31 December 2020 (31 December 2019: \u00a3124.2 billion) principally as a result of growth in customer deposits.\n\nThe Group's liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) was 136 per cent (based on a monthly rolling average over the previous 12 months) as at 31 December 2020 (31 December 2019: 137 per cent) calculated on a consolidated basis based on the EU Delegated Act. Net liquidity outflows increased as a result of a higher volume of short notice customer deposits and higher derivative margin volatility. Following the implementation of structural reform, liquidity risk is managed at a legal entity level with the Group consolidated LCR representing the composite of the Ring-Fenced Bank and Non Ring-Fenced Bank entities.\n\nThe Group's credit ratings continue to reflect the resilience of the Group's business model and the strength of the balance sheet. In October, Moody's downgraded Lloyds Bank plc from Aa3/Negative to A1/Stable due to the removal of the uplift for government support. This impacted a number of other UK peers and was triggered by the downgrade of the UK sovereign rating a few days earlier given the agency's concerns around the pandemic and the UK's exit from the European Union, but did not impact the standalone rating of the bank. Over the year both S&P and Fitch have affirmed the Group's ratings, albeit with negative outlooks to reflect their concerns over the UK economy.",

Despite the more challenging funding conditions around the end of the first quarter, the Group saw strong demand in a number of public issuances, and completed/uni00A0\u00a39.9 billion of long-term funding throughout 2020 across the Group's main issuing entities. This was below the Group's guidance (of the lower end of a \u00a310-15 billion range) given the availability of more cost effective funding via the TFSME. In addition, the Group has been active in offering liquidity to investors through buyback and liability management activity, whilst maintaining a prudent approach to managing funding and liquidity with long-term funding buyback volumes of \u00a37.0 billion during 2020. Overall, total wholesale funding volumes totalled \u00a3109.4 billion as at 31 December 2020. The Group plans to continue to access wholesale funding markets in 2021. The continued availability of TFSME will limit the overall wholesale funding requirements of Lloyds Bank plc.\n\n## Liquidity Portfolio\n\nAt 31 December 2020, the banking business had \u00a3141.7 billion of highly liquid unencumbered LCR eligible assets, based on a monthly rolling average over the previous 12 months post any liquidity haircuts (31 December 2019: \u00a3130.3 billion), of which \u00a3140.3 billion is LCR level 1 eligible (31 December 2019: \u00a3129.1 billion) and \u00a31.4 billion is LCR level 2 eligible (31 December 2019: \u00a31.2 billion). These assets are available to meet cash and collateral outflows and regulatory requirements. The Insurance business manages a separate liquidity portfolio to mitigate insurance liquidity risk.\n\n## LCR eligible assets\n\n|                                            | Average   2020 1 \u00a3bn   | Average   2019 1 \u00a3bn   | Change %   |\n|--------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------|\n| Level 1                                    |                        |                        |            |\n| Cash and central bank reserves             | 69.3                   | 50.9                   | 36         |\n| High quality government/MDB/agency bonds 2 | 68.1                   | 76.4                   | (11)       |\n| High quality covered bonds                 | 2.9                    | 1.8                    | 61         |\n| Total                                      | 140.3                  | 129.1                  | 9          |\n| Level 2 3                                  | 1.4                    | 1.2                    | 17         |\n| Total LCR eligible assets                  | 141.7                  | 130.3                  | 9          |\n\n## LCR eligible assets by currency\n\n|                     | Sterling \u00a3bn   | US Dollar \u00a3bn   | Euro \u00a3bn   | Other  currencies \u00a3bn   | Total \u00a3bn   |\n|---------------------|----------------|-----------------|------------|-------------------------|-------------|\n| At 31 December 2020 |                |                 |            |                         |             |\n| Level 1             | 109.7          | 15.6            | 15.0       | -                       | 140.3       |\n| Level 2             | 0.9            | 0.3             | 0.2        | -                       | 1.4         |\n| Total 1             | 110.6          | 15.9            | 15.2       | -                       | 141.7       |\n| At 31 December 2019 |                |                 |            |                         |             |\n| Level 1             | 100.5          | 15.6            | 13.0       | -                       | 129.1       |\n| Level 2             | 0.7            | 0.5             | -          | -                       | 1.2         |\n| Total 1             | 101.2          | 16.1            | 13.0       | -                       | 130.3       |\n\nThe banking business also has a significant amount of non-LCR eligible liquid assets which are eligible for use in a range of central bank or similar facilities, including the Bank of England's Term Funding Scheme with additional incentives for SMEs (TFSME). Future use of such facilities will be based on prudent liquidity management and economic considerations, having regard for external market conditions.\n\n## Stress testing results\n\nInternal liquidity stress testing results at 31 December 2020/uni00A0(calculated as an average of month end observations over the previous 12 months) showed that the banking business had liquidity resources representing 137 per cent of modelled outflows over a three month period from all wholesale funding sources, retail and corporate deposits, intraday requirements and rating dependent contracts under the Group's most severe liquidity stress scenario.\n\nThis scenario includes a two notch downgrade of the Group's current long-term debt rating and accompanying one notch short-term downgrade implemented instantaneously by all major rating agencies.\n\n## Encumbered assets\n\nThis disclosure provides further detail on the availability of assets that could be used to support potential future funding requirements of the Group.\n\nThe disclosure is not designed to identify assets that would be available in the event of a resolution or bankruptcy.\n\nThe Board and the Group Asset and Liability Committee (GALCO) monitor and manage total balance sheet encumbrance using a number of risk appetite metrics. At 31 December 2020, the Group had \u00a346.9 billion (31 December 2019: \u00a360.6 billion) of externally encumbered on-balance sheet assets with counterparties other than central banks. The decrease in encumbered assets was primarily driven by securitisation and covered bond redemptions. The Group also had \u00a3707.2 billion (31 December 2019: \u00a3639.5 billion) of unencumbered on-balance sheet assets, and \u00a3117.2 billion (31 December 2019: \u00a3133.7 billion) of pre-positioned and encumbered assets held with central banks, the reduction in the latter was primarily driven by the amortisation of the asset portfolios pledged to access Bank of England funding schemes. Primarily, the Group encumbers mortgages, unsecured lending and credit card receivables through the issuance programmes and tradable securities through securities financing activity. The Group mainly positions mortgage assets at central banks.",

        "page_content": "Risk management continued\n\n## Capital risk\n\n## Definition\n\nCapital risk is defined as the risk that the Group has a sub-optimal quantity or quality of capital or that capital is inefficiently deployed across the Group.\n\n## Exposures\n\nA capital risk exposure arises when the Group has insufficient capital resources to support its strategic objectives and plans, and to meet both regulatory and external stakeholder requirements and expectations. This could arise due to a depletion of the Group's capital resources as a result of the crystallisation of any of the risks to which it is exposed, or through a significant increase in risk-weighted assets as a result of rule changes or economic deterioration. Alternatively a shortage of capital could arise from an increase in the minimum requirements for capital, leverage or MREL either at Group, Ring-Fenced Bank (RFB) sub-group or regulated entity level./uni00A0The Group's capital management approach is focused on maintaining sufficient and appropriate capital resources across all regulated levels of its structure in order to prevent such exposures while optimising value for shareholders.\n\n## Measurement\n\nThe Group maintains capital levels across all regulated entities commensurate with a prudent level of solvency to achieve financial resilience and market confidence. To support this, capital risk appetite is calibrated by taking into consideration both an internal view of the amount of capital to hold as well as external regulatory requirements.\n\nThe Group measures both its capital requirements and the amount of capital resources it holds to meet those requirements through applying the regulatory framework defined by the Capital Requirements Directive and Regulation (CRD IV), as amended by revisions to the Capital Requirements Directive implemented in December 2020 (CRD V) and by those provisions of the revised Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR II) that came into force in June 2019 and December 2020. The requirements are implemented in the UK by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and supplemented through additional regulation under the PRA Rulebook. Further details of the regulatory capital and leverage frameworks that the Group is subject to, including the means by which its capital and leverage requirements and capital resources are calculated, will be provided in the Group's Pillar 3 Report.\n\nDuring 2020 regulators undertook a series of measures in response to the coronavirus pandemic. This included supportive revisions made to the IFRS 9 transitional arrangements for capital, which the Group applies in full. Over the short to medium-term, these arrangements will provide some stability in capital requirements against the increased provisioning and subsequent volatility connected to the impact of IFRS 9. This is particularly evident from the current application of the arrangements which has seen the significant increase in Stage 1 and Stage 2 expected credit losses during the first half of 2020 partially offset for capital purposes.\n\nThe UK left the EU on 31 January 2020 but remained subject to changes to EU capital regulation until the end of the/uni00A0transition period on 31 December 2020. Under temporary transitional powers (TTP) granted to the PRA, EU capital rules that existed on 31 December 2020 will continue to generally apply until 31 March 2022. This is subject to revision following any significant changes introduced by UK regulators, including changes which implement the remaining parts of CRR II that are not yet in force.\n\nThe minimum amount of total capital, under Pillar 1 of the regulatory framework, is set at 8 per cent of total risk-weighted assets. At least 4.5 per cent of risk-weighted assets are required to be covered by common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital and at least 6 per cent of risk-weighted assets are required to be covered by tier 1 capital. These minimum Pillar 1 requirements are supplemented by additional minimum requirements under Pillar 2A of the regulatory framework, the aggregate of which is referred to as the Group's Total Capital Requirement (TCR), and a number of regulatory capital buffers as described below.\n\nAdditional minimum requirements under Pillar 2A are set by the PRA as a firm-specific Individual Capital Requirement (ICR) reflecting a point in time estimate, which may change over time, of the minimum amount of capital to cover risks that are not fully covered by Pillar 1, such as credit concentration and operational risk, and those risks not covered at all by Pillar 1, such as pensions and interest rate risk in the banking book (IRRBB). During the year the PRA reduced the Group's total Pillar 2A capital requirement from c.4.6 per cent to c.3.8 per cent of risk-weighted assets at 31 December 2020, of which c.2.1 per cent of risk-weighted assets must be met by CET1 capital.\n\nThis comprised of both the initial reduction applied in the first half of 2020 and a second reduction applied in December 2020 which is designed to reflect the additional resilience from the higher UK countercyclical capital buffer rate which in normal conditions will be set at 2 per cent (currently set at 0 per cent). The latter reduction is currently fully offset at CET1 level by other regulatory capital requirements as at 31 December 2020.\n\nThe Group is also required to hold a number of regulatory capital buffers which are required to be met with CET1 capital.\n\nSystemic buffers are designed to hold systemically important banks to higher capital standards, so that they can withstand a greater level of stress before requiring resolution.\n\n- Although the Group is not currently classified as a global systemically important institution (G-SII) under the Capital Requirements Directive, it has been classified as an 'other' systemically important institution (O-SII) by the PRA.\n- The O-SII buffer (formerly referred to as the systemic risk buffer) applies to the Group's RFB sub-group and is currently set at 2.0 per cent of the RFB sub-group's risk- weighted assets. The size of the buffer applied to the RFB sub-group is dependent upon the level of its total assets. The O-SII buffer equates to 1.7 per cent of risk-weighted assets at Group level, with the difference reflecting the risk-weighted assets of the Group that are not in the RFB sub-group and for which the O-SII buffer does not therefore apply. It is the PRA's policy to include this in the Group's PRA buffer./uni00A0\n\nThe capital conservation buffer (CCB) is a standard buffer of 2.5 per cent of risk-weighted assets designed to provide for losses in the event of stress.\n\nThe countercyclical capital buffer (CCYB) is time-varying and is designed to require banks to hold additional capital to remove or reduce the build-up of systemic risk in times of credit boom, providing additional loss absorbing capacity and acting as an incentive for banks to constrain further credit growth. The amount of the buffer is determined by reference to buffer rates applied by the Bank of England's Financial Policy Committee (FPC) for the individual countries where the Group has relevant credit exposures. The CCYB rate for the UK is currently set at 0 per cent as a result of the measures introduced by UK regulators during the first half of 2020 in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Given the Group's UK focused business model, the overall countercyclical capital buffer at 31 December 2020 for the Group was around 0 per cent of risk-weighted assets. In December 2020, the FPC confirmed that it expects the UK CCYB rate to remain at 0 per cent until at least Q4 2021 and due to the usual 12-month implementation lag, any subsequent increase would not take effect until Q4 2022 at the earliest. The FPC also noted that the eventual pace of return to a standard 2 per cent UK CCYB rate will depend on banks' ability to rebuild capital while continuing to support households and businesses.\n\nAs part of the Group's capital planning process, forecast capital positions are subjected to stress testing to determine the adequacy of the Group's capital resources against minimum requirements, including the ICR. The PRA considers outputs from both the Group's internal stress tests and Bank of England stress tests, in conjunction with other information, as part of the process for informing the setting of a bank-specific capital buffer for the Group, known as the PRA Buffer. The PRA requires this buffer to remain confidential.\n\nUnder previous Bank of England stress tests, the BoE has taken action to avoid an unwarranted de facto increase in capital requirements that could result from the interaction of IFRS 9. The stress hurdle rates for banks participating in past exercises were adjusted to recognise the additional resilience provided by the earlier provisions taken under IFRS 9. A similar approach will be applied for the forthcoming 2021 solvency stress test. The Bank is continuing to work on a more enduring treatment of IFRS 9 for the purposes of future stress tests and will collect additional data during the 2021 solvency stress test to help inform a future approach.\n\nAll buffers are required to be met with CET1 capital. Usage of the PRA Buffer would trigger a dialogue between the Group and the PRA to agree what action is required whereas a breach of the combined buffer (all other regulatory buffers, as referenced above) would give rise to mandatory restrictions upon any discretionary capital distributions. As part of the regulatory response to the coronavirus pandemic the PRA has communicated its expectation that banks' capital and liquidity buffers can be drawn down as necessary to support the real economy through the shock and that sufficient time will be made available to restore buffers in a gradual manner.\n\nIn addition to the risk-based capital framework outlined above, the Group is also subject to minimum capital requirements under the UK Leverage Ratio",

        "page_content": "Framework. The leverage ratio is calculated by dividing fully loaded tier 1 capital resources by the leverage exposure which is a defined measure of on-balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet items.\n\nThe minimum leverage ratio requirement under the UK Leverage Ratio Framework is 3.25 per cent. This is supplemented by a time-varying countercyclical leverage buffer (CCLB) which is determined by multiplying the leverage exposure measure by 35 per cent of the countercyclical capital buffer (CCYB) rate. As at/uni00A031 December 2020/uni00A0the CCLB for the Group was 0 per cent. An additional leverage ratio buffer (ALRB) of 0.7 per cent applies to the RFB sub-group and is determined by multiplying the RFB sub-group leverage exposure measure by 35 per cent of the O-SII buffer. This equates to 0.6 per cent of the total leverage exposure measure at Group level.\n\nAt least 75 per cent of the 3.25 per cent minimum leverage ratio requirement as well as 100 per cent of regulatory leverage buffers must be met by CET1 capital.\n\nThe leverage ratio framework does not currently give rise to higher regulatory capital requirements for the Group than the risk-based capital framework.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nThe Group has a capital management framework that includes the setting of capital risk appetite and capital planning and stress testing activities. Close monitoring of capital and leverage ratios is undertaken to ensure the Group meets regulatory requirements and risk appetite levels and deploys its capital resources efficiently.\n\nThe Group monitors early warning indicators and maintains a Capital Contingency Framework as part of a Recovery Plan which are designed to identify emerging capital concerns at an early stage, so that mitigating actions can be taken, if needed. The Recovery Plan sets out a range of potential mitigating actions that could be taken in response to a stress. For example, the Group is able to accumulate additional capital through the retention of profits over time, which can be enhanced through reducing or cancelling proposed dividend payments and share buybacks, by raising new equity via, for example, a rights issue or debt exchange and by raising additional tier 1 or tier 2 capital securities. The cost and availability of additional capital is dependent upon market conditions and perceptions at the time. This type of activity was demonstrated in Q3 2019 with the cancellation of the remaining share buy-back programme and more recently in Q1 2020 with the announcement to cancel the planned 2019 year-end dividend./uni00A0\n\nThe Group is also able to manage the demand for capital through management actions including adjusting its lending strategy, risk hedging strategies and through business disposals.\n\nCapital policies and procedures are well established and subject to independent oversight.\n\n## Monitoring\n\nThe Group's capital is actively managed and monitoring capital ratios is a key factor in the Group's planning processes, which separately cover the RFB sub-group and key individual banking entities. Multi-year base case forecasts of the Group's capital position, based upon the Group's operating plan, are produced at least annually to inform the Group's capital plan whilst shorter term forecasts are more frequently undertaken to understand and respond to variations of the Group's actual performance against the plan. This has been a particular focus recently given the significant uncertainties caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The Group's capital plan is tested for capital adequacy using relevant stress scenarios and sensitivities covering adverse economic conditions as well as other adverse factors that could impact the Group.\n\nRegular monitoring of the capital position is undertaken by a range of committees, including Group Capital Risk Committee (GCRC), Group Financial Risk Committee (GFRC), Group and Ring-Fenced Bank Asset and Liability Committee (GALCO), Group Risk Committee (GRC), Board Risk Committee (BRC) and the Board. This includes reporting of actual ratios against forecasts and risk appetite, base case and stress scenario projected ratios, and review of early warning indicators and assessment against the Capital Contingency Framework.\n\nThe regulatory framework within which the Group operates continues to evolve and further detail on this will be provided in the Group's Pillar 3 report. The Group continues to monitor prudential developments very closely, analysing the potential capital impacts to ensure that, through organic capital generation and management actions, the Group continues to maintain a strong capital position that exceeds both minimum regulatory\n\nrequirements and the Group's risk appetite and is consistent with market expectations.\n\n## Target capital ratios\n\nThe Board's view of the ongoing level of CET1 capital required by the Group to grow the business, meet regulatory requirements and cover uncertainties continues to be around 12.5 per cent plus a management buffer of around 1 per cent.\n\nThis takes into account, amongst other things:\n\n- the minimum Pillar 1 CET1 capital requirement of 4.5 per cent of riskweighted assets\n- the Group's Pillar 2A requirement set by the PRA. During the year the PRA reduced the Group's CET1 Pillar 2A capital requirement from c.2.6 per cent to c.2.1/uni00A0per cent of risk-weighted assets at 31 December 2020\n- the CCB requirement of 2.5 per cent of risk-weighted assets\n- the Group's current CCYB requirement which is around 0 per cent of riskweighted assets\n- the RFB sub-group's O-SII buffer of 2.0 per cent of risk-weighted assets, which equates to 1.7 per cent of risk-weighted assets at Group level\n- the Group's PRA Buffer\n\n## Dividend policy\n\nFollowing a request made by the PRA to large UK banks in March 2020, the Group suspended the payment of dividends on ordinary shares for the remainder of the year and cancelled the payment of the final dividend for 2019. These actions were undertaken as a precautionary measure to preserve capital as the spread of the coronavirus pandemic led to a UK-wide lockdown, with the potential to create a significant and prolonged downturn.\n\nIn December 2020, the PRA announced that dividend payments could recommence, provided that this was subject to a prudent framework for the setting of such distributions. The framework established by the PRA in respect of any distributions for 2020 requires banks to take into account the ongoing economic uncertainties and the need for banks to continue to support the re-build of the UK economy through lending, particularly in the event of a more severe and prolonged downturn. As a result the PRA established a cap on distributions for year end 2020, based on the higher of i) 20 basis points of total risk-weighted assets at 31 December 2020, or ii) 25 per cent of cumulative profits for 2019 and 2020 after deducting prior shareholder distributions covering the two year period./uni00A0\n\nGiven the Group's strong capital position at year end and the regulator's removal of the prohibition on capital distributions, the Board has recommended a final ordinary dividend of 0.57 pence per share, the maximum allowed under the PRA's framework.\n\nIn addition the PRA has noted its intent to provide a further update on distributions ahead of the 2021 half-year results for the large UK banks. It is expected that the PRA will take account of the outcome of the first stage of the BoE 2021 solvency stress test exercise in informing its approach to half-year distributions. Ahead of the update banks may accrue for (on an appropriately prudent basis) but not pay out any dividends. The Group will update the market on any potential interim dividend with the half year results, following receipt of this update from the regulator.\n\nThe Board remains committed to future capital returns. In 2021, subject to regulatory guidance, the Board intends to grow the dividend from 2020, in line with its progressive and sustainable ordinary dividend policy, and to accrue dividends. As normal, the Board will give due consideration at year end to the size of the final dividend payment based on circumstances at the time.\n\nSurplus capital represents capital over and above the amount management wish to retain to grow the business, meet regulatory requirements and cover uncertainties. The amount of required capital may vary from time to time depending on circumstances and by its nature there can be no guarantee that any return of surplus capital will be made.\n\nThe ability of the Group to pay a dividend is also subject to constraints including the availability of distributable reserves, legal and regulatory restrictions and the Group's financial and operating performance.\n\nDistributable reserves are determined as required by the Companies Act 2006 by reference to a company's individual financial statements. At 31 December 2020 Lloyds Banking Group plc ('the Company') had accumulated distributable reserves of approximately \u00a310 billion. Substantially all of the Company's merger reserve is available for distribution under UK company law as a result of transactions undertaken to recapitalise the Company in 2009.",

        "page_content": "## Risk management continued\n\nLloyds Banking Group plc acts as a holding company which also issues capital and other securities to capitalise and fund the activities of the Group. The profitability of the holding company, and its ability to sustain dividend payments, is therefore dependent upon the continued receipt of dividends and interest from its main operating subsidiaries, including Lloyds Bank plc (the Ring-Fenced Bank), Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets plc (the non-ringfenced bank), LBG Equity Investments Limited and Scottish Widows Group Limited (the insurance business). The principal operating subsidiary is Lloyds Bank plc which, at 31 December 2020, had a consolidated CET1 capital ratio of/uni00A015.5 per cent (31 December 2019: 14.3 per cent). A number of Group subsidiaries, principally those with banking and insurance activities, are subject to regulatory capital requirements which require minimum amounts of capital to be maintained relative to their size and risk. The Group actively manages the capital of its subsidiaries, which includes monitoring the regulatory capital ratios for its banking and insurance subsidiaries and, on a consolidated basis, the RFB sub-group against approved risk appetite levels. The Group operates a formal capital management policy which requires all subsidiary entities, subject to agreement by their governing bodies, to remit surplus capital to their parent companies.\n\n## Minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL)\n\nIn 2015, the Financial Stability Board established an international standard for the total loss absorbing capacity (TLAC) of global systemically important banks (G-SIBs). The standard, which first applied from 1 January 2019, is designed to enhance the resilience of the global financial system by ensuring that failing G-SIBs have sufficient capital to absorb losses and recapitalise under resolution, whilst continuing to provide critical banking services.\n\nG-SIBs are subject to the framework for the minimum requirements for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL) that came into force in June 2019 following the implementation of CRR II. The MREL framework reflects the European implementation of the global TLAC standard. The purpose of MREL is to require firms to maintain sufficient own funds and eligible liabilities that are capable of credibly bearing losses or recapitalising a bank whilst in resolution. MREL can be satisfied by a combination of regulatory capital and certain unsecured liabilities (which must be subordinate to a firm's operating liabilities).\n\nAs the Group is not classified as a G-SIB it is not directly subject to the CRR II MREL.\n\nIn the UK the Bank of England has implemented MREL through the Banking Act and a statement of policy on MREL (MREL SoP). The Group is subject to these requirements and must therefore maintain a minimum level of MREL resources. The Group operates a single point of entry (SPE) resolution strategy, with Lloyds Banking Group plc as the designated resolution entity.\n\nApplying the Bank of England's MREL SoP to current minimum capital requirements, the Group's MREL from 1 January 2020, excluding regulatory capital and leverage buffers, is the higher of 2 times Pillar 1 plus Pillar 2A, equivalent to 19.8 per cent of risk-weighted assets, or 6.5 per cent of the UK leverage ratio exposure measure.\n\nFrom 1 January 2022 the Group's indicative MREL, excluding regulatory capital and leverage buffers, will increase to the higher of 2 times Pillar 1 plus 2 times Pillar 2A, equivalent to 23.6 per cent of risk-weighted assets, or 6.5 per cent of the UK leverage ratio exposure measure.\n\nIn addition, CET1 capital cannot be used to meet both MREL and capital or leverage buffers.\n\nThe BoE has commenced a review of the current MREL framework and expects to consult on proposed changes during the year with a view to setting final end-state requirements for 1 January 2022.\n\nInternal MREL also apply to the Group's material sub-groups and entities, including the RFB sub-group, Lloyds Bank plc, Bank of Scotland plc and Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets plc.\n\n## Analysis of capital position\n\nThe Group's CET1 capital ratio increased to 16.2 per cent after the accrual for ordinary dividends (31 December 2019: 13.8 per cent on a pro forma basis), amounting to a capital build for the year of 242 basis points (263 basis points prior to the accrual for the full year ordinary dividend).\n\nExcluding the impact of the revised capital treatment for intangible software assets of 51 basis points and the reversal of the full year 2019 ordinary dividend accrual of 83 basis points, the capital build for the year prior to the accrual for the current full year ordinary dividend was 129 basis points, reflecting the following:\n\n- banking business capital build before impairment charge of 192 basis points, which was largely offset by the impairment charge for the year of 174 basis points\n- the application of IFRS 9 transitional arrangements for capital, which have provided an in-year benefit amounting to 83 basis points in the form of relief against the impact of the increase in the impairment charge\n- a net increase of 28 basis points resulting from the reduction in underlying risk-weighted assets and excess expected losses as well as favourable market and other movements, partially offset by pension contributions (equivalent to 46 basis points) made during the year\n\nThe accrual for foreseeable dividends reflects the recommended final ordinary dividend of 0.57 pence per share.\n\nExcluding the application of the IFRS 9 transitional arrangements for capital the Group's CET1 capital ratio after ordinary dividends would be 15.0 per cent (31 December 2019: 13.4 per cent on a pro forma basis).\n\nThe PRA is consulting on a proposal to reverse the revised capital treatment of intangible software assets (which currently follows EU capital regulations), thereby reinstating the original requirement to deduct in full. Excluding the impact of the revised capital treatment the Group's CET1 capital ratio after ordinary dividends would be 15.7 per cent./uni00A0\n\nThe transitional total capital ratio, after ordinary dividends, increased to 23.3 per cent (31 December 2019: 21.5 per cent on a pro forma basis), largely reflecting the increase in CET 1 capital, offset in part by the reduction in tier 2 capital, the latter reflecting instrument calls, regulatory amortisation and other movements, partially offset by the net outcome of subordinated liability exchange exercises undertaken during the year.\n\nThe Group's transitional minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL), after ordinary dividends, increased to 36.4 per cent (31 December 2019: 32.6 per cent on a pro forma basis), reflecting the increase in transitional total capital and an increase in senior unsecured securities driven by net new issuance./uni00A0\n\nThe UK leverage ratio, after ordinary dividends, increased from 5.2 per cent on a pro forma basis to 5.8 per cent, largely reflecting the increase in the fully loaded tier 1 capital position, partially offset by the increase in the leverage exposure measure reflecting movements in securities financing transactions and off-balance sheet items.\n\n## Total capital requirement\n\nThe Group's total capital requirement (TCR) as at 31 December 2020, being the aggregate of the Group's Pillar 1 and current Pillar 2A capital requirements, was \u00a323,918 million (31 December 2019: \u00a325,608 million).\n\n## Capital resources\n\nAn analysis of the Group's capital position as at 31 December 2020 is presented in the following section on both a transitional arrangements basis and a fully loaded basis in respect of legacy capital securities subject to current grandfathering provisions. In addition the Group's capital position under both bases reflects the application of the separate transitional arrangements for IFRS 9.",

In addition, following revisions to eligibility criteria for capital instruments under CRR II, certain tier 1 capital instruments of the Group that will transition to tier 2 capital by 2022 will cease to qualify as regulatory capital in June 2025.

Significant investments primarily arise from investments in the Group's Insurance business.\n\nThe risk-weighted assets movement table provides analysis of the movement in risk-weighted assets in the period by risk type and an insight into the key drivers of the movements. The key driver analysis is compiled on a monthly basis through the identification and categorisation of risk-weighted asset movements and is subject to management judgment.\n\nCredit risk, risk-weighted assets:\n\n- Asset size reduction of \u00a39.3 billion includes lower levels of retail unsecured lending and reductions in non-government related commercial lending, together with continued optimisation in Commercial Banking and the exit of equity investments\n- Asset quality increase of \u00a32.8 billion includes the impact of credit migration and model calibrations, partially offset by the benefit from House Price Index increases during 2020\n- Model updates increase of \u00a31.8 billion relates to changes to the retail mortgage models\n- Methodology and policy increase of \u00a31.7 billion reflects the full implementation of the new securitisation framework on 1 January 2020 and the recognition of the revised capital treatment of intangible software assets, partially offset by the impact of revisions to the SME scalar\n\nCounterparty credit risk, risk-weighted assets increased by \u00a30.9 billion due to movements in market rates during the year.\n\nMarket risk, risk-weighted assets/uni00A0increased by \u00a30.4bn driven by a modest increase in interest rate risk exposure from a low risk base and COVID-19 related volatility entering the VaR model./uni00A0\n\n## Leverage ratio\n\n## Analysis of leverage movements\n\nThe Group's fully loaded UK leverage ratio increased to 5.8 per cent during the period, primarily driven by the increase in tier 1 capital. The leverage exposure measure increased by \u00a311.7 billion during the period, largely reflecting the increase in the SFT and off-balance sheet exposure measures./uni00A0Following a direction received from the PRA the Group is permitted to exclude lending under the UK Government's Bounce Back Loan Scheme (BBLS) from the leverage exposure measure.\n\nThe derivatives exposure measure, representing derivative financial instruments per the balance sheet net of deconsolidation and derivatives adjustments, reduced by \u00a32.1 billion during the period, largely as a result of a reduction in the regulatory potential future exposure add-on following trade compressions through central counterparties.\n\nThe SFT exposure measure, representing SFT assets per the balance sheet net of deconsolidation and other SFT adjustments, increased by \u00a37.8 billion during the period, primarily reflecting an increase in volumes.\n\nOff-balance sheet items increased by \u00a37.7 billion during the period, largely reflecting new residential mortgage offers placed and an increase in corporate facilities.\n\nThe average UK leverage ratio was 5.6 per cent over the quarter, with the actual ratio increasing to 5.8 per cent in the final month of the quarter which largely reflected the increase in tier 1 capital in December following the introduction of the revised capital treatment of intangible software assets.",

        "page_content": "## Risk management continued\n\nThe Group applies the full extent of the IFRS 9 transitional arrangements for capital as set out under CRR Article 473a (as amended via the CRR 'Quick Fix' revisions published in June 2020). Specifically, the Group has opted to apply both paragraphs 2 and 4 of CRR Article 473a (static and dynamic relief) and in addition to apply a 100 per cent risk weight to the consequential Standardised credit risk exposure add-back as permitted under paragraph 7a of the revisions.\n\nAs at 31 December 2020, static relief under the transitional arrangements amounted to \u00a3616 million (31 December 2019: \u00a3742 million) and dynamic relief under the transitional arrangements amounted to \u00a31,865 million (31 December 2019: nil) through CET 1 capital.\n\n## Stress testing\n\nThe Group undertakes a wide-ranging programme of stress testing providing a comprehensive view of the potential impacts arising from the risks to which the Group and its key legal entities are exposed. One of the most important uses of stress testing is to assess the resilience of the operational and strategic plans of the Group and its legal entities to adverse economic conditions and other key vulnerabilities. As part of this programme the Group conducted a macroeconomic stress test of the operating plan in the second half of the year which shows that the Group's capital position is resilient to a further severe economic shock over and above the stress in the current economic environment.\n\nThe Group also participates in stress tests run by the Bank of England. The forthcoming 2021 solvency stress test aims to update and refine the desktop analysis undertaken by the Bank during 2020. Though it follows a different approach, it will require the Group to show how resilient it is to a severe economic shock in addition to what has been experienced over 2020 (HPI and CRE values are assumed to fall a further 33 per cent and unemployment peaks at 11.9 per cent).\n\nThe Climate Biennial Exploratory Scenario (CBES) is scheduled to launch in June 2021. The Group has invested significant resource to prepare for this, in particular in acquiring climate related data, and will leverage the experience gained through that exercise to further embed climate risk into stress testing activities./uni00A0\n\n## G-SIB indicators\n\nAlthough the Group is not currently classified as a Global Systemically Important Bank (G-SIB), by virtue of the Group's leverage exposure measure exceeding \u20ac200 billion the Group is required to report G-SIB indicator metrics to the PRA. The Group's indicator metrics used within the/uni00A02020/uni00A0Basel G-SIBs annual exercise will be disclosed from April 2021 and the results are expected to be made available by the Basel Committee later this year.\n\n## Insurance businesses\n\nThe business transacted by the insurance companies within the Group comprises both life insurance business and General Insurance business. Life insurance business comprises unit-linked business, non-profit business and with-profits business.\n\nScottish Widows Limited (SW Ltd) holds the only with-profit fund managed by the Group. Each insurance company within the Group is regulated by the PRA.\n\nThe Solvency II regime for insurers and insurance groups came into force from 1 January 2016. The insurance businesses are required to calculate solvency capital requirements and available capital on a risk-based approach. The Insurance business of the Group calculates regulatory capital on the basis of an internal model, which was approved by the PRA on 5 December 2015, with the latest major change to the model approved in November 2020.\n\nThe minimum required capital must be maintained at all times throughout the year. These capital requirements and the capital available to meet them are regularly estimated in order to ensure that capital maintenance requirements are being met.\n\nAll minimum regulatory requirements of the insurance companies have been met during the year.\n\n## Insurance underwriting risk\n\n## Definition\n\nInsurance underwriting risk is defined as the risk of adverse developments in the timing, frequency and severity of claims for insured/underwritten events and in customer behaviour, leading to reductions in earnings and/or value.\n\n## Exposures\n\nThe major source of insurance underwriting risk within the Group is the Insurance business.\n\nLongevity and persistency are key risks within the life and pensions business. Longevity risk arises from the annuity portfolios where policyholders' future cash flows are guaranteed at retirement and increases in life expectancy, beyond current assumptions, will increase the cost of annuities. Longevity risk exposures are expected to increase with the Insurance business growth in the annuity market. Persistency assumptions are set to give a best estimate, however customer behaviour may result in increased cancellations or cessation of contributions.\n\nThe Group's defined benefit pension schemes also expose the Group to longevity risk. For further information please refer to the defined benefit pension schemes component of the market risk section and note 34 to the financial statements.\n\nProperty insurance risk is a key risk within the General Insurance business, through Home Insurance. Exposures can arise, for example, in extreme weather conditions such as flooding, when property damage claims are higher than expected.\n\n## Measurement\n\nInsurance underwriting risks are measured using a variety of techniques including stress, reverse stress and scenario testing, as well as stochastic modelling. Current and potential future insurance underwriting risk exposures are assessed and aggregated on a range of stresses including risk measures based on 1-in-200 year stresses for the Insurance business' regulatory capital assessments and other supporting measures where appropriate, including those set out in note 31/uni00A0to the financial statements.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nInsurance underwriting risk in the Insurance business is mitigated in a number of ways:\n\n- General Insurance exposure to accumulations of risk and possible catastrophes is mitigated by reinsurance arrangements broadly spread over different reinsurers. Detailed modelling, including that of the potential losses under various catastrophe scenarios, supports the choice of reinsurance arrangements\n- Insurance processes on underwriting, claims management, pricing and product design\n- Longevity risk transfer and hedging solutions are considered on a regular basis and since 2017 the Group has reinsured \u00a34.2/uni00A0billion of annuitant longevity./uni00A0An established team of longevity and pricing experts supports the annuity proposition\n- Exposure limits by risk type are assessed through the business planning process and used as a control mechanism to ensure risks are taken within risk appetite\n\n## Monitoring\n\nInsurance underwriting risks in the Insurance business are monitored by Insurance senior executive committees and ultimately the Insurance Board. Significant risks from the Insurance business and the defined benefit pension schemes are reviewed by the Group Executive and Group Risk Committees and Board.\n\nInsurance underwriting risk exposures within the Insurance business are monitored against risk appetite. The Insurance business monitors experiences against expectations, for example business volumes and mix, claims and persistency experience. The effectiveness of controls put in place to manage insurance underwriting risk is evaluated and significant divergences from experience or movements in risk exposures are investigated and remedial action taken.",

        "page_content": "## Change/execution risk\n\n## Definition\n\nChange/execution risk is defined as the risk that, in delivering its change agenda, the Group fails to ensure compliance with laws and regulation, maintain effective customer service and availability, and/or operation within the Group's risk appetite.\n\n## Exposures\n\nChange/execution risks arise when the Group undertakes activities which require products, processes, people, systems or controls to change. These changes can be as a result of external drivers (for example, a new piece of regulation that requires the Group to put in place a new process or reporting) and internal drivers (such as the strategic transformation that is outlined in the Group's Strategic Review 2021).\n\n## Measurement\n\nThe Group currently measures change/execution risk against a defined risk appetite metric which is a combination of leading, quality and delivery indicators across the investment portfolio. These indicators are reported through defined internal governance structures in the form of a monthly execution risk dashboard. An associated measure, based on the aggregate performance of the dashboard is included in the Group balanced scorecard.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nThe Group takes a range of mitigating actions with respect to change/ execution risk. These include the following:\n\n- The Board establishes/uni00A0a Group-wide risk appetite and metric for change/ execution risk\n- Ensuring compliance with the Change policy and associated policies and procedures, which set out the principles and key controls that apply across the business and are aligned to the Group risk appetite\n- Businesses assess the potential impacts of undertaking any change activity on their ability to execute effectively, and the potential consequences for existing business risk profiles\n- The implementation of effective governance and control frameworks to ensure adequate controls are in place to manage change activity and act to mitigate the change/execution risks identified. These controls are monitored in line with the Change policy and any additional monitoring that is deemed necessary\n- Events related to change activities are escalated and managed appropriately in line with risk framework guidance\n\n## Monitoring\n\nChange/execution risks from across the Group are monitored and reported through to Board and Group Governance Committees in accordance with the Group's enterprise risk management framework and aligned to the Group's Strategic Review 2021 activities. Risk exposures are discussed monthly through established governance through to Group Transformation Risk Committee with upwards reporting to Board Risk and Executive Committees. In addition, oversight, challenge and reporting are completed at Risk Division level to provide oversight management of risks and the effectiveness of controls, recommending follow up remedial action if required. All material change/execution risk events are escalated in accordance with the formal Group Operational Risk policy and Change policy.\n\n## Conduct risk\n\n## Definition\n\nConduct risk is defined as the risk of customer detriment across the customer lifecycle including: failures in product management, distribution and servicing activities; from other risks materialising, or other activities which could undermine the integrity of the market or distort competition, leading to unfair customer outcomes, regulatory censure, reputational damage or financial loss.\n\n## Exposures\n\nThe Group faces significant conduct risks, which affect all aspects of the Group's operations and all types of customers.\n\nConduct risks can impact directly or indirectly on the Group's customers and could materialise from a number of areas across the Group, including:\n\n- Business and strategic planning that does not sufficiently consider customer needs\n- Ineffective development, management and monitoring of products, their distribution (including the sales process) and post- sales service (including the management of customers in financial difficulties)\n- Unclear, unfair, misleading or untimely customer communications\n- A culture that is not sufficiently customer-centric\n- Poor governance of colleagues' incentives and rewards and approval of schemes which drive unfair customer outcomes\n- Ineffective management and oversight of legacy conduct issues\n- Ineffective management and resolution of customers' complaints or claims\n- Outsourcing of customer service and product delivery to third-parties that do not have the same level of control, oversight and culture as the Group\n- The risks associated with becoming a more digitised bank\n- Poor management, governance and control of data\n\nThere is a high level of scrutiny regarding financial institutions' treatment of customers, including those in vulnerable circumstances, from regulatory bodies, the media, politicians and consumer groups. The COVID-19 pandemic has magnified existing challenges, and brought new challenges for customers, affecting health, income and relationships. The Group continues to apply significant focus to its treatment of customers in financial difficulties and ensuring fair outcomes.\n\nThe Group is also exposed to the risk of engaging in or failing to manage conduct which could constitute market abuse, undermine the integrity of a market in which it is active, distort competition or create conflicts of interest.\n\nThere continues to be a significant focus on market misconduct, resulting from previous issues such as London Inter-bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and foreign exchange (FX).\n\nDue to the level of enhanced focus on conduct, there is a risk that certain aspects of the Group's current or legacy business may be determined by the Financial Conduct Authority, other regulatory bodies or the courts as not being conducted in accordance with applicable laws or regulations, in a manner that fails to deliver fair and reasonable customer treatment, or is inconsistent with market integrity or competition requirements.\n\nThe evolving COVID-19 situation means increased uncertainty surrounding the future, which poses the risk that increasingly more customers face difficulties, become vulnerable and/or struggle to manage their existing commitments.",

        "page_content": "## Risk management continued\n\n## Measurement\n\nTo articulate its conduct risk appetite, the Group has sought more granularity through the use of suitable Conduct Risk Appetite Metrics (CRAMs) and tolerances that indicate where it may be operating outside its conduct risk appetite. These include Board-level conduct risk metrics covering an assessment of overall CRAMs performance, out of appetite CRAMs, Financial Ombudsman Service (FoS) change rates and complaints.\n\nCRAMs have been designed for services and product families offered by the Group and are measured by a consistent set of common metrics. These contain a range of product design, sales and process metrics (including outcome testing outputs) to provide a more holistic view of conduct risks; some products also have a suite of additional bespoke metrics.\n\nEach of the tolerances for the metrics are agreed for the individual product or service and are regularly tracked. At a consolidated level these metrics are part of the Board risk appetite. The Group has, and continues to, evolve its approach to conduct risk measurements, including those supporting customer vulnerability, process delivery and other emerging conduct themes.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nThe Group takes a range of mitigating actions with respect to conduct risk and remains focused on delivering a leading customer experience. The Group's ongoing commitment to good customer outcomes sets the tone from the top and supports the development of the right customer-centric culture, strengthening links between actions to support conduct, culture and customer and enabling more effective control management. Actions to encourage good conduct include:\n\n- Conduct risk appetite established at Group and business area level, with metrics included in the Group risk appetite to ensure ongoing focus\n- Simplified and enhanced conduct policies and procedures in place to ensure appropriate controls and processes that deliver fair customer outcomes, and support market integrity and competition requirements\n- Customer needs considered through divisional customer plans, with integral conduct lens, reviewed and challenged by Group Customer First Committee (GCFC)\n- Cultural transformation: achieving a values-led culture through a focus on behaviours to ensure the Group is transforming its culture for success in a digital world. This is supported by strong direction and tone from senior executives and the Board\n- Continuous embedding of the customer vulnerability framework aligned with the FCA guidance on fair treatment of vulnerable customers launched in January 2021. Development and continued oversight of the implementation of the vulnerability strategy continues through the Group Customer Vulnerability Committee (GCVC) operating at a senior level to prioritise change, drive implementation and ensure consistency across the Group\n- Enhanced product governance framework to ensure products continue to offer customers fair value, and consistently meet their needs throughout their product life cycle; reviewed and challenged by Group Product Governance Committee (GPGC)\n- Enhanced complaints management through effectively responding to, and learning from, root causes of complaint volumes and Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS) change rates\n- Review and oversight of thematic conduct agenda items at senior committees, ensuring holistic consideration of key Group-wide conduct risks\n- Robust recruitment and training, with a continued focus on how the Group manages colleagues' performance with clear customer accountabilities\n- Ongoing engagement with third-parties involved in serving the Group's customers to ensure consistent delivery\n- Monitoring and testing of customer outcomes to ensure the Group delivers fair outcomes for customers throughout the product and service lifecycle, and make continuous improvements to products, services and processes\n- Continued focus on market conduct and member of the Fixed Income, Currencies and Commodities Markets Standard Board\n- Adoption of robust change delivery methodology to enable prioritisation and delivery of initiatives to address conduct challenges\n- Continued focus on proactive identification and mitigation of conduct risk in the Group's Strategic Review 2021\n- Active engagement with regulatory bodies and other stakeholders to develop understanding of concerns related to customer treatment, effective competition and market integrity, to ensure that the Group's strategic conduct focus continues to meet evolving stakeholder expectations\n- Adapting quickly to the evolving COVID-19 situation, being swift to offer the new to market products (BBILs, CBILs) and new regulatory requirements (payment holidays). The Group also continued to support customers in challenging times by adapting support, proactively contacting vulnerable customers, and using insight to understand who may become vulnerable and what their needs could be\n\n## Monitoring\n\nConduct risk is governed through divisional risk committees and significant issues are escalated to the Group Risk Committee, in accordance with the Group's Enterprise Risk Management Framework, as well as through the monthly Consolidated Risk Report. Risk exposures are discussed at divisional risk committees, where oversight, challenge and reporting are completed to assess the effectiveness controls. Remedial action is recommended, if required. All material conduct risk events are escalated in accordance with the Group Operational Risk policy to the respective divisional Managing Directors and Conduct, Compliance and Operational Risk.\n\nGCFC acts as the guardian of customer experience and has responsibility for monitoring and reviewing plans and actions to improve it, providing oversight of customer outcomes and customer experience and providing challenge to divisions to make changes to support the delivery of the Group's vision and foster a customer-centric culture.\n\nA number of activities support the close monitoring of conduct risk including:\n\n- The use of CRAMs across the Group, with a clear escalation route to Board\n- Second line oversight activities\n- Horizon Scanning/uni00A0",

Data risk manifests:\n\n- When personal data is not gathered legally, for a legitimate purpose, or is not managed or protected from misuse and/or processed in a way that complies with General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) and other data privacy regulatory obligations\n- When data quality (accuracy, completeness, consistency, uniqueness, validity and timeliness) is not managed, resulting in data used in systems, processes and products not being fit for the intended purpose\n- When data records are not created, retained, protected, destroyed, or retrieved appropriately\n- When data governance fails to provide robust oversight of data decision-making and the control mechanisms to ensure strategies and management instructions are implemented effectively\n- When data standards are not maintained across core data, data management risks are not managed and data related issues are not remediated as a result of poor data management resulting in inaccurate, incomplete data that is not available at the right time, to the right people, to enable business decisions to be made, and regulatory reporting requirements to be fulfilled\n- When critical data mapping and data information standards are not followed impacting compliance, traceability and understanding of data\n\nFor emerging risks relating to Data, please refer to page/uni00A0148.\n\n## Measurement\n\nData risk is measured through a series of quantitative and qualitative indicators, aligned to key sources of data risk for the Group covering data governance, data management and data privacy and ethics. In addition to risk appetite measures and limits, data risks and controls are monitored and governed through Group and Sub-Group Committees on a monthly basis. Significant issues are escalated to Group Risk Committee.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nData risk is a key component of the Group's enterprise risk management framework, where the focus is on the end to end management of data risk. This ensures that risks are identified, assessed, managed, monitored and reported using the risk and control self-assessment process.\n\nInvestment continues to be made to enhance the maturity of data risk management. Examples including:\n\n- Delivering a data strategy and data risk and control library to ensure data risks are managed within appetite\n- Enhancing capability and awareness in data management and privacy\n- Enhancing assurance of suppliers\n- Delivering enhanced controls and processes for data retention and destruction, deleting large volumes of historic over-retained data\n- Embedding data by design and ethics principles into the data science lifecycle and progressing opportunities to simplify the completion of privacy records impact assessments\n\n## Monitoring\n\nData risk is governed through Group and Sub-Group committees and significant issues are escalated to Group Risk Committee, in accordance with the Group's enterprise risk management framework. Risk exposures are discussed at Group and Sub-Group committees, where oversight, challenge and reporting are completed to assess the effectiveness of controls and agree remedial actions.

In addition, Group-wide data risk issues and the top data risks that Group faces are discussed at Data Cross Divisional Committee and Group Data Committee.\n\nA number of activities support the close monitoring of data risk including:\n\n- Implementation of the data risk and control library to ensure greater coverage and insight of data risk, and ensuring data risks are managed within appetite\n- Design and monitoring of data risk appetite metrics, including key risk indicators and key performance indicators\n- Monitoring and reporting of progress against the Data Capability Assessment Model\n- Monitoring of significant data related issues complaints and breaches\n- Identification and effective mitigation of data risk when planning and implementing transformation or business change\n- Implementation of effective controls to mitigate data risk, including data privacy, ethics, data management and records management\n- Effective monitoring and testing of compliance with data privacy and data management regulatory requirements. For example GDPR and Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS 239) requirements\n- Horizon scanning for changes in the external environment, including but not limited to changes to laws, rules and regulations, for example, the UK's exit from the EU and ensuring data flows remain unaffected\n\n## Governance risk\n\n## Definition\n\nGovernance risk is defined as the risk that the Group's organisational infrastructure fails to provide robust oversight of decision-making and the control mechanisms to ensure strategies and management instructions are implemented effectively.\n\n## Exposures\n\nThe internal and corporate governance arrangements of major financial institutions continue to be subject to a high level of regulatory and public scrutiny. The Group's exposure to governance risk is also reflective of the significant volume of existing and proposed legislation and regulation, both within the UK and across the multiple jurisdictions within which it operates, with which it must comply.\n\n## Measurement\n\nThe Group's governance arrangements are assessed against new or proposed legislation and regulation and best practice among peer organisations in order to identify any areas of enhancement required.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nThe Group's enterprise risk management framework (ERMF) establishes robust arrangements for risk governance, in particular by:\n\n- Defining individual and collective accountabilities for risk management, risk oversight and risk assurance through a three lines of defence model which supports the discharge of responsibilities to customers, shareholders and regulators\n- Outlining governance arrangements which articulate the enterprise-wide approach to risk management\n- Supporting a consistent approach to Group-wide behaviour and risk decision-making through a Group policy framework which helps everyone understand their responsibilities by clearly articulating and communicating rules, standards, boundaries and risk appetite measures which can be controlled, enforced and monitored\n\nUnder the banner of the ERMF, training modules are in place to support all colleagues in understanding and fulfilling their risk responsibilities.\n\nThe Group's Code of Responsibility embodies its values and reflects its commitment to operating responsibly and ethically both at a business and an individual level. All colleagues are required to adhere to the code in all aspects of their roles.\n\nEffective implementation of the ERMF mutually reinforces and is reinforced by the Group's risk culture, which is embedded in its approach to recruitment, selection, training, performance management and reward.",

        "page_content": "## Risk management continued\n\n## Monitoring\n\nA review of the Group's ERMF, which includes the status of the Group's principles and policy framework, and the design and operational effectiveness of key governance committees, is undertaken on an annual basis and the findings are reported to the Group Risk Committee, Board Risk Committee and the Board.\n\nFor further information on corporate governance see pages 86 to 97.\n\n## People risk\n\n## Definition\n\nPeople risk is defined as the risk that the Group fails to provide an appropriate colleague and customer-centric culture, supported by robust reward and wellbeing policies and processes; effective leadership to manage colleague resources; effective talent and succession management; and robust control to ensure all colleague-related requirements are met.\n\n## Exposures\n\nThe Group's management of material people risks is critical to its capacity to deliver against its strategic objectives, particularly in the context of increasing volumes of organisational, political and external market change and increasing digitisation. The Group is exposed to the following key people risks:\n\n- Failure to recruit, develop and retain colleagues, including ineffective management of succession planning or failure to identify appropriate talent pipeline\n- The increasing digitisation of the business is changing the capability mix required and may impact the Group's ability to attract and retain talent\n- Senior Managers and Certification Regime (SM&CR) and additional regulatory constraints on remuneration structures may impact the Group's ability to attract and retain talent\n- Failure to manage capacity, colleagues having excessive demands placed on them resulting in wellbeing issues and business objectives not being met\n- Failure to meet all colleague-related legal and regulatory requirements\n- Ineffective leadership, poor communication, weak performance, inappropriate remuneration policies\n- Colleague engagement may continue to be challenged by ongoing media attention on culture within the banking sector, conduct and ethical considerations\n- Inadequately designed people processes that are not resilient to withstand unexpected events\n\nFor emerging risks relating to people risk and ways of working, please refer to page/uni00A0148.\n\n## Measurement\n\nPeople risk is measured through a series of quantitative and qualitative indicators, aligned to key sources of people risk for the Group such as succession, retention, colleague engagement and wellbeing. In addition to risk appetite measures and limits, people risks and controls are monitored on a monthly basis via the Group's risk governance framework and reporting structures.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nThe Group takes many mitigating actions with respect to people risk. Key areas of focus include:\n\n- Focusing on leadership and colleague engagement, through delivery of strategies to attract, retain and develop high calibre people together with implementation of rigorous succession planning\n- Continued focus on the Group's culture and inclusivity strategy by developing and delivering initiatives that reinforce the appropriate behaviours which generate the best possible long-term outcomes for customers and colleagues\n- Managing organisational capability and capacity through divisional people strategies to ensure there are the right skills and resources to meet customers' needs and deliver the Group's strategic plan\n- Maintaining effective remuneration arrangements to ensure they promote an appropriate culture and colleague behaviours that meet customer needs and regulatory expectations\n- Ensuring colleague wellbeing strategies and support are in place to meet colleague needs, and that the skills and capability growth required to build a workforce for the Bank of the Future are achieved\n- Ensuring compliance with legal and regulatory requirements related to SM&CR, embedding compliant and appropriate colleague behaviours in line with Group policies, values and its people risk priorities\n- Ongoing consultation with the Group's recognised unions on changes which impact their members\n- Reviewing and enhancing people processes to ensure they are fit for purpose and operationally resilient\n\n## Monitoring\n\nMonitoring and reporting is undertaken at Board, Group, entity and divisional committees. Key people risk metrics are reported and discussed monthly at the Group People Risk Committee with escalation to Group Risk and Executive Committees and the Board where required.\n\nAll material people risk events are escalated in accordance with the Group Operational Risk Policy.\n\n## Operational resilience risk\n\n## Definition\n\nOperational resilience risk is defined as the risk that the Group fails to design resilience into business operations, underlying infrastructure and controls (people, process, technology) so that it is able to withstand external or internal events which could impact the continuation of operations, and fails to respond in a way which meets customer and stakeholder expectations and needs when the continuity of operations is compromised.\n\n## Exposures\n\nIneffective operational resilience risk management could lead to vital services not being available to customers, and in extreme circumstances, bank failure could result. The Group has in place a transparent and effective operating model to identify and monitor critical business processes from a customer, Group and financial industry perspective. The failure to adequately build resilience into a critical business process may occur in a variety of ways, including:\n\n- The Group being overly reliant on one location to deliver a critical business process\n- The Group not having an adequate succession plan in place for designated subject matter experts\n- The Group being overly reliant on a supplier which fails to provide a service\n- A weakness in the Group's cyber or security defences leaving it vulnerable to an attack\n- The Group failing to upgrade its IT systems and leaving them vulnerable to failure\n- Operational resilience and damage to physical assets including: terrorist acts, other acts of war or hostility, geopolitical, pandemic or other such events\n\nEffective operational resilience ensures the Group designs resilience into its systems, is able to withstand and/or recover from a significant unexpected event occurring and can continue to provide services to its customers. A significant outage could result in customers being unable to access accounts or conduct transactions, which as well as presenting significant reputational risk for the Group would negatively impact the Group's purpose of Helping Britain Prosper. Operational resilience is also an area of continued regulatory and industry focus, similar in importance to financial resilience.\n\nFailure to manage operational resilience effectively could impact the following other risk categories:\n\n- Regulatory compliance: non-compliance with new/existing operational resilience regulations, for example, through failure to identify emerging regulation or not embedding regulatory requirements within the Group's policies, processes and procedures\n- Operational risk: being unable to safely provide customers with business services\n- Conduct risk: an operational resilience failure may render the Group liable to fines from the FCA for poor conduct\n- Market risk: the Group being unable to provide key services could have ramifications for the wider market and could impact share price",

        "page_content": "## Measurement\n\nOperational resilience risk is managed across the Group through the Group's enterprise risk management framework and Operational risk policies. The Group's enterprise risk management framework includes a risk and control self-assessment process, risk impact likelihood matrix, key risk and control indicators, risk appetite, a robust incident management and escalation process, scenario analysis and an operational losses process. Board risk appetite metrics are in place and are well understood. These specific measures are subject to ongoing monitoring and reporting, including a mandatory review of thresholds on at least an annual basis. To strengthen the management of operational resilience risk, the Group mobilised an operational resilience enhancement programme which is designed to focus on end to end resilience and the management of key risks to critical processes.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nThe Group has increased its focus on operational resilience and has updated its operational resilience strategy to reflect changing priorities of both customers and regulators. The Group has carefully considered and provided a response to the publication of the consultation paper by the FCA, PRA and Bank of England (December 2019). Focus will be given to ensure that the Group's strategy and approach to operational resilience aligns with industry thinking, expectation and anticipated regulatory policy. At the core of its approach to operational resilience are the Group's critical business processes which drive all activity, including further mapping of the processes to identify any additional resilience requirements such as impact tolerances in the event of a service outage. The Group continues to maintain and develop playbooks that guide its response to a range of interruptions from internal and external threats and tests these through scenario-based testing and exercising.\n\nStrategic Review 2021 considers the changing risk management requirements, adapting the change delivery model to be more agile and develop the people skills and capabilities needed to be a Bank of the Future. The Group continues to review and invest in its control environment to ensure it addresses the risks it faces. Risks are reported and discussed at local governance forums and escalated to executive management and Board as appropriate. The Group employs a range of risk management strategies, including: avoidance, mitigation, transfer (including insurance) and acceptance. Where there is a reliance on third-party suppliers to provide services, the Group's sourcing policy ensures that outsourcing initiatives follow a defined process including due diligence, risk evaluation and ongoing assurance.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, business continuity plans have proved resilient, with particular attention applied to heightened risks in the supply chain./uni00A0\n\nMitigating actions to the principal operational resilience risk are:\n\nCyber: the threat landscape associated with cyber risk continues to evolve and there is significant regulatory attention on this subject. The Board continues to invest heavily to protect the Group from cyber-attacks. Investment continues to focus on improving the Group's approach to identity and access management, improving capability to detect and respond to cyber-attacks and improved ability to manage vulnerabilities across the estate. With effect from 1 January 2021, the Group has entered in to a cyber insurance policy, which provides cover for specified information security risks.\n\nIT resilience: the Group continues to optimise its approach to IT and operational resilience by investing in technology improvements and enhancing the resilience of systems that support the Group's critical business processes, primarily through the technology resilience programme, with independent verification of progress on an annual basis. The Board recognises the role that resilient technology plays in building the UK's preferred financial partner and in maintaining banking services across the wider industry. As such, the Board dedicates considerable time and focus to this subject at both the Board and the Board Risk Committee, and continues to sponsor key investment programmes that enhance resilience.\n\nPeople: the Group acknowledges the risks associated to the failure to maintain appropriately skilled and available colleagues. The Group continues to optimise its approach to ensure that where applicable, colleagues are capable of supporting a critical business process. Key controls and processes are regularly reported to committee(s) and alignment to the Strategic Review 2021 is closely monitored.\n\nProperty: the Group's property portfolio remains a key focus in ensuring resilience requirements are appropriately maintained. Processes are in place\n\nto identify key buildings where a critical business process is performed. Depending on criticality, a number of mitigating controls are in place to manage the risk of severe critical business process disruption. The Group remains committed to investment in the upkeep of the property portfolio, primarily through the Group Property upkeep investment programme.\n\nSourcing: the threat landscape associated with third-party suppliers and the critical services they provide continues to receive a significant amount of regulatory attention. The Group acknowledges the importance of demonstrating control and responsibility for those critical business services which could cause significant harm to the Group's customers.\n\n## Monitoring\n\nMonitoring and reporting of operational resilience risk is undertaken at Board, Group, entity and divisional committees. Each committee monitors key risks, control effectiveness, key risk and control indicators, events, operational losses, risk appetite metrics and the results of independent testing conducted by the Risk division and/or Group Internal Audit.\n\nThe Group maintains a formal approach to operational resilience risk event escalation, whereby material events are identified, captured and escalated. Root causes are determined, and action plans put in place to ensure an optimum level of control to keep customers and the business safe, reduce costs, and improve efficiency.\n\n## Operational risk\n\n## Definition\n\nOperational risk is defined as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events.\n\n## Exposures\n\nThe principal operational risks to the Group which could result in customer detriment, unfair customer outcomes, financial loss, disruption and/or reputational damage are:\n\n- A cyber-attack\n- Failure of IT systems, due to volume of change, and/or aged infrastructure\n- Internal and/or external fraud or financial crime\n- Failure to ensure compliance with increasingly complex and detailed regulation including anti-money laundering, anti-bribery, counter-terrorist financing, and financial sanctions and prohibitions laws and regulations\n\nA number of these risks could increase where there is a reliance on thirdparty suppliers to provide services to the Group or its customers.\n\n## Measurement\n\nOperational risk is managed across the Group through an operational risk framework and operational risk policies. The operational risk framework includes a risk and control self-assessment process, risk impact likelihood matrix, key risk and control indicators, risk appetite, a robust operational event management and escalation process, scenario analysis and an operational losses process.\n\nThe table below shows high level loss and event trends for the Group using Basel II categories. Based on data captured on the Group's One Risk and Control Self-Assessment, in 2020 the highest frequency of events occurred in external fraud (73.55 per cent) and execution, delivery and process management (14.14 per cent). Clients, products and business practices accounted for 58.21 per cent of losses by value, driven by legacy issues where impacts materialised in 2020 (excluding PPI).",

The Group calculates its minimum (Pillar I) operational risk capital requirements using The Standardised Approach (TSA). Pillar II is calculated using internal and external loss data and extreme but plausible scenarios that may occur in the next 12 months.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nThe Group continues to focus on changing risk management requirements, adapting the change delivery model to be more agile and developing the people skills and capabilities needed to be a Bank of the Future. Risks are reported and discussed at local governance forums and escalated to executive management and Board as appropriate to ensure the correct level of visibility and engagement. The Group employs a range of risk management strategies, including: avoidance, mitigation, transfer (including insurance) and acceptance. Where there is a reliance on third-party suppliers to provide services, the Group's sourcing policy ensures that outsourcing initiatives follow a defined process including due diligence, risk evaluation and ongoing assurance.\n\nMitigating actions to the principal operational risks are:\n\n- The threat landscape associated with cyber risk continues to evolve and there is significant regulatory attention on this subject. The Board continues to invest heavily to protect the Group from cyber-attacks.

Fraud risk appetite metrics holistically cover the impacts of fraud in terms of losses to the Group, costs of fraud systems and operations, and customer experience of actual and attempted fraud. Oversight of the appropriateness and performance of these metrics is undertaken regularly through business area and Group-level committees. This approach drives a continual programme of prioritised enhancements to the Group's technology and process and people related controls; with an emphasis on preventative controls supported by real time detective controls wherever feasible. Group-wide policies and operational control frameworks are maintained and designed to provide customer confidence, protect the Group's commercial interests and reputation, comply with legal requirements and meet regulatory requirements. The Group's fraud awareness programme remains a key component of its fraud control environment, and awareness of fraud risk is supported by mandatory training for all colleagues. This is further strengthened by material annual investment into both technology and the personal development needs of colleagues. The Group also plays an active role with other financial institutions, industry bodies, and enforcement agencies in identifying and combatting fraud\n- The Group has adopted policies and procedures designed to detect and prevent the use of its banking network for money laundering, terrorist financing, bribery, tax evasion, human trafficking, modern-day slavery and wildlife trafficking, and activities prohibited by legal and regulatory sanctions. Against a background of complex and detailed laws and regulations, and of continued criminal and terrorist activity, the Group regularly reviews and assesses its policies, procedures and organisational arrangements to keep them current, effective and consistent across markets and jurisdictions. The Group requires mandatory training on these topics for all employees. Specifically, the anti-money laundering procedures include 'know-your-customer' requirements, transaction monitoring technologies, reporting of suspicions of money laundering or terrorist financing to the applicable regulatory authorities, and interaction between the Group's Financial Intelligence Unit and external agencies and other financial institutions. The Anti-Bribery Policy prohibits the payment, offer, acceptance or request of a bribe, including 'facilitation payments' by any employee or agent and provides a confidential reporting service for anonymous reporting of suspected or actual bribery activity. The Sanctions and the Related Prohibitions Policy sets out a framework of controls for compliance with legal and regulatory sanctions\n- In addition to its efforts internally the Group also contributes to fraud and financial crime prevention by supporting and championing industry level activity, including:\n- - Being a signatory to the industry code for Authorised Push Payment (APP) fraud, which has greatly increased consumer protection and the reimbursement of funds to victims\n- - Co-sponsorship the National Economic Crime Centre (NECC) Fusion Cell, which was established in response to the changing economic crime threat related to COVID-19\n- - Maintaining partnerships with key partners such as City of London Police, Trading Standards, Global Cyber Alliance and North East Business Resilience Centre\n- - Active membership of Stop Scams UK, designed to stop scams at source by bringing together partnership from various industry sectors\n\n## Monitoring\n\nMonitoring and reporting of operational risk is undertaken at Board, Group, entity and divisional committees. Each committee monitors key risks, control effectiveness, key risk and control indicators, events, operational losses, risk appetite metrics and the results of independent testing conducted by the Risk Division and/or Group Internal Audit.\n\nThe Group maintains a formal approach to operational risk event escalation, whereby material events are identified, captured and escalated. Root causes of events are determined, and action plans put in place to ensure an optimum level of control to keep customers and the business safe, reduce costs, and improve efficiency.\n\nThe insurance programme is monitored and reviewed regularly, with recommendations being made to the Group's senior management annually prior to each renewal. Insurers are monitored on an ongoing basis, to ensure counterparty risk is minimised. A process is in place to manage any insurer rating changes or insolvencies.",

        "page_content": "## Model risk\n\n## Definition\n\nModel risk is defined as the risk of financial loss, regulatory censure, reputational damage or customer detriment, as a result of deficiencies in the development, application or ongoing operation of models and rating systems.\n\nModels are defined as quantitative methods that process input data into quantitative outputs, or qualitative outputs (including ordinal letter output) which have a quantitative measure associated with them. Model Governance Policy is restricted to specific categories of application of models, principally financial risk, treasury and valuation, with certain exclusions, such as prescribed calculations and project appraisal calculations.\n\n## Exposures\n\nThere are over 300 models in the Group performing a variety of functions including:\n\n- capital calculation\n- credit decisioning, including fraud\n- pricing models\n- impairment calculation\n- stress testing and forecasting\n- market risk measurement\n\nAs a result of the wide scope and breadth of coverage, there is exposure to model risk across a number of the Group's principal risk categories.\n\nModel risk has increased in 2020 due to the nature and uncertainty of the economic outlook, a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The effect of government-led customer support initiatives have weakened established relationships between model inputs and outputs, reducing the ability to forecast using models alone. While underlying model drivers are expected to remain valid in the longer term, year-end impairment reporting contains a greater element of governed judgement that reflects current conditions.\n\n## Measurement\n\nThe Group risk appetite framework is the key component for measuring the Group's model risk. Reported monthly to the Group Risk Committee and Board, focus is placed on the performance of the Group's most material models.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nThe model risk management framework, established by and with continued oversight from an independent team in the Risk division, provides the foundation for managing and mitigating model risk within the Group. Accountability is cascaded from the Board and senior management via the Group enterprise risk management framework.\n\nThis provides the basis for the Model Governance Policy, which defines the mandatory requirements for models across the Group, including:\n\n- the scope of models covered by the policy\n- model materiality\n- roles and responsibilities, including ownership, independent oversight and approval\n- key principles and controls regarding data integrity, development, validation, implementation, ongoing maintenance and revalidation, monitoring, and the process for non-compliance\n\nThe model owner takes responsibility for ensuring the fitness for purpose of the models and rating systems, supported and challenged by the independent specialist Group function.\n\nThe above ensures all models in scope of policy, including those involved in regulatory capital calculation, are developed consistently and are of sufficient quality to support business decisions and meet regulatory requirements.\n\n## Monitoring\n\nThe Group Model Governance Committee is the primary body for overseeing model risk. Policy requires that key performance indicators are monitored for every model to ensure they remain fit for purpose and all issues are escalated appropriately. Material model issues are reported to Group and Board Risk Committees monthly with more detailed papers as necessary to focus on key issues.\n\n## Regulatory and legal risk\n\n## Definition\n\nRegulatory and legal risk is defined as the risk of financial penalties, regulatory censure, criminal or civil enforcement action or customer detriment as a result of failure to identify, assess, correctly interpret, comply with, or manage regulatory and/or legal requirements.\n\n## Exposures\n\nWhilst the Group has a zero risk appetite for material regulatory breaches or material legal incidents, the Group remains exposed to them, driven by significant ongoing and new legislation, regulation and court proceedings in the UK and overseas which in each case needs to be interpreted, implemented and embedded into day-to-day operational and business practices across the Group.\n\n## Measurement\n\nRegulatory and legal risks are measured against a defined risk appetite metric, which is an assessment of material regulatory breaches and material legal incidents.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nThe Group undertakes a range of key mitigating actions to manage regulatory and legal risk. These include the following:\n\n- The Board has established a Group-wide risk appetite and metric for regulatory and legal risk\n- Group policies and procedures set out the principles and key controls that should apply across the business which are aligned to the Group risk appetite. Mandated policies and processes require appropriate control frameworks, management information, standards and colleague training to be implemented to identify and manage regulatory and legal risk\n- Business units identify, assess and implement policy and regulatory requirements and establish local controls, processes, procedures and resources to ensure appropriate governance and compliance\n- Business units regularly produce management information to assist in the identification of issues and test management controls are working effectively\n- Risk and Legal departments provide oversight, proactive support and constructive challenge to the business in identifying and managing regulatory and legal issues\n- Risk department conducts thematic reviews of regulatory compliance and provides oversight of regulatory compliance assessments across businesses and divisions where appropriate\n- Business units, with the support of divisional and Group-level teams, conduct ongoing horizon scanning to identify and address changes in regulatory and legal requirements\n- The Group engages with regulatory authorities and industry bodies on forthcoming regulatory changes, market reviews and investigations, ensuring programmes are established to deliver new regulation and legislation\n- The Group has adapted quickly to evolving regulatory expectations during the COVID-19 pandemic and has engaged with regulatory authorities throughout\n\n## Monitoring\n\nMaterial risks are managed through the relevant divisional-level committees, with review and escalation through Group level committees where appropriate, including the escalation of any material regulatory breaches or material legal incidents.",

Customers, shareholders and employees expectations continue to evolve and current societal trends are likely to be accelerated by the pandemic.\n\nStrategic risks can manifest themselves in existing principal risks or as new exposures which could adversely impact the Group and its businesses.\n\nIn considering strategic risks, a key focus is the interconnectivity of individual risks and the cumulative effect of different risks on the Group's overall risk profile.\n\nThe Group is working actively to implement a robust framework for the identification, assessment and quantification of strategic risks. This framework has been deployed as part of the recent strategic review and is being embedded into the Group's day to day business operations.\n\nFurther information on strategic risk drivers and their potential risk implications is outlined in the risk overview on pages/uni00A058/uni00A0and 59.\n\n## Measurement\n\nThe Group assesses and monitors strategic risk implications as part of business planning and in its day to day activities, ensuring they respond appropriately to internal and external factors including changes to regulatory, macroeconomic and competitive environments. An assessment is made of the key strategic risks that are considered to impact the Group, leveraging internal and external information and the key mitigants or actions that could be taken in response.\n\nThrough 2021, a clear set of strategic risks, mitigants and controls will be embedded to meet divisional, legal entity and Group-wide objectives. The assessment and measurement will be supported by a quantitative risk assessment approach and underpinned by the Group's One Risk and Control Self-Assessment (One RCSA) framework. The Group's quantitative risk assessment will focus specifically on assessing the connectivity of inherent risks, which can magnify their impact and severity.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nThe range of mitigating actions includes:\n\n- Horizon scanning is conducted across the Group to identify potential threats, risks, emerging issues, opportunities and explore future trends\n- The Group's business planning processes includes formal assessment of the strategic risk implications of new business, product entries and other strategic initiatives\n- The Group's governance framework mandates individual's and committee's responsibilities and decision making rights, to ensure that strategic risks are appropriately reported and escalated\n\n## Monitoring\n\nA review of the Group's strategic risks, which includes the risks to the current strategic review and the mitigating actions, is undertaken on an annual basis and the findings are reported to the Group and Board Risk Committees.\n\nRisks, alongside their control effectiveness, are articulated and reported regularly to Group and Board Risk Committees.",

These are crossreferenced from the financial statements and are identified as audited.\n\nOur opinion is consistent with our reporting to the Audit Committee.\n\n## Separate opinion in relation to international financial reporting standards adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union\n\nAs explained in note 1 to the financial statements, the Group, in addition to applying international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006, has also applied international financial reporting standards adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union.\n\nIn our opinion, the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union.\n\n## Separate opinion in relation to IFRSs as issued by the IASB\n\nAs explained in note 1 to the financial statements, the Group, in addition to applying international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of Companies Act 2006, has also applied international financial reporting standards (IFRSs) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).\n\nIn our opinion, the financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as issued by the IASB.\n\n## Basis for opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) ('ISAs (UK)') and applicable law. Our responsibilities under ISAs (UK) are further described in the Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe remained independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, which includes the FRC's Ethical Standard, as applicable to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge and belief, we declare that non-audit services prohibited by the FRC's Ethical Standard were not provided to the Group.\n\nOther than those disclosed in note 12 to the financial statements, we have provided no non-audit services to the Group in the period under audit.\n\n## Our audit approach\n\n## Overview\n\n## Audit scope\n\n- - The scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of audit procedures performed were determined by our risk assessment, the financial significance of components and other qualitative factors (including history of misstatement through fraud or error).\n- - We performed audit procedures over components considered financially significant in the context of the Group (full scope audit) or in the context of individual primary statement account balances (audit of specific account balances). We performed other procedures including testing entity level controls, information technology general controls and analytical review procedures to address the risk of material misstatement in the residual components above performance materiality.\n\n## Key audit matters\n\n- - Allowance for Expected Credit Losses (ECL) (Group)\n- - Insurance actuarial assumptions (Group)\n- - Defined benefit obligation (Group)\n- - Valuation of certain level 3 financial instruments (Group)\n- - Hedge accounting (Group)\n- - Privileged access to IT systems (Group and parent)\n- - Impact of COVID-19 (Group and parent)",

        "page_content": "## Materiality\n\n- - Overall Group materiality: \u00a3300m (2019: \u00a3360m) based on 5 per cent of the four-year average adjusted profit before tax for the financial years ended 31 December 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020, adjusted to remove the effects of certain items which were considered to have a disproportionate impact.\n- - Overall parent company materiality: \u00a3300m (2019: \u00a3360m) based on 1 per cent of total assets, but limited to the overall Group materiality.\n- - Performance materiality: \u00a3220m (Group and parent company).\n\n## The scope of our audit\n\nAs part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements.\n\n## Capability of the audit in detecting irregularities, including fraud\n\nIrregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined in the Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud, is detailed below.\n\nBased on our understanding of the Group and industry, we identified that the principal risks of non-compliance with laws and regulations related to breaches of banking laws and regulations such as, but not limited to, regulations relating to consumer credit and unethical and prohibited business practices, and we considered the extent to which non-compliance might have a material effect on the financial statements. We also considered those laws and regulations that have a direct impact on the preparation of the financial statements such as the Companies Act 2006. We evaluated management's incentives and opportunities for fraudulent manipulation of the financial statements (including the risk of override of controls), and determined that the principal risks were related to posting manual journal entries to manipulate financial performance, management bias through judgements and assumptions in significant accounting estimates and significant one-off or unusual transactions. The Group engagement team shared this risk assessment with the component auditors so that they could include appropriate audit procedures in response to such risks in their work. Audit procedures performed by the Group engagement team and/or component auditors included:\n\n- - Discussions with management and those charged with governance including consideration of known or suspected instances of non-compliance with laws and regulation and fraud.\n- - Evaluation and testing of the operating effectiveness of management's entity level controls designed to prevent and detect irregularities, in particular their code of conduct and whistleblowing helpline.\n- - Assessment of matters reported on the Group's whistleblowing helpline and the results of management's investigation of such matters.\n- - Performing testing over period end adjustments.\n- - Incorporating unpredictability into the nature, timing and/or extent of our testing.\n- - Reviewing key correspondence with the FCA and PRA.\n- - Challenging assumptions and judgements made by management in their significant accounting estimates, in particular in relation to the allowance for ECL; insurance actuarial assumptions; the defined benefit obligation; and the valuation of certain level 3 financial instruments (see related key audit matters below).\n- - Identifying and testing journal entries, in particular any manual journal entries posted by unexpected or unusual users, posted with descriptions indicating a higher level of risk, and posted late with a favourable impact on financial performance.\n\nThere are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above. We are less likely to become aware of instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations that are not closely related to events and transactions reflected in the financial statements. Also, the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion.\n\n## Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors' professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by the auditors, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures thereon, were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\nThis is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.\n\nThe Impact of COVID-19 on the audit is a new key audit matter this year. Payment Protection Insurance (PPI), which was a key audit matter last year, is no longer included because of the significant reduction in the amount and the level of estimation uncertainty of the PPI provision by 31 December 2020. This was a result of the Group processing almost all PPI information requests and complaints. The key audit matter in respect of defined benefit obligations has been extended to include harder to value assets within the pensions asset portfolio. Otherwise, the key audit matters below are consistent with last year.",

These models use a number of key assumptions including probability of default, loss given default and valuation of recoveries. Management also apply judgemental adjustments where they believe the model calculated assumptions and allowances are not appropriate, either due to emerging trends or model limitations. An example of this is adjustments to the impairment model for anticipated increases to account deterioration across the portfolio that have been deferred through the impact of government support schemes. There has been an increase in the use of judgemental adjustments to modelled ECLs in the current year which reflects the fact that the historical data used in the development of the models does not capture all the conditions of the COVID-19  pandemic experienced during 2020.\n\nOur work therefore focused on the appropriateness of modelling methodologies adopted and significant judgements made in determining adjustments as well as the measurement of those adjustments.\n\nThe allowance for ECL relating to credit impaired loans and advances (referred to herein also as being in Stage 3) in the Commercial Banking division is primarily estimated on an individual basis. Judgement is required to determine when a loan is considered to be credit impaired, and then to estimate the expected future cash flows related to that loan under multiple weighted scenario outcomes.\n\n## Commercial Banking\n\nWe understood management's process and evaluated and tested key controls around the determination of the allowance for ECL. For the Stage 1 and 2 allowance, we focused on:\n\n- - The identification and assessment of the completeness and accuracy of critical data applied in the ECL calculation;\n- - The accuracy and timeliness of updates to credit risk ratings, which are applied in assessing whether loans have suffered a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition;\n- - The governance over the ECL determination, including the validation of the ECL methodology, assumptions and inputs, and the annual model performance validation, and;\n- - The review, challenge and approval processes in place to assess the overall reasonableness of the allowance for ECL, alongside other available credit risk related information within the Group.\n\nFor the Stage 3 allowance, we focused on:\n\n- - The controls in place for the identification of credit impaired loans and subsequent transfer of these cases to the credit loss assessment team; and\n- - The review, challenge and approval processes that are in place to assess the overall reasonableness of the allowance for ECL.\n\nWe found these key controls were designed, implemented and operated effectively, and therefore determined that we could place reliance on these key controls for the purposes of our audit. Where control deficiencies were identified, management identified compensating controls which we tested and were able to place reliance on.\n\nWe performed the following procedures over the Stage 1 and 2 allowance for ECL:\n\n- - We critically assessed whether the methodology applied in the calculation is compliant with IFRS 9;\n- - We tested the formulae applied within the calculation, including the appropriateness, and application of, the quantitative and qualitative criteria used to assess significant increases in credit risk;\n- - We evaluated the accuracy and timing of the information being used to calculate a borrower's internal credit risk rating;\n- -  We assessed whether the most recent internal credit risk rating assessment was performed sufficiently timely to incorporate the recent economic environment;\n- -  We critically assessed the impact of identified model limitations and the justification for judgemental adjustments applied by management.\n\nWe performed the following procedures to test the completeness of credit impaired assets requiring a Stage 3 allowance for ECL:\n\n- - We critically assessed the criteria for determining whether a credit impairment event had occurred; and\n- - We tested a risk based sample of Stage 1 and 2 loans, utilising industry specialists to support the audit team in identifying sectors or types of borrowers with a heightened risk of weaker financial performance or distress.\n\nFor each risk based sample, as well as an additional haphazardly selected sample of Stage 1 and 2 loans, we independently assessed whether there was evidence indicating a credit impairment event (e.g. a customer experiencing significant financial difficulty or in breach of covenant) and therefore whether they were appropriately categorised. Our testing included consideration of events subsequent to the balance sheet date.\n\nAdditionally, we selected a sample of borrowers from management's 'watchlist', identified as requiring close credit risk monitoring, but not assessed as credit impaired. We critically assessed the latest information against criteria, as defined by management, for considering whether the borrower is credit impaired, or not.\n\nFor a sample of Stage 3 credit impaired loans, we:\n\n- - Evaluated the basis on which the allowance was determined, and the evidence supporting the analysis performed by management;\n- - We independently challenged whether the key assumptions used, such as the recovery strategies, collateral rights and ranges of potential outcomes, were appropriate, given the borrower's circumstances;\n- - Re-performed management's allowance calculation, assessing supporting evidence in relation to key inputs on a case by case basis, that included expected future cash flows, discount rates, valuations of collateral held, and the weightings applied to scenario outcomes; and\n- - Where relevant, we specifically considered whether valuations were up to date, and consistent with the strategy being followed in respect of the particular borrower and assessed the sensitivity to key assumptions used.\n\nBased on the evidence assessed, we found the methodologies, modelled assumptions and data used within the allowance for ECL assessment to be materially appropriate and in line with the requirements of IFRS 9.",

Each of the segments comprises a number of components. The consolidated financial statements are a consolidation of the components. In establishing the overall approach to the Group audit, we determined the type of work that is required to be performed over the components by us, as the Group engagement team, or auditors within PwC UK and from other PwC network firms operating under our instruction ('component auditors'). Almost all of our audit work is undertaken by PwC UK component auditors.\n\nWhere the work was performed by component auditors, we determined the level of involvement we needed to have in their audit work to be able to conclude whether sufficient appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the consolidated financial statements as a whole. This included regular communication with the component auditors throughout the audit, the issuance of instructions, a review of the results of their work on significant and elevated risk areas and formal clearance meetings.\n\nAny components which were considered individually financially significant in the context of the Group's consolidated financial statements were considered full scope components. An individually financially significant component was deemed to be one which either represented more than or equal to 10% of the total assets of the consolidated Group, or represented more than or equal to 10% of the total liabilities of the consolidated Group, or whereby a component had a significant number of balances exceeding performance materiality. We have used appropriate judgement in determining what constitutes a 'significant' number. We have also performed risk assessments over the significant and elevated risks identified in our audit plan to identify any additional individually financially significant components.\n\nWe considered the individual financial significance of other components in relation to primary statement account balances. We considered the presence of any significant audit risks and other qualitative factors (including history of misstatements through fraud or error). Any component which was not already included as a full scope component but was identified as being individually financially significant in respect of one or more account balances was subject to specific audit procedures over those specific account balances. Inconsequential components (defined as components which, in our judgement, did not present a reasonable possibility of a risk of material misstatement either individually or in aggregate) were eliminated from further consideration for specific audit procedures, although they were subject to Group level analytical review procedures.\n\nAll remaining components which were neither inconsequential nor individually financially significant were subject to procedures which addressed the risk of material misstatement including testing of entity level controls, information technology general controls and Group and component level analytical review procedures.\n\nCertain account balances were audited centrally by the Group engagement team.\n\nComponents within the scope of our audit contributed 98 per cent of Group total assets and 81 per cent of Group total income.\n\n## Materiality\n\nThe scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole.\n\nBased on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:\n\n|                                  | Group financial statements                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Parent company financial statements                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Overall materiality              | \u00a3300m (2019: \u00a3360m).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | \u00a3300m (2019: \u00a3360m).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| How we determined it             | 5 per cent of the four-year average adjusted profit before  tax for the financial years ended 31 December 2017,  2018, 2019 and 2020, adjusted to remove the effects of  certain items which were considered to have a  disproportionate impact.                                                                                                 | 1 per cent of total assets, but limited to the overall Group materiality.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| Rationale for benchmark  applied | Due to the impact of COVID-19 on profit for 2020, our  starting point was 5 per cent of the average adjusted  profit before tax across 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020.

Profit based  benchmarks are not considered the most appropriate for  parent company materiality as the parent company is not  a trading entity. Where the calculated parent company  materiality from total assets exceeds the Group overall  materiality level, the parent company overall materiality  has been restricted to equal the Group overall materiality |\n\nFor each component in the scope of our Group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall Group materiality. The range of materiality allocated across components was between \u00a350m and \u00a3100m. Certain components were audited to a local statutory audit materiality that was also less than our overall Group materiality.\n\nWe use performance materiality to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds overall materiality. Specifically, we use performance materiality in determining the scope of our audit and the nature and extent of our testing of account balances, classes of transactions and disclosures, for example in determining sample sizes. Our performance materiality was \u00a3220m for the Group and parent company financial statements.\n\nIn determining the performance materiality, we considered a number of factors - the history of misstatements, risk assessment and aggregation risk and the effectiveness of controls - and concluded that an amount at the upper end of our normal range was appropriate.\n\nWe agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above \u00a315m (Group and parent company audit) (2019: \u00a318m) as well as misstatements below those amounts that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.\n\n## Conclusions relating to going concern\n\nOur evaluation of the directors' assessment of the Group's and the parent company's ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included:\n\n- - Evaluation of management's going concern assessment;\n- - Evaluation and testing of the control environment in place over liquidity and capital forecasting to the extent these are relevant to the going concern assessments performed by the Group;",

        "page_content": "- - Evaluation of stress testing performed by management and consideration of whether the stresses applied are appropriate for assessing going concern;\n- - Evaluation of the Groups forecast financial performance, liquidity and capital positions over the going concern period including an evaluation of the impact of COVID-19 on the financial outlook of the Group;\n- - Review of credit rating agency ratings and actions; and\n- - Substantiation of certain financial resources available to the Group, for example at the Bank of England.\n\nBased on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group's and the parent company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.\n\nIn auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.\n\nHowever, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this conclusion is not a guarantee as to the Group's and the parent company's ability to continue as a going concern.\n\nIn relation to the Group's and the parent company's reporting on how they have applied the UK Corporate Governance Code, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to the directors' statement in the financial statements about whether the directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nOur responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report.\n\n## Reporting on other information\n\nThe other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and our auditors' report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, any form of assurance thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, we are required to perform procedures to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report based on these responsibilities.\n\nWith respect to the Strategic report and Directors' report, we also considered whether the disclosures required by the UK Companies Act 2006 have been included.\n\nBased on our work undertaken in the course of the audit, the Companies Act 2006 requires us also to report certain opinions and matters as described below.\n\n## Strategic report and Directors' report\n\nIn our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Strategic report and Directors' report for the year ended 31 December 2020 is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.\n\nIn light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and parent company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit, we did not identify any material misstatements in the Strategic report and Directors' report.\n\n## Directors' remuneration\n\nIn our opinion, the part of the Directors' remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.\n\n## Corporate governance statement\n\nThe Listing Rules require us to review the directors' statements in relation to going concern, longer-term viability and that part of the corporate governance statement relating to the parent company's compliance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review. Our additional responsibilities with respect to the corporate governance statement as other information are described in the Reporting on other information section of this report.\n\nBased on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded that each of the following elements of the corporate governance statement, included within the Annual Report is materially consistent with the financial statements and our knowledge obtained during the audit, and we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to:\n\n- - The directors' confirmation that they have carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks;\n- - The disclosures in the Annual Report and Accounts that describe those principal risks, what procedures are in place to identify emerging risks and an explanation of how these are being managed or mitigated;\n- - The directors' statement in the financial statements about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing them, and their identification of any material uncertainties to the Group's and parent company's ability to continue to do so over a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements;\n- - The directors' explanation as to their assessment of the Group's and parent company's prospects, the period this assessment covers and why the period is appropriate; and\n- - The directors' statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the Group and parent company will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of its assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.\n\nOur review of the directors' statement regarding the longer-term viability of the Group was substantially less in scope than an audit and only consisted of making inquiries and considering the directors' process supporting their statement; checking that the statement is in alignment with the relevant provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code; and considering whether the statement is consistent with the financial statements and our knowledge and understanding of the Group and parent company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit.\n\nIn addition, based on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded that each of the following elements of the corporate governance statement is materially consistent with the financial statements and our knowledge obtained during the audit:\n\n- - The directors' statement that they consider the Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable, and provides the information necessary for the members to assess the Group's and parent company's position, performance, business model and strategy;\n- - The section of the Annual Report that describes the review of effectiveness of risk management and internal control systems; and\n- - The section of the Annual Report describing the work of the Audit Committee.",

The directors are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group's and the parent company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors' report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nOur audit testing might include testing complete populations of certain transactions and balances, possibly using data auditing techniques. However, it typically involves selecting a limited number of items for testing, rather than testing complete populations. We will often seek to target particular items for testing based on their size or risk characteristics. In other cases, we will use audit sampling to enable us to draw a conclusion about the population from which the sample is selected.\n\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC's website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditors' report.\n\n## Use of this report\n\nThis report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the parent company's members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.\n\n## Other required reporting\n\n## Companies Act 2006 exception reporting\n\nUnder the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:\n\n- - we have not obtained all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or\n- - adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or\n- - certain disclosures of directors' remuneration specified by law are not made; or\n- - the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors' remuneration report to be audited are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.\n\nWe have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.\n\n## Appointment\n\nFollowing the recommendation of the Audit Committee, we were appointed by the members on 21 December 1995 to audit the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 1995 and subsequent financial periods. The period of total uninterrupted engagement is 26 years, covering the years ended 31/uni00A0December 1995 to 31 December 2020. The audit was tendered in 2014 and we were re-appointed with effect from 1 January 2016. There will be a mandatory rotation for the 2021 audit and we will cease to be auditor of the Group.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Mark Hannam (Senior Statutory Auditor)\n\nfor and on behalf of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Chartered Accountants and Statutory Auditors London 23 February 2021",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements\n\nfor the year ended 31 December\n\n## Note 1: Basis of preparation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of Lloyds Banking Group plc and its subsidiary undertakings (the Group) comply with international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). IFRS comprises accounting standards prefixed IFRS issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and those prefixed IAS issued by the IASB's predecessor body as well as interpretations issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee and its predecessor body. On adoption of IFRS 9 in 2018, the Group elected to continue applying hedge accounting under IAS 39. The financial statements are also compliant with IFRS adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union. The EU endorsed version of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement /uni00A0relaxes some of the hedge accounting requirements; the Group has not taken advantage of this relaxation, and therefore there is no difference in application to the Group between IFRS as adopted by the EU and IFRS as issued by the IASB.\n\nThe financial information has been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of investment properties, financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, trading securities and certain other financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss and all derivative contracts. As stated on page 113, the directors consider that it is appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements. In reaching this assessment, the directors have considered the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic upon the Group's performance and projected funding and capital position and have also taken into account the impact of further stress scenarios. On this basis, the directors are satisfied that the Group will maintain adequate levels of funding and capital for the foreseeable future. Further details of the Group's funding and capital position are set out on pages 183 to 196.\n\nDetails of those IFRS pronouncements which will be relevant to the Group but which were not effective at 31 December 2020 and which have not been applied in preparing these financial statements are given in note 53.\n\nIn 2019 the Group adopted IFRS 16 and amendments to IAS 12 and early-adopted the hedge accounting amendments Interest Rate Benchmark Reform issued by the IASB.\n\n## Note 2: Accounting policies\n\nThe Group's accounting policies are set out below. These accounting policies have been applied consistently.\n\n## (A) Consolidation\n\nThe assets, liabilities and results of Group undertakings (including structured entities) are included in the financial statements on the basis of accounts made up to the reporting date. Group undertakings include subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures. Details of the Group's subsidiaries and related undertakings are given on pages 349 to 354./uni00A0\n\n## (1) Subsidiaries\n\nSubsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it has power over the entity, is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity, and has the ability to affect those returns through the exercise of its power. This generally accompanies a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights although in certain circumstances a holding of less than one half of the voting rights may still result in the ability of the Group to exercise control. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity. The Group reassesses whether or not it controls an entity if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to any of the above elements. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group; they are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.\n\nThe Group consolidates collective investment vehicles if its beneficial ownership interests give it substantive rights to remove the external fund manager over the investment activities of the fund. Where a subsidiary of the Group is the fund manager of a collective investment vehicle, the Group considers a number of factors in determining whether it acts as principal, and therefore controls the collective investment vehicle, including: an assessment of the scope of the Group's decision making authority over the investment vehicle; the rights held by other parties including substantive removal rights without cause over the Group acting as fund manager; the remuneration to which the Group is entitled in its capacity as decision maker; and the Group's exposure to variable returns from the beneficial interest it holds in the investment vehicle. Consolidation may be appropriate in circumstances where the Group has less than a majority beneficial interest. Where a collective investment vehicle is consolidated the interests of parties other than the Group are reported in other liabilities and the movement in these interests in interest expense.\n\nStructured entities are entities that are designed so that their activities are not governed by way of voting rights. In assessing whether the Group has power over such entities in which it has an interest, the Group considers factors such as the purpose and design of the entity; its practical ability to direct the relevant activities of the entity; the nature of the relationship with the entity; and the size of its exposure to the variability of returns of the entity.\n\nThe treatment of transactions with non-controlling interests depends on whether, as a result of the transaction, the Group loses control of the subsidiary. Changes in the parent's ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions; any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to the owners of the parent entity. Where the Group loses control of the subsidiary, at the date when control is lost the amount of any noncontrolling interest in that former subsidiary is derecognised and any investment retained in the former subsidiary is remeasured to its fair value; the gain or loss that is recognised in profit or loss on the partial disposal of the subsidiary includes the gain or loss on the remeasurement of the retained interest.\n\nIntercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains and losses on transactions between Group companies are eliminated.\n\nThe acquisition method of accounting is used to account for business combinations by the Group. The consideration for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Group. The consideration includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Acquisition related costs are expensed as incurred except those relating to the issuance of debt instruments (see (E)(4) below) or share capital (see (P) below). Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair value at the acquisition date.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financialflstatements continued\n\n## Note 2: Accounting policies continued\n\n## (2) Joint ventures and associates\n\nJoint ventures are joint arrangements over which the Group has joint control with other parties and has rights to the net assets of the arrangements. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement and only exists when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the entity, but is not control or joint control of those policies, and is generally achieved through holding between 20 per cent and 50 per cent of the voting share capital of the entity.\n\nThe Group utilises the venture capital exemption for investments where significant influence or joint control is present and the business unit operates as a venture capital business. These investments are designated at initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss. Otherwise, the Group's investments in joint ventures and associates are accounted for by the equity method of accounting.\n\n## (B) Goodwill\n\nGoodwill arises on business combinations and represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group's share of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired. Where the fair value of the Group's share of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired entity is greater than the cost of acquisition, the excess is recognised immediately in the income statement.\n\nGoodwill is recognised as an asset at cost and is tested at least annually for impairment. If an impairment is identified the carrying value of the goodwill is written down immediately through the income statement and is not subsequently reversed. At the date of disposal of a subsidiary, the carrying value of attributable goodwill is included in the calculation of the profit or loss on disposal.\n\n## (C) Other intangible assets\n\nIntangible assets which have been determined to have a finite useful life are amortised on a straight line basis over their estimated useful life as follows: up to 7 years for capitalised software; 10 to 15 years for brands and other intangible assets.\n\nIntangible assets with finite useful lives are reviewed at each reporting date to assess whether there is any indication that they are impaired. If any such indication exists the recoverable amount of the asset is determined and in the event that the asset's carrying amount is greater than its recoverable amount, it is written down immediately. Certain brands have been determined to have an indefinite useful life and are not amortised. Such intangible assets are reassessed annually to reconfirm that an indefinite useful life remains appropriate. In the event that an indefinite life is inappropriate a finite life is determined and an impairment review is performed on the asset.\n\n## (D) Revenue recognition\n\n## (1) Net interest income\n\nInterest income and expense are recognised in the income statement using the effective interest method for all interest-bearing financial instruments, except for those classified at fair value through profit or loss. The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset or liability and of allocating the interest income or interest expense over the expected life of the financial instrument. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash payments or receipts over the expected life of the financial instrument to the gross carrying amount of the financial asset (before adjusting for expected credit losses) or to the amortised cost of the financial liability, including early redemption fees, and related penalties, and premiums and discounts that are an integral part of the overall return. In the case of financial assets that are purchased or originated credit-impaired, the effective interest rate is the rate that discounts the estimated future cash flows to the amortised cost of the instrument. Direct incremental transaction costs related to the acquisition, issue or disposal of a financial instrument are also taken into account. Interest income from non-credit impaired financial assets is recognised by applying the effective interest rate to the gross carrying amount of the asset; for credit impaired financial assets, the effective interest rate is applied to the net carrying amount after deducting the allowance for expected credit losses. Impairment policies are set out in (H) below.\n\n## (2) Fee and commission income and expense\n\nFees and commissions receivable which are not an integral part of the effective interest rate are recognised as income as the Group fulfils its performance obligations. The Group's principal performance obligations arising from contracts with customers are in respect of value added current accounts, credit cards and debit cards. These fees are received, and the Group's provides the service, monthly; the fees are recognised in income on this basis. The Group also receives certain fees in respect of its asset finance business where the performance obligations are typically fulfilled towards the end of the customer contract; these fees are recognised in income on this basis. Where it is unlikely that the loan commitments will be drawn, loan commitment fees are recognised in fee and commission income over the life of the facility, rather than as an adjustment to the effective interest rate for loans expected to be drawn. Incremental costs incurred to generate fee and commission income are charged to fees and commissions expense as they are incurred.\n\n## (3) Other\n\nDividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.\n\nRevenue recognition policies specific to trading income are set out in (E)(3) below, life insurance and general insurance business are detailed below (see (M) below); those relating to leases are set out in (J)(1) below.\n\n## (E) Financial assets and liabilities\n\nOn initial recognition, financial assets are classified as measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income or fair value through profit or loss, depending on the Group's business model for managing the financial assets and whether the cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest. The Group assesses its business models at a portfolio level based on its objectives for the relevant portfolio, how the performance of the portfolio is managed and reported, and the frequency of asset sales. Financial assets with embedded derivatives are considered in their entirety when considering their cash flow characteristics. The Group reclassifies financial assets when and only when its business model for managing those assets changes. A reclassification will only take place when the change is significant to the Group's operations and will occur at a portfolio level and not for individual instruments; reclassifications are expected to be rare. Equity investments are measured at fair value through profit or loss unless the Group elects at initial recognition to account for the instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income. For these instruments, principally strategic investments, dividends are recognised in profit or loss but fair value gains and losses are not subsequently reclassified to profit or loss following derecognition of the investment.\n\nThe Group initially recognises loans and advances, deposits, debt securities in issue and subordinated liabilities when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Regular way purchases and sales of securities and other financial assets and trading liabilities are recognised on trade date, being the date that the Group is committed to purchase or sell an asset.\n\nFinancial assets are derecognised when the contractual right to receive cash flows from those assets has expired or when the Group has transferred its contractual right to receive the cash flows from the assets and either: substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred; or the Group has neither retained nor transferred substantially all of the risks and rewards, but has transferred control.\n\nFinancial liabilities are derecognised when the obligation is discharged, cancelled or expires.",

        "page_content": "## Note 2: Accounting policies continued\n\n## (1) Financial instruments measured at amortised cost\n\nFinancial assets that are held to collect contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest are measured at amortised cost. A basic lending arrangement results in contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. Where the contractual cash flows introduce exposure to risks or volatility unrelated to a basic lending arrangement such as changes in equity prices or commodity prices, the payments do not comprise solely principal and interest. Financial assets measured at amortised cost are predominantly loans and advances to customers and banks together with certain debt securities used by the Group to manage its liquidity. Loans and advances are initially recognised when cash is advanced to the borrower at fair value inclusive of transaction costs. Interest income is accounted for using the effective interest method (see (D) above).\n\nFinancial liabilities are measured at amortised cost, except for trading liabilities and other financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss on initial recognition which are held at fair value.\n\n## (2) Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income\n\nFinancial assets that are held to collect contractual cash flows and for subsequent sale, where the assets' cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest, are recognised in the balance sheet at their fair value, inclusive of transaction costs. Interest calculated using the effective interest method and foreign exchange gains and losses on assets denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement. All other gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised directly in other comprehensive income, until the financial asset is either sold or matures, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is recognised in the income statement other than in respect of equity shares, for which the cumulative revaluation amount is transferred directly to retained profits. The Group recognises a charge for expected credit losses in the income statement (see (H) below). As the asset is measured at fair value, the charge does not adjust the carrying value of the asset, it is reflected in other comprehensive income.\n\n## (3) Financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss\n\nFinancial assets are classified at fair value through profit or loss where they do not meet the criteria to be measured at amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income or where they are designated at fair value through profit or loss to reduce an accounting mismatch. All derivatives are carried at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nThe assets backing the insurance and investment contracts issued by the Group do not meet the criteria to be measured at amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income as they are managed on a fair value basis and accordingly are measured at fair value through profit or loss. Similarly, trading securities, which are debt securities and equity shares acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short-term or which are part of a portfolio which is managed for short-term gains, do not meet these criteria and are also measured at fair value through profit or loss. Financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss are recognised in the balance sheet at their fair value. Fair value gains and losses together with interest coupons and dividend income are recognised in the income statement within net trading income.\n\nFinancial liabilities are measured at fair value through profit or loss where they are trading liabilities or where they are designated at fair value through profit or loss in order to reduce an accounting mismatch; where the liabilities are part of a group of liabilities (or assets and liabilities) which is managed, and its performance evaluated, on a fair value basis; or where the liabilities contain one or more embedded derivatives that significantly modify the cash flows arising under the contract and would otherwise need to be separately accounted for. Financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss are recognised in the balance sheet at their fair value. Fair value gains and losses are recognised in the income statement within net trading income in the period in which they occur, except that gains and losses attributable to changes in own credit risk are recognised in other comprehensive income.\n\nThe fair values of assets and liabilities traded in active markets are based on current bid and offer prices respectively. If the market is not active the Group establishes a fair value by using valuation techniques. The fair values of derivative financial instruments are adjusted where appropriate to reflect credit risk (via credit valuation adjustments (CVAs), debit valuation adjustments (DVAs) and funding valuation adjustments (FVAs)), market liquidity and other risks.\n\n## (4) Borrowings\n\nBorrowings (which include deposits from banks, customer deposits, debt securities in issue and subordinated liabilities) are recognised initially at fair value, being their issue proceeds net of transaction costs incurred. These instruments are subsequently stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\n\nPreference shares and other instruments which carry a mandatory coupon or are redeemable on a specific date are classified as financial liabilities. The coupon on these instruments is recognised in the income statement as interest expense. Securities which carry a discretionary coupon and have no fixed maturity or redemption date are classified as other equity instruments. Interest payments on these securities are recognised, as distributions from equity in the period in which they are paid. An exchange of financial liabilities on substantially different terms is accounted for as an extinguishment of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new financial liability. The difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability extinguished and the new financial liability is recognised in profit or loss together with any related costs or fees incurred.\n\nWhen a financial liability is exchanged for an equity instrument, the new equity instrument is recognised at fair value and any difference between the carrying value of the liability and the fair value of the new equity is recognised in profit or loss.\n\n## (5) Sale and repurchase agreements (including securities lending and borrowing)\n\nSecurities sold subject to repurchase agreements (repos) continue to be recognised on the balance sheet where substantially all of the risks and rewards are retained. Funds received under these arrangements are included in deposits from banks, customer deposits, or trading liabilities. Conversely, securities purchased under agreements to resell (reverse repos), where the Group does not acquire substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership, are recorded as loans and advances measured at amortised cost or trading securities. The difference between sale and repurchase price is treated as interest and accrued over the life of the agreements using the effective interest method.\n\nSecurities borrowing and lending transactions are typically secured; collateral takes the form of securities or cash advanced or received. Securities lent to counterparties are retained on the balance sheet. Securities borrowed are not recognised on the balance sheet, unless these are sold to third parties, in which case the obligation to return them is recorded at fair value as a trading liability. Cash collateral given or received is treated as a loan and advance measured at amortised cost or customer deposit.\n\n## (F) Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting\n\nAs permitted by IFRS 9, the Group continues to apply the requirements of IAS 39 to its hedging relationships. All derivatives are recognised at their fair value. Derivatives are carried on the balance sheet as assets when their fair value is positive and as liabilities when their fair value is negative. Refer to note 48(3) (Financial instruments: Financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value) for details of valuation techniques and significant inputs to valuation models.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financialflstatements continued\n\n## Note 2: Accounting policies continued\n\nChanges in the fair value of all derivative instruments, other than those in effective cash flow and net investment hedging relationships, are recognised immediately in the income statement. As noted in (2) and (3) below, the change in fair value of a derivative in an effective cash flow or net investment hedging relationship is allocated between the income statement and other comprehensive income.\n\nDerivatives embedded in a financial asset are not considered separately; the financial asset is considered in its entirety when determining whether its cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest. Derivatives embedded in financial liabilities and insurance contracts (unless the embedded derivative is itself an insurance contract) are treated as separate derivatives when their economic characteristics and risks are not closely related to those of the host contract and the host contract is not carried at fair value through profit or loss. These embedded derivatives are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the income statement. In accordance with IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts , a policyholder's option to surrender an insurance contract for a fixed amount is not treated as an embedded derivative.\n\nHedge accounting allows one financial instrument, generally a derivative such as a swap, to be designated as a hedge of another financial instrument such as a loan or deposit or a portfolio of such instruments. At the inception of the hedge relationship, formal documentation is drawn up specifying the hedging strategy, the hedged item, the hedging instrument and the methodology that will be used to measure the effectiveness of the hedge relationship in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flow of the hedged risk. The effectiveness of the hedging relationship is tested both at inception and throughout its life and if at any point it is concluded that it is no longer highly effective in achieving its documented objective, hedge accounting is discontinued. Note 17 provides details of the types of derivatives held by the Group and presents separately those designated in hedge relationships.\n\nWhere there is uncertainty arising from interest rate benchmark reform, the Group assumes that the interest rate benchmark on which the hedged cash flows and/or the hedged risk are based, or the interest rate benchmark on which the cash flows of the hedging instrument are based, are not altered as a result of interest rate benchmark reform. The Group does not discontinue a hedging relationship during the period of uncertainty arising from the interest rate benchmark reform solely because the actual results of the hedge are not highly effective.\n\n## (1) Fair value hedges\n\nChanges in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, together with the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk; this also applies if the hedged asset is classified as a financial asset at fair value through other comprehensive income. If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, changes in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are no longer recognised in the income statement. The cumulative adjustment that has been made to the carrying amount of the hedged item is amortised to the income statement using the effective interest method over the period to maturity.\n\n## (2) Cash flow hedges\n\nThe effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income in the cash flow hedging reserve. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to the income statement in the periods in which the hedged item affects profit or loss. When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised in the income statement when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.\n\n## (3) Net investment hedges\n\nHedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges. Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in other comprehensive income, the gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in the income statement when the foreign operation is disposed of. The hedging instrument used in net investment hedges may include non-derivative liabilities as well as derivative financial instruments.\n\n## (G) Offset\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right of offset and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. Cash collateral on exchange traded derivative transactions is presented gross unless the collateral cash flows are always settled net with the derivative cash flows. In certain situations, even though master netting agreements exist, the lack of management intention to settle on a net basis results in the financial assets and liabilities being reported gross on the balance sheet.\n\n## (H) Impairment of financial assets\n\nThe impairment charge in the income statement includes the change in expected credit losses and including those arising from fraud. Expected credit losses are recognised for loans and advances to customers and banks, other financial assets held at amortised cost, financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, and certain loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts. Expected credit losses are calculated as an unbiased and probability-weighted estimate using an appropriate probability of default, adjusted to take into account a range of possible future economic scenarios, and applying this to the estimated exposure of the Group at the point of default after taking into account the value of any collateral held, repayments, or other mitigants of loss and including the impact of discounting using the effective interest rate.\n\nAt initial recognition, allowance (or provision in the case of some loan commitments and financial guarantees) is made for expected credit losses resulting from default events that are possible within the next 12 months (12-month expected credit losses). In the event of a significant increase in credit risk since origination, allowance (or provision) is made for expected credit losses resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial instrument (lifetime expected credit losses). Financial assets where 12-month expected credit losses are recognised are considered to be Stage 1; financial assets which are considered to have experienced a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition are in Stage 2; and financial assets which have defaulted or are otherwise considered to be credit impaired are allocated to Stage 3. Some Stage 3 assets, mainly in Commercial Banking, are subject to individual rather than collective assessment. Such cases are subject to a risk-based impairment sanctioning process, and these are reviewed and updated at least quarterly, or more frequently if there is a significant change in the credit profile. The collective assessment of impairment aggregates financial instruments with similar risk characteristics such as whether the facility is revolving in nature or secured and the type of security against financial assets.\n\nAn assessment of whether credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition considers the change in the risk of default occurring over the remaining expected life of the financial instrument. In determining whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk, the Group uses quantitative tests based on relative and absolute probability of default (PD) movements linked to internal credit ratings together with qualitative indicators such as watchlists and other indicators of historical delinquency, credit weakness or financial difficulty. The use of internal credit ratings and qualitative indicators ensure alignment between the assessment of staging and the Group's management of credit risk which utilises these internal metrics within distinct retail and commercial portfolio risk management practices. However, unless identified at an earlier stage, the credit risk of financial assets is deemed to have increased significantly when more than 30 days past due. The use of a payment holiday in itself has not been judged to indicate a significant increase in credit risk, with the underlying long-term credit risk deemed to be driven by economic conditions and captured through the use of forward-looking models. These portfolio level models are capturing",

Where the credit risk subsequently improves such that it no longer represents a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, the asset is transferred back to Stage 1.\n\nAssets are transferred to Stage 3 when they have defaulted or are otherwise considered to be credit impaired. Default is considered to have occurred when there is evidence that the customer is experiencing financial difficulty which is likely to affect significantly the ability to repay the amount due. IFRS 9 contains a rebuttable presumption that default occurs no later than when a payment is 90 days past due. The Group uses this 90 day backstop for all its products except for UK mortgages. For UK mortgages, the Group uses a backstop of 180 days past due as mortgage exposures more than 90 days past due, but less than 180 days, typically show high cure rates and this aligns with the Group's risk management practices. Key differences between Stage 3 balances and nonperforming loans relate to the use of 180 days past due for Stage 3 mortgages and to the cure periods applied to forbearance exposures. The use of payment holidays is not considered to be an automatic trigger of regulatory default and therefore does not automatically trigger Stage 3. Days past due will also not accumulate on any accounts that have taken a payment holiday including those already past due.\n\nIn certain circumstances, the Group will renegotiate the original terms of a customer's loan, either as part of an ongoing customer relationship or in response to adverse changes in the circumstances of the borrower. In the latter circumstances, the loan will remain classified as either Stage 2 or Stage 3 until the credit risk has improved such that it no longer represents a significant increase since origination (for a return to Stage 1), or the loan is no longer credit impaired (for a return to Stage 2). On renegotiation the gross carrying amount of the loan is recalculated as the present value of the renegotiated or modified contractual cash flows, which are discounted at the original effective interest rate. Renegotiation may also lead to the loan and associated allowance being derecognised and a new loan being recognised initially at fair value.\n\nPurchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets (POCI) include financial assets that are purchased or originated at a deep discount that reflects incurred credit losses. At initial recognition, POCI assets do not carry an impairment allowance; instead, lifetime expected credit losses are incorporated into the calculation of the effective interest rate. All changes in lifetime expected credit losses subsequent to the assets' initial recognition are recognised as an impairment charge.\n\nA loan or advance is normally written off, either partially or in full, against the related allowance when the proceeds from realising any available security have been received or there is no realistic prospect of recovery and the amount of the loss has been determined. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off decrease the amount of impairment losses recorded in the income statement. For both secured and unsecured retail balances, the write-off takes place only once an extensive set of collections processes has been completed, or the status of the account reaches a point where policy dictates that continuing attempts to recover are no longer appropriate. For commercial lending, a write-off occurs if the loan facility with the customer is restructured, the asset is under administration and the only monies that can be received are the amounts estimated by the administrator, the underlying assets are disposed and a decision is made that no further settlement monies will be received, or external evidence (for example, third party valuations) is available that there has been an irreversible decline in expected cash flows.\n\n## (I) Property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment (other than investment property) is included at cost less accumulated depreciation. The value of land (included in premises) is not depreciated. Depreciation on other assets is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the difference between the cost and the residual value over their estimated useful lives, as follows: the shorter of 50 years and the remaining period of the lease for freehold/long and short leasehold premises; the shorter of 10 years and, if lease renewal is not likely, the remaining period of the lease for leasehold improvements; 10 to/uni00A020 years for fixtures and furnishings; and 2 to 8 years for other equipment and motor vehicles.\n\nThe assets' residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.\n\nAssets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. In the event that an asset's carrying amount is determined to be greater than its recoverable amount it is written down immediately. The recoverable amount is the higher of the asset's fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.\n\nInvestment property comprises freehold and long leasehold land and buildings that are held either to earn rental income or for capital accretion or both, primarily within the life insurance funds. In accordance with the guidance published by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, investment property is carried at fair value based on current prices for similar properties, adjusted for the specific characteristics of the property (such as location or condition). If this information is not available, the Group uses alternative valuation methods such as discounted cash flow projections or recent prices in less active markets. These valuations are reviewed at least annually by independent professionally qualified valuers. Investment property being redeveloped for continuing use as investment property, or for which the market has become less active, continues to be valued at fair value.\n\n## (J) Leases\n\nUnder IFRS 16, a lessor is required to determine whether a lease is a finance or operating lease. A lessee is not required to make this determination.\n\n## (1) As lessor\n\nAssets leased to customers are classified as finance leases if the lease agreements transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee but not necessarily legal title. All other leases are classified as operating leases. When assets are subject to finance leases, the present value of the lease payments, together with any unguaranteed residual value, is recognised as a receivable, net of allowances for expected credit losses and residual value impairment, within loans and advances to banks and customers. The difference between the gross receivable and the present value of the receivable is recognised as unearned finance lease income. Finance lease income is recognised in interest income over the term of the lease using the net investment method (before tax) so as to give a constant rate of return on the net investment in the leases. Unguaranteed residual values are reviewed regularly to identify any impairment.\n\nOperating lease assets are included within property, plant and equipment at cost and depreciated over their estimated useful lives, which equates to the lives of the leases, after taking into account anticipated residual values. Operating lease rental income is recognised on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease.\n\nThe Group evaluates non-lease arrangements such as outsourcing and similar contracts to determine if they contain a lease which is then accounted for separately.\n\n## (2) As lessee\n\nLeases are recognised as a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability at the date at which the leased asset is available for use by the Group. Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be determined, or the Group's incremental borrowing rate appropriate for the right-of-use asset arising from the lease.\n\nLease payments are allocated between the liability and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to profit or loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period. The right-of-use asset is depreciated over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis.\n\nPayments associated with short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognised on a straight-line basis as an expense in profit or loss. Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of twelve months or less. Low-value assets comprise IT equipment and small items of office furniture.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financialflstatements continued\n\n## Note 2: Accounting policies continued\n\n## (K) Employee benefits\n\nShort-term employee benefits, such as salaries, paid absences, performance-based cash awards and social security costs are recognised over the period in which the employees provide the related services.\n\n## (1) Pension schemes\n\nThe Group operates a number of post-retirement benefit schemes for its employees including both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans. A defined benefit scheme is a pension plan that defines an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and salary. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan into which the Group pays fixed contributions; there is no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions.\n\nScheme assets are included at their fair value and scheme liabilities are measured on an actuarial basis using the projected unit credit method. The defined benefit scheme liabilities are discounted using rates equivalent to the market yields at the balance sheet date on high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability. The Group's income statement charge includes the current service cost of providing pension benefits, past service costs, net interest expense (income), and plan administration costs that are not deducted from the return on plan assets. Past service costs, which represents the change in the present value of the defined benefit obligation resulting from a plan amendment or curtailment, are recognised when the plan amendment or curtailment occurs. Net interest expense (income) is calculated by applying the discount rate at the beginning of the period to the net defined benefit liability or asset.\n\nRemeasurements, comprising actuarial gains and losses, the return on plan assets (excluding amounts included in net interest expense (income) and net of the cost of managing the plan assets), and the effect of changes to the asset ceiling (if applicable) are reflected immediately in the balance sheet with a charge or credit recognised in other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. Remeasurements recognised in other comprehensive income are reflected immediately in retained profits and will not subsequently be reclassified to profit or loss.\n\nThe Group's balance sheet includes the net surplus or deficit, being the difference between the fair value of scheme assets and the discounted value of scheme liabilities at the balance sheet date. Surpluses are only recognised to the extent that they are recoverable through reduced contributions in the future or through refunds from the schemes. In assessing whether a surplus is recoverable, the Group considers (i) its current right to obtain a refund or a reduction in future contributions and (ii) the rights of other parties existing at the balance sheet date. In determining the rights of third parties existing at the balance sheet date, the Group does not anticipate any future acts by other parties.\n\nThe costs of the Group's defined contribution plans are charged to the income statement in the period in which they fall due.\n\n## (2) Share-based compensation\n\nThe Group operates a number of equity-settled, share-based compensation plans in respect of services received from certain of its employees. The value of the employee services received in exchange for equity instruments granted under these plans is recognised as an expense over the vesting period of the instruments, with a corresponding increase in equity. This expense is determined by reference to the fair value of the number of equity instruments that are expected to vest. The fair value of equity instruments granted is based on market prices, if available, at the date of grant. In the absence of market prices, the fair value of the instruments at the date of grant is estimated using an appropriate valuation technique, such as a Black-Scholes option pricing model or a Monte Carlo simulation. The determination of fair values excludes the impact of any non-market vesting conditions, which are included in the assumptions used to estimate the number of options that are expected to vest. At each balance sheet date, this estimate is reassessed and if necessary revised. Any revision of the original estimate is recognised in the income statement, together with a corresponding adjustment to equity. Cancellations by employees of contributions to the Group's Save As You Earn plans are treated as non-vesting conditions and the Group recognises, in the year of cancellation, the amount of the expense that would have otherwise been recognised over the remainder of the vesting period. Modifications are assessed at the date of modification and any incremental charges are charged to the income statement.\n\n## (L) Taxation\n\nTax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Current and deferred tax are charged or credited in the income statement except to the extent that the tax arises from a transaction or event which is recognised, in the same or a different period, outside the income statement (either in other comprehensive income, directly in equity, or through a business combination), in which case the tax appears in the same statement as the transaction that gave rise to it. The tax consequences of the Group's dividend payments (including distributions on other equity instruments), if any, are charged or credited to the statement in which the profit distributed originally arose.\n\nCurrent tax is the amount of corporate income taxes expected to be payable or recoverable based on the profit for the period as adjusted for items that are not taxable or not deductible, and is calculated using tax rates and laws that were enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.\n\nCurrent tax includes amounts provided in respect of uncertain tax positions when management expects that, upon examination of the uncertainty by Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) or other relevant tax authority, it is more likely than not that an economic outflow will occur. Provisions reflect management's best estimate of the ultimate liability based on their interpretation of tax law, precedent and guidance, informed by external tax advice as necessary. Changes in facts and circumstances underlying these provisions are reassessed at each balance sheet date, and the provisions are remeasured as required to reflect current information.\n\nFor the Group's long-term insurance businesses, the tax expense is analysed between tax that is payable in respect of policyholders' returns and tax that is payable on the shareholders' returns. This allocation is based on an assessment of the rates of tax which will be applied to the returns under the current UK tax rules.\n\nDeferred tax is recognised on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the balance sheet. Deferred tax is calculated using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and which are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences but not recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries where the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax liabilities are not recognised on temporary differences that arise from goodwill which is not deductible for tax purposes.\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognised to the extent it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which the deductible temporary differences can be utilised, and are reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised in respect of temporary differences that arise on initial recognition of assets and liabilities acquired other than in a business combination. Deferred tax is not discounted.",

        "page_content": "## Note 2: Accounting policies continued\n\n## (M) Insurance\n\nThe Group undertakes both life insurance and general insurance business. Insurance and participating investment contracts are accounted for under IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts , which permits (with certain exceptions) the continuation of accounting practices for measuring insurance and participating investment contracts that applied prior to the adoption of IFRS. The Group, therefore, continues to account for these products using UK GAAP and UK established practice.\n\nProducts sold by the life insurance business are classified into three categories:\n\n- - Insurance contracts - these contracts transfer significant insurance risk and may also transfer financial risk. The Group defines significant insurance risk as the possibility of having to pay benefits on the occurrence of an insured event which are significantly more than the benefits payable if the insured event were not to occur. These contracts may or may not include discretionary participation features.\n- - Investment contracts containing a discretionary participation feature (participating investment contracts) - these contracts do not transfer significant insurance risk, but contain a contractual right which gives the holder the right to receive, in addition to the guaranteed benefits, further additional discretionary benefits or bonuses that are likely to be a significant proportion of the total contractual benefits and the amount and timing of which is at the discretion of the Group, within the constraints of the terms and conditions of the instrument and based upon the performance of specified assets.\n- - Non-participating investment contracts - these contracts do not transfer significant insurance risk or contain a discretionary participation feature.\n\nThe general insurance business issues only insurance contracts.\n\n## (1) Life insurance business\n\n## (i) Accounting for insurance and participating investment contracts\n\n## Premiums and claims\n\nPremiums received in respect of insurance and participating investment contracts are recognised as revenue when due except for unit-linked contracts on which premiums are recognised as revenue when received. Claims are recorded as an expense on the earlier of the maturity date or the date on which the claim is notified.\n\n## Liabilities\n\n- Changes in the value of liabilities are recognised in the income statement through insurance claims.\n- - Insurance and participating investment contracts in the Group's with-profit funds\n\nLiabilities of the Group's with-profit funds, including guarantees and options embedded within products written by these funds, are stated at their realistic values in accordance with the Prudential Regulation Authority's realistic capital regime, except that projected transfers out of the funds into other Group funds are recorded in the unallocated surplus (see below). Further details on valuation under the realistic capital regime are included in note 30/uni00A0Liabilities arising from insurance contracts and participating investment contracts.\n\n- - Insurance contracts which are not unit-linked or in the Group's with-profit funds\n\nA liability for contractual benefits that are expected to be incurred in the future is recorded when the premiums are recognised. The liability is calculated by estimating the future cash flows over the duration of in-force policies and discounting them back to the valuation date allowing for probabilities of occurrence. The liability will vary with movements in interest rates and with the cost of life insurance and annuity benefits where future mortality is uncertain.\n\nAssumptions are made in respect of all material factors affecting future cash flows, including future interest rates, mortality and costs.\n\nFurther details on valuation are included in note 30/uni00A0Liabilities arising from insurance contracts and participating investment contracts.\n\n- - Insurance and participating investment contracts which are unit-linked\n\nLiabilities for unit-linked insurance contracts and participating investment contracts are stated at the bid value of units plus an additional allowance where appropriate (such as for any excess of future expenses over charges). The liability is increased or reduced by the change in the unit prices and is reduced by policy administration fees, mortality and surrender charges and any withdrawals. Benefit claims in excess of the account balances incurred in the period are also charged through insurance claims. Revenue consists of fees deducted for mortality, policy administration and surrender charges.\n\n## Unallocated surplus\n\nAny amounts in the with-profit funds not yet determined as being due to policyholders or shareholders are recognised as an unallocated surplus which is shown separately from liabilities arising from insurance contracts and participating investment contracts.\n\n## (ii) Accounting for non-participating investment contracts\n\nThe Group's non-participating investment contracts are primarily unit-linked. These contracts are accounted for as financial liabilities whose value is contractually linked to the fair values of financial assets within the Group's unitised investment funds. The value of the unit-linked financial liabilities is determined using current unit prices multiplied by the number of units attributed to the contract holders at the balance sheet date. Their value is never less than the amount payable on surrender, discounted for the required notice period where applicable. Investment returns (including movements in fair value and investment income) allocated to those contracts are recognised in the income statement through insurance claims.\n\nDeposits and withdrawals are not accounted for through the income statement but are accounted for directly in the balance sheet as adjustments to the nonparticipating investment contract liability.\n\nThe Group receives investment management fees in the form of an initial adjustment or charge to the amount invested. These fees are in respect of services rendered in conjunction with the issue and management of investment contracts where the Group actively manages the consideration received from its customers to fund a return that is based on the investment profile that the customer selected on origination of the contract. These services comprise an indeterminate number of acts over the lives of the individual contracts and, therefore, the Group defers these fees and recognises them over the estimated lives of the contracts, in line with the provision of investment management services.\n\nCosts which are directly attributable and incremental to securing new non-participating investment contracts are deferred. This asset is subsequently amortised over the period of the provision of investment management services and its recoverability is reviewed in circumstances where its carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the asset is greater than its recoverable amount it is written down immediately through fee and commission expense in the income statement. All other costs are recognised as expenses when incurred.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financialflstatements continued\n\n## Note 2: Accounting policies continued\n\n## (iii) Value of in-force business\n\nThe Group recognises as an asset the value of in-force business in respect of insurance contracts and participating investment contracts. The asset represents the present value of the shareholders' interest in the profits expected to emerge from those contracts written at the balance sheet date. This is determined after making appropriate assumptions about future economic and operating conditions such as future mortality and persistency rates and includes allowances for both non-market risk and for the realistic value of financial options and guarantees. Each cash flow is valued using the discount rate consistent with that applied to such a cash flow in the capital markets. The asset in the consolidated balance sheet is presented gross of attributable tax and movements in the asset are reflected within other operating income in the income statement.\n\nThe Group's contractual rights to benefits from providing investment management services in relation to non-participating investment contracts acquired in business combinations and portfolio transfers are measured at fair value at the date of acquisition. The resulting asset is amortised over the estimated lives of the contracts. At each reporting date an assessment is made to determine if there is any indication of impairment. Where impairment exists, the carrying value of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount and the impairment loss recognised in the income statement.\n\n## (2) General insurance business\n\nThe Group both underwrites and acts as intermediary in the sale of general insurance products. Underwriting premiums are included in insurance premium income, net of refunds, in the period in which insurance cover is provided to the customer; premiums received relating to future periods are deferred in the balance sheet within liabilities arising from insurance contracts and participating investment contracts on a basis that reflects the length of time for which contracts have been in-force and the projected incidence of risk over the term of the contract and only credited to the income statement when earned. Broking commission is recognised when the underwriter accepts the risk of providing insurance cover to the customer. Where appropriate, provision is made for the effect of future policy terminations based upon past experience.\n\nThe underwriting business makes provision for the estimated cost of claims notified but not settled and claims incurred but not reported at the balance sheet date. The provision for the cost of claims notified but not settled is based upon a best estimate of the cost of settling the outstanding claims after taking into account all known facts. In those cases where there is insufficient information to determine the required provision, statistical techniques are used which take into account the cost of claims that have recently been settled and make assumptions about the future development of the outstanding cases. Similar statistical techniques are used to determine the provision for claims incurred but not reported at the balance sheet date. Claims liabilities are not discounted.\n\n## (3) Liability adequacy test\n\nAt each balance sheet date liability adequacy tests are performed to ensure the adequacy of insurance and participating investment contract liabilities net of related deferred cost assets and value of in-force business. In performing these tests current best estimates of discounted future contractual cash flows and claims handling and policy administration expenses, as well as investment income from the assets backing such liabilities, are used. Any deficiency is immediately charged to the income statement, initially by writing off the relevant assets and subsequently by establishing a provision for losses arising from liability adequacy tests.\n\n## (4) Reinsurance\n\nContracts entered into by the Group with reinsurers under which the Group is compensated for benefits payable on one or more contracts issued by the Group are recognised as assets arising from contracts held with reinsurers. Where the contract transfers significant insurance risk, the contract issued by the Group is classified as an insurance contract; where the contract transfers financial risk, the contract issued by the Group is recognised at fair value through profit or loss.\n\n## Assets arising from contract held with reinsurers - Insurance risk transferred\n\nAmounts recoverable from or due to reinsurers are measured consistently with the amounts associated with the reinsured contracts and in accordance with the terms of each reinsurance contract and are regularly reviewed for impairment. Premiums payable for reinsurance contracts are recognised as an expense when due within insurance premium income. Changes in the reinsurance recoverable assets are recognised in the income statement through insurance claims.\n\n## Assets arising from contract held with reinsurers - Financial risk transferred\n\nThese contracts are accounted for as financial assets whose value is contractually linked to the fair values of financial assets within the reinsurers' investment funds. Investment returns (including movements in fair value and investment income) allocated to these contracts are recognised in insurance claims. Deposits and withdrawals are not accounted for through the income statement but are accounted for directly in the balance sheet as adjustments to the assets arising from reinsurance contracts held.\n\n## (N) Foreign currency translation\n\nItems included in the financial statements of each of the Group's entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the functional currency). Foreign currency transactions are translated into the appropriate functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement, except when recognised in other comprehensive income as qualifying cash flow or net investment hedges. Non-monetary assets that are measured at fair value are translated using the exchange rate at the date that the fair value was determined. Translation differences on equities and similar non-monetary items held at fair value through profit and loss are recognised in profit or loss as part of the fair value gain or loss. Translation differences on non-monetary financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, such as equity shares, are included in the fair value reserve in equity unless the asset is a hedged item in a fair value hedge.\n\nThe results and financial position of all Group entities that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows: the assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity, are translated into sterling at foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date; and the income and expenses of foreign operations are translated into sterling at average exchange rates unless these do not approximate to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions in which case income and expenses are translated at the dates of the transactions.\n\nForeign exchange differences arising on the translation of a foreign operation are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in a separate component of equity together with exchange differences arising from the translation of borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments (see (F)(3) above). On disposal or liquidation of a foreign operation, the cumulative amount of exchange differences relating to that foreign operation are reclassified from equity and included in determining the profit or loss arising on disposal or liquidation.",

Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the financial statements but are disclosed unless they are remote.\n\nProvision is made for expected credit losses in respect of irrevocable undrawn loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts (see (H) above).\n\n## (P) Share capital\n\nIncremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options or to the acquisition of a business are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. Dividends paid on the Group's ordinary shares are recognised as a reduction in equity in the period in which they are paid.\n\nWhere the Company or any member of the Group purchases the Company's share capital, the consideration paid is deducted from shareholders' equity as treasury shares until they are cancelled; if these shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received is included in shareholders' equity.\n\n## (Q) Cash and cash equivalents\n\nFor the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash and non-mandatory balances with central banks and amounts due from banks with a maturity of less than three months.\n\n## Note 3: Critical accounting judgements and estimates\n\nThe preparation of the Group's financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions in applying the accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Due to the inherent uncertainty in making estimates, actual results reported in future periods may be based upon amounts which differ from those estimates. Estimates, judgements and assumptions are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.\n\nThe significant judgements made by management in applying the Group's accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty in these financial statements, which together are deemed critical to the Group's results and financial position, are as follows:\n\n## Allowance for expected credit losses\n\nKey judgements:\n\nDetermining an appropriate definition of default against which a probability of default, exposure at default and loss given default parameter can be evaluated\n\nThe appropriate lifetime of an exposure to credit risk for the assessment of lifetime losses, notably on revolving products\n\nEstablishing the criteria for a significant increase in credit risk\n\nThe use of management judgement alongside impairment modelling processes to adjust inputs, parameters and outputs to reflect risks not captured by models\n\nKey estimates:\n\nBase case and Multiple Economic Scenarios (MES) assumptions, including the rate of unemployment and the rate of change of house prices, required for creation of MES scenarios and forward-looking credit parameters\n\nThese judgements and estimates are subject to significant uncertainty.\n\nThe Group recognises an allowance for expected credit losses for loans and advances to customers and banks, other financial assets held at amortised cost, financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income and certain loan commitment and financial guarantee contracts. At 31 December 2020 the Group's expected credit loss allowance was \u00a36,247 million (2019: \u00a33,455 million), of which \u00a35,788/uni00A0million (2019: \u00a33,278/uni00A0million) was in respect of drawn balances.\n\nThe calculation of the Group's expected credit loss (ECL) allowances and provisions against loan commitments and guarantees under IFRS 9 requires the Group to make a number of judgements, assumptions and estimates. The most significant are set out below.\n\n## Definition of default\n\nThe probability of default (PD) of an exposure, both over a 12 month period and over its lifetime, is a key input to the measurement of the ECL allowance. Default has occurred when there is evidence that the customer is experiencing significant financial difficulty which is likely to affect the ability to repay amounts due. The definition of default adopted by the Group is described in note 2(H) Impairment of financial assets. The Group has rebutted the presumption in IFRS 9 that default occurs no later than when a payment is 90 days past due for UK mortgages. As a result, at 31 December 2020, approximately \u00a30.6 billion of UK mortgages (2019: \u00a30.6 billion) were classified as Stage 2 rather than Stage 3; the impact on the Group's ECL allowance was not material.\n\n## Lifetime of an exposure\n\nA range of approaches, segmented by product type, has been adopted by the Group to estimate a product's expected life. These include using the full contractual life and taking into account behavioural factors such as early repayments and refinancing. For non-revolving retail assets, the Group has assumed the expected life for each product to be the time taken for all significant losses to be observed. For retail revolving products, the Group has considered the losses beyond the contractual term over which the Group is exposed to credit risk. For commercial overdraft facilities, the average behavioural life has been used. Changes to the assumed expected lives of the Group's assets could impact the ECL allowance recognised by the Group. The assessment of SICR and corresponding lifetime loss, and the PD, of a financial asset deemed to be Stage 2, or Stage 3, is dependent on its expected life.\n\n## Significant increase in credit risk\n\nPerforming assets are classified as either Stage 1 or Stage 2. An ECL allowance equivalent to 12 months expected losses is established against assets in Stage 1; assets classified as Stage 2 carry an ECL allowance equivalent to lifetime expected losses. Assets are transferred from Stage 1 to Stage 2 when there has been a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) since initial recognition. Credit impaired assets are transferred to Stage 3 with a lifetime expected losses allowance. The Group uses both quantitative and qualitative indicators to determine whether there has been a SICR for an asset. For Retail, the following tables set out the Retail Master Scale (RMS) grade triggers which result in a SICR for financial assets and the PD boundaries for each RMS grade. Credit cards SICR triggers have been refined in 2020 following a review of sensitivity to changes in economic assumptions, 2019 triggers were previously aligned",

The Group does not use the low credit risk exemption in its staging assessments. The use of a payment holiday in and of itself has not been judged to indicate a significant increase in credit risk, nor forbearance, with the underlying long-term credit risk deemed to be driven by economic conditions and captured through the use of forward-looking models. These portfolio level models are capturing the anticipated volume of increased defaults and therefore an appropriate assessment of staging and expected credit loss. During 2020, the Group has granted payment holidays on Retail loans and advances, \u00a36.4/uni00A0billion/uni00A0remained in place at 31 December 2020, \u00a34.3 billion of these balances were classified as Stage 1. If all of these assets were classified as Stage 2, the Group's ECL would have been less than \u00a350/uni00A0million higher.\n\nAll financial assets are assumed to have suffered a SICR if they are more than 30 days past due; non-mortgage Retail financial assets are also assumed to have suffered a SICR if they are in arrears on three or more separate occasions in a rolling twelve month period. Financial assets are classified as credit impaired if they are 90 days past due except for UK mortgages where a 180 days backstop is used.\n\nA Stage 3 asset that is no longer credit-impaired is transferred back to Stage 2 as no cure period is applied to Stage 3. If an exposure that is classified as Stage 2 no longer meets the SICR criteria, which in some cases include a minimum cure period, it is moved back to Stage 1.\n\nThe setting of precise trigger points combined with risk indicators requires judgement. The use of different trigger points may have a material impact upon the size of the ECL allowance. The Group monitors the effectiveness of SICR criteria on an ongoing basis.\n\n## Generation of Multiple Economic Scenarios (MES)\n\nThe measurement of expected credit losses is required to reflect an unbiased probability-weighted range of possible future outcomes. The Group considers the choice of approach used to generate the range of economic outcomes to be judgemental, given several methods can be adopted. In addition to a defined base case, as used for planning, the Group's approach relies on model-generated scenarios, reducing scope for bias in the selection of scenarios and their weightings. The conditioning assumptions underpinning the base case scenario reflect the Group's best view of future events. Where outcomes materially diverge from the conditioning assumptions adopted, the base case scenario is updated. The base case is therefore central to the range of outcomes created as no alternative conditioning assumptions are factored into the model-generated scenarios.\n\nThe Group models a full distribution of economic scenarios around this base case, ranking them using estimated relationships with industry-wide historical loss data. The full distribution is summarised by a practical number of scenarios to run through ECL models representing four sections: an upside, the base case, and a downside scenario weighted at 30 per cent each, with a severe downside scenario weighted at 10 per cent. With the base case already pre-defined, the other three scenarios are constructed as averages of constituent modelled scenarios around the 15th, 75th and 95th percentiles of the distribution. The scenario weights therefore represent the allocation to each summary segment of the distribution and not a subjective view on likelihood. The inclusion of a severe downside scenario with a smaller weighting but relatively large credit losses, ensures the non-linearity of losses in the tail of the distribution is captured when ECL based on the weighted result of the four scenarios is calculated.\n\nA committee under the chairmanship of the Chief Economist meets at least quarterly to review and, if appropriate, recommend changes to the method by which economic scenarios are generated; for approval by the Chief Financial Officer and Chief Risk Officer. In 2020, a change was made to the way in which the distribution of scenarios is created. This change allows for a greater dispersal of economic outcomes in the early periods of the forecast, to recognise the increased near-term profile of risks present since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. This change allows for a wider distribution of losses both on the upside and downside, although is most evident in the severe downside scenario, given it represents a more adverse segment of the distribution. The change is estimated to have driven an additional \u00a3200/uni00A0million of ECL resulting from the inclusion of more adverse economic outcomes.\n\n## Base Case and MES Economic Assumptions\n\nThe Group's base case economic scenario has continued to be revised in light of the impact of the coronavirus pandemic in the UK and globally. The scenario reflects judgements of the net effect of government-mandated restrictions on economic activity, large-scale government interventions, and behavioural changes by households and businesses that may persist beyond the rollout of coronavirus vaccination programmes.\n\nDespite large-scale vaccination efforts commencing in the UK and globally, there remains considerable uncertainty about the pace and eventual extent of the post-pandemic recovery. The Group's current base case scenario builds in three key conditioning assumptions. First, the UK vaccine rollout successfully protects the elderly, key workers and the clinically vulnerable by mid-2021. Second, national lockdowns end by April 2021, allowing a phased return to a tiered system of restrictions that are progressively eased in the second quarter and second half of 2021, leaving only limited restrictions in place by the end of 2021. Third, government policy measures including specifically the furlough scheme continue to provide support for the duration of severe economic restrictions, through to mid-2021.\n\nConditioned on the above assumptions and despite the recovery in economic activity resuming from the second quarter of 2021, the Group's base case outlook assumes a rise in the unemployment rate and weakness in residential and commercial property prices. Risks around this base case economic view lie in both directions and are partly captured by the MES generated. But uncertainties relating to the key conditioning assumptions, including epidemiological developments and the efficacy of vaccine rollouts, are not specifically captured by the MES scenarios. These specific risks have been recognised outside the modelled scenarios published below.\n\nThe Group has accommodated the latest available information at the reporting date in defining its base case scenario and generating the MES. The scenarios include forecasts for key variables in the fourth quarter of 2020, for which actuals may have since emerged prior to publication.",

The five-year period reflects movements within the current reporting year such that 31 December 2020 reflects five years 2020 to 2024. The prior year comparative data has been re-presented to align to the equivalent period, 2019 to 2023. The inclusion of the reporting year within the five-year period reflects the need to predict variables which remain unpublished at the reporting date, and recognises that credit models utilise both level and annual change in calculating ECL. The use of calendar years also maintains a comparability between tables disclosed.\n\n|                                     | At 31 December 2020   | At 31 December 2020   | At 31 December 2020   | At 31 December 2020   | At 31 December 2019   | At 31 December 2019   | At 31 December 2019   | At 31 December 2019   |\n|-------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n|                                     | Upside %              | Base case %           | Downside %            | Severe  downside %    | Upside %              | Base case %           | Downside %            | Severe  downside %    |\n| Gross domestic product              | 0.3                   | 0.1                   | (0.4)                 | (0.8)                 | 1.6                   | 1.3                   | 1.0                   | 0.3                   |\n| UK Bank Rate                        | 0.98                  | 0.15                  | 0.05                  | 0.02                  | 1.87                  | 1.15                  | 0.51                  | 0.17                  |\n| Unemployment rate                   | 5.0                   | 5.9                   | 7.1                   | 8.8                   | 3.9                   | 4.3                   | 5.5                   | 6.7                   |\n| House price growth                  | 4.2                   | 1.1                   | (3.5)                 | (7.5)                 | 5.1                   | 1.4                   | (2.5)                 | (7.0)                 |\n| Commercial real estate price growth | 2.1                   | (1.1)                 | (4.9)                 | (9.7)                 | 1.6                   | (0.3)                 | (3.9)                 | (7.3)                 |",

A significant difference between these bases arises on UK mortgages as the probability-weighted ECL includes the impact of house price movements on the loss given default (LGD). Commercial Banking also reflects movements in the loss given default, whereas for Other Retail portfolios only the probability of default responds to changes in the economic outlook. ECL applied through individual assessments and post-model adjustments is reported flat against each economic scenario, reflecting the basis on which they are evaluated. Judgements applied through changes to inputs are reflected in the scenario sensitivities.\n\n|                                       | At 31 December 2020   | At 31 December 2020       | At 31 December 2020   | At 31 December 2019   | At 31 December 2019       | At 31 December 2019   |\n|---------------------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------|\n| Impact of multiple economic scenarios | Base case \u00a3m          | Probability-  weighted \u00a3m | Difference \u00a3m         | Base case \u00a3m          | Probability-  weighted \u00a3m | Difference \u00a3m         |\n| UK mortgages                          | 804                   | 1,027                     | 223                   | 464                   | 569                       | 105                   |\n| Other Retail                          | 2,310                 | 2,368                     | 58                    | 1,492                 | 1,521                     | 29                    |\n| Commercial Banking                    | 2,177                 | 2,402                     | 225                   | 1,258                 | 1,315                     | 57                    |\n| Other                                 | 450                   | 450                       | -                     | 50                    | 50                        | -                     |\n| ECL allowance                         | 5,741                 | 6,247                     | 506                   | 3,264                 | 3,455                     | 191                   |\n\nThe table below shows the Group's ECL for the upside, base case, downside and severe downside scenarios. The stage allocation for an asset is based on the overall scenario probability-weighted PD and, hence, the Stage 2 allocation is constant across all the scenarios.

A probability-weighted scenario is not shown as this does not reflect the basis on which ECL is reported.\n\n|                    | At 31 December 2020   | At 31 December 2020   | At 31 December 2020   | At 31 December 2020   | At 31 December 2019   | At 31 December 2019   | At 31 December 2019   | At 31 December 2019   |\n|--------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n|                    | Upside \u00a3m             | Base case \u00a3m          | Downside \u00a3m           | Severe  downside \u00a3m   | Upside \u00a3m             | Base case \u00a3m          | Downside \u00a3m           | Severe  downside \u00a3m   |\n| UK mortgages       | 602                   | 797                   | 1,269                 | 2,578                 | 311                   | 461                   | 670                   | 1,667                 |\n| Other Retail       | 2,154                 | 2,299                 | 2,509                 | 2,819                 | 1,435                 | 1,486                 | 1,570                 | 1,740                 |\n| Commercial Banking | 1,892                 | 2,157                 | 2,738                 | 4,155                 | 1,206                 | 1,254                 | 1,387                 | 1,625                 |\n| Other              | 448                   | 449                   | 450                   | 457                   | 49                    | 50                    | 50                    | 51                    |\n| ECL allowance      | 5,096                 | 5,702                 | 6,966                 | 10,009                | 3,001                 | 3,251                 | 3,677                 | 5,083                 |\n\nThe table below shows the percentage of assets that would be recorded in Stage 2 for the upside, base case, downside and severe downside scenarios, if stage allocation was based on each specific scenario.

These assessments are carried out by the Business Support Unit based on detailed reviews and expected recovery strategies. While these assessments are based on the Group's latest economic view, the use of group-wide multiple economic scenarios and weightings is not considered appropriate for these cases due to their individual characteristics. In place of this a range of case specific outcomes are considered with any alternative better or worse outcomes that carry a 25 per cent likelihood taken into account in establishing a probability-weighted ECL. At 31 December 2020 individually assessed provisions for Commercial Banking were/uni00A0\u00a31,222 million (2019: \u00a3890 million) which reflected a range of \u00a3982/uni00A0million to \u00a31,548 million (2019: \u00a3515 million to \u00a31,183 million), based on the range of alternative outcomes considered.",

Limitations in the Group's impairment models or data inputs, may be identified through the ongoing assessment and validation of the output of the models. In these circumstances, management make appropriate adjustments to the Group's allowance for impairment losses to ensure that the overall provision adequately reflects all material risks. These adjustments are determined by considering the particular attributes of exposures which have not been adequately captured by the impairment models and range from changes to model inputs and parameters, at account level, through to more qualitative post-model overlays.\n\nJudgements are not typically assessed under each distinct economic scenario used to generate ECL, but instead are applied on the basis of final modelled ECL which reflects the probability weighted view of all scenarios. All adjustments are reviewed quarterly and are subject to internal review and challenge, including by the Audit Committee, to ensure that amounts are appropriately calculated and that there are specific release criteria within a reasonable timeframe.\n\nAt 31 December 2020/uni00A0the coronavirus pandemic and the various support measures that have been put in place have resulted in an economic environment which differs significantly from the historical economic conditions upon which the impairment models have been built. As a result there is a greater need for management judgements to be applied alongside the use of models. At 31 December 2020/uni00A0management judgement resulted in additional ECL allowances totalling \u00a31,383 million/uni00A0(2019: \u00a3153 million)./uni00A0This comprises judgements added due to COVID-19 in the year and other judgements not directly linked to COVID-19 but which have increased in size under the current outlook.

Management believes that the resulting position does not fully reflect the underlying credit risk in the portfolios. Adjustments have therefore been made to increase expected future rates of default and remove the impact of the observed improvement in average credit scores.\n\n## Incorporation of forward-looking LGDs: \u00a386/uni00A0million\n\nModelled LGDs in non-mortgage Retail portfolios are predominantly based on observed customer behaviour and resulting incurred losses. Management believes that this may not be representative of future experience, given the current economic outlook, and consequently an adjustment has been made to increase forward-looking LGDs to reflect a deterioration in cure and recovery rates. The impact has been estimated by using experience of losses in previous downturns and management's view of relative comparability of anticipated economic scenarios.\n\n## Commercial Banking: \u00a3131 million\n\nThis adjustment principally comprises:\n\n## Adjustment to economic variables used as inputs to models: \u00a393/uni00A0million\n\nManagement does not believe that the observed corporate insolvency rates used as an input to Commercial default models adequately reflect the current economic situation and outlook given the temporary government support. As a result, the observed reductions in the rate of insolvencies have been replaced with an increase proportionate to that seen in unemployment to generate a level of predicted defaults.",

The rapid evolution of the pandemic and significant changes that this has brought about could continue into 2021 and may partially invalidate the conditioning assumptions that underpin the Group's base case scenario. Management believes that the risks to the conditioning assumptions around the base case scenario are markedly to the downside, reflecting notably the potential for a material delay in the vaccination programme or reduction in its effectiveness from further virus mutation and the corresponding delayed withdrawal of restrictions on/uni00A0social interaction or introduction of further lockdowns. The Group's ECL allowances are required to reflect an unbiased probability-weighted view of all possible future outcomes and therefore management believes that an adjustment is required to capture these additional risks.\n\nAn adjustment of \u00a3400 million/uni00A0has been made to increase the Group's ECL allowances to reflect this increased uncertainty around the conditioning assumptions. This equates to a 1 percentage point increase in unemployment allied with a 5 per cent lower HPI in 2021, reflecting a more immediate and therefore greater ECL impact than the gradual increase reflected in the stated univariate sensitivity. It is proportionate to the level of volatility seen in forecasts as the pandemic has unfolded and is also equivalent to a 10 per cent re-weighting from the upside to the severe downside scenario. The adjustment, which has not been allocated to a specific portfolio, has been allocated against Stage 1 assets given the downside risks are largely considered to relate to exposures with currently low default probabilities, the majority of which are in Stage 1. Through 2021 the scale of the uncertainty is expected to diminish and the need for this adjustment will then be reassessed.\n\n## Other judgements\n\n## UK mortgages: \u00a3510 million/uni00A0(2019: \u00a3183 million)\n\nThese adjustments principally comprise:\n\n## Adjustment to modelled forecast parameters: \u00a3193/uni00A0million/uni00A0(2019: \u00a3nil)\n\nAdjustments have been required to the estimated defaults used within the ECL calculation for UK mortgages following the adoption of new default forecast models. Forecast models which predict quarterly defaults based on several economic variables have been developed using the response from the previous recession, as per usual modelling best practice. However, management believe further adjustments are necessary when the results of these models have been benchmarked to observed levels, given the atypical nature of the current economic outlook. These were derived using historical observed default rates under previous downturn conditions to ensure that the resulting forecast best reflected management's view given the current economic outlook. The adjustment to forward-looking parameters prior to their use in ECL calculations ensures that all downstream account level calculations reflect the Group's best view of credit losses in respect of the economic scenarios stated. As such this in-model adjustment is reflected within all scenarios, assessment of staging and in subsequent assessment of all post-model adjustments.\n\n## End-of-term interest-only: \u00a3179/uni00A0million (2019: \u00a3132 million)\n\nThe current definition of default used in the UK mortgages impairment model excludes past term interest-only accounts that continue to make interest payments but have missed their capital payment upon maturity of the loan. This adjustment therefore mitigates the risk that the model understates the credit losses associated with interest-only accounts which have missed, or will potentially miss, their final capital payment. For those accounts that have reached end of term this adjustment manually overwrites PDs to 70 per cent or 100 per cent, thereby moving them into Stage 2, or Stage 3, depending on whether they are deemed performing, or non-performing respectively. For interest-only accounts with six years or less to maturity an appropriate incremental PD uplift is made to PDs based on the probability of missing a future capital payment, assessed through segmentation of behaviour score, debt-to-value and worst ever arrears status. The increase in the judgement in 2020 is primarily driven by an increase in the stock of long-term defaults following COVID-19 related litigation suspension.\n\n## Long-term defaults: \u00a387 million/uni00A0(2019: \u00a333 million)\n\nThe Group suspended mortgage litigation activity between late 2014 and mid 2018 as changes were implemented to the treatment of amounts in arrears, interrupting the natural flow of accounts to possession. An adjustment is made to ensure adequate provision coverage considering the resulting build-up of accounts in long term default. Coverage is uplifted to the equivalent levels of those accounts already in repossession on an estimated shortfall of balances expected to flow to possession. A further adjustment is made to mitigate for the risk that credit model provision understates the probability of possession for accounts which have been in default for more than 24 months, with an arrears balance increase in the last 6 months. These accounts have their probability of possession set to 95 per cent based on observed historical losses incurred on accounts that were of an equivalent status. The increase in judgement in 2020 is primarily driven by an increase in the stock of long-term defaults following COVID-19 related litigation suspension.\n\n## Other Retail: \u00a3(13) million (2019:/uni00A0\u00a3(10) million)\n\nThese adjustments principally comprise:\n\n## Lifetime extension on revolving products: \u00a381/uni00A0million (2019: \u00a336 million)\n\nUnsecured revolving products use a model lifetime definition of three years based on historic data which shows that substantially all accounts resolve in this time. An adjustment is made to extend the lifetime used for Stage 2 exposures to six years by adding incremental probability of default through the extrapolation of the default trajectory observed throughout the three years and beyond. The resulting additional ECL allowance is added to Stage 2 accounts proportionate to the modelled three year PD. The increase in the judgement in 2020 is driven by growth in Stage 2 assets and their coverage, rather than any change to the lifetime assumption.\n\n## Unsecured non-scored accounts: \u00a3(72)/uni00A0million (2019:/uni00A0\u00a3nil)\n\nDue to a shortcoming in the models, it is not possible to retrieve relevant credit data for a number of accounts and therefore no PD is available and no assessment of whether there has been a SICR can be carried out. The model defaults these accounts to Stage 2 and a proxy ECL allowance calculated based on similar accounts within the portfolio. The deterioration in the economic outlook and growth in the number of accounts subject to this proxy have resulted in this approach having a more significant effect and an exercise has been carried out to identify and adjust those accounts which should not have been allocated to Stage 2.\n\n## Credit Card LGD alignment: \u00a3(55)/uni00A0million (2019: \u00a3(22)/uni00A0million)\n\nThe MBNA impairment model was developed using historical MBNA data. Following the acquisition of the business and the subsequent migration of this portfolio to Lloyds Banking Group collections strategies an adjustment is required to reflect the recent improvement in cure rates now evident as collections strategies harmonise, which are not captured by the original MBNA model development data.",

The valuation of this asset requires assumptions to be made about future economic and operating conditions which are inherently uncertain and changes could significantly affect the value attributed to this asset. The methodology used to value this asset and the key assumptions that have been made in determining the carrying value of the value of in-force business asset at 31 December 2020 are set out in note 23.\n\nAt 31 December 2020, the Group carried total liabilities arising from insurance contracts and participating investment contracts of \u00a3116,060/uni00A0million (2019: \u00a3111,449 million). Elements of the valuations of liabilities arising from insurance contracts and participating investment contracts require management to estimate future investment returns, future mortality rates and future expenses. These estimates are subject to significant uncertainty. The methodology used to value these liabilities and the key assumptions that have been made in determining their carrying value are set out in note 30.\n\nThe effect on the Group's profit before tax and shareholders' equity of changes in annuitant mortality and other key assumptions used in determining the life insurance assets and liabilities is set out in note 31. Reducing annuitant mortality rates to 95 per cent of the expected rate would reduce profit before tax by \u00a3333 million/uni00A0(2019: \u00a3293 million).\n\n## Defined benefit pension scheme obligations\n\nKey estimates:\n\nDiscount rate applied to future cash flows\n\nExpected lifetime of the schemes' members\n\nThe net asset recognised in the balance sheet at 31 December 2020 in respect of the Group's defined benefit pension scheme obligations was \u00a31,578/uni00A0million/uni00A0comprising an asset of \u00a31,714 million and a liability of \u00a3136 million (2019: a net asset of \u00a3550 million comprising an asset of \u00a3681/uni00A0million and a liability of \u00a3131/uni00A0million). The Group's accounting policy for its defined benefit pension scheme obligations is set out in note 2(K).\n\nThe accounting valuation of the Group's defined benefit pension schemes' liabilities requires management to make a number of assumptions. The key areas of estimation uncertainty are the discount rate applied to future cash flows and the expected lifetime of the schemes' members.\n\nThe discount rate is required to be set with reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on high quality corporate bonds in the currency of and with a term consistent with the defined benefit pension schemes' obligations. The average duration of the schemes' obligations is approximately 19 years. The market for bonds with a similar duration is limited and, as a result, significant management judgement is required to determine an appropriate yield curve on which to base the discount rate. Assuming that there is no change in other assumptions or in the value of the schemes' assets, the effect on the net accounting surplus at 31 December 2020 of a decrease of 10 basis points in the discount rate would be a reduction of \u00a3890 million/uni00A0(2019: \u00a3784 million). To the extent that changes in the discount rate arise from changes in gilt yields, rather than credit spreads, the impact is largely mitigated by the schemes' assetliability matching strategies.\n\nThe cost of the benefits payable by the schemes will also depend upon the life expectancy of the members. The mortality assumptions used by the Group are based on standard industry tables for both current mortality rates and the rate of future mortality improvement, adjusted in line with the actual experience of the Group's schemes. Assuming that there is no change in other assumptions or in the value of the schemes' assets, the effect on the net accounting surplus at 31 December 2020 of an increase in one year in the average life of scheme members would be a reduction of \u00a32,146 million (2019: \u00a31,636 million). The Group has in place a longevity swap, as described in note 34, to partially mitigate mortality risk.\n\nFurther sensitivities and the balance sheet impact of changes in the principal actuarial assumptions are provided in part (v) of note 34.\n\n## Recoverability of deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions\n\nKey judgements:\n\nAssessing the likely level of future taxable profits taking into account the Group's long-term financial and strategic plans Interpreting tax rules on the Group's open tax matters\n\nAt 31 December 2020 the Group carried deferred tax assets on its balance sheet of \u00a32,741 million (2019: \u00a32,666 million) principally relating to tax losses carried forward. Further information on the Group's deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions is provided in notes 35 and 46 respectively.\n\nEstimation of income taxes includes the assessment of recoverability of deferred tax assets. Deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that they are considered more likely than not to be recoverable based on existing tax laws and forecasts of future taxable profits against which the underlying tax deductions can be utilised. The Group has recognised a deferred tax asset of \u00a34,064 million (2019: \u00a33,611 million) in respect of trading losses carried forward. Substantially all of these losses have arisen in Bank of Scotland plc and Lloyds Bank plc, and they will be utilised as taxable profits arise in those legal entities in future periods.\n\nThe Group's expectations of future UK taxable profits require management judgement, and take into account the Group's long-term financial and strategic plans and anticipated future tax-adjusting items. In making this assessment, account is taken of business plans, the Board-approved operating plan and the expected future economic outlook as set out in the strategic report, as well as the risks associated with future regulatory change, in order to produce a base case forecast of future UK taxable profits. Under current law there is no expiry date for UK trading losses not yet utilised, and given the forecast of future profitability and the Group's commitment to the UK market, it is more likely than not the value of the losses will be recovered at some point in the future. Banking tax losses that arose before 1 April 2015 can only be used against 25/uni00A0per cent of taxable profits arising after 1 April 2016, and they cannot be used to reduce the surcharge on banking profits. These restrictions in utilisation means that the value of the deferred tax/uni00A0asset in respect of tax losses is only expected to be fully recovered by 2049 (2019: 2039) in the base case forecast. The rate of recovery of the Group's tax loss asset is not a straight line, being affected by the relative profitability of the legal entities in future periods, and the relative size of their tax losses carried forward. It is expected in the base case that 60 per cent of the value will be recovered by 2034, when Bank of Scotland plc will have utilised all of its available tax losses. It is possible that future tax law changes could",

        "page_content": "## Note 3: Critical accounting judgements and estimates continued\n\nmaterially affect the timing of recovery and the value of these losses ultimately realised by the Group. The value of the deferred tax asset in respect of tax losses increased by \u00a3420 million in 2020 as a result of the change in UK tax rates (see note 35).\n\nAs disclosed in note 46, the Group has an open matter in relation to a claim for group relief of losses incurred in its former Irish banking subsidiary, where the final tax position will remain uncertain until the matter is finally determined by judicial process.\n\n## Regulatory provisions\n\nKey judgements:\n\nDetermining the scope of reviews required by regulators\n\nThe impact of legal decisions that may be relevant to claims received\n\nKey estimates:\n\nThe number of future complaints\n\nThe proportion of complaints that will be upheld\n\nThe average cost of redress\n\nAt 31 December 2020, the Group carried provisions of \u00a3642 million (2019: \u00a32,408 million) against the cost of making redress payments to customers and the related administration costs in connection with historical regulatory breaches.\n\nDetermining the amount of the provisions, which represent management's best estimate of the cost of settling these issues, requires the exercise of significant judgement and estimation. It will often be necessary to form a view on matters which are inherently uncertain, such as the scope of reviews required by regulators, and to estimate the number of future complaints, the extent to which they will be upheld, the average cost of redress and the impact of decisions reached by legal and other review processes that may be relevant to claims received. Consequently the continued appropriateness of the underlying assumptions is reviewed on a regular basis against actual experience and other relevant evidence and adjustments made to the provisions where appropriate.\n\n## Fair value of financial instruments\n\nKey estimates:\n\nInterest rate spreads, earning multiples and interest rate volatility\n\nAt 31 December 2020, the carrying value of the Group's financial instrument assets held at fair value was \u00a3248,385 million (2019: \u00a3234,467/uni00A0million), and its financial instrument liabilities held at fair value was \u00a349,959 million (2019: \u00a347,265 million).\n\nThe valuation techniques for level 3 financial instruments involve management judgement and estimates the extent of which depends on the complexity of the instrument and the availability of market observable information. In addition, in line with market practice, the Group applies credit, debit and funding valuation adjustments in determining the fair value of its uncollateralised derivative positions. A description of these adjustments is set out in note 48. Details about sensitivities to market risk arising from trading assets and other treasury positions can be found in the risk management section on page 159.\n\n## Recoverability of other intangible assets\n\nKey judgements:\n\nAssessing future trading conditions that could affect the Group's business operations\n\nAssessing whether certain of the Group's purchased brands have an indefinite life\n\nKey estimates:\n\nThe value-in-use calculations require management to estimate future cash flows, appropriate discount rates for those cash flows and long-term sustainable growth rates\n\nEstimated useful life of internally generated capitalised software\n\nAt 31 December 2020, the carrying value of the Group's other intangible assets was \u00a34,140 million (2019: \u00a33,808 million), including capitalised software enhancements of \u00a33,309 million (2019: \u00a32,907 million) and brands of \u00a3380 million (2019: \u00a3380 million).\n\nIn determining the estimated useful life of capitalised software enhancements, management consider the product's lifecycle and the Group's technology strategy; assets are reviewed annually to assess whether there is any indication of impairment and to confirm that the remaining estimated useful life is still appropriate. For the year ended 31 December 2020, the amortisation charge was \u00a3590 million/uni00A0and at 31 December 2020, the weighted-average remaining estimated useful life of the Group's capitalised software enhancements was 4.9 years (2019: 4.7 years). If the Group reduced by one year the estimated useful life of those assets with a remaining estimated useful life of more than two years at 31 December 2020, the 2021 amortisation charge would be approximately \u00a3175/uni00A0million higher.\n\nBrands arising from the acquisition of Bank of Scotland in 2009 are recognised on the Group's balance sheet and have been determined to have an indefinite useful life. The carrying value at 31 December 2020 was \u00a3380 million (2019: \u00a3380 million). The recoverable amount has been based on a value-in-use calculation. The calculation uses post-tax projections of the income generated by the brands, a discount rate of 9.31 per cent and a future growth rate of 2.5 per cent . Management estimates that if the growth rate were decreased by 1 per cent there would have been an impairment charge of \u00a350 million.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financialflstatements continued\n\n## Note 4: Segmental analysis\n\nLloyds Banking Group provides a wide range of banking and financial services in the UK and in certain locations overseas.\n\nThe Group Executive Committee (GEC) has been determined to be the chief operating decision maker for the Group. The Group's operating segments reflect its organisational and management structures. The GEC reviews the Group's internal reporting based around these segments in order to assess performance and allocate resources. GEC considers interest income and expense on a net basis and consequently the total interest income and expense for all reportable segments is presented net. The segments are differentiated by the type of products provided and by whether the customers are individuals or corporate entities.\n\nThe segmental results and comparatives are presented on an underlying basis, the basis reviewed by the chief operating decision maker. The effects of the following are excluded in arriving at underlying profit:\n\n- - market volatility and asset sales, including the effects of certain asset sales, the volatility relating to the Group's own debt and hedging arrangements and that arising in the insurance businesses;\n- - the unwind of acquisition-related fair value adjustments and the amortisation of purchased intangible assets;\n- - restructuring costs, principally comprising severance costs, the costs of integrating newly acquired businesses, the costs of regulatory reform and the rationalisation of the property portfolio; and\n- - payment protection insurance.\n\nFor the purposes of the underlying income statement, operating lease depreciation (net of gains on disposal of operating lease assets) is shown as an adjustment to total income.\n\nDuring 2020, the Group migrated certain customer relationships from the SME business within Commercial Banking to Business Banking within Retail; the Group has also revised its approach to internal funding charges, including the adoption of the Sterling Overnight Index Average (SONIA) interest rate benchmark in place of LIBOR. Comparatives have been restated accordingly.\n\nThe Group's activities are organised into three financial reporting segments: Retail; Commercial Banking; and Insurance and Wealth.\n\nRetail offers a broad range of financial service products, including current accounts, savings, mortgages, motor finance and unsecured consumer lending to personal and small business customers.\n\nCommercial Banking provides a range of products and services such as lending, transactional banking, working capital management, risk management and debt capital markets services to SMEs, corporates and financial institutions.\n\nInsurance and Wealth offers insurance, investment and wealth management products and services.\n\nIncome and expenditure not attributed to these financial reporting segments, including the costs of certain central and head office functions and the Group's private equity business, Lloyds Development Capital, is disclosed as Other.\n\nInter-segment services are generally recharged at cost, although some attract a margin. In particular a profit margin is charged on the internal commission arrangements between the UK branch and other distribution networks and the insurance product manufacturing businesses within the Group. Inter-segment lending and deposits are generally entered into at market rates, except that non-interest bearing balances are priced at a rate that reflects the external yield that could be earned on such funds.\n\nFor the majority of those derivative contracts entered into by business units for risk management purposes, the business unit recognises the net interest income or expense on an accrual accounting basis and transfers the remainder of the movement in the fair value of the derivative to the central function where the resulting accounting volatility is managed where possible through the establishment of hedge accounting relationships. Any change in fair value of the hedged instrument attributable to the hedged risk is also recorded within the central function. This allocation of the fair value of the derivative and change in fair value of the hedged instrument attributable to the hedged risk avoids accounting asymmetry in segmental results and leads to accounting volatility, which is managed centrally and reported within Other.",

Other services supplied pursuant to legislation relate primarily to costs incurred in connection with client asset assurance and with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requirements associated with the audit of the Group's financial statements filed on its Form 20-F.\n\nAudit related fees: This category includes fees in respect of services for assurance and related services that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of the financial statements, for example acting as reporting accountants in respect of debt prospectuses required by the listing rules.\n\nOther non-audit fees:/uni00A0 This category includes other assurance services not related to the performance of the audit or review of the financial statements, for example, the review of controls operated by the Group on behalf of a third party. The auditors are not engaged to provide tax services.\n\nIt is the Group's policy to use the auditors on assignments in cases where their knowledge of the Group means that it is neither efficient nor cost effective to employ another firm of accountants.\n\nThe Group has procedures that are designed to ensure auditor independence, including prohibiting certain non-audit services. All audit and non-audit assignments must be pre-approved by the audit committee on an individual engagement basis; for certain types of non-audit engagements where the fee is 'de minimis' the audit committee has pre-approved all assignments subject to confirmation by management. On a quarterly basis, the audit committee receives and reviews a report detailing all pre-approved services and amounts paid to the auditors for such pre-approved services.\n\nDuring the year, the auditors also earned fees payable by entities outside the consolidated Lloyds Banking Group in respect of the following:\n\n|                                                                                   |   2020 \u00a3m |   2019 \u00a3m |   2018 \u00a3m |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Audits of Group pension schemes                                                   |       0.1 |       0.1 |       0.1 |\n| Audits of the unconsolidated Open Ended Investment Companies managed by the Group |       0.4 |       0.4 |       0.3 |\n| Reviews of the financial position of corporate and other borrowers                |       1.4 |       0.2 |       0.4 |",

This also contains the impact on the impairment charge as a result of write-offs and recoveries, where the related loss allowances are reassessed to reflect ultimate realisable or recoverable value.\n\n## Additions (repayments)\n\nExpected loss allowances are recognised on origination of new loans or further drawdowns of existing facilities. Repayments relate to the reduction of loss allowances as a result of repayments of outstanding balances.\n\n## Methodology and model changes\n\nIncrease or decrease in impairment charge as a result of adjustments to the models used for expected credit loss calculations; either as changes to the model inputs or to the underlying assumptions, as well as the impact of changing the models used.\n\nMovements in the Group's impairment allowances are shown in note 18.",

The number of shares that could have been acquired at the annual average price of the Company's shares based on the monetary value of the subscription rights attached to outstanding share options and awards is determined.

To reduce credit risk the Group uses a variety of credit enhancement techniques such as netting and collateralisation, where security is provided against the exposure; a large proportion of the Group's derivatives are held through exchanges such as London Clearing House and are collateralised through those exchanges. Further details are provided in note 51 Credit risk.\n\nThe Group holds derivatives as part of the following strategies:\n\n- - Customer driven, where derivatives are held as part of the provision of risk management products to Group customers;\n- - To manage and hedge the Group's interest rate and foreign exchange risk arising from normal banking business. The hedge accounting strategy adopted by the Group is to utilise a combination of fair value and cash flow hedge approaches as described in note 51; and\n- - Derivatives held in policyholder funds as permitted by the investment strategies of those funds.\n\nThe principal derivatives used by the Group are as follows:\n\n- - Interest rate related contracts include interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements and options. An interest rate swap is an agreement between two parties to exchange fixed and floating interest payments, based upon interest rates defined in the contract, without the exchange of the underlying principal amounts. Forward rate agreements are contracts for the payment of the difference between a specified rate of interest and a reference rate, applied to a notional principal amount at a specific date in the future. An interest rate option gives the buyer, on payment of a premium, the right, but not the obligation, to fix the rate of interest on a future loan or deposit, for a specified period and commencing on a specified future date.\n- - Exchange rate related contracts include forward foreign exchange contracts, currency swaps and options. A forward foreign exchange contract is an agreement to buy or sell a specified amount of foreign currency on a specified future date at an agreed rate. Currency swaps generally involve the exchange of interest payment obligations denominated in different currencies; the exchange of principal can be notional or actual. A currency option gives the buyer, on payment of a premium, the right, but not the obligation, to sell specified amounts of currency at agreed rates of exchange on or before a specified future date.\n- - Credit derivatives, principally credit default swaps, are used by the Group as part of its trading activity and to manage its own exposure to credit risk. A credit default swap is a swap in which one counterparty receives a premium at pre-set intervals in consideration for guaranteeing to make a specific payment should a negative credit event take place.\n- - Equity derivatives are also used by the Group as part of its equity-based retail product activity to eliminate the Group's exposure to fluctuations in various international stock exchange indices. Index-linked equity options are purchased which give the Group the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a specified amount of equities, or basket of equities, in the form of published indices on or before a specified future date.",

The calculation uses pre-tax projections of future cash flows based upon budgets and plans approved by management covering a three-year period, the related run-off of existing business in-force and a discount rate of 10 per cent. The budgets and plans are based upon past experience adjusted to take into account anticipated changes in sales volumes, product mix and margins having regard to expected market conditions and competitor activity.

New business cash flows beyond the three-year period have been extrapolated using a steady/uni00A02 per cent growth rate which does not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the life assurance market. Management believes that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions above would not cause the recoverable amount of the goodwill relating to Scottish Widows to fall below its balance sheet carrying value.\n\nThe recoverable amount of the goodwill relating to Motor Finance has also been based on a value-in-use calculation using pre-tax cash flow projections based on financial budgets and plans approved by management covering a four-year period and a discount rate of 14 per cent. The cash flows beyond the four-year period are extrapolated using a growth rate of 0.5 per cent which does not exceed the long-term average growth rates for the markets in which Motor Finance participates. Management believes that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions above would not cause the recoverable amount of the goodwill relating to Motor Finance to fall below the balance sheet carrying value. The impairment charge of \u00a34 million related to the goodwill arising on a small, separable acquisition a number of years ago.\n\nThe recoverable amount of the goodwill relating to the Cards business has been based on a value-in-use calculation using pre-tax cash flow projections based on financial budgets and plans approved by management covering a five-year period and a discount rate of 13 per cent. The cash flows beyond the five year period assume no growth. Management believes that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions above would not cause the recoverable amount of the goodwill relating to the Cards business to fall below the balance sheet carrying value.\n\n## Note 23: Value of in-force business\n\n## Key assumptions\n\nThe impact of reasonably possible changes in the key assumptions made in respect of the Group's life insurance business, which include the impact on the value of in-force business, are disclosed in note 31.\n\nThe principal features of the methodology and process used for determining key assumptions used in the calculation of the value of in-force business are set out below:\n\n## Economic assumptions\n\nEach cash flow is valued using the discount rate consistent with that applied to such a cash flow in the capital markets. In practice, to achieve the same result, where the cash flows are either independent of or move linearly with market movements, a method has been applied known as the 'certainty equivalent' approach whereby it is assumed that all assets earn a risk-free rate and all cash flows are discounted at a risk-free rate. The certainty equivalent approach covers all investment assets relating to insurance and participating investment contracts, other than the annuity business (where an illiquidity premium is included, see below).\n\nA market-consistent approach has been adopted for the valuation of financial options and guarantees, using a stochastic option pricing technique calibrated to be consistent with the market price of relevant options at each valuation date. Further information on options and guarantees can be found in note 30.\n\nThe liabilities in respect of the Group's UK annuity business are matched by a portfolio of fixed interest securities, including a large proportion of corporate bonds and illiquid loan assets. The value of the in-force business asset for UK annuity business has been calculated after taking into account an estimate of the market premium for illiquidity in respect of corporate bond holdings and relevant illiquid loan assets. In determining the market premium for illiquidity, a range of inputs are considered which reflect actual asset allocation and relevant observable market data. The illiquidity premium is estimated to be 77 basis points at 31 December 2020 (31 December 2019: 91 basis points).\n\nThe risk-free rate is derived from the relevant swap curve with a deduction for credit risk.\n\nThe table below shows the resulting range of yields and other key assumptions at 31 December:\n\n|                                                           | 2020 %         | 2019 %       |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------------|--------------|\n| Risk-free rate (value of in-force non-annuity business) 1 | (0.36) to 3.75 | 0.00 to 3.90 |\n| Risk-free rate (value of in-force annuity business) 1     | 0.41 to 4.53   | 0.91 to 4.81 |\n| Risk-free rate (financial options and guarantees) 1       | (0.36) to 3.75 | 0.00 to 3.90 |\n| Retail price inflation                                    | 3.00           | 3.11         |\n| Expense inflation                                         | 3.30           | 3.41         |\n\n- 1 All risk-free rates are quoted as the range of rates implied by the relevant forward swap curve.\n\n## Non-market risk\n\nAn allowance for non-market risk is made through the choice of best estimate assumptions based upon experience, which generally will give the mean expected financial outcome for shareholders and hence no further allowance for non-market risk is required. However, in the case of operational risk, reinsurer default and the with-profit funds these can be asymmetric in the range of potential outcomes for which an explicit allowance is made.\n\n## Non-economic assumptions\n\nFuture mortality, morbidity, expenses, lapse and paid-up rate assumptions are reviewed each year and are based on an analysis of past experience and on management's view of future experience. Further information on these assumptions is given in note 30 and the effect of changes in key assumptions is given in note 31.",

The carrying value at 31 December 2020/uni00A0was \u00a3380 million/uni00A0(2019:/uni00A0\u00a3380 million). The Bank of Scotland name has been in existence for over 300 years and there are no indications that the brand should not have an indefinite useful life. The recoverable amount has been based on a value-in-use calculation. The calculation uses post-tax projections of the income generated by the brands, a discount rate of 9.31 per cent and a future growth rate of 2.5/uni00A0per cent. Management estimates that if the growth rate were decreased by 1 per cent there would have been an impairment charge of \u00a350 million.",

At the reporting date the Group had over-collateralised these programmes as set out in the table above to meet the terms of the programmes, to secure the rating of the covered bonds and to provide operational flexibility. From time-to-time, the obligations of the Group to provide collateral may increase due to the formal requirements of the programmes. The Group may also voluntarily contribute collateral to support the ratings of the covered bonds.\n\nThe Group recognises the full liabilities associated with its securitisation and covered bond programmes within debt securities in issue, although the obligations of the Group in respect of its securitisation issuances are limited to the cash flows generated from the underlying assets. The Group could be required to provide additional support to a number of the securitisation programmes to support the credit ratings of the debt securities issued, in the form of increased cash reserves and the holding of subordinated notes. Further, certain programmes contain contractual obligations that require the Group to repurchase assets should they become credit impaired or as otherwise required by the transaction documents.\n\nThe Group has not provided financial or other support by voluntarily offering to repurchase assets from any of its public securitisation programmes during 2020 (2019: none).",

The primary purpose of the conventional and unitised business written in the withprofit funds is to provide a smoothed investment vehicle to policyholders, protecting them against short-term market fluctuations. Payouts may be subject to a guaranteed minimum payout if certain policy conditions are met. With-profit policyholders are entitled to at least 90 per cent of the distributed profits, with the shareholders receiving the balance. The policyholders are also usually insured against death and the policy may carry a guaranteed annuity option at retirement.\n\n## (ii) Method of calculation of liabilities\n\nWith-profit liabilities are stated at their realistic value, the main components of which are:\n\n- - With-profit benefit reserve, the total asset shares for with-profit policies;\n- - Cost of options and guarantees (including guaranteed annuity options);\n- - Deductions levied against asset shares;\n- - Planned enhancements to with-profits benefits reserve; and\n- - Impact of the smoothing policy.",

The with-profit fund financial options and guarantees are valued using a stochastic simulation model where all assets are assumed to earn, on average, the risk-free yield and all cash flows are discounted using the risk-free yield. The risk-free yield is defined as the spot yield derived from the relevant swap curve, adjusted for credit risk. Further information on significant options and guarantees is given below.\n\n## Guaranteed annuity option take-up rates\n\nCertain pension contracts contain guaranteed annuity options that allow the policyholder to take an annuity benefit on retirement at annuity rates that were guaranteed at the outset of the contract. For contracts that contain such options, key assumptions in determining the cost of options are economic conditions in which the option has value, mortality rates and take up rates of other options. The financial impact is dependent on the value of corresponding investments, interest rates and longevity at the time of the claim.\n\n## Investment volatility\n\nThe calibration of the stochastic simulation model uses implied volatilities of derivatives where possible, or historical volatility where it is not possible to observe meaningful prices.\n\n## Mortality\n\nThe mortality assumptions, including allowances for improvements in longevity for annuitants, are set with regard to the Group's actual experience where this is significant, and relevant industry data otherwise.\n\n## Lapse rates (persistency)\n\nLapse rates refer to the rate of policy termination or the rate at which policyholders stop paying regular premiums due under the contract.\n\nHistorical persistency experience is analysed using statistical techniques. As experience can vary considerably between different product types and for contracts that have been in-force for different periods, the data is broken down into broadly homogenous groups for the purposes of this analysis.\n\nThe most recent experience is considered along with the results of previous analyses and management's views on future experience, taking into consideration potential changes in future experience that may result from guarantees and options becoming more valuable under adverse market conditions, in order to determine a 'best estimate' view of what persistency will be. In determining this best estimate view a number of factors are considered, including the credibility of the results (which will be affected by the volume of data available), any exceptional events that have occurred during the period under consideration, any known or expected trends in underlying data and relevant published market data.\n\n## (iv) Options and guarantees within the With-Profit Funds\n\nThe most significant options and guarantees provided from within the With-Profit Funds are in respect of guaranteed minimum cash benefits on death, maturity, retirement or certain policy anniversaries, and guaranteed annuity options on retirement for certain pension policies.\n\nFor those policies written in Scottish Widows pre-demutualisation containing potentially valuable options and guarantees, under the terms of the Scheme a separate memorandum account was set up, within the With-Profit Fund originally held in Scottish Widows plc and subsequently transferred into Scottish Widows Limited, called the Additional Account which is available, inter alia, to meet any additional costs of providing guaranteed benefits in respect of those policies. The Additional Account had a value at 31 December 2020 of \u00a32.5 billion (2019: \u00a32.6 billion). The eventual cost of providing benefits on policies written both pre and post demutualisation is dependent upon a large number of variables, including future interest rates and equity values, demographic factors, such as mortality, and the proportion of policyholders who seek to exercise their options. The ultimate cost will therefore not be known for many years.\n\nAs noted above, the liabilities of the With-Profit Funds are valued using a market-consistent stochastic simulation model which places a value on the options and guarantees which captures both their intrinsic value and their time value.\n\nThe most significant economic assumptions included in the model are risk-free yield and investment volatility.\n\n## Non-profit fund liabilities\n\n## (i) Business description\n\nThe Group principally writes the following types of life insurance contracts within its non-profit funds. Shareholder profits on these types of business arise from management fees and other policy charges.\n\n## Unit-linked business\n\nThis includes unit-linked pensions and unit-linked bonds, the primary purpose of which is to provide an investment vehicle where the policyholder is also insured against death.\n\n## Life insurance\n\nThe policyholder is insured against death or permanent disability, usually for predetermined amounts. Such business includes whole of life and term assurance and long-term creditor policies.\n\n## Annuities\n\nThe policyholder is entitled to payments for the duration of their life and is therefore insured against surviving longer than expected.\n\n## (ii) Method of calculation of liabilities\n\nThe non-profit fund liabilities are determined on the basis of recognised actuarial methods and involve estimating future policy cash flows over the duration of the in-force book of policies, and discounting the cash flows back to the valuation date allowing for probabilities of occurrence.",

        "page_content": "## (iii) Assumptions Note 30: Liabilities arising from insurance contracts and participating investment contracts continued\n\nGenerally, assumptions used to value non-profit fund liabilities are prudent in nature and therefore contain a margin for adverse deviation. This margin for adverse deviation is based on management's judgement and reflects management's views on the inherent level of uncertainty. In calculating the value of nonprofit fund liabilities, the impacts of COVID-19 that has also increased the level of uncertainty have been considered, in particular in relation to persistency and mortality. The key assumptions used in the measurement of non-profit fund liabilities are:\n\n## Interest rates\n\nThe rates of interest used are determined by reference to a number of factors including the redemption yields on fixed interest assets at the valuation date.\n\nMargins for risk are allowed for in the assumed interest rates, including reductions made to the available yields to allow for default risk based upon the credit rating of the securities allocated to the insurance liability.\n\n## Mortality and morbidity\n\nThe mortality and morbidity assumptions, including allowances for improvements in longevity for annuitants, are set with regard to the Group's actual experience where this provides a reliable basis, and relevant industry data otherwise, and include a margin for adverse deviation.\n\n## Lapse rates (persistency)\n\nLapse rates are allowed for on some non-profit fund contracts. The process for setting these rates is as described for with-profit liabilities, however a prudent scenario is assumed by the inclusion of a margin for adverse deviation within the non-profit fund liabilities.\n\n## Maintenance expenses\n\nAllowance is made for future policy costs explicitly. Expenses are determined by reference to an internal analysis of current and expected future costs plus a margin for adverse deviation. Explicit allowance is made for future expense inflation.\n\n## Key changes in assumptions\n\nA detailed review of the Group's assumptions in 2020/uni00A0resulted in a net loss of \u00a3151 million (2019: net gain of \u00a3336 million). The following were the key impacts on profit before tax:\n\n- - Change in persistency assumptions (\u00a374 million/uni00A0decrease (2019: \u00a367 million decrease)).\n- - Change in the assumption in respect of current and future mortality and morbidity rates (\u00a352 million/uni00A0increase (2019: \u00a3164 million increase)).\n- - Change in expenses assumptions (\u00a3124 million/uni00A0decrease (2019: \u00a3208 million/uni00A0increase)).\n\nThese amounts include the impacts of movements in liabilities and value of the in-force business in respect of insurance contracts and participating investment contracts.\n\n## (iv) Options and guarantees outside the With-Profit Funds\n\nA number of typical guarantees are provided outside the With-Profit Funds such as guaranteed payments on death (for example term assurance) or guaranteed income for life (e.g. annuities). In addition, certain personal pension policyholders in Scottish Widows, for whom reinstatement to their occupational pension scheme was not an option, have been given a guarantee that their pension and other benefits will correspond in value to the benefits of the relevant occupational pension scheme. The key assumptions affecting the ultimate value of the guarantee are future salary growth, gilt yields at retirement, annuitant mortality at retirement, marital status at retirement and future investment returns. There is currently a provision, calculated on a deterministic basis, of \u00a365 million (2019: \u00a364 million) in respect of those guarantees.\n\n## (2) Non-life insurance\n\nFor non-life insurance contracts, the methodology and assumptions used in relation to determining the bases of the earned premium and claims provisioning levels are derived for each individual underwritten product. Assumptions are intended to be neutral estimates of the most likely or expected outcome. There has been no significant change in the assumptions and methodologies used for setting reserves.\n\nThe movements in non-life insurance contract liabilities and reinsurance assets over the year have been as follows:\n\n|                                                                       | 2020 \u00a3m   | 2019 \u00a3m   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Provisions for unearned premiums                                      |           |           |\n| Gross provision at 1 January                                          | 333       | 342       |\n| Increase in the year                                                  | 655       | 663       |\n| Release in the year                                                   | (658)     | (672)     |\n| Change in provision for unearned premiums charged to income statement | (3)       | (9)       |\n| Gross provision at 31 December                                        | 330       | 333       |\n| Reinsurers' share                                                     | (14)      | (14)      |\n| Net provision at 31 December                                          | 316       | 319       |\n\nThese provisions represent the liability for short-term insurance contracts for which the Group's obligations are not expired at the year end.",

In practice this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some assumptions may be correlated. These amounts include movements in assets, liabilities and the value of the in-force business in respect of insurance contracts and participating investment contracts. The impact is shown in one direction but can be assumed to be reasonably symmetrical.\n\n|                                              |                     | 2020                                            | 2020                                | 2019                                            | 2019                                |\n|----------------------------------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n|                                              | Change in  variable | Increase  (reduction)  in profit  before tax \u00a3m | Increase  (reduction)  in equity \u00a3m | Increase  (reduction)  in profit  before tax \u00a3m | Increase  (reduction)  in equity \u00a3m |\n| Non-annuitant mortality and morbidity 1      | 5% reduction        | 16                                              | 13                                  | 19                                              | 16                                  |\n| Annuitant mortality 2                        | 5% reduction        | (333)                                           | (270)                               | (293)                                           | (243)                               |\n| Lapse rates 3                                | 10% reduction       | 70                                              | 57                                  | 107                                             | 89                                  |\n| Future maintenance and investment expenses 4 | 10% reduction       | 332                                             | 269                                 | 299                                             | 248                                 |\n| Risk-free rate 5                             | 0.25% reduction     | 37                                              | 30                                  | 33                                              | 28                                  |\n| Guaranteed annuity option take up 6          | 5% addition         | (2)                                             | (1)                                 | (1)                                             | (1)                                 |\n| Equity investment volatility 7               | 1% addition         | (2)                                             | (2)                                 | (2)                                             | (1)                                 |\n| Widening of credit default spreads 8         | 0.25% addition      | (467)                                           | (378)                               | (424)                                           | (352)                               |\n| Increase in illiquidity premia 9             | 0.10% addition      | 219                                             | 178                                 | 191                                             | 159                                 |\n\nAssumptions have been flexed on the basis used to calculate the value of in-force business and the realistic and statutory reserving bases.\n\n- 1  This sensitivity shows the impact of reducing mortality and morbidity rates on non-annuity business to 95 per cent of the expected rate.\n- 2  This sensitivity shows the impact on the annuity and deferred annuity business of reducing mortality rates to 95 per cent of the expected rate.\n- 3  This sensitivity shows the impact of reducing lapse and surrender rates to 90 per cent of the expected rate.\n- 4  This sensitivity shows the impact of reducing maintenance expenses and investment expenses to 90 per cent of the expected rate.\n- 5  This sensitivity shows the impact on the value of in-force business, financial options and guarantee costs, statutory reserves and asset values of reducing the risk-free rate by 25/uni00A0basis points.\n- 6  This sensitivity shows the impact of a flat 5 per cent addition to the expected rate.\n- 7  This sensitivity shows the impact of a flat 1 per cent addition to the expected rate.\n- 8  This sensitivity shows the impact of a 25 basis point increase in credit default spreads on corporate bonds and the corresponding reduction in market values.

All significant schemes are based in the UK, with the three most significant being the main sections of the Lloyds Bank Pension Scheme No. 1, the Lloyds Bank Pension Scheme No. 2 and the HBOS Final Salary Pension Scheme. At 31 December 2020, these schemes represented 94 per cent of the Group's total gross defined benefit pension assets (2019: 94 per cent). These schemes provide retirement benefits calculated as a percentage of final pensionable salary depending upon the length of service; the minimum retirement age under the rules of the schemes at 31 December 2020 is generally 55 although certain categories of member are deemed to have a contractual right to retire at 50.\n\nThe Group operates both funded and unfunded pension arrangements; the majority, including the three most significant schemes, are funded schemes in the UK. All of these UK funded schemes are operated as separate legal entities under trust law, are in compliance with the Pensions Act 2004 and are managed by a Trustee Board (the Trustee) whose role is to ensure that their Scheme is administered in accordance with the Scheme rules and relevant legislation, and to safeguard the assets in the best interests of all members and beneficiaries. The Trustee is solely responsible for setting investment policy and for agreeing funding requirements with the employer through the funding valuation process. The Board of Trustees must be composed of representatives of the Company and plan participants in accordance with the Scheme's regulations.\n\nA valuation to determine the funding status of each scheme is carried out at least every three years, whereby scheme assets are measured at market value and liabilities (technical provisions) are measured using prudent assumptions. If a deficit is identified a recovery plan is agreed between the employer and the scheme Trustee and sent to the Pensions Regulator for review. The Group has not provided for these deficit contributions as the future economic benefits arising from these contributions are expected to be available to the Group. The Group's overseas defined benefit pension schemes are subject to local regulatory arrangements.\n\nTerms have now been agreed in principle with the Trustee in respect of the most recent triennial funding valuations of the Group's three main defined benefit pension schemes. The valuations showed an aggregate ongoing funding deficit of approximately \u00a37.3 billion/uni00A0as at 31 December 2019 (a funding level of 85.7 per cent) compared to a \u00a37.3/uni00A0billion deficit at 31 December 2016 (a funding level of 85.9 per cent). The revised deficit now includes an allowance for the impact of RPI reform announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in November 2020. Under the old recovery plan deficit contributions of approximately \u00a30.8/uni00A0billion were paid in 2020 and \u00a31.3/uni00A0billion/uni00A0was committed from 2021 to 2024. Under the new recovery plan, \u00a30.8 billion/uni00A0plus a further 30 per cent of in-year capital distributions to ordinary shareholders, up to a limit on total deficit contributions of \u00a32.0 billion per annum, is payable from 2021 until this deficit has been removed. The deficit contributions are in addition to the regular contributions to meet benefits accruing over the year, and to cover the expenses of running the scheme. The Group expects to pay contributions of at least \u00a31.1 billion to its defined benefit schemes in 2021.\n\nDuring 2009, the Group made one-off contributions to the Lloyds Bank Pension Scheme No. 1 and Lloyds Bank Pension Scheme No. 2 in the form of interests in limited liability partnerships for each of the two schemes which hold assets to provide security for the Group's obligations to the two schemes. At 31 December 2020, the limited liability partnerships held assets of approximately \u00a36.7 billion. The limited liability partnerships are consolidated fully in the Group's balance sheet.\n\nThe Group has also established three private limited companies which hold assets to provide security for the Group's obligations to the HBOS Final Salary Pension Scheme, a section of the Lloyds Bank Pension Scheme No. 1 and the Lloyds Bank Offshore Pension Scheme. At 31 December 2020 these held assets of approximately \u00a34.7 billion in aggregate. The private limited companies are consolidated fully in the Group's balance sheet. The terms of these arrangements require the Group to maintain assets in these vehicles to agreed minimum values in order to secure obligations owed to the relevant Group pension schemes. The Group has satisfied this requirement during 2020.\n\nThe last funding valuations of other Group schemes were carried out on a number of different dates. In order to report the position under IAS 19 as at 31 December 2020 the most recent valuation results for all schemes have been updated by qualified independent actuaries. The funding valuations use a more prudent approach to setting the discount rate and more conservative longevity assumptions than the IAS 19 valuations.\n\nIn July 2018 a decision was sought from the High Court in respect of the requirement to equalise the Guaranteed Minimum Pension (GMP) benefits accrued between 1990 and 1997 from contracting out of the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme. In its judgment handed down on 26 October 2018 the High Court confirmed the requirement to treat men and women equally with respect to these benefits and a range of methods that the Trustee is entitled to adopt to achieve equalisation. The Group recognised a past service cost of \u00a3108 million in respect of equalisation in 2018 and, following agreement of the detailed implementation approach with the Trustee, a further \u00a333 million/uni00A0was recognised in 2019. A further hearing was held during 2020 which confirmed the extent of the Trustee's obligation to revisit past transfers out of the Schemes. The amount of any additional liability as a result of this judgment is still being reviewed but is not considered likely to be material.\n\n## (ii) Amounts in the financial statements\n\n|                                            | 2020 \u00a3m   | 2019 \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Amount included in the balance sheet       |           |           |\n| Present value of funded obligations        | (49,549)  | (45,241)  |\n| Fair value of scheme assets                | 51,127    | 45,791    |\n| Net amount recognised in the balance sheet | 1,578     | 550       |",

        "page_content": "## Note 34: Retirement benefit obligations continued\n\nOn 25 November 2020 the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced the outcome of a consultation into a reform of the calculation of RPI. It is now expected that from 2030 RPI will be aligned with CPIH (the Consumer Price Index including owner-occupiers' housing costs). To determine the RPI assumption a termdependent inflation curve has been used adjusting for an assumed inflation risk premium. In the period to 2030 a gap of 100 basis points has been assumed between RPI and CPI; thereafter no gap has been assumed.\n\n|                                                                        | 2020 Years   | 2019 Years   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Life expectancy for member aged 60, on the valuation date:             |              |              |\n| Men                                                                    | 27.0         | 27.5         |\n| Women                                                                  | 29.0         | 29.2         |\n| Life expectancy for member aged 60, 15 years after the valuation date: |              |              |\n| Men                                                                    | 28.1         | 28.5         |\n| Women                                                                  | 30.2         | 30.3         |\n\nThe mortality assumptions used in the UK scheme valuations are based on standard tables published by the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries which were adjusted in line with the actual experience of the relevant schemes. The table shows that a member retiring at age 60 at 31 December 2020 is assumed to live for, on average, 27.0 years for a male and 29.0 years for a female. In practice there will be much variation between individual members but these assumptions are expected to be appropriate across all members. It is assumed that younger members will live longer in retirement than those retiring now. This reflects the expectation that mortality rates will continue to fall over time as medical science and standards of living improve. To illustrate the degree of improvement assumed the table also shows the life expectancy for members aged 45 now, when they retire in 15 years' time at age 60. The Group has considered the impact of COVID-19 and whilst a higher number of deaths have been experienced in 2020, this does not have a material impact on the defined benefit obligation.\n\n## (v) Amount, timing and uncertainty of future cash flows\n\n## Risk exposure of the defined benefit schemes\n\nWhilst the Group is not exposed to any unusual, entity specific or scheme specific risks in its defined benefit pension schemes, it is exposed to a number of significant risks, detailed below:\n\nInflation rate risk:/uni00A0 the majority of the plans' benefit obligations are linked to inflation both in deferment and once in payment. Higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities although this will be materially offset by holdings of inflation-linked gilts and, in most cases, caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect against extreme inflation.\n\nInterest rate risk:/uni00A0 The defined benefit obligation is determined using a discount rate derived from yields on AA-rated corporate bonds. A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase plan liabilities although this will be materially offset by an increase in the value of bond holdings and through the use of derivatives.\n\nLongevity risk: /uni00A0The majority of the schemes obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the members so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the plans' liabilities.\n\nInvestment risk:/uni00A0 Scheme assets are invested in a diversified portfolio of debt securities, equities and other return-seeking assets. If the assets underperform the discount rate used to calculate the defined benefit obligation, it will reduce the surplus or increase the deficit. Volatility in asset values and the discount rate will lead to volatility in the net pension asset on the Group's balance sheet and in other comprehensive income. To a lesser extent this will also lead to volatility in the pension expense in the Group's income statement.\n\nThe ultimate cost of the defined benefit obligations to the Group will depend upon actual future events rather than the assumptions made. The assumptions made are unlikely to be borne out in practice and as such the cost may be higher or lower than expected.\n\n## Sensitivity analysis\n\nThe effect of reasonably possible changes in key assumptions on the value of scheme liabilities and the resulting pension charge in the Group's income statement and on the net defined benefit pension scheme asset, for the Group's three most significant schemes, is set out below. The sensitivities provided assume that all other assumptions and the value of the schemes' assets remain unchanged, and are not intended to represent changes that are at the extremes of possibility. The calculations are approximate in nature and full detailed calculations could lead to a different result. It is unlikely that isolated changes to individual assumptions will be experienced in practice. Due to the correlation of assumptions, aggregating the effects of these isolated changes may not be a reasonable estimate of the actual effect of simultaneous changes in multiple assumptions.\n\n|                                             | Effect of reasonably possible alternative assumptions   | Effect of reasonably possible alternative assumptions   | Effect of reasonably possible alternative assumptions                   | Effect of reasonably possible alternative assumptions                   |\n|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                             | Increase (decrease) in the income  statement charge     | Increase (decrease) in the income  statement charge     | (Increase) decrease in the net  defined benefit pension scheme  surplus | (Increase) decrease in the net  defined benefit pension scheme  surplus |\n|                                             | 2020 \u00a3m                                                 | 2019 \u00a3m                                                 | 2020 \u00a3m                                                                 | 2019 \u00a3m                                                                 |\n| Inflation (including pension increases) 1 : |                                                         |                                                         |                                                                         |                                                                         |\n| Increase of 0.1 per cent                    | 11                                                      | 12                                                      | 531                                                                     | 467                                                                     |\n| Decrease of 0.1 per cent                    | (11)                                                    | (12)                                                    | (522)                                                                   | (460)                                                                   |\n| Discount rate 2 :                           |                                                         |                                                         |                                                                         |                                                                         |\n| Increase of 0.1 per cent                    | (20)                                                    | (20)                                                    | (866)                                                                   | (763)                                                                   |\n| Decrease of 0.1 per cent                    | 19                                                      | 21                                                      | 890                                                                     | 784                                                                     |\n| Expected life expectancy of members:        |                                                         |                                                         |                                                                         |                                                                         |\n| Increase of one year                        | 39                                                      | 40                                                      | 2,146                                                                   | 1,636                                                                   |\n| Decrease of one year                        | (37)                                                    | (39)                                                    | (2,052)                                                                 | (1,575)                                                                 |\n\n- 1  At 31 December 2020, the assumed rate of RPI inflation is 2.80 per cent and CPI inflation 2.41 per cent (2019: RPI 2.94 per cent and CPI 1.99 per cent).\n\nFi\n\nn\n\na\n\nnc\n\ni\n\na\n\nl\n\nr\n\ne\n\nsu\n\nl\n\nt\n\ns",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financialflstatements continued\n\n## Note 34: Retirement benefit obligations continued\n\n## Sensitivity analysis method and assumptions\n\nThe sensitivity analysis above reflects the impact on the liabilities of the Group's three most significant schemes which account for over 90 per cent of the Group's defined benefit obligations. Whilst differences in the underlying liability profiles for the remainder of the Group's pension arrangements mean they may exhibit slightly different sensitivities to variations in these assumptions, the sensitivities provided above are indicative of the impact across the Group as a whole.\n\nThe inflation assumption sensitivity applies to both the assumed rate of increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Retail Price Index (RPI), and includes the impact on the rate of increases to pensions, both before and after retirement. These pension increases are linked to inflation (either CPI or RPI) subject to certain minimum and maximum limits.\n\nThe sensitivity analysis (including the inflation sensitivity) does not include the impact of any change in the rate of salary increases as pensionable salaries have been frozen since 2 April 2014.\n\nThe life expectancy assumption has been applied by allowing for an increase/decrease in life expectation from age 60 of one year, based upon the approximate weighted average age for each scheme. Whilst this is an approximate approach and will not give the same result as a one year increase in life expectancy at every age, it provides an appropriate indication of the potential impact on the schemes from changes in life expectancy.\n\nThere was no change in the methods and assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis from the prior year.\n\n## Asset-liability matching strategies\n\nThe main schemes' assets are invested in a diversified portfolio, consisting primarily of debt securities. The investment strategy is not static and will evolve to reflect the structure of liabilities within the schemes. Specific asset-liability matching strategies for each pension plan are independently determined by the responsible governance body for each scheme and in consultation with the employer.\n\nA significant goal of the asset-liability matching strategies adopted by Group schemes is to reduce volatility caused by changes in market expectations of interest rates and inflation. In the main schemes, this is achieved by investing scheme assets in bonds, primarily fixed interest gilts and index linked gilts, and by entering into interest rate and inflation swap arrangements. These investments are structured to take into account the profile of scheme liabilities and actively managed to reflect both changing market conditions and changes to the liability profile.\n\nOn 28 January 2020, the main schemes entered into a \u00a310 billion longevity insurance arrangement to hedge around 20 per cent of the schemes' exposure to unexpected increases in life expectancy. This arrangement forms part of the schemes' investment portfolio and will provide income to the schemes in the event that pensions are paid out for longer than expected. The transaction is structured as a pass-through with Scottish Widows as the insurer, and onwards reinsurance to Pacific Life Re Limited. The valuation of the swap was nil at inception and whilst there has been a slightly higher than expected number of deaths in the population covered by the arrangement, this has not had a material impact on the value of the swap.\n\nAt 31 December 2020 the asset-liability matching strategy mitigated around 105 per cent of the liability sensitivity to interest rate movements and around 100 per cent of the liability sensitivity to inflation movements. In addition a small amount of interest rate sensitivity arises through holdings of corporate and other debt securities.\n\n## Maturity profile of defined benefit obligation\n\nThe following table provides information on the weighted average duration of the defined benefit pension obligation and the distribution and timing of benefit payments:\n\n|                                                    | 2020 Years   | 2019 Years   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Duration of the defined benefit obligation         | 19           | 18           |\n|                                                    | 2020 \u00a3m      | 2019 \u00a3m      |\n| Maturity analysis of benefits expected to be paid: |              |              |\n| Within 12 months                                   | 1,293        | 1,274        |\n| Between 1 and 2 years                              | 1,350        | 1,373        |\n| Between 2 and 5 years                              | 4,347        | 4,455        |\n| Between 5 and 10 years                             | 8,301        | 8,426        |\n| Between 10 and 15 years                            | 9,093        | 9,229        |\n| Between 15 and 25 years                            | 17,485       | 17,400       |\n| Between 25 and 35 years                            | 13,479       | 13,999       |\n| Between 35 and 45 years                            | 7,162        | 8,291        |\n| In more than 45 years                              | 2,287        | 3,160        |\n\n## Maturity analysis method and assumptions\n\nThe projected benefit payments are based on the assumptions underlying the assessment of the obligations, including allowance for expected future inflation. They are shown in their undiscounted form and therefore appear large relative to the discounted assessment of the defined benefit obligations recognised in the Group's balance sheet. They are in respect of benefits that have been accrued prior to the respective year-end date only and make no allowance for any benefits that may have been accrued subsequently.\n\n## Defined contribution schemes\n\nThe Group operates a number of defined contribution pension schemes in the UK and overseas, principally Your Tomorrow and the defined contribution sections of the Lloyds Bank Pension Scheme No. 1.\n\nDuring the year ended 31 December 2020 the charge to the income statement in respect of defined contribution schemes was \u00a3319 million (2019: \u00a3287/uni00A0million; 2018: \u00a3300 million), representing the contributions payable by the employer in accordance with each scheme's rules.",

        "page_content": "## Note 34: Retirement benefit obligations continued\n\n## Other post-retirement benefit schemes\n\nThe Group operates a number of schemes which provide post-retirement healthcare benefits to certain employees, retired employees and their dependants. The principal scheme relates to former Lloyds Bank staff and under this scheme the Group has undertaken to meet the cost of post-retirement healthcare for all eligible former employees (and their dependants) who retired prior to 1 January 1996. The Group has entered into an insurance contract to provide these benefits and a provision has been made for the estimated cost of future insurance premiums payable.\n\nFor the principal post-retirement healthcare scheme, the latest actuarial valuation of the liability was carried out at 31 December 2020 by qualified independent actuaries. The principal assumptions used were as set out above, except that the rate of increase in healthcare premiums has been assumed at 6.40 per cent (2019: 6.54 per cent).\n\nMovements in the other post-retirement benefits obligation:\n\n|                                | 2020 \u00a3m   | 2019 \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| At 1 January                   | (126)     | (124)     |\n| Actuarial gains (losses)       | 16        | (6)       |\n| Insurance premiums paid        | 4         | 7         |\n| Charge for the year            | (3)       | (4)       |\n| Exchange and other adjustments | -         | 1         |\n| At 31 December                 | (109)     | (126)     |\n\n## Note 35: Deferred tax\n\nThe Group's deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:\n\n| Statutory position       | 2020 \u00a3m   | 2019 \u00a3m   | Tax disclosure           | 2020 \u00a3m   | 2019 \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------|-----------|-----------|--------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Deferred tax assets      | 2,741     | 2,666     | Deferred tax assets      | 5,527     | 4,938     |\n| Deferred tax liabilities | (45)      | (44)      | Deferred tax liabilities | (2,831)   | (2,316)   |\n| Asset at 31 December     | 2,696     | 2,622     | Asset at 31 December     | 2,696     | 2,622     |\n\nThe statutory position reflects the deferred tax assets and liabilities as disclosed in the consolidated balance sheet and takes into account the ability of the Group to net assets and liabilities where there is a legally enforceable right of offset. The tax disclosure of deferred tax assets and liabilities ties to the amounts outlined in the tables below which splits the deferred tax assets and liabilities by type, before such netting.\n\nAs a result of legislation enacted in 2016, the UK corporation tax rate had been expected to reduce from 19 per cent to 17 per cent on 1 April 2020. The Group measures its deferred tax assets and liabilities at the value expected to be recoverable or payable in future periods, and so at 31 December 2019 substantially all of its deferred tax was measured using the 17 per cent tax rate. During the December 2019 election campaign, however, the UK Government stated its intention to maintain the corporation tax rate at 19/uni00A0per cent, and this tax rate was substantively enacted on 17 March 2020. The Group therefore remeasured its deferred tax assets and liabilities at 19 per cent. The deferred tax impact of this remeasurement in 2020 is a credit of \u00a3350 million in the income statement and a charge of \u00a351/uni00A0million/uni00A0in other comprehensive income.\n\nOn 29 October 2018, the UK Government announced its intention to restrict the use of capital tax losses to 50 per cent of any future gains arising. This restriction was substantively enacted on 2 July 2020 and as a result the Group recognised additional deferred tax liabilities of \u00a363/uni00A0million, with an impact of \u00a347/uni00A0million/uni00A0as a prior year charge in the income statement and \u00a316 million in other comprehensive income, in respect of unrealised gains at that date.\n\nMovements in deferred tax liabilities and assets (before taking into consideration the offsetting of balances within the same taxing jurisdiction) can be summarised as follows:",

The deferred tax asset not recognised in respect of the remaining expenses is approximately \u00a3414 million (2019: \u00a3254/uni00A0million), and these expenses can be carried forward indefinitely. The unrecognised deferred tax asset has increased in 2020/uni00A0because, as UK markets performed poorly, there was a significant increase in the amount of expenses to carry forward.\n\nDeferred tax assets of approximately \u00a3114 million (2019: \u00a348 million) have not been recognised in respect of \u00a3582 million of UK tax losses and other temporary differences which can only be used to offset future capital gains. UK capital losses can be carried forward indefinitely.\n\nIn addition, no deferred tax asset is recognised in respect of unrelieved foreign tax credits of \u00a346 million (2019: \u00a346 million), as there are no expected future taxable profits against which the credits can be utilised. These credits can be carried forward indefinitely.\n\nNo deferred tax has been recognised in respect of foreign trade losses where it is not more likely than not that we will be able to utilise them in future periods. Of the asset not recognised, \u00a341 million (2019: \u00a335 million) relates to losses that will expire if not used within 20 years, and \u00a348/uni00A0million (2019: \u00a345/uni00A0million) relates to losses with no expiry date.\n\nAs a result of parent company exemptions on dividends from subsidiaries and on capital gains on disposal there are no significant taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, branches, associates and joint arrangements.\n\n## Note 36: Other provisions\n\n|                                | Provisions  for financial  commitments  and guarantees \u00a3m   | Payment  protection  insurance \u00a3m   | Other  regulatory  provisions \u00a3m   | Other \u00a3m   | Total \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| At 1 January 2020              | 177                                                         | 1,880                               | 528                                | 738        | 3,323      |\n| Exchange and other adjustments | (7)                                                         | -                                   | 11                                 | (9)        | (5)        |\n| Provisions applied             | -                                                           | (1,703)                             | (538)                              | (198)      | (2,439)    |\n| Charge for the year            | 289                                                         | 85                                  | 379                                | 283        | 1,036      |\n| At 31 December 2020            | 459                                                         | 262                                 | 380                                | 814        | 1,915      |",

        "page_content": "## Note 36: Other provisions continued\n\n## Provisions for financial commitments and guarantees\n\nProvisions are recognised for expected credit losses on undrawn loan commitments and financial guarantees. See also note 18.\n\n## Payment protection insurance (excluding MBNA)\n\nThe/uni00A0Group has made provisions for PPI costs totalling \u00a321,960 million; of which \u00a385 million/uni00A0was/uni00A0recognised in the final quarter of the year ended 31 December 2020. Of the approximately six/uni00A0million enquiries received pre-deadline, more than 99 per cent have now been processed. The \u00a385/uni00A0million/uni00A0charge in the fourth quarter was driven by the impact of coronavirus delaying operational activities during 2020, the final stages of work to ensure operational completeness ahead of an orderly programme close and final validation of information requests and complaints with third parties that resulted in a limited number of additional complaints to be handled./uni00A0A small part of the costs incurred during the year also reflect the costs associated with litigation activity to date.\n\nAt 31 December 2020, a provision of \u00a3201 million remained unutilised relating to complaints and associated administration costs excluding amounts relating to MBNA. Total cash payments were \u00a31,462 million during the year ended/uni00A031 December 2020.\n\n## Payment protection insurance (MBNA)\n\nAs announced in December 2016, the Group's exposure continues to remain capped at \u00a3240 million under the terms of the MBNA sale and purchase agreement. No additional charge has been made by MBNA to its PPI provision in the year ended 31 December 2020; total cash payments in the year were \u00a3241 million and the remaining provision at 31 December 2020 was \u00a361 million (31 December 2019: \u00a3302 million).\n\n## Other provisions for legal actions and regulatory matters\n\nIn the course of its business, the Group is engaged in discussions with the PRA, FCA and other UK and overseas regulators and other governmental authorities on a range of matters. The Group also receives complaints in connection with its past conduct and claims brought by or on behalf of current and former employees, customers, investors and other third parties and is subject to legal proceedings and other legal actions. Where significant, provisions are held against the costs expected to be incurred in relation to these matters and matters arising from related internal reviews. During the year ended 31 December 2020 the Group charged a further \u00a3379 million in respect of legal actions and other regulatory matters, and the unutilised balance at 31 December 2020 was \u00a3380 million (31 December 2019: \u00a3528 million). The most significant items are as follows.\n\n## HBOS Reading - review\n\nThe Group completed its compensation assessment for those within the Customer Review in 2019 with more than \u00a3109/uni00A0million of compensation paid, in addition to \u00a315 million for ex-gratia payments and \u00a36 million for the reimbursement of legal fees. The Group is applying the recommendations from Sir Ross Cranston's review, issued in December 2019, including a reassessment of direct and consequential losses by an independent panel, an extension of debt relief and a wider definition of de facto directors. Further details of the panel were announced on 3 April 2020 and the panel's full scope and methodology was published on 7 July 2020. The panel's stated objective is to consider cases via a non-legalistic and fair process, and to make their decisions in a generous, fair and common-sense manner. Details of an appeal process for the further assessments of debt relief and de facto director status have also been announced./uni00A0The Group continues to make progress on its assessment of claims for further debt relief and de facto director status, completing preliminary assessments for 98 per cent of claims on both debt relief and de facto directors. As part of these activities the Group has recorded charges in relation to compensation payments and associated costs (projected to the fourth quarter of 2021) in 2020 in applying the recommendations, in respect of debt relief and de facto director status. During 2021, decisions from the independent panel re-review on direct and consequential losses will start to be issued, which is likely to result in further charges but it is not possible to estimate the potential impact at this stage. The Group is committed to implementing Sir Ross' recommendations in full.\n\nThe Dame Linda Dobbs review, which is considering the Group's handling of HBOS Reading between January 2009 and January 2017, is now expected to complete towards the end of 2021. The cost of undertaking the review is included in the revised provision.\n\nThe 2020 charge of \u00a3159 million, and lifetime cost of \u00a3435 million, includes both compensation payments and operational costs.\n\n## Arrears handling related activities\n\nThe Group has provided an additional \u00a335 million in the year ended 31 December 2020 for arrears handling related activities, bringing the total provided to date to \u00a31,016 million; the unutilised balance at 31 December 2020 was \u00a362 million.\n\n## Customer claims in relation to insurance branch business in Germany\n\nThe Group continues to receive claims from customers in Germany relating to policies issued by Clerical Medical Investment Group Limited (subsequently renamed Scottish Widows Limited), with smaller numbers of claims received from customers in Austria and Italy. The German industry-wide issue regarding notification of contractual 'cooling off' periods continued to lead to a similar number of claims in 2020 as 2019. The total provision made to 31 December 2020/uni00A0was \u00a3674 million/uni00A0(31 December 2019: \u00a3656 million); utilisation of the provision was \u00a328 million in the year ended 31 December 2020 (2019: \u00a328 million); the remaining unutilised provision as at 31 December 2020/uni00A0was \u00a393 million (31 December 2019: \u00a3101/uni00A0million). The ultimate financial effect, which could be significantly different from the current provision, will be known only once all relevant claims have been resolved.\n\n## Other\n\nFollowing the sale of TSB Banking Group plc, the Group raised a provision of \u00a3665 million in relation to various ongoing commitments; \u00a3111/uni00A0million of this provision remained unutilised at 31 December 2020.\n\nProvisions are made for staff and other costs related to Group restructuring initiatives at the point at which the Group becomes committed to the expenditure. At 31 December 2020 provisions of \u00a3198 million (31 December 2019: \u00a3129 million) were held.\n\nThe Group carries provisions of \u00a3112 million (2019: \u00a3118 million) for indemnities and other matters relating to legacy business disposals in prior years.",

The subordination of specific subordinated liabilities is determined in respect of the issuer and any guarantors of that liability. The claims of holders of preference shares and preferred securities are generally junior to those of the holders of undated subordinated liabilities, which in turn are junior to the claims of holders of the dated subordinated liabilities. The Group has not had any defaults of principal, interest or other breaches with respect to its subordinated liabilities during 2020 (2019:/uni00A0none).\n\n## Note 38: Share capital\n\n## (1) Authorised share capital\n\nAs permitted by the Companies Act 2006, the Company removed references to authorised share capital from its articles of association at the annual general meeting on 5 June 2009. This change took effect from 1 October 2009.\n\n## (2) Issued and fully paid share capital\n\n|                                            | 2020 Number of shares   | 2019 Number of shares   | 2018 Number of shares   | 2020 \u00a3m   | 2019 \u00a3m   | 2018 \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Ordinary shares of 10p (formerly 25p) each |                         |                         |                         |           |           |           |\n| At 1 January                               | 70,052,557,838          | 71,163,592,264          | 71,972,949,589          | 7,005     | 7,116     | 7,197     |\n| Issued under employee share schemes        | 786,648,222             | 775,882,951             | 768,551,098             | 79        | 78        | 77        |\n| Share buyback programme                    | -                       | (1,886,917,377)         | (1,577,908,423)         | -         | (189)     | (158)     |\n| At 31 December                             | 70,839,206,060          | 70,052,557,838          | 71,163,592,264          | 7,084     | 7,005     | 7,116     |\n\n## Share issuances\n\nIn 2020, 787 million shares (2019:/uni00A0776 million shares; 2018:/uni00A0769 million shares) were issued in respect of employee share schemes.\n\n## (3) Share capital and control\n\nThere are no restrictions on the transfer of shares in the Company other than as set out in the articles of association and:\n\n- - certain restrictions which may from time to time be imposed by law and regulations (for example, insider trading laws);\n- - where directors and certain employees of the Company require the approval of the Company to deal in the Company's shares; and\n- - pursuant to the rules of some of the Company's employee share plans where certain restrictions may apply while the shares are subject to the plans.\n\nWhere, under an employee share plan operated by the Company, participants are the beneficial owners of shares but not the registered owners, the voting rights are normally exercised by the registered owner at the direction of the participant. Outstanding awards and options would normally vest and become exercisable on a change of control, subject to the satisfaction of any performance conditions at that time.\n\nIn addition, the Company is not aware of any agreements between shareholders that may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities and/or voting rights. Information regarding significant direct or indirect holdings of shares in the Company can be found on page 112.\n\nThe directors have authority to allot and issue ordinary and preference shares and to make market purchases of ordinary and preference shares as granted at the annual general meeting on 21 May 2020. The authority to issue shares and the authority to make market purchases of shares will expire at the next annual general meeting. Shareholders will be asked, at the annual general meeting, to give similar authorities.\n\nSubject to any rights or restrictions attached to any shares, on a show of hands at a general meeting of the Company every holder of shares present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote has one vote and on a poll every member present and entitled to vote has one vote for every share held.\n\nFurther details regarding voting at the annual general meeting can be found in the notes to the notice of the annual general meeting.\n\n## Ordinary shares\n\nThe holders of ordinary shares, who held 100 per cent of the total ordinary share capital at 31 December 2020, are entitled to receive the Company's report and accounts, attend, speak and vote at general meetings and appoint proxies to exercise voting rights. Holders of ordinary shares may also receive a dividend (subject to the provisions of the Company's articles of association) and on a winding up may share in the assets of the Company.\n\n## Preference shares\n\nThe Company has in issue various classes of preference shares which are all classified as liabilities under accounting standards and which are included in note 37.\n\n## Note 39: Share premium account\n\n|                                     | 2020 \u00a3m   | 2019 \u00a3m   | 2018 \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| At 1 January                        | 17,751    | 17,719    | 17,634    |\n| Issued under employee share schemes | 112       | 29        | 85        |\n| Redemption of preference shares 1   | -         | 3         | -         |\n| At 31 December                      | 17,863    | 17,751    | 17,719    |",

or in the case of financial assets obtained on acquisitions of businesses, since the date of acquisition.\n\nThe cash flow hedging reserve represents the cumulative after-tax gains and losses on effective cash flow hedging instruments that will be reclassified to the income statement in the periods in which the hedged item affects profit or loss.\n\nThe foreign currency translation reserve represents the cumulative after-tax gains and losses on the translation of foreign operations and exchange differences arising on financial instruments designated as hedges of the Group's net investment in foreign operations.\n\nMovements in other reserves were as follows:\n\n|                                                                                                          | 2020 \u00a3m   | 2019 \u00a3m   | 2018 \u00a3m   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Merger reserve                                                                                           |           |           |           |\n| At 1 January                                                                                             | 7,763     | 7,766     | 7,766     |\n| Redemption of preference shares (note 39)                                                                | -         | (3)       | -         |\n| At 31 December                                                                                           | 7,763     | 7,763     | 7,766     |\n|                                                                                                          | 2020 \u00a3m   | 2019 \u00a3m   | 2018 \u00a3m   |\n| Capital redemption reserve                                                                               |           |           |           |\n| At 1 January                                                                                             | 4,462     | 4,273     | 4,115     |\n| Shares cancelled under share buyback programmes                                                          | -         | 189       | 158       |\n| At 31 December                                                                                           | 4,462     | 4,462     | 4,273     |\n|                                                                                                          | 2020 \u00a3m   | 2019 \u00a3m   | 2018 \u00a3m   |\n| Revaluation reserve in respect of debt securities held at fair value through other  comprehensive income |           |           |           |\n| At 1 January                                                                                             | 123       | 279       | 472       |\n| Change in fair value                                                                                     | 46        | (30)      | (37)      |\n| Deferred tax                                                                                             | 29        | 10        | 35        |\n| Current tax                                                                                              | (2)       | -         | -         |\n|                                                                                                          | 73        | (20)      | (2)       |\n| Income statement transfers in respect of disposals (note 9)                                              | (149)     | (196)     | (275)     |\n| Deferred tax                                                                                             | 47        | 61        | 84        |\n|                                                                                                          | (102)     | (135)     | (191)     |\n| Impairment recognised in the income statement At 31 December                                             | 5         | (1)       | -         |\n|                                                                                                          | 99        | 123       | 279       |",

This decision was taken by the Board at the specific request of the regulator, the PRA, in line with all other major UK listed banks, as a result of the developing coronavirus crisis.\n\nThe financial statements do not reflect recommended dividends.\n\nDividends paid during the year were as follows:\n\n|                                                              | 2020 pence  per share   |   2019 pence  per share |   2018 pence  per share | 2020 \u00a3m   | 2019 \u00a3m   | 2018 \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Final dividend recommended by directors at previous year end | -                       |                    2.14 |                    2.05 | -         | 1,523     | 1,475     |\n| Interim dividend paid in the year                            | -                       |                    1.12 |                    1.07 | -         | 789       | 765       |\n|                                                              | -                       |                    3.26 |                    3.12 | -         | 2,312     | 2,240     |\n\nThe trustees of the following holdings of Lloyds Banking Group plc shares in relation to employee share schemes retain the right to receive dividends but have chosen to waive their entitlement to the dividends on those shares as indicated: the Lloyds Banking Group Share Incentive Plan (holding at 31 December 2020: 3,990,862 shares, 31 December 2019: 6,508,529 shares, waived rights to all dividends), the HBOS Share Incentive Plan Trust (holding at 31 December 2020: nil, 31 December 2019: 445,625 shares, waived rights to all dividends), the Lloyds Banking Group Employee Share Ownership Trust (holding at 31 December 2020: 20,540,083 shares, 31 December 2019: 11,656,155 shares, waived rights to all dividends).\n\n## Note 44: Share-based payments\n\n## Charge to the income statement\n\nThe charge to the income statement is set out below:\n\n|                                      | 2020 \u00a3m   | 2019 \u00a3m   | 2018 \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Deferred bonus plan                  | 81        | 261       | 325       |\n| Executive and SAYE plans:            |           |           |           |\n| Options granted in the year          | 13        | 16        | 14        |\n| Options granted in prior years       | 62        | 59        | 71        |\n|                                      | 75        | 75        | 85        |\n| Share plans:                         |           |           |           |\n| Shares granted in the year           | 16        | 17        | 16        |\n| Shares granted in prior years        | 24        | 20        | 17        |\n|                                      | 40        | 37        | 33        |\n| Total charge to the income statement | 196       | 373       | 443       |\n\nDuring the year ended 31 December 2020 the Group operated the following share-based payment schemes, all of which are equity settled.\n\n## Group Performance Share plan\n\nThe Group operates a Group Performance Share plan that is equity settled.

The expected volatility is estimated based on the historical volatility of the closing daily share price over the most recent period that is commensurate with the expected life of the option. The historical volatility is compared to the implied volatility generated from market traded options in the Group's shares to assess the reasonableness of the historical volatility and adjustments made where appropriate.\n\n## Share Incentive Plan\n\n## Free Shares\n\nAn award of shares may be made annually to employees up to a maximum of \u00a33,600. The shares awarded are held in trust for a mandatory period of three years on the employee's behalf, during which period the employee is entitled to any dividends paid on such shares. The award is subject to a non-market based condition. If an employee leaves the Group within this three year period for other than a 'good' reason, all of the shares awarded will be forfeited.\n\nOn 20 May 2020, the Group made an award of \u00a3200 (2019: \u00a3200) of shares to all eligible employees.

The award is subject to a non-market based condition: if an employee leaves within this three year period for other than a 'good' reason, all of the matching shares are forfeited. Similarly if the employees sell their purchased shares within three years, their matching shares are forfeited.\n\nThe number of shares awarded relating to matching shares in 2020 was 62,262,140 (2019: 37,346,812), with an average fair value of \u00a30.34 (2019: \u00a30.56), based on market prices at the date of award.\n\n## Fixed share awards\n\nFixed share awards were introduced in 2014 in order to ensure that total fixed remuneration is commensurate with role and to provide a competitive reward package for certain Lloyds Banking Group employees, with an appropriate balance of fixed and variable remuneration, in line with regulatory requirements. The fixed share awards are delivered in Lloyds Banking Group shares, released over five years with 20 per cent being released each year following the year of award. From June 2020, the fixed share awards are released over three years with one third being released each year following the year of award. The number of shares purchased in 2020 was 13,975,993 (2019: 8,239,332).\n\nThe fixed share award is not subject to any performance conditions, performance adjustment or clawback. On an employee leaving the Group, there is no change to the timeline for which shares will become unrestricted.",

In accordance with IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements , transactions and balances with subsidiaries have been eliminated on consolidation.\n\n## Pension funds\n\nThe Group provides banking and some investment management services to certain of its pension funds. At 31 December 2020, customer deposits of \u00a3151/uni00A0million (2019: \u00a3169 million) and investment and insurance contract liabilities of \u00a3152 million/uni00A0(2019: \u00a3127 million) related to the Group's pension funds. As disclosed in note 34, the Group's main pension funds have entered into a longevity insurance arrangement that was structured as a pass-through involving Scottish Widows.\n\n## Collective investment vehicles\n\nThe Group manages 137 (2019: 141) collective investment vehicles, such as Open Ended Investment Companies (OEICs) and of these 76 (2019: 75) are consolidated. The Group invested \u00a3659 million (2019: \u00a3804 million) and redeemed \u00a31,159 million (2019: \u00a31,771 million) in the unconsolidated collective investment vehicles during the year and had investments, at fair value, of \u00a32,234 million (2019: \u00a33,417 million) at 31 December. The Group earned fees of \u00a393/uni00A0million from the unconsolidated collective investment vehicles during 2020 (2019: \u00a3127 million).\n\n## Joint ventures and associates\n\nAt 31 December 2020 there were loans and advances to customers of \u00a328 million (2019: \u00a375 million) outstanding and balances within customer deposits of \u00a373/uni00A0million (2019: \u00a35 million) relating to joint ventures and associates.\n\nDuring the year the Group paid fees of \u00a37 million (2019: \u00a32 million) to its Schroders Personal Wealth joint venture and also made a payment of \u00a320 million under the terms of an Operating Margin Guarantee put in place as part of the agreements for the establishment of the joint venture.\n\nIn addition to the above balances, the Group has a number of other associates held by its venture capital business that it accounts for at fair value through profit or loss. At 31 December 2020, these companies had total assets of approximately \u00a34,387 million (2019: \u00a34,761 million), total liabilities of approximately \u00a34,928 million (2019: \u00a35,322 million) and for the year ended 31 December 2020 had turnover of approximately \u00a33,857/uni00A0million (2019: \u00a34,286 million) and made a net loss of approximately \u00a3435 million (2019: net loss of \u00a3190 million). In addition, the Group has provided \u00a31,295 million (2019: \u00a31,266 million) of financing to these companies on which it received \u00a391 million (2019: \u00a386 million) of interest income in the year.\n\n## Note 46: Contingent liabilities, commitments and guarantees\n\n## Interchange fees\n\nWith respect to multi-lateral interchange fees (MIFs), the Group is not involved in the ongoing litigation which involves card schemes such as Visa and Mastercard (as described below). However, the Group is a member/licensee of Visa and Mastercard and other card schemes. The litigation in question is as follows:\n\n- - litigation brought by retailers against both Visa and Mastercard continues in the English Courts (and includes a judgment of the Supreme Court in June 2020 upholding the Court of Appeal's finding in 2018 that historic interchange arrangements of Mastercard and Visa infringed competition law); and\n- - litigation brought on behalf of UK consumers in the English Courts against Mastercard, which the Supreme Court has now confirmed can proceed.\n\nAny impact on the Group of the litigation against Visa and Mastercard remains uncertain at this time, such that it is not practicable for the Group to provide an estimate of any potential financial effect. Insofar as Visa is required to pay damages to retailers for interchange fees set prior to June 2016, contractual arrangements to allocate liability have been agreed between various UK banks (including the Group) and Visa Inc, as part of Visa Inc's acquisition of Visa Europe in 2016. These arrangements cap the maximum amount of liability to which the Group may be subject and this cap is set at the cash consideration received by the Group for the sale of its stake in Visa Europe to Visa Inc in 2016. In 2016, the Group received Visa preference stock as part of the consideration for the sale of its shares in Visa Europe. In 2020, some of these Visa preference shares were converted into Visa Inc Class A common stock (in accordance with the provisions of the Visa Europe sale documentation) and they were subsequently sold by the Group. The sale had no impact on this contingent liability./uni00A0\n\n## LIBOR and other trading rates\n\nCertain Group companies, together with other panel banks, have been named as defendants in private lawsuits, including purported class action suits, in the US in connection with their roles as panel banks contributing to the setting of US Dollar, Japanese Yen and Sterling London Interbank Offered Rate and the Australian BBSW reference rate. Certain of the plaintiffs' claims have been dismissed by the US Federal Court for the Southern District of New York (subject to appeals).\n\nCertain Group companies are also named as defendants in (i) UK based claims; and (ii) two Dutch class actions, raising LIBOR manipulation allegations. A number of the claims against the Group in relation to the alleged mis-sale of interest rate hedging products also include allegations of LIBOR manipulation.\n\nFurthermore, the Swiss Competition Commission concluded its investigation against Lloyds Bank plc in June 2019. However, the Group continues to respond to litigation arising out of the investigations into submissions made by panel members to the bodies that set LIBOR and various other interbank offered rates.\n\nIt is currently not possible to predict the scope and ultimate outcome on the Group of the various outstanding regulatory investigations not encompassed by the settlements, any private lawsuits or any related challenges to the interpretation or validity of any of the Group's contractual arrangements, including their timing and scale. As such, it is not practicable to provide an estimate of any potential financial effect.\n\n## Tax authorities\n\nThe Group has an open matter in relation to a claim for group relief of losses incurred in its former Irish banking subsidiary, which ceased trading on 31 December 2010. In 2013, HMRC informed the Group that its interpretation of the UK rules means that the group relief is not available. In 2020, HMRC concluded their enquiry into the matter and issued a closure notice. The Group's interpretation of the UK rules has not changed and hence it has appealed to the First Tier Tax Tribunal, with a hearing expected in early 2022. If the final determination of the matter by the judicial process is that HMRC's position is correct, management estimate that this would result in an increase in current tax liabilities of approximately \u00a3810 million/uni00A0(including interest) and a reduction in the Group's deferred tax asset of approximately \u00a3270 million. The Group, having taken appropriate advice, does not consider that this is a case where additional tax will ultimately fall due.",

All material such matters are periodically reassessed, with the assistance of external professional advisers where appropriate, to determine the likelihood of the Group incurring a liability. In those instances where it is concluded that it is more likely than not that a payment will be made, a provision is established to management's best estimate of the amount required at the relevant balance sheet date. In some cases it will not be possible to form a view, for example because the facts are unclear or because further time is needed properly to assess the merits of the case, and no provisions are held in relation to such matters. In these circumstances, specific disclosure in relation to a contingent liability will be made where material. However the Group does not currently expect the final outcome of any such case to have a material adverse effect on its financial position, operations or cash flows.\n\n## Contingent liabilities, commitments and guarantees arising from the banking business\n\n|                                                                                             | 2020 \u00a3m   | 2019 \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Contingent liabilities                                                                      |           |           |\n| Acceptances and endorsements                                                                | 131       | 74        |\n| Other:                                                                                      |           |           |\n| Other items serving as direct credit substitutes                                            | 317       | 366       |\n| Performance bonds, including letters of credit, and other transaction-related contingencies | 2,105     | 2,454     |\n|                                                                                             | 2,422     | 2,820     |\n| Total contingent liabilities                                                                | 2,553     | 2,894     |\n\nThe contingent liabilities of the Group arise in the normal course of its banking business and it is not practicable to quantify their future financial effect.\n\n|                                                                                | 2020 \u00a3m   | 2019 \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Commitments and guarantees                                                     |           |           |\n| Documentary credits and other short-term trade-related transactions            | 1         | -         |\n| Forward asset purchases and forward deposits placed                            | 127       | 189       |\n| Undrawn formal standby facilities, credit lines and other commitments to lend: |           |           |\n| Less than 1 year original maturity:                                            |           |           |\n| Mortgage offers made                                                           | 20,179    | 12,684    |\n| Other commitments and guarantees                                               | 89,269    | 85,735    |\n|                                                                                | 109,448   | 98,419    |\n| 1 year or over original maturity                                               | 38,299    | 34,945    |\n| Total commitments and guarantees                                               | 147,875   | 133,553   |\n\nOf the amounts shown above in respect of undrawn formal standby facilities, credit lines and other commitments to lend, \u00a373,962 million (2019: \u00a363,504/uni00A0million) was irrevocable.\n\n## Capital commitments\n\nExcluding commitments in respect of investment property (note 25), capital expenditure contracted but not provided for at 31 December 2020/uni00A0amounted to/uni00A0\u00a3501 million (2019: \u00a3405 million).

Details of the Group's interests in consolidated structured entities are set out in note 29 for securitisations and covered bond vehicles, note 34 for structured entities associated with the Group's pension schemes, and below in part (A) and (B). Details of the Group's interests in unconsolidated structured entities are included below in part (C).\n\n## (A) Asset-backed conduits\n\nIn addition to the structured entities discussed in note 29, which are used for securitisation and covered bond programmes, the Group sponsors an active asset-backed conduit, Cancara, which invests in client receivables and debt securities. The total consolidated exposure of Cancara at 31 December 2020 was \u00a32,490 million (2019: \u00a33,735 million), comprising \u00a31,695 million of loans and advances (2019: \u00a33,670 million) and \u00a3795/uni00A0million of debt securities (2019: \u00a365/uni00A0million).\n\nAll lending assets and debt securities held by the Group in Cancara are restricted in use, as they are held by the collateral agent for the benefit of the commercial paper investors and the liquidity providers only. The Group provides liquidity facilities to Cancara under terms that are usual and customary for standard lending activities in the normal course of the Group's banking activities. During 2020 there have continued to be planned drawdowns on certain liquidity facilities for balance sheet management purposes, supporting the programme to provide funding alongside the proceeds of the asset-backed commercial paper issuance. The Group could be asked to provide support under the contractual terms of these arrangements including, for example, if Cancara experienced a shortfall in external funding, which may occur in the event of market disruption.\n\nThe external assets in Cancara are consolidated in the Group's financial statements.\n\n## (B) Consolidated collective investment vehicles and limited partnerships\n\nThe assets of the Insurance business held in consolidated collective investment vehicles, such as Open-Ended Investment Companies and limited partnerships, are not directly available for use by the Group. However, the Group's investment in the majority of these collective investment vehicles is readily realisable. As at 31 December 2020, the total carrying value of these consolidated collective investment vehicle assets and liabilities held by the Group was \u00a357,430 million (2019: \u00a368,724 million).\n\nThe Group has no contractual arrangements (such as liquidity facilities) that would require it to provide financial or other support to the consolidated collective investment vehicles; the Group has not previously provided such support and has no current intentions to provide such support.\n\n## (C) Unconsolidated collective investment vehicles and limited partnerships\n\nThe Group's direct interests in unconsolidated structured entities comprise investments in collective investment vehicles, such as Open-Ended Investment Companies, and limited partnerships with a total carrying value of \u00a355,235 million at 31 December 2020 (2019: \u00a338,177 million), included within financial assets designated at fair value through profit and loss (see note 16). These investments include both those entities managed by third parties and those managed by the Group. At 31 December 2020, the total asset value of these unconsolidated structured entities, including the portion in which the Group has no interest, was \u00a32,473 billion (2019: \u00a32,363 billion).\n\nGiven the nature of these investments, the Group's maximum exposure to loss is equal to the carrying value of the investment. However, the Group's investments in these entities are primarily held to match policyholder liabilities in the Insurance division and the majority of the risk from a change in the value of the Group's investment is matched by a change in policyholder liabilities. The collective investment vehicles are primarily financed by investments from investors in the vehicles.\n\nDuring the year the Group has not provided any non-contractual financial or other support to these entities and has no current intention of providing any financial or other support. There were no transfers from/to these unconsolidated collective investment vehicles and limited partnerships.\n\nThe Group considers itself the sponsor of a structured entity where it is primarily involved in the design and establishment of the structured entity and further where the Group transfers assets to the structured entity, markets products associated with the structured entity in its own name and/or provides guarantees regarding the structured entity's performance.\n\nThe Group sponsors a range of diverse investment funds and limited partnerships where it acts as the fund manager or equivalent decision maker and markets the funds under one of the Group's brands.\n\nThe Group earns fees from managing the investments of these funds. The investment management fees that the Group earned from these entities, including those in which the Group held no ownership interest at 31 December 2020, are reported in note 6.",

It is a measure as at a specific date and may be significantly different from the amount which will actually be paid or received on maturity or settlement date.\n\nWherever possible, fair values have been calculated using unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets for identical instruments held by the Group. Where quoted market prices are not available, or are unreliable because of poor liquidity, fair values have been determined using valuation techniques which, to the extent possible, use market observable inputs, but in some cases use non-market observable inputs. Valuation techniques used include discounted cash flow analysis and pricing models and, where appropriate, comparison to instruments with characteristics similar to those of the instruments held by the Group. The Group measures valuation adjustments for its derivative exposures on the same basis as the derivatives are managed.\n\nThe carrying amount of the following financial instruments is a reasonable approximation of fair value: cash and balances at central banks, items in the course of collection from banks, items in course of transmission to banks, notes in circulation and liabilities arising from non-participating investment contracts. Fair values have not been disclosed for discretionary participating investment contracts. There is currently no agreed definition of fair valuation for discretionary participation features applied under IFRS and therefore the range of possible fair values of these contracts cannot be measured reliably.\n\nBecause a variety of estimation techniques are employed and significant estimates made, comparisons of fair values between financial institutions may not be meaningful. Readers of these financial statements are thus advised to use caution when using this data to evaluate the Group's financial position.\n\nFair value information is not provided for items that are not financial instruments or for other assets and liabilities which are not carried at fair value in the Group's consolidated balance sheet. These items include intangible assets, such as brands and acquired credit card relationships; premises and equipment; and shareholders' equity. These items are material and accordingly the Group believes that any fair value information presented would not represent the underlying value of the Group.\n\n## Valuation control framework\n\nThe key elements of the control framework for the valuation of financial instruments include model validation, product implementation review and independent price verification. These functions are carried out by appropriately skilled risk and finance teams, independent of the business area responsible for the products.\n\nModel validation covers both qualitative and quantitative elements relating to new models. In respect of new products, a product implementation review is conducted pre- and post-trading. Pre-trade testing ensures that the new model is integrated into the Group's systems and that the profit and loss and risk reporting are consistent throughout the trade life cycle. Post-trade testing examines the explanatory power of the implemented model, actively monitoring model parameters and comparing in-house pricing to external sources. Independent price verification procedures cover financial instruments carried at fair value. The frequency of the review is matched to the availability of independent data, monthly being the minimum. Valuation differences in breach of established thresholds are escalated to senior management. The results from independent pricing and valuation reserves are reviewed monthly by senior management.\n\nFormal committees, consisting of senior risk, finance and business management, meet at least quarterly to discuss and approve valuations in more judgemental areas, in particular for unquoted equities, structured credit, over-the-counter options and the Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) reserve.\n\n## Valuation of financial assets and liabilities\n\nAssets and liabilities carried at fair value or for which fair values are disclosed have been classified into three levels according to the quality and reliability of information used to determine the fair values.\n\n## Level 1\n\nLevel 1 fair value measurements are those derived from unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Products classified as level 1 predominantly comprise equity shares, treasury bills and other government securities.\n\n## Level 2\n\nLevel 2 valuations are those where quoted market prices are not available, for example where the instrument is traded in a market that is not considered to be active or valuation techniques are used to determine fair value and where these techniques use inputs that are based significantly on observable market data. Examples of such financial instruments include most over-the-counter derivatives, financial institution issued securities, certificates of deposit and certain asset-backed securities.\n\n## Level 3\n\nLevel 3 portfolios are those where at least one input which could have a significant effect on the instrument's valuation is not based on observable market data. Such instruments would include the Group's venture capital and unlisted equity investments which are valued using various valuation techniques that require significant management judgement in determining appropriate assumptions, including earnings multiples and estimated future cash flows. Certain of the Group's asset-backed securities and derivatives, principally where there is no trading activity in such securities, are also classified as level 3.\n\nTransfers out of the level 3 portfolio arise when inputs that could have a significant impact on the instrument's valuation become market observable after previously having been non-market observable. In the case of asset-backed securities this can arise if more than one consistent independent source of data becomes available. Conversely transfers into the portfolio arise when consistent sources of data cease to be available.",

The discount rates are derived from market observable interest rates, a risk margin that reflects loan credit ratings and an incremental illiquidity premium based on historical spreads at origination on similar loans.\n\n## Debt securities\n\nDebt securities measured at fair value and classified as level 2 are valued by discounting expected cash flows using an observable credit spread applicable to the particular instrument.\n\nWhere there is limited trading activity in debt securities, the Group uses valuation models, consensus pricing information from third party pricing services and broker or lead manager quotes to determine an appropriate valuation. Debt securities are classified as level 3 if there is a significant valuation input that cannot be corroborated through market sources or where there are materially inconsistent values for an input. Asset classes classified as level 3 mainly comprise certain collateralised loan obligations and collateralised debt obligations.\n\n## Equity investments\n\nUnlisted equity and fund investments are valued using different techniques in accordance with the Group's valuation policy and International Private Equity and Venture Capital Guidelines.\n\nDepending on the business sector and the circumstances of the investment, unlisted equity valuations are based on earnings multiples, net asset values or discounted cash flows.\n\n- - A number of earnings multiples are used in valuing the portfolio including price earnings, earnings before interest and tax and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. The particular multiple selected is appropriate for the type of business being valued and is derived by reference to the current market-based multiple. Consideration is given to the risk attributes, growth prospects and financial gearing of comparable businesses when selecting the appropriate multiple.\n- - Discounted cash flow valuations use estimated future cash flows, usually based on management forecasts, with the application of appropriate exit yields or terminal multiples and discounted using rates appropriate to the specific investment, business sector or recent economic rates of return. Recent transactions involving the sale of similar businesses may sometimes be used as a frame of reference in deriving an appropriate multiple.\n- - For fund investments the most recent capital account value calculated by the fund manager is used as the basis for the valuation and adjusted, if necessary, to align valuation techniques with the Group's valuation policy.\n\nUnlisted equity investments and investments in property partnerships held in the life assurance funds are valued using third party valuations. Management take account of any pertinent information, such as recent transactions and information received on particular investments, to adjust the third party valuations where necessary.",

The carrying amount of the securities is adjusted to reflect the effect of changes in own credit spreads and the resulting gain or loss is recognised in other comprehensive income.\n\nAt 31 December 2020, the own credit adjustment arising from the fair valuation of \u00a36,828 million (2019: \u00a37,531 million) of the Group's debt securities in issue designated at fair value through profit or loss resulted in a loss of \u00a375 million (2019: loss of \u00a3419 million), before tax, recognised in other comprehensive income.\n\n## Trading liabilities in respect of securities sold under repurchase agreements\n\nThe fair value of these liabilities is determined using discounted cash flow techniques. The discount rates are derived from observable repo curves specific to the type of security sold under the repurchase agreement.",

The types of derivatives classified as level 2 and the valuation techniques used include:\n\n- - Interest rate swaps which are valued using discounted cash flow models; the most significant inputs into those models are interest rate yield curves which are developed from publicly quoted rates.\n- - Foreign exchange derivatives that do not contain options which are priced using rates available from publicly quoted sources.\n- - Credit derivatives which are valued using standard models with observable inputs, except for the items classified as level 3, which are valued using publicly available yield and credit default swap (CDS) curves.\n- - Less complex interest rate and foreign exchange option products which are valued using volatility surfaces developed from publicly available interest rate cap, interest rate swaption and other option volatilities; option volatility skew information is derived from a market standard consensus pricing service. For more complex option products, the Group calibrates its models using observable at-the-money data; where necessary, the Group adjusts for out-of-themoney positions using a market standard consensus pricing service.\n\nComplex interest rate and foreign exchange products where inputs to the valuation are significant are material and unobservable are classified as level 3.\n\nWhere credit protection, usually in the form of credit default swaps, has been purchased or written on asset-backed securities, the security is referred to as a negative basis asset-backed security and the resulting derivative assets or liabilities have been classified as either level 2 or level 3 according to the classification of the underlying asset-backed security.\n\nCertain unobservable inputs used to calculate CVA, FVA, and own credit adjustments, are not significant in determining the classification of the derivative and debt instruments. Consequently, these inputs do not form part of the level 3 sensitivities presented.\n\nThe table below analyses movements in level 3 derivative assets and liabilities carried at fair value.\n\n|                                                                                                                                                                  | 2020                  | 2020                       | 2019                  | 2019                       |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------|\n|                                                                                                                                                                  | Derivative  assets \u00a3m | Derivative  liabilities \u00a3m | Derivative  assets \u00a3m | Derivative  liabilities \u00a3m |\n| At 1 January                                                                                                                                                     | 863                   | (1,367)                    | 927                   | (716)                      |\n| Exchange and other adjustments                                                                                                                                   | 16                    | (17)                       | (27)                  | 4                          |\n| Losses (gains) recognised in the income statement within other income                                                                                            | 84                    | (112)                      | 81                    | (75)                       |\n| Purchases (additions)                                                                                                                                            | 61                    | (6)                        | 4                     | (4)                        |\n| (Sales) redemptions                                                                                                                                              | (85)                  | 19                         | (19)                  | 47                         |\n| Transfers into the level 3 portfolio                                                                                                                             | 41                    | (51)                       | 415                   | (959)                      |\n| Transfers out of the level 3 portfolio                                                                                                                           | 1                     | 160                        | (518)                 | 336                        |\n| At 31 December                                                                                                                                                   | 981                   | (1,374)                    | 863                   | (1,367)                    |\n| Gains (losses) recognised in the income statement, within other income, relating to the  change in fair value of those assets or liabilities held at 31 December | 99                    | (131)                      | (14)                  | 18                         |\n\n## Derivative valuation adjustments\n\nDerivative financial instruments which are carried in the balance sheet at fair value are adjusted where appropriate to reflect credit risk, market liquidity and other risks.\n\n## (i) Uncollateralised derivative valuation adjustments\n\nThe following table summarises the movement on this valuation adjustment account during 2019 and 2020:\n\n|                                  | 2020 \u00a3m   | 2019 \u00a3m   |\n|----------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| At 1 January                     | 423       | 562       |\n| Income statement charge (credit) | 70        | (134)     |\n| Transfers                        | (19)      | (5)       |\n| At 31 December                   | 474       | 423       |",

These exposures largely relate to the provision of risk management solutions for corporate customers within the Commercial Banking division.\n\nA CVA is taken where the Group has a positive future uncollateralised exposure (asset). A DVA is taken where the Group has a negative future uncollateralised exposure (liability). These adjustments reflect interest rates and expectations of counterparty creditworthiness and the Group's own credit spread respectively.\n\nThe CVA is sensitive to:\n\n- - the current size of the mark-to-market position on the uncollateralised asset;\n- - expectations of future market volatility of the underlying asset; and\n- - expectations of counterparty creditworthiness.\n\nMarket Credit Default Swap (CDS) spreads are used to develop the probability of default for quoted counterparties. For unquoted counterparties, internal credit ratings and market sector CDS curves and recovery rates are used. The Loss Given Default (LGD) is based on market recovery rates and internal credit assessments.\n\nThe combination of a one notch deterioration in the credit rating of derivative counterparties and a ten per cent increase in LGD increases the CVA by \u00a383/uni00A0million. Current market value is used to estimate the projected exposure for products not supported by the model, which are principally complex interest rate options that are traded in very low volumes. For these, the CVA is calculated on an add-on basis (although no such adjustment was required at 31 December 2020).\n\nThe DVA is sensitive to:\n\n- - the current size of the mark-to-market position on the uncollateralised liability;\n- - expectations of future market volatility of the underlying liability; and\n- - the Group's own CDS spread.\n\nA one per cent rise in the CDS spread would lead to an increase in the DVA of \u00a3101 million.\n\nThe risk exposures that are used for the CVA and DVA calculations are strongly influenced by interest rates. Due to the nature of the Group's business the CVA/DVA exposures tend to be on average the same way around such that the valuation adjustments fall when interest rates rise. A one per cent rise in interest rates would lead to a \u00a383 million fall in the overall valuation adjustment to \u00a3240 million. The CVA model used by the Group does not assume any correlation between the level of interest rates and default rates.\n\nThe Group has also recognised a Funding Valuation Adjustment to adjust for the net cost of funding uncollateralised derivative positions. This adjustment is calculated on the expected future exposure discounted at a suitable cost of funds. A ten basis points increase in the cost of funds will increase the funding valuation adjustment by approximately \u00a326 million.\n\n## (ii) Market liquidity\n\nThe Group includes mid to bid-offer valuation adjustments against the expected cost of closing out the net market risk in the Group's trading positions within a timeframe that is consistent with historical trading activity and spreads that the trading desks have accessed historically during the ordinary course of business in normal market conditions.\n\nAt 31 December 2020, the Group's derivative trading business held mid to bid-offer valuation adjustments of \u00a383 million (2019: \u00a380 million).",

The calculation of the effect of reasonably possible alternative assumptions included in the table above reflects such relationships.\n\n## Debt securities\n\nReasonably possible alternative assumptions have been determined in respect of the Group's structured credit investment by flexing credit spreads.\n\n## Derivatives\n\nReasonably possible alternative assumptions have been determined in respect of swaptions in the Group's derivative portfolios which are priced using industry standard option pricing models. Such models require interest rate volatilities which may be unobservable at longer maturities. To derive reasonably possible alternative valuations these volatilities have been flexed within a range of 13 per cent to 128 per cent (2019: 10 per cent to 128 per cent).\n\n## Unlisted equity, venture capital investments and investments in property partnerships\n\nThe valuation techniques used for unlisted equity and venture capital investments vary depending on the nature of the investment. Reasonably possible alternative valuations for these investments have been calculated by reference to the approach taken, as appropriate to the business sector and investment circumstances and as such the following inputs have been considered:\n\n- - for valuations derived from earnings multiples, consideration is given to the risk attributes, growth prospects and financial gearing of comparable businesses when selecting an appropriate multiple;\n- - the discount rates used in discounted cash flow valuations; and\n- - in line with International Private Equity and Venture Capital Guidelines, the values of underlying investments in fund investment portfolios.",

Financial assets carried at amortised cost are mainly classified as level 3 due to significant unobservable inputs used in the valuation models. Where inputs are observable, debt securities are classified as level 1 or 2.\n\n|                                            |                   |               | Valuation hierarchy   | Valuation hierarchy   | Valuation hierarchy   |\n|--------------------------------------------|-------------------|---------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n|                                            | Carrying value \u00a3m | Fair value \u00a3m | Level 1 \u00a3m            | Level 2 \u00a3m            | Level 3 \u00a3m            |\n| At 31 December 2020                        |                   |               |                       |                       |                       |\n| Financial assets at amortised cost:        |                   |               |                       |                       |                       |\n| Loans and advances to customers: Stage 1   | 432,571           | 431,395       | -                     | 58,643                | 372,752               |\n| Loans and advances to customers: Stage 2   | 49,514            | 50,198        | -                     | -                     | 50,198                |\n| Loans and advances to customers: Stage 3   | 4,508             | 4,412         | -                     | -                     | 4,412                 |\n| Loans and advances to customers: POCI      | 12,250            | 12,250        | -                     | -                     | 12,250                |\n| Loans and advances to customers            | 498,843           | 498,255       | -                     | 58,643                | 439,612               |\n| Loans and advances to banks                | 10,746            | 10,745        | -                     | 2,686                 | 8,059                 |\n| Debt securities                            | 5,405             | 5,398         | -                     | 5,387                 | 11                    |\n| Reverse repos included in above amounts:   |                   |               |                       |                       |                       |\n| Loans and advances to customers            | 58,643            | 58,643        | -                     | 58,643                | -                     |\n| Loans and advances to banks                | 2,686             | 2,686         | -                     | 2,686                 | -                     |\n| At 31 December 2019                        |                   |               |                       |                       |                       |\n| Financial assets at amortised cost:        |                   |               |                       |                       |                       |\n| Loans and advances to customers: Stage 1 1 | 449,300           | 449,477       | -                     | 54,600                | 394,877               |\n| Loans and advances to customers: Stage 2   | 27,548            | 28,259        | -                     | -                     | 28,259                |\n| Loans and advances to customers: Stage 3 1 | 4,568             | 4,496         | -                     | -                     | 4,496                 |\n| Loans and advances to customers: POCI      | 13,572            | 13,572        | -                     | -                     | 13,572                |\n| Loans and advances to customers            | 494,988           | 495,804       | -                     | 54,600                | 441,204               |\n| Loans and advances to banks                | 9,775             | 9,773         | -                     | 1,555                 | 8,218                 |\n| Debt securities                            | 5,544             | 5,537         | -                     | 5,526                 | 11                    |\n| Reverse repos included in above amounts:   |                   |               |                       |                       |                       |\n| Loans and advances to customers            | 54,600            | 54,600        | -                     | 54,600                | -                     |\n| Loans and advances to banks                | 1,555             | 1,555         | -                     | 1,555                 | -                     |\n\n## Valuation methodology\n\n## Loans and advances to customers\n\nThe Group provides loans and advances to commercial, corporate and personal customers at both fixed and variable rates. Due to their short-term nature, the carrying value of the variable rate loans and those relating to lease financing is assumed to be their fair value.\n\nTo determine the fair value of loans and advances to customers, loans are segregated into portfolios of similar characteristics. A number of techniques are used to estimate the fair value of fixed rate lending; these take account of expected credit losses based on historic trends, prevailing market interest rates and expected future cash flows. For retail exposures, fair value is usually estimated by discounting anticipated cash flows (including interest at contractual rates) at market rates for similar loans offered by the Group and other financial institutions. Certain loans secured on residential properties are made at a fixed rate for a limited period, typically two to five years, after which the loans revert to the relevant variable rate. The fair value of such loans is estimated by reference to the market rates for similar loans of maturity equal to the remaining fixed interest rate period. The fair value of commercial loans is estimated by discounting anticipated cash flows at a rate which reflects the effects of interest rate changes, adjusted for changes in credit risk.\n\n## Loans and advances to banks\n\nThe carrying value of short-dated loans and advances to banks is assumed to be their fair value. The fair value of loans and advances to banks is estimated by discounting the anticipated cash flows at a market discount rate adjusted for the credit spread of the obligor or, where not observable, the credit spread of borrowers of similar credit quality.\n\n## Debt securities\n\nThe fair values of debt securities are determined predominantly from lead manager quotes and, where these are not available, by alternative techniques including reference to credit spreads on similar assets with the same obligor, market standard consensus pricing services, broker quotes and other research data.\n\n## Reverse repurchase agreements\n\nThe carrying amount is deemed a reasonable approximation of fair value given the short-term nature of these instruments.\n\nFi\n\nn\n\na\n\nnc\n\ni\n\na\n\nl\n\nr\n\ne\n\nsu\n\nl\n\nt\n\ns",

        "page_content": "## Note 49: Transfers of financial assets\n\nThere were no significant transferred financial assets which were derecognised in their entirety, but with ongoing exposure. Details of transferred financial assets that continue to be recognised in full are as follows.\n\nThe Group enters into repurchase and securities lending transactions in the normal course of business that do not result in derecognition of the financial assets as substantially all of the risks and rewards, including credit, interest rate, prepayment and other price risks are retained by the Group. In all cases, the transferee has the right to sell or repledge the assets concerned.\n\nAs set out in note 29, included within financial assets measured at amortised cost are loans transferred under the Group's securitisation and covered bond programmes. As the Group retains all or a majority of the risks and rewards associated with these loans, including credit, interest rate, prepayment and liquidity risk, they remain on the Group's balance sheet. Assets transferred into the Group's securitisation and covered bond programmes are not available to be used by the Group whilst the assets are within the programmes. However, the Group retains the right to remove loans from the covered bond programmes where they are in excess of the programme's requirements. In addition, where the Group has retained some of the notes issued by securitisation and covered bond programmes, the Group has the ability to sell or pledge these retained notes.\n\nThe table below sets out the carrying values of the transferred assets and the associated liabilities. For repurchase and securities lending transactions, the associated liabilities represent the Group's obligation to repurchase the transferred assets. For securitisation programmes, the associated liabilities represent the external notes in issue (note 29). Except as otherwise noted below, none of the liabilities shown in the table below have recourse only to the transferred assets.\n\n|                                                                   | 2020                                       | 2020                                           | 2019                                       | 2019                                           |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                                   | Carrying  value of  transferred  assets \u00a3m | Carrying  value of  associated  liabilities \u00a3m | Carrying  value of  transferred  assets \u00a3m | Carrying  value of  associated  liabilities \u00a3m |\n| Repurchase and securities lending transactions                    |                                            |                                                |                                            |                                                |\n| Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss             | 5,791                                      | 2,512                                          | 9,186                                      | 3,364                                          |\n| Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income | 6,025                                      | 5,105                                          | 7,897                                      | 5,875                                          |\n| Securitisation programmes                                         |                                            |                                                |                                            |                                                |\n| Financial assets at amortised cost:                               |                                            |                                                |                                            |                                                |\n| Loans and advances to customers 1                                 | 34,584                                     | 4,451                                          | 42,545                                     | 7,335                                          |\n\n- 1  The carrying value of associated liabilities excludes securitisation notes held by the Group of \u00a327,448 million (31 December 2019: \u00a331,436 million).",

Information about the Group's exposure to each of the above risks and its capital can be found on pages 144 to 204. The following additional disclosures, which provide its quantitative information about the risks within financial instruments held or issued by the Group, should be read in conjunction with that earlier information.\n\n## Market risk\n\n## (A) Interest rate risk\n\nInterest rate risk arises from the different repricing characteristics of the assets and liabilities. Liabilities are either insensitive to interest rate movements, for example interest free or very low interest customer deposits, or are sensitive to interest rate changes but bear rates which may be varied at the Group's discretion and that for competitive reasons generally reflect changes in the UK Bank Rate, set by the Bank of England. The rates on the remaining deposits are contractually fixed for their term to maturity.\n\nMany banking assets are sensitive to interest rate movements; there is a large volume of managed rate assets such as variable rate mortgages which may be considered as a natural offset to the interest rate risk arising from the managed rate liabilities. However, a significant proportion of the Group's lending assets, for example many personal loans and mortgages, bear interest rates which are contractually fixed.\n\nThe Group's risk management policy is to optimise reward whilst managing its market risk exposures within the risk appetite defined by the Board. The largest residual risk exposure arises from balances that are deemed to be insensitive to changes in market rates (including current accounts, a portion of variable rate deposits and investable equity), and is managed through the Group's structural hedge. The structural hedge consists of longer-term fixed rate assets or interest rate swaps and the amount and duration of the hedging activity is reviewed regularly by the Group Asset and Liability Committee. Further details on the Group market risk policy can be found on page 155.\n\nThe Group establishes hedge accounting relationships for interest rate risk using cash flow hedges and fair value hedges. The Group is exposed to cash flow interest rate risk on its variable rate loans and deposits together with its floating rate subordinated debt. The derivatives used to manage the structural hedge may be designated into cash flow hedges to manage income statement volatility. The economic items related to the structural hedge, for example current accounts, are not eligible hedged items under IAS 39 for inclusion into accounting hedge relationships. The Group is exposed to fair value interest rate risk on its fixed rate customer loans, its fixed rate customer deposits and the majority of its subordinated debt, and to cash flow interest rate risk on its variable rate loans and deposits together with its floating rate subordinated debt. The Group applies netting between similar risks before applying hedge accounting.\n\nHedge ineffectiveness arises during the management of interest rate risk due to residual unhedged risk. Sources of ineffectiveness, which the Group may decide to not fully mitigate, can include basis differences, timing differences and notional amount differences. The effectiveness of accounting hedge relationships is assessed between the hedging derivatives and the documented hedged item, which can differ to the underlying economically hedged item.\n\nAt 31 December 2020 the aggregate notional principal of interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges was \u00a3215,325 million (2019: \u00a3183,489 million) with a net fair value asset of \u00a3211 million (2019: asset of \u00a3569 million) (note 17). The gains on the hedging instruments were \u00a3988 million (2019: gains of \u00a31,144/uni00A0million). The losses on the hedged items attributable to the hedged risk were \u00a3441 million (2019: losses of \u00a31,001 million). The gains and losses relating to the fair value hedges are recorded in net trading income.\n\nIn addition the Group has cash flow hedges which are primarily used to hedge the variability in the cost of funding within the commercial business. The notional principal of the interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges at 31 December 2020 was \u00a3326,386 million (2019: \u00a3426,740 million) with a net fair value asset of \u00a330 million (2019: liability of \u00a3388 million) (note 17). In 2020, ineffectiveness recognised in the income statement that arises from cash flow hedges was a loss of \u00a32 million (2019: gain of \u00a3134 million).\n\n## Interest Rate Benchmark Reform\n\nFor the purposes of determining whether:\n\n- - a forecast transaction is highly probable;\n- - hedged future cash flows are expected to occur;\n- - a hedge is expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk; and\n- - an accounting hedging relationship should be discontinued because of a failure of the retrospective effectiveness test\n\nthe Group assumes that the interest rate benchmark on which the hedged risk or the cash flows of the hedged item or hedging instrument are based is not altered by uncertainties resulting from interest rate benchmark reform. In addition, for a fair value hedge of a non-contractually specified benchmark portion of interest rate risk, the Group assesses only at inception of the hedge relationship and not on an ongoing basis that the risk is separately identifiable and hedge effectiveness can be measured. The Group's most significant hedge accounting relationships are exposed to the following interest rate benchmarks: Sterling LIBOR, US Dollar LIBOR and EURIBOR./uni00A0\n\nAt 31 December 2020, the Group expects that EURIBOR will continue to exist as a benchmark rate for the foreseeable future and, as a result does not anticipate changing the hedged risk to a different benchmark. Accordingly, the Group does not consider its fair value or cash flow hedges of the EURIBOR benchmark interest rate to be directly affected by interest rate benchmark reform.\n\nThe notional of the hedged items that the Group has designated into cash flow hedge relationships that is directly affected by the interest rate benchmark reform is \u00a320,243 million (2019: \u00a329,202 million), of which \u00a316,523 million (2019: \u00a325,438 million) relates to Sterling LIBOR and \u00a33,720/uni00A0million (2019: \u00a31,350/uni00A0million) relates to US Dollar LIBOR. These are principally loans and advances to customers in Commercial Banking.\n\nThe interest rate benchmark reforms also affect assets designated in fair value hedges with a notional of \u00a3107,340 million (2019: \u00a3102,969/uni00A0million), of which \u00a3103,438 million (2019: \u00a398,278 million) is in respect of Sterling LIBOR, and liabilities designated in fair value hedges with a notional of \u00a335,360 million (2019: \u00a362,295/uni00A0million), of which \u00a310,518 million (2019: \u00a39,186 million) is in respect of Sterling LIBOR. These fair value hedges principally relate to mortgages in Retail and debt securities in issue.\n\nAt 31 December 2020, the notional amount of the hedging instruments in hedging relationships to which these amendments apply was \u00a3464,744/uni00A0million (2019: \u00a3604,602 million), of which \u00a3116,498 million (2019: \u00a3117,076 million) relates to Sterling LIBOR fair value hedges and \u00a3302,707 million (2019:/uni00A0\u00a3400,439/uni00A0million) relates to Sterling LIBOR cash flow hedges.",

This programme has developed an implementation plan for new products and a transition plan for legacy products. The programme also encompasses the associated impacts on systems, processes, accounting and reporting and includes dealing with the impact on hedge accounting relationships of the transition to alternative reference rates.\n\n## (B) Foreign exchange risk\n\nThe corporate and retail businesses incur foreign exchange risk in the course of providing services to their customers. All non-structural foreign exchange exposures in the non-trading book are transferred to the trading area where they are monitored and controlled. These risks reside in the authorised trading centres who are allocated exposure limits. The limits are monitored daily by the local centres and reported to the market and liquidity risk function in London. Associated VaR and the closing, average, maximum and minimum are disclosed on page 159. The Group also manages foreign currency risk via cash flow hedge accounting, utilising currency swaps.\n\nRisk arises from the Group's investments in its overseas operations. The Group's structural foreign currency exposure is represented by the net asset value of the foreign currency equity and subordinated debt investments in its subsidiaries and branches. Gains or losses on structural foreign currency exposures are taken to reserves.\n\nThe Group ceased all hedging of the currency translation risk of the net investment in foreign operations on 1 January 2018.\n\nThe Group's main overseas operations are in the Americas and Europe. Details of the Group's structural foreign currency exposures are as follows:\n\n## (C) Functional currency of Group operations\n\n|          | 2020    | 2020         | 2020                   | 2019    | 2019         | 2019                   |\n|----------|---------|--------------|------------------------|---------|--------------|------------------------|\n|          | Euro \u00a3m | US Dollar \u00a3m | Other  non-sterling \u00a3m | Euro \u00a3m | US Dollar \u00a3m | Other  non-sterling \u00a3m |\n| Exposure | 113     | 95           | 12                     | 63      | 93           | 48                     |\n\n## Credit risk\n\nThe Group's credit risk exposure arises in respect of the instruments below and predominantly in the United Kingdom.

Consequently, the Group has no significant exposure to credit risk for such assets which back those contract liabilities.\n\n## Derivative assets\n\nAn analysis of derivative assets is given in note 17. The Group reduces exposure to credit risk by using master netting agreements and by obtaining collateral in the form of cash or highly liquid securities. In respect of the Group's net credit risk relating to derivative assets of \u00a313,747/uni00A0million (2019: \u00a311,673/uni00A0million), cash collateral of \u00a38,715 million (2019: \u00a37,650 million) was held and a further \u00a3454 million was due from OECD banks (2019: \u00a3274 million).\n\n|                                        | 2020                   | 2020       | 2020     | 2019                   | 2019       | 2019     |\n|----------------------------------------|------------------------|------------|----------|------------------------|------------|----------|\n|                                        | Investment  grade 1 \u00a3m | Other 2 \u00a3m | Total \u00a3m | Investment  grade 1 \u00a3m | Other 2 \u00a3m | Total \u00a3m |\n| Trading and other                      | 26,782                 | 2,015      | 28,797   | 22,991                 | 2,142      | 25,133   |\n| Hedging                                | 810                    | 6          | 816      | 1,178                  | 58         | 1,236    |\n| Total derivative financial instruments | 27,592                 | 2,021      | 29,613   | 24,169                 | 2,200      | 26,369   |\n\n## Financial guarantees and irrevocable loan commitments\n\nFinancial guarantees represent undertakings that the Group will meet a customer's obligation to third parties if the customer fails to do so. Commitments to extend credit represent unused portions of authorisations to extend credit in the form of loans, guarantees or letters of credit. The Group is theoretically exposed to loss in an amount equal to the total guarantees or unused commitments, however, the likely amount of loss is expected to be significantly less; most commitments to extend credit are contingent upon customers maintaining specific credit standards.",

The Group holds collateral against loans and advances and irrevocable loan commitments; qualitative and, where appropriate, quantitative information is provided in respect of this collateral below. Collateral held as security for financial assets at fair value through profit or loss and for derivative assets is also shown below.\n\nThe Group holds collateral in respect of loans and advances to banks and customers as set out below. The Group does not hold collateral against debt securities, comprising asset-backed securities and corporate and other debt securities, which are classified as financial assets held at amortised cost.\n\n## Loans and advances to banks\n\nThere were reverse repurchase agreements which are accounted for as collateralised loans within loans and advances to banks with a carrying value of \u00a32,686/uni00A0million (2019: \u00a31,555 million), against which the Group held collateral with a fair value of \u00a32,682 million (2019: \u00a31,516 million).\n\nThese transactions were generally conducted under terms that are usual and customary for standard secured lending activities.\n\n## Loans and advances to customers\n\n## Retail lending\n\n## Mortgages\n\nAn analysis by loan-to-value ratio of the Group's residential mortgage lending is provided below. The value of collateral used in determining the loan-tovalue ratios has been estimated based upon the last actual valuation, adjusted to take into account subsequent movements in house prices, after making allowances for indexation error and dilapidations.\n\nIn some circumstances, where the discounted value of the estimated net proceeds from the liquidation of collateral (i.e. net of costs, expected haircuts and anticipated changes in the value of the collateral to the point of sale) is greater than the estimated exposure at default, no credit losses are expected and no ECL allowance is recognised.\n\n|                             | Drawn balances   | Drawn balances   | Drawn balances   | Drawn balances   | Drawn balances   | Expected credit losses   | Expected credit losses   |

lending is unsecured. At 31 December 2020, Stage 3 non-mortgage lending amounted to \u00a3538 million, net of an impairment allowance of \u00a3492 million (2019: \u00a3610 million, net of an impairment allowance of \u00a3368 million).\n\nStage 1 and Stage 2 non-mortgage retail lending amounted to \u00a358,183 million (2019: \u00a354,307 million). Lending decisions are predominantly based on an obligor's ability to repay from normal business operations rather than reliance on the disposal of any security provided. Collateral values are rigorously assessed at the time of loan origination and are thereafter monitored in accordance with business unit credit policy.\n\nThe Group's credit risk disclosures for unimpaired non-mortgage retail lending report assets gross of collateral and therefore disclose the maximum loss exposure. The Group believes that this approach is appropriate.\n\n## Commercial lending\n\n## Reverse repurchase transactions\n\nAt 31 December 2020 there were reverse repurchase agreements which were accounted for as collateralised loans with a carrying value of \u00a358,643 million (2019: \u00a354,600 million), against which the Group held collateral with a fair value of \u00a359,157 million (2019: \u00a352,982 million), all of which the Group was able to repledge. There were no collateral balances in the form of cash provided in respect of reverse repurchase agreements included in these amounts (2019: \u00a3nil). These transactions were generally conducted under terms that are usual and customary for standard secured lending activities.",

The fair value of the collateral held in respect of impaired secured commercial lending was \u00a3753 million (2019: \u00a3744/uni00A0million). In determining the fair value of collateral, no specific amounts have been attributed to the costs of realisation. For the purposes of determining the total collateral held by the Group in respect of impaired secured commercial lending, the value of collateral for each loan has been limited to the principal amount of the outstanding advance in order to eliminate the effects of any over-collateralisation and to provide a clearer representation of the Group's exposure.\n\nStage 3 secured commercial lending and associated collateral relates to lending to property companies and to customers in the financial, business and other services; transport, distribution and hotels; and construction industries.\n\n## Stage 1 and Stage 2 secured lending\n\nFor Stage 1 and Stage 2 secured commercial lending, the Group reports assets gross of collateral and therefore discloses the maximum loss exposure. The Group believes that this approach is appropriate as collateral values at origination and during a period of good performance may not be representative of the value of collateral if the obligor enters a distressed state.\n\nStage 1 and Stage 2 secured commercial lending is predominantly managed on a cash flow basis. On occasion, it may include an assessment of underlying collateral, although, for Stage 3 lending, this will not always involve assessing it on a fair value basis. No aggregated collateral information for the entire unimpaired secured commercial lending portfolio is provided to key management personnel.\n\n## Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (excluding equity shares)\n\nIncluded in financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are reverse repurchase agreements treated as collateralised loans with a carrying value of \u00a312,993/uni00A0million (2019: \u00a311,269 million). Collateral is held with a fair value of \u00a313,169 million (2019: \u00a311,081 million), all of which the Group is able to repledge. At 31 December 2020, \u00a310,049 million/uni00A0had been repledged (2019: \u00a39,605 million).\n\nIn addition, securities held as collateral in the form of stock borrowed amounted to \u00a354,232 million (2019: \u00a332,888 million). Of this amount, \u00a352,887 million (2019: \u00a330,594/uni00A0million) had been resold or repledged as collateral for the Group's own transactions.\n\nThese transactions were generally conducted under terms that are usual and customary for standard secured lending activities.\n\n## Derivative assets, after offsetting of amounts under master netting arrangements\n\nThe Group reduces exposure to credit risk by using master netting agreements and by obtaining collateral in the form of cash or highly liquid securities. In respect of the net derivative assets after offsetting of amounts under master netting arrangements of \u00a313,747 million (2019: \u00a311,673/uni00A0million), cash collateral of \u00a38,715 million (2019: \u00a37,650 million) was held.\n\n## Irrevocable loan commitments and other credit-related contingencies\n\nAt 31 December 2020, the Group held irrevocable loan commitments and other credit-related contingencies of \u00a376,515 million (2019: \u00a366,398/uni00A0million). Collateral is held as security, in the event that lending is drawn down, on \u00a319,548 million (2019: \u00a312,391 million) of these balances.\n\n## Collateral repossessed\n\nDuring the year, \u00a3125 million of collateral was repossessed (2019: \u00a3413 million), consisting primarily of residential property.\n\nIn respect of retail portfolios, the Group does not take physical possession of properties or other assets held as collateral and uses external agents to realise the value as soon as practicable, generally at auction, to settle indebtedness. Any surplus funds are returned to the borrower or are otherwise dealt with in accordance with appropriate insolvency regulations. In certain circumstances the Group takes physical possession of assets held as collateral against commercial lending. In such cases, the assets are carried on the Group's balance sheet and are classified according to the Group's accounting policies.",

Liquidity risk is managed through a series of measures, tests and reports that are primarily based on contractual maturity. The Group carries out monthly stress testing of its liquidity position against a range of scenarios, including those prescribed by the PRA. The Group's liquidity risk appetite is also calibrated against a number of stressed liquidity metrics.\n\nThe table below analyses assets and liabilities of the Group into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining contractual period at the balance sheet date; balances with no fixed maturity are included in the over 5 years category.

The Group's assets and liabilities may be repaid or otherwise mature earlier or later than implied by their contractual terms and readers are, therefore, advised to use caution when using this data to evaluate the Group's liquidity position. In particular, amounts in respect of customer deposits are usually contractually payable on demand or at short notice. However, in practice, these deposits are not usually withdrawn on their contractual maturity.\n\nThe table below analyses financial instrument liabilities of the Group, excluding those arising from insurance and participating investment contracts, on an undiscounted future cash flow basis according to contractual maturity, into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date; balances with no fixed maturity are included in the over 5 years category.\n\n|                                                                 | Up to 1  month \u00a3m   | 1-3  months \u00a3m   | 3-12  months \u00a3m   | 1-5  years \u00a3m   | Over 5  years \u00a3m   | Total \u00a3m   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|------------------|-------------------|-----------------|--------------------|------------|\n| At 31 December 2020                                             |                     |                  |                   |                 |                    |            |\n| Deposits from banks                                             | 8,584               | 2,429            | 550               | 23,451          | 495                | 35,509     |\n| Customer deposits                                               | 428,634             | 13,659           | 8,387             | 8,049           | 1,528              | 460,257    |\n| Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss      | 3,904               | 7,117            | 5,096             | 2,139           | 10,513             | 28,769     |\n| Debt securities in issue                                        | 6,339               | 6,599            | 16,612            | 45,666          | 19,583             | 94,799     |\n| Liabilities arising from non-participating investment contracts | 38,450              | -

Save as disclosed below, the impact of these accounting changes is still being assessed by the Group and reliable estimates cannot be made at this stage.\n\nWith the exception of IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts and certain other minor amendments, as at 23/uni00A0February 2021 these pronouncements have been endorsed for use in the United Kingdom.\n\n## IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts\n\nIFRS 17 replaces IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023.\n\nIFRS 17 requires insurance contracts and participating investment contracts to be measured on the balance sheet as the total of the fulfilment cash flows and the contractual service margin. Changes to estimates of future cash flows from one reporting date to another are recognised either as an amount in profit or loss or as an adjustment to the expected profit for providing insurance coverage, depending on the type of change and the reason for it. The effects of some changes in discount rates can either be recognised in profit or loss or in other comprehensive income as an accounting policy choice. The risk adjustment is released to profit and loss as an insurer's risk reduces. Profits which are currently recognised through a value in-force asset, will no longer be recognised at inception of an insurance contract. Instead, the expected profit for providing insurance coverage is recognised in profit or loss over time as the insurance coverage is provided. The standard will have a significant impact on the accounting for the insurance and participating investment contracts issued by the Group.\n\nThe Group's IFRS 17 project is progressing to plan. Work has focused on interpreting the requirements of the standard, developing methodologies and accounting policies, and assessing the changes required to reporting and other systems. The development of the Group's data warehousing and actuarial liability calculation processes required for IFRS 17 reporting is progressing.\n\n## Interest Rate Benchmark Reform\n\nThe IASB's Phase 2 amendments in response to issues arising from the replacement of interest rate benchmarks in a number of jurisdictions are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2021.\n\nUnder these amendments, an immediate gain or loss is not recognised in the income statement where the contractual cash flows of a financial asset or financial liability are amended as a direct consequence of the rate reform and the revised contractual terms are economically equivalent to the previous terms. In addition, hedge accounting is continued for relationships that are directly affected by the reform.\n\nThese amendments are not expected to have a significant impact on the Group.\n\n## Minor amendments to other accounting standards\n\nThe IASB has issued a number of minor amendments to IFRSs effective 1 January 2021 and in later years (including IFRS 9 Financial Instruments /uni00A0and IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets ). These amendments are not expected to have a significant impact on the Group.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the parent company financial statements\n\nfor the year ended 31 December\n\n## Note 1: Basis of preparation and accounting policies\n\nThe financial statements of Lloyds Banking Group plc comply with international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). IFRS comprises accounting standards prefixed IFRS issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and those prefixed IAS issued by the IASB's predecessor body as well as interpretations issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee and its predecessor body. On adoption of IFRS 9 in 2018, the Group elected to continue applying hedge accounting under IAS 39.\n\nThe financial information has been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss and all derivative contracts.\n\nThe accounting policies of the Company are the same as those of the Group which are set out in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. Investments in subsidiaries are carried at historical cost, less any provisions for impairment.\n\nFees payable to the Company's auditors by the Group are set out in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Note 2: Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss\n\n|                 | 2020 \u00a3m   | 2019 \u00a3m   |\n|-----------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Debt securities | 14,362    | 12,516    |\n\nThe assets held at fair value through profit or loss represent holdings of debt securities issued by subsidiary companies. The contractual terms of such instruments contain certain write-down and conversion features, and so are not deemed to satisfy the solely payments of principal and interest test.\n\n## Note 3: Amounts due from subsidiaries\n\nThese comprise short-term lending to subsidiaries, repayable on demand. As required by IFRS 9, the Company has established an allowance for impairment losses for amounts due from its subsidiaries (31 December 2020: \u00a33 million; 31 December 2019: \u00a31 million) based on the probability of its subsidiaries defaulting on the amounts payable in the next 12 months. The carrying value of the amounts owed by subsidiaries is a reasonable approximation to fair value.\n\n## Note 4: Share capital, share premium account and other equity instruments\n\nDetails of the Company's share capital, share premium account and other equity instruments are as set out in notes 38, 39 and 42 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Note 5: Other reserves\n\nThe merger reserve comprises the premium on shares issued on 13 January 2009 under the placing and open offer and shares issued on 16 January 2009 on the acquisition of HBOS plc, offset by adjustments on the redemption of preference shares. Substantially all of the Company's merger reserve is available for distribution.\n\nMovements in the merger reserve were as follows:\n\n|                                   | 2020 \u00a3m   | 2019 \u00a3m   | 2018 \u00a3m   |\n|-----------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| At 1 January                      | 7,420     | 7,423     | 7,423     |\n| Redemption of preference shares 1 | -         | (3)       | -         |\n| At 31 December                    | 7,420     | 7,420     | 7,423     |\n\nThe capital redemption reserve represents transfers from the merger reserve in accordance with companies' legislation and amounts transferred from share capital following the cancellation of shares.\n\nMovements in the capital redemption reserve were as follows:\n\n|                                                 | 2020 \u00a3m   | 2019 \u00a3m   | 2018 \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| At 1 January                                    | 4,462     | 4,273     | 4,115     |\n| Shares cancelled under share buyback programmes | -         | 189       | 158       |\n| At 31 December                                  | 4,462     | 4,462     | 4,273     |",

The changes in the credit risk of these liabilities are linked to the changes in credit risk on corresponding assets that the Company holds at fair value through profit or loss, representing debt securities issued by subsidiaries. Given the economic relationship between these assets and liabilities, the Company presents changes in the credit risk of its liabilities in profit or loss in order to avoid creating or enlarging an accounting mismatch.\n\nThe amount contractually payable on maturity of the debt securities held at fair value through profit or loss at 31 December 2020 was \u00a38,060/uni00A0million, which was \u00a3575 million/uni00A0lower/uni00A0than the balance sheet carrying value (2019: \u00a33,393 million which was \u00a371 million lower than the balance sheet carrying value). At 31 December 2020 there was a cumulative \u00a3541 million/uni00A0increase in the fair value of these liabilities attributable to changes in credit risk (2019: increase of \u00a3101/uni00A0million), of which \u00a3440 million arose in 2020 and \u00a3101 million arose in 2019; this is determined by reference to the quoted credit spreads of the Company.",

All regulated banking and insurance subsidiaries are required to maintain capital at levels agreed with the regulators; this may impact those subsidiaries' ability to make distributions.\n\n## Loans to subsidiaries\n\n|                                | 2020 \u00a3m   | 2019 \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| At 1 January                   | 14,660    | 24,211    |\n| Exchange and other adjustments | 35        | (106)     |\n| New advances                   | 7,416     | 1,812     |\n| Repayments                     | (2,004)   | (11,257)  |\n| At 31 December                 | 20,107    | 14,660    |\n\nIn addition the Company carries out banking activities through its subsidiary, Lloyds Bank plc. At 31 December 2020, the Company held deposits of \u00a37/uni00A0million with Lloyds Bank plc (2019: \u00a329 million). Given the volume of transactions flowing through the account, it is not meaningful to provide gross inflow and outflow information. Included within other liabilities is \u00a3805 million (2019: \u00a3105 million) due to subsidiary undertakings. In addition, at 31 December 2020 the Company had interest rate and currency swaps with Lloyds Bank plc and Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets plc with an aggregate notional principal amount of \u00a349,388/uni00A0million and a net positive fair value of \u00a31,029 million (2019: notional principal amount of \u00a337,555 million and a net positive fair value of \u00a3338 million). Of this amount an aggregate notional principal amount of \u00a319,909 million and a net positive fair value of \u00a31,418 million (2019: notional principal amount of \u00a321,164 million and a net positive fair value of \u00a3707 million) were designated as fair value hedges to manage the Company's issuance of subordinated liabilities.\n\n## Guarantees\n\nThe Company guarantees certain of its subsidiaries' liabilities to the Bank of England.\n\n## Other related party transactions\n\nRelated party information in respect of other related party transactions is given in note 45 to the consolidated financial statements.",

If it sounds too good to be true, it usually is and we would ask that shareholders take steps to protect themselves. We strongly recommend seeking advice from an independent financial adviser authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Shareholders can verify whether a firm is authorised via the Financial Services Register which is available at www.fca.org.uk\n\nIf a shareholder is concerned that they may have been targeted by such a scheme, please contact the FCA Consumer Helpline on 0800 111 6768 or use the online 'Share Fraud Reporting Form' available from their website (see above). We would also recommend contacting the Police through Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040 or visiting www.actionfraud.org.uk for further information.\n\n## Important shareholder and registrar information\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Company website\n\nwww.lloydsbankinggroup.com\n\n## Shareholder information\n\nhelp.shareview.co.uk (from here you will be able to email your query securely)\n\n## Registrar\n\nEquiniti Limited Aspect House, Spencer Road, Lancing West Sussex BN99 6DA\n\n## Shareholder helpline\n\n0371 384 2990* from within the UK +44 121 415 7066 from outside the UK\n\n* Lines are open from 8.30 am to 5.30 pm Monday to Friday, excluding English and Welsh public holidays.\n\nThe company registrar is Equiniti Limited.

with the transition requirements of the standard, comparative information was not restated.\n- 2 The Group implemented the amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes with effect from 1 January 2019 and as a result tax relief on distributions on other equity instruments, previously taken directly to retained profits, is now reported within tax expense in the income statement.

However, on 31 March 2020 the Group announced the cancellation of its final 2019 ordinary dividend. This decision was taken by the Board at the specific request of the regulator, the PRA, in line with all other major UK listed banks, as a result of the developing coronavirus crisis.\n- 6 Dividends per ordinary share in 2016 included a recommended special dividend of 0.5 pence.\n- 7   For 2016, this figure excluded the limited voting ordinary shares owned by the Lloyds Bank Foundations. The limited voting ordinary shares were redesignated as ordinary shares on 1 July 2017.\n- 8   Averages are calculated on a monthly basis from the consolidated financial data of Lloyds Banking Group.\n- 9   Total dividend for the year divided by earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders adjusted for tax relief on distributions to other equity holders.\n- 10  The cost:income ratio is calculated as total operating expenses as a percentage of total income (net of insurance claims).",
