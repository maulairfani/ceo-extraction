That means meeting expenses today, saving enough for important goals like retirement and being prepared for all of life's moments in between. At BlackRock, the assets we manage on behalf of our clients - who are pension plans that serve workers from all industries, individuals through financial advisors, nonprofit organizations and academic institutions, insurance companies and governments - represent the futures of millions of people across the world. This is why we work with such a deep sense of passion and responsibility each and every day.\n\n## We make investing easier and more affordable\n\nInvesting is out of reach for too many people, so BlackRock is helping to make investing easier and more affordable for all savers. Our more than 1,100 iShares exchange-traded funds (ETFs) simplify investing by making it more convenient for people to access market opportunities anywhere in the world. And we have demonstrated our commitment to making investing more affordable for more investors. In the past five years, iShares has helped save investors over $400 million through reductions in fund fees.\u00b9\n\n## We advance sustainable investing because our conviction is it delivers better outcomes for investors\n\nBlackRock understands that climate risk is investment risk that all of our clients face. To help manage it, we have put sustainability at the center of our investment approach. We offer more than 200 environmental, social and governance (ESG) strategies to help investors meet their goals, from screening out specific sectors to proactively supporting positive sustainable outcomes. We also offer tools and technology to aid investors in better understanding how climate change may impact their investments over time.\n\n## We contribute to a more resilient economy that benefits more people\n\nWe invest our clients' money in companies of all types and sizes, in every region of the world. These investments provide capital for companies to grow and create jobs, which, in turn, enables economies and societies to prosper. We use our voice as shareholders to urge companies to focus on important issues that will also impact the value of their investments, like climate change, the fair treatment of workers and equality. We are also working through the BlackRock Foundation to expand financial security for low income groups who face barriers to economic participation and may be vulnerable to disruption from climate change.",

We have a responsibility to put their best interest at the center of every decision we make.\n\nOur clients include people of all backgrounds saving for their futures. They are pensions, who manage the retirement savings of teachers, nurses, factory workers and small business owners. They are educational and nonprofit organizations, who work to educate students in pursuit of solving social challenges. And they are insurance companies and governments, who support people during life's most difficult moments and build hospitals, schools and roads to improve their communities. By investing on our clients' behalf, we help more and more people experience financial well-being throughout their lives.\n\nBlackRock has spent the last 33 years helping to provide better financial futures for our clients. We offer an extensive set of investment strategies, across active and index, asset classes, geographies and exposures, so that we can develop solutions\n\nthat meet clients' specific needs. It is why we built our Aladdin technology and risk management system: to help clients understand and manage risk, operate more efficiently and make more informed investment decisions. It is why we pioneered the targetdate fund, an all-in-one portfolio that automatically adjusts for different stages of an investor's life. And it is why we use our voice as shareholders to urge companies to focus on important issues - like climate change, the fair treatment of workers and equality - to better protect the long-term value of our clients' investments.\n\nWe continue to innovate ahead of clients' evolving needs. For example, in 2020 we introduced Aladdin Climate to better assess climate risks in investment portfolios and launched LifePath Paycheck to provide millions of American workers with simplified access to lifetime income throughout their retirement. We innovate every day because challenging the status quo and finding new solutions enhances returns, convenience, value and transparency for our clients and helps them achieve their long-term goals.",

        "page_content": "## Helping clients achieve their long - term goals\n\nSpotlight: Building resilience with renewable power\n\nBlackRock is unwavering in our commitment to working with clients to help them reach their goals over the long term. One example of this commitment in action is our renewable power platform. BlackRock's Real Assets team manages one of the largest renewable power platforms in the world, and across our strategies, we have over $11 billion of invested and committed capital. Renewables have continued to grow as more of our clients look to alternative sources of return and sustainable investments to add resilience to their portfolios. At the same time, renewables are playing a key role in helping to solve the global climate crisis and the shift from fossil fuels to cleaner energy\n\n## 270 projects\n\nBlackRock has invested in over 270 wind and solar infrastructure projects around the world* BlackRock has invested in over 270 wind and solar infrastructure projects around the world\u00b9\n\n## 36 million cars\n\nOur renewable power projects will reduce carbon emissions equivalent to removing 36 million cars from the road* Our renewable power projects will reduce carbon emissions equivalent to removing 36 million cars from the road\u00b9\n\n## 30 million homes\n\nOur wind and solar investments produce enough clean energy to power over 30 million homes for one year* Our wind and solar investments produce enough clean energy to power over 30 million homes for one year\u00b9\n\n## 20,000 jobs\n\nThese investments have supported approximately 20,000 jobs* These investments have supported approximately 20,000 jobs\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 Source: BlackRock. Metrics estimated over the lifetime of BlackRock's renewable power assets and funds. Employment figures are estimated using Political Economy Research Institute, University of Massachusetts Amherst, Green Growth, 'A U.S. Program for Controlling Climate Change and Expanding Job Opportunities.'\n\nsources - both of which are necessary for long-term financial well-being.\n\nOur robust portfolio of renewable energy projects gives clients access to the opportunity presented by the global transition to a net-zero economy. BlackRock has invested on their behalf in over 270 wind and solar infrastructure projects around the world.\u00b9 Collectively these investments produce enough clean energy to power over 30 million homes for one year, leading to carbon emissions reductions equivalent to removing 36 million cars from the road and providing approximately 20,000 jobs.\u00b9\n\nThese big numbers have meaningful on-the-ground impacts. For example, BlackRock invested in the construction of two solar power projects in Queensland, Australia, in an area long known for coal mining, but which had recently begun to transition to renewable energy. The 240-megawatt portfolio was slated to generate enough clean energy to power around 85,000 homes in the region annually.\n\nThe project was based in a small rural town of about 1,200 people. Over the nearly two-year construction period, BlackRock's investment led to the creation of 550 building jobs, in addition\n\nto boosting local servicerelated employment. Today, the town continues to benefit from the management of these green projects - from ongoing sponsorship of community events to supplying a printing facility for an internet access center.\n\nCapturing the growth opportunity in renewable projects such as these helps our clients build portfolios for the future - not only for the next five years but for the next century. They also serve a large universe of stakeholders by adding resilience to local economies and the environment.",

        "page_content": "Inspiring employees\n\n## Investing in our business by investing in our people\n\nBlackRock's strong performance over time is because of the investments we make in our talented employees.\n\nOur employees are the foundation of our client-centric culture. They help deliver performance and innovation, serve our communities and ultimately drive returns for our shareholders. Our ability to continue delivering for all stakeholders hinges on our ability to attract, develop and retain dedicated and talented people who are inspired by our purpose and take emotional ownership of the work they do each and every day.\n\nBlackRock's growth over time means we can continuously enhance the programs and resources we provide employees to support their well-being and ongoing development. For example, throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we increased the benefits we offer our employees by providing services such as company-paid COVID-19 diagnostic and antibody testing and free on-demand physical, mental and emotional healthcare programs. We also expanded the content available on BlackRock Academies, our platform for providing best-in-class resources and courses to our employees, so that they can continue learning and growing their careers even\n\nin a remote environment. Being a student is core to who we are at BlackRock and our capacity to learn helps us deliver the best of BlackRock to our clients, each other and ourselves.\n\nMost importantly, BlackRock is committed to improving and maintaining a diverse, inclusive and equitable culture. It is central to our success and is what enables all 16,500 of BlackRock's employees to drive our purpose of helping more and more people experience financial well-being. Our goal is to build, develop and retain a diverse talent pipeline, while fostering a culture where every employee feels comfortable, confident and empowered to make an impact. We believe that diverse groups make better decisions, which in turn leads to better outcomes for our clients. While we still have work to do, in 2020, we advanced our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion in three key areas: 1) talent and culture; 2) our role as a fiduciary on behalf of our clients and 3) public policy and social impact in the communities where we operate. A respectful culture that values diversity in all its forms not only encourages employees to question our assumptions and consider the unique perspectives that each of us brings, but also serves the BlackRock purpose of helping more and more people experience financial well-being.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Helping families navigate a crisis\n\nThe stresses of working from home during COVID-19 hit families particularly hard, as parents have juggled their day jobs with childcare, eldercare and finding time for selfcare. And while all working parents are feeling these pressures, research shows that women are disproportionately carrying this increased burden and millions of women are leaving the workforce as a result.\n\nBlackRock recognizes the strain on employee caregivers and we are leveraging both grassroots efforts and institutional expertise to support families financially, logistically and emotionally. For example, our global Benefits team extended the number of back-up care days where available and offered mental health workshops, one-onone counseling and tools to support selfcare, manage stress and avoid burnout.\n\nThese and other solutions were shaped in collaboration with Families at BlackRock (FAB), an employee network with 16 chapters and 2,000-plus members in 30 countries. At the pandemic's outset, FAB initiated a 'Kids Chat,' where parents could crowd-source ideas and resources on issues like schooling, services for children with disabilities and talking about race. The Benefits team converted these tips into a searchable database that was shared across the chat rooms to make these insights more readily accessible.\n\nIn September 2020, when it became clear that a return to normal was still far off, the firm launched an innovative mentoring program that pairs new parents with more experienced colleagues. It's yet another way BlackRock is helping employees thrive in an unimaginable year.\n\n## 91%\n\nof employees are proud to work at BlackRock 1\n\n## 50%\n\nof our 2020 U.S. hires identify as a racial or ethnic minority 3\n\n## 6.3\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nyears average employee tenure at BlackRock 2\n\n## 52%\n\nof BlackRock employees are involved in an employee or impact network 4",

For example, in Germany we partner with CodeDoor, a nonprofit that enables underserved youth and adults to gain in-demand technical and coding skills to launch upwardly mobile careers. 1\n- \u00b7 In March 2020, we committed $50 million to COVID-19 relief efforts. More than half of this commitment has been deployed across 60 food relief, community support, and frontline response organizations serving the hardest-hit communities in 18 of the countries where\n\nwe operate. The remaining commitment will be fulfilled in 2021 and is aimed at longterm recovery for households and communities. 1\n\n- \u00b7 We donated $9 million in funds to match $8 million in employee giving, benefiting over 3,700 organizations that employees either volunteered with or donated to in 2020. 1\n\nBlackRock is also contributing to a stronger, more resilient economy through our investments and in how we serve our clients. Our clients' investments support businesses small and large, finance infrastructure projects that connect and power cities and make a positive social or environmental impact in the world. For example, we are developing and launching products focused on racial equity and social justice across our active and index businesses. We also maintain a dedicated Diverse Broker Program aimed at increasing connectivity and engagement with minority, women and disabled-veteran owned firms while helping them grow their businesses. And in 2020, we traded $295 billion of securities with diverse brokers in the U.S. 1 We are committed to delivering innovative strategies and serving our clients in a way that meets their needs, supports healthy economies and delivers value for society.\n\n## Supporting an inclusive and sustainable economic recovery\n\nBlackRock is committed to helping those in the most vulnerable communities build financial stability so they can realize a better future. One way we do this is by fostering equitable access to skill-building and job training - a need that has grown more acute as a result of the COVID-19 crisis.\n\nThe numbers are stark: 255 million jobs eliminated globally by the pandemic, 75 million unemployed young people and more than 375 million workers who will lack the skills needed for jobs in 2030. 2\n\nTo help address this gap, The BlackRock Foundation has committed $13 million to Generation, a nonprofit organization that transitions people around the world into life-changing careers that may otherwise be inaccessible. The funds will support more than 50,000 job seekers in the U.S., U.K., Italy, India, France and Spain, as well as infrastructure to scale the program globally.\n\nBlackRock's contributions go beyond financial. We are leveraging our client and vendor networks to match Generation graduates with employers, using our expertise to help Generation scope future high-potential career paths, and facilitating volunteer opportunities for our own employees in communities across the world.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## $589 million\n\ncontribution to our existing Donor Advised Fund and a newly established BlackRock Foundation to support our future philanthropic efforts 1\n\n## $50 million\n\ncommitment to establish BlackRock's Emergency Savings Initiative, which works to increase access to and usage of proven savings strategies and tools for low-to-moderate income households in the U.S. 2\n\n## $50 million\n\ndonated to COVID-19 relief efforts and other charitable organizations in 2020\n\n## $10 million\n\ncommitment aimed at bringing visibility and increased resources to support the upward mobility of Black and Latinx communities 3",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## To our shareholders,\n\nWhen I sit down to write this letter every spring, I reflect on the year that's passed, and it often feels like a distant memory. By nature, I focus on what lies ahead. But right now, it's not so easy to draw that distinction between years. More than 13 months after COVID-19 became a global health crisis, we are still confronting its impacts daily and have yet to return to normalcy. For billions of people around the world, the pandemic has brought on hardships - physically, emotionally, mentally and financially.\n\nMore than ever before, I think about what BlackRock stands for, who we serve and where we are making an impact in the world. The events of this past year have only further strengthened our sense of responsibility to help millions of people invest to build savings, make investing easier and more affordable, advance sustainable investing and contribute to a more resilient economy.\n\nI am an optimist. And while there are still immediate and pressing matters such as economic relief and vaccination rollout to address, the events of 2020 have brought to the forefront heightened conversations, and more important, actions by governments and companies on issues such as climate change, racial equity and economic inequality. Major asset managers and financial institutions, including BlackRock, can make a significant impact in these areas and accelerate positive long-term developments.\n\nThat is why we are increasingly using our voice and our insights to advocate on behalf of clients for more sustainable and inclusive economies. We're asking ourselves: how can we contribute to an effective transition to the net zero economy? How can we bring the voices of smaller and individual shareholders to the companies they invest in? How can we help more people benefit from the long-term growth of capital markets?\n\nBlackRock can help more and more people experience financial well-being only if we contribute to solutions for some of the most pressing issues our society faces today.\n\nThis starts with serving all our stakeholders; BlackRock exists because of them and we focused on meeting their needs through the pandemic. The platform we've built over three decades enabled us to help clients navigate the turbulent markets and heightened risk that characterized the early part of the pandemic. We prioritized providing resources to keep our employees and their families safe and healthy. We served our communities' urgent needs by contributing to organizations delivering food security and supporting frontline workers. We provided greater transparency and more information to shareholders, so they could better understand how we were adjusting our operations and how our business was performing. By staying true to our purpose and serving all our stakeholders, 2020 included some of the proudest moments in BlackRock's 33-year history.\n\nWhat I look forward to most in a post-pandemic world is meeting in person with our clients again. Our entire business is built on listening to the people we serve and understanding their needs. There is no substitute for meeting in person to hear about the challenges and opportunities they face in trying to meet the needs of their own clients: pension beneficiaries in the United Kingdom retiring after long careers in public service; families in the United States saving to buy their first homes; and countries like Mexico, Norway and Japan looking to build new hospitals, schools and infrastructure. Helping our clients is what gives me, and the employees of BlackRock, our sense of purpose.\n\nIn this remote work environment, technology has made it easier to connect with people in places around the world - a convenience that will no doubt remain longer term and reduce the need for some of the travel we all used to do. But I miss the personal connections and unexpected ideas that come from meeting face-toface and sharing a meal together. It's often through a less structured conversation than one can have on a video call that we learn most about each other and experience intangibles, like culture, that are hard to see through a screen. These in-person conversations we have with all stakeholders are often the most fruitful in providing us with insights to better serve them.\n\nIt's through my conversations over the past year that I've heard from people who feel even further away from being prepared with enough savings for retirement. Embedded in BlackRock's purpose is a responsibility to help people not be left behind. That's why we are working to educate, empower and prepare people with the investment solutions, technology and mindset required to invest for the long term. It is why we continuously push ourselves to evolve our business. And it's why our Social Impact programs partner with organizations that are confronting structural barriers to financial resilience and economic mobility.\n\nIt's the driving force behind our strategy in iShares , where we are making it easier and more affordable for more people to participate in the growth of capital markets through ETFs. It's why we are investing in technology, to help people construct portfolios that are more resilient across market cycles and throughout their lives. It's why sustainable investing, including managing climate risk and promoting equity, is at the center of how we help clients invest. And it's why BlackRock is at the forefront of creating new solutions to address the retirement crisis.\n\nInvesting in our business isn't only about developing products and solutions or enhancing our operations. Just as important is putting time, money and effort into our culture and our people.\n\nIn the wake of the financial crisis more than 10 years ago, for example, challenging economic and market conditions created a difficult backdrop for companies globally, ourselves included. But our unwavering commitment to serving clients and meeting their needs over the long term guided our investments during this critical time, as it has throughout our history.\n\nSince our acquisition of Barclays Global Investors in 2009, clients in more than 100 countries have entrusted BlackRock with $1.7 trillion of net new assets. Our assets under management have grown from $3.3 trillion to $8.7 trillion. As we have grown, we have prioritized using our increased scale to benefit our clients, through lower fees and trading costs and better investment sourcing. We consistently invested in our talented employees through development programs and benefits that supported both their",

We created more than 7,500 jobs for new employees to join us. We invested in our culture and in defining our purpose, which unify us and serve as our constant north star, guiding all of our long-term decisions. We invested in our communities through partnerships with impact-driven organizations. We continuously enhanced our disclosures to increase transparency and accountability between BlackRock and our stakeholders. As a result of our continued investments in all our stakeholders, our stock delivered nearly 400% total return for our shareholders over the past decade, exceeding peers and broader markets. 2\n\nOur purpose, strategy and responsibility to society are all interconnected. By investing in BlackRock for the long term, we are able to better serve our clients, strengthen our culture, inspire and reward our employees and help advance our communities, which ultimately drives our ability to deliver long-term durable profits for our shareholders.\n\n## BlackRock's 2020 results\n\nWhile we did not design our operating model with this pandemic or an almost entirely virtual work environment in mind, the strength of our culture\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nand long history of connecting a global and growing organization on one technology platform enabled us to adapt quickly as the world shifted to working remotely. This helped us to not miss a beat in serving our clients when they most needed our help. And that in turn resonated in our 2020 results.\n\nMore than any year before, 2020 highlighted the benefits of our unified Aladdin platform. Aladdin enabled us to rebuild BlackRock beyond its walls and deliver operational resilience, advice and solutions for our clients. Aladdin also enabled more than 250 thirdparty Aladdin clients - asset managers, asset owners, banks and insurance clients - to operate seamlessly during this time.\n\nOur strong 2020 performance was possible because of the dedication and tireless effort of our 16,500 employees. Throughout the past year, we have kept the health and safety of our employees and their families as the top priority. We committed to our employees, including those whose jobs were dependent on people being in the office, that we would not eliminate any roles as a result of the pandemic in 2020. We also implemented efforts to support employees, including company-paid COVID-19 diagnostic and antibody testing, and free on-demand physical, mental and emotional healthcare programs.\n\nBlackRock's success in 2020 meant we were able to do more to support our communities when they needed it most. We committed to donating $50 million to COVID-19 relief efforts, and to date, we have deployed more than half of this commitment to 60 food relief, community support and frontline response organizations serving the hardest-hit areas across 18 countries. BlackRock is also helping people in vulnerable communities build financial stability through job readiness programs and access to saving strategies and tools. By supporting organizations such as Generation, which trains job seekers across 14 countries with the skills necessary to access stable employment in high-demand sectors, BlackRock is advancing our purpose of helping more and more people experience financial well-being.\n\n## The importance of our culture\n\nAs I think about how far BlackRock has come in serving our clients and delivering for shareholders since becoming a public company, culture has been critical to creating value.\n\nThrough most of the past year, more than 90% of BlackRock employees worked from their homes. During these times, I realized the strength of our culture, how it binds us together and how it propels us forward. It's reflected in: our employees' deep sense of responsibility to help more and more people experience financial well-being; BlackRock's investment in our employees, their families and communities; and in our commitment to running our business sustainably for the benefit of all stakeholders.\n\nWe never take our culture for granted. It's why we invest so heavily and consistently in cultivating it and are relentless at ensuring that it is lived each day. Working from home makes it difficult, however, to nurture our culture in the same way we're able to in person. We have employees, including more than 400 graduate program analysts, who have never set foot in our offices nor met their colleagues face-to-face. I firmly believe the culture we want can't be built or maintained remotely over the long term and I am looking forward to having more people return to the office.\n\nBlackRock's high-performance culture is what enables us to stay ahead of clients' needs. It challenges us to be forward-thinkers, problem solvers and innovators. A high-performance culture also requires diversity, empathy, equity, respect and inclusion.\n\nI know our culture is not perfect. It depends on the contribution of 16,500 individuals. And in some cases, certain employees have not upheld BlackRock's standards. I have made it clear to employees that we want to know when that happens, and those individuals don't have a place at BlackRock. Rooting out misconduct - and ensuring an environment that doesn't allow it - is critical to building the\n\nculture we all aspire to and ensuring everyone can experience BlackRock at its best. That is why we are taking a number of actions internally to promote an environment of respect and inclusivity and making enhancements to our processes for investigating employee complaints. At the same time, we have retained an external law firm to conduct a review of recent reports of employee-workplace matters and to provide recommendations on how we might further enhance our processes and procedures.\n\nBlackRock must have a supportive, welcoming, inclusive and equitable work environment. This includes drawing on the expertise of people with varied backgrounds and perspectives.\n\nJust as we ask of other companies, we have a long-term strategy aimed at improving diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) at BlackRock.\n\nOur goal is to build, develop and retain a diverse talent pipeline while fostering a culture where everyone feels seen, heard and empowered to thrive. Our strategy includes: mitigating bias in our hiring and talent management practices; providing professional development, sponsorship and executive coaching opportunities; raising awareness of DEI matters; and resetting behavioral expectations across the organization. In order to execute on our strategy, DEI needs to be owned by everyone at BlackRock and we must hold each other accountable.\n\nTo truly drive change, we must embed DEI into everything we do. Advancing a more equitable and inclusive environment begins by examining our own culture and talent practices, but we cannot be content to stop there. Our global strategy aims to advance DEI holistically. We are focused on racial equity and social justice in our investment and stewardship activities, and we're using our voice to advocate for public policy changes that promote social justice. We are also enhancing connectivity and engagement with minority businesses that support our client investment activities, including by increasing our partnerships with diverse brokers, asset managers and vendors. We cannot help more and more people experience financial well-being without advancing equity and social justice.",

        "page_content": "## Our long-term strategy is guided by our purpose\n\nBlackRock's culture and purpose are centered around our clients' needs, and that is what guides our longterm strategy for growth. We built the industry's most comprehensive investment platform across active and index, asset classes, geographies and exposures, all unified by one culture and one technology platform so we can focus on clients and support them with solutions no matter their objective or risk preference. BlackRock's ability to be a whole portfolio partner for clients has proven to be critical, as more institutional and wealth clients are turning to us for help to build more resilient portfolios.\n\nBlackRock's strategy for future growth, which our Global Executive Committee carefully reviews with our Board of Directors each year, is aligned with our purpose and centers on helping clients navigate their most complex challenges as the investment landscape and the world change around them. By accelerating growth in iShares , illiquid alternatives and technology, keeping alpha at the heart of BlackRock and being a global leader in sustainable investing, BlackRock is uniquely positioned to provide whole portfolio solutions for clients. This is leading to deeper and more comprehensive relationships with more clients and we believe will enable us to continue to deliver on our 5% organic base fee growth target. 3\n\n## Making Investing Easier and More Affordable for More People\n\nOur mission to help people save for the future starts with making it easier and more affordable for people to be invested in the capital markets.\n\nOur more than 1,100 iShares ETFs make it simpler for anyone to access market opportunities anywhere in the world. In Brazil, for example, we launched the country's first locally-listed ETF, making it easier for Brazilians to access global markets through a single investment at a low cost. In Germany, more than one million people contribute monthly to ETF savings plans composed of iShares ETFs. These plans allow regular investments for just one or two euros, meaning people can start investing earlier and in a way that works best for them. And our iShares Fixed Income ETFs once again proved their resilience, making it easier for anyone to buy and sell bundles of bonds while sidestepping a legacy marketplace that remains fragmented and comparatively difficult to access.\n\nBy giving individuals access to an entire market through a single investment, wealth managers an opportunity to customize portfolios in a more efficient and scalable way, and institutions the ability to allocate capital, adjust positions and manage risk more simply, iShares ETFs are unlocking tens of millions of new investors who are using this technology to help them achieve their goals. This has driven the growth of our iShares assets under management from $500 billion in 2009 to $2.7 trillion today.\n\n3 Target is based on estimates and assumptions. There is no guarantee that it will be achieved.\n\n## Our Strategy for Long-Term Growth\n\n## Drive growth engines\n\n## iShares\n\nAladdin\n\nLead as whole portfolio advisor\n\nKeep active at the heart of BlackRock\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Private Markets\n\nBecome the global leader in sustainable investing\n\nTarget\n\nGrowth\n\nTo drive the next leg of growth for iShares , we are investing in new product innovation in areas like Fixed Income and Sustainable ETFs, offering value and quality across all our products and helping more people use iShares ETFs in more ways.\n\n## An Ability to Generate Differentiated Returns When Clients Need It Most\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent monetary and fiscal policy actions from governments and central banks across the world has had a profound impact on investment portfolios. With equity markets near record highs and interest rates globally near historic lows, more and more investors are adjusting their portfolio allocations in search of alpha to help them achieve their objectives.\n\nBlackRock has evolved our platform over time to better position ourselves to deliver more durable alpha across public and private markets and help more people reach their goals. That's why we are investing heavily in areas such as investment sourcing, data analytics and technology, while leveraging our global scale and reach.\n\nPrivate markets in particular are becoming a critical component for alpha. More and more clients I speak with are looking to increase their allocations to illiquid alternatives for the yield and uncorrelated returns they offer, and we believe there is no manager better positioned to partner with clients than BlackRock. We are investing in product innovation, such as our Long Term Private Capital strategy, that seeks to better align incentives and meets client needs for longer duration solutions. We are advancing sustainable strategies, including through our global renewable power platform, which help clients capture investment opportunities presented by the transition to a net zero emissions economy. And we are investing in technology, such as eFront, to give clients greater transparency and an integrated view of their whole portfolio so they can better understand what is happening across their public and private investments.\n\n## Making Investing Clearer and More Informed with Aladdin\n\nLast year, I wrote that the biggest change for asset managers will be how technology is used. In the future, asset managers will have to be as good at using technology as anything else they do - and as good at it as any tech firm. This became even more apparent during the pandemic as coronavirus worries injected severe bouts of extreme market volatility into the financial ecosystem. In this rapidly changing market environment, Aladdin delivered operational resilience and risk analysis that enabled BlackRock and the Aladdin community to adapt.\n\nBy creating a whole portfolio ecosystem with straight-through processing, we are making Aladdin the language of portfolios across public and private\n\nmarkets, while also providing greater scale and efficiency for clients. We are investing to bring Aladdin onto the cloud, partnering with leading providers like Snowflake, to make it easier for investors to analyze the exponential amount of data available to them and accelerate the pace of innovation in Aladdin . And we are investing in rapidly growing spaces like sustainability - both organically and through minority investments such as Clarity AI - to position Aladdin for the future of asset management.\n\nAt the heart of Aladdin is a data processing and risk management platform. As risks change over time, we are constantly monitoring the impact on companies and as a result, on our clients' portfolios. We see a very real example of this related to climate change and the risks and opportunities it presents. Climate risk, and other risks related to a company's longterm sustainability, is investment risk. And over the last several years, there has been a proliferation of data related to the impacts of climate change on businesses and society. We launched Aladdin Climate to extend our capabilities to help BlackRock and our Aladdin clients better understand the impacts of both physical risk and transition risk associated with climate change on their portfolios.\n\nThrough Aladdin Climate, we are building tools and analytics to track investment portfolios' trajectories toward net zero emissions, quantifying the impact of climate change on strategies ranging from cash management to illiquid alternatives, and helping catalyze increasingly robust and standardized climate data and metrics so more investors can understand, report and act on climate change.\n\n## Advancing Sustainable Investing to Drive Better Outcomes for Investors\n\nBlackRock's commitment to sustainability is embedded across our business because our deeply held investment conviction is that integrating sustainability can help investors build more resilient portfolios and achieve better long-term, risk-adjusted returns. That is why we have made sustainability integral to the way we manage risk, generate alpha, build portfolios and pursue investment stewardship.\n\nAs the pandemic took hold, we saw investors of all types and sizes choose to tilt their investments toward sustainability-focused companies in greater magnitude than ever before. Investors in mutual funds and ETFs invested more than $360 billion globally in sustainable assets in 2020, more than double the amount invested in 2019. 4 BlackRock captured a leading $68 billion of net new assets across our sustainable investment strategies.\n\nEarlier this year, I asked all companies BlackRock is invested in on behalf of our clients to disclose a plan for how their business model will be compatible with a net zero economy, because every company will be profoundly affected.",

        "page_content": "BlackRock's net zero commitment centers on helping clients prepare their portfolios for a net zero world, and our ambition is to have net zero emissions across all our assets under management by 2050.\n\nIn line with this ambition, I'm proud that BlackRock announced recently that we joined the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative.\n\nWe are committed to making our ambition a reality and we are evolving our business to embed the management of climate-related risks and opportunities across our strategy and operations. As we outlined in our 2021 sustainability commitments, we are: advocating for companies to transition their own business models; offering our clients more choice to reallocate their capital; helping clients realize the substantial investment opportunities that will come from the climate transition; and investing in better data, tools and technology to measure and assess the impact on portfolios of climate and other sustainability factors.\n\n## The importance of government policy -including mandatory disclosure -in advancing toward net zero\n\nAchieving a net zero economy will require both technological innovation and planning over decades. Much of the conversation is currently focused on public companies and their role in that transition. They have an important role to play. Government, however, must play the leadership role in addressing this crisis: setting standards, creating the right incentives, putting a price on carbon and investing in the technology and infrastructure required for the energy transition. Every level of government working in partnership with the private sector is required to ensure a just transition that protects people's livelihoods, vulnerable communities and developing nations.\n\nWithin the corporate world, the focus today is primarily on public companies - and understandably so. BlackRock has been a major advocate of enhancing public companies' disclosure of sustainability data. This will benefit both investors and broader society. But we cannot overlook the role of private companies as well. If large private companies are not held to the same level of scrutiny as public companies, we will create an unintended incentive to shift carbon-intensive assets to markets with less transparency and, often, less regulation. This might make public companies look better but will do nothing to advance us toward a net zero economy by 2050. By contrast, global implementation of carbon pricing mechanisms is an essential tool for reducing demand for fossil fuels.\n\nI believe that private markets will play an indispensable role in the net zero transition. Many of the investments needed, such as renewable power infrastructure, are best financed through private structures. In addition, the decarbonization technologies needed to achieve net zero are highly experimental and demand investors, often private entities, with a high tolerance for risk and a long investment timeline.\n\nI strongly believe we also need a comprehensive disclosure regime that covers not only public companies, but large private companies as well. In many areas, such as carbon disclosure, I believe that voluntary disclosure can be best and companies shouldn't wait for government-mandated disclosure. However, climate risk is both such a significant investment risk and massive societal risk that I believe we need a globally-consistent sustainability reporting framework. The business ministry in the U.K. and the SEC in the U.S. are already moving forward on enhanced disclosure, which I support. Global consistency is critical, and I urge regulators across the globe to work together on this front.\n\nA consistent set of reporting standards will promote access to consistent, high-quality and material public information that will enable both asset owners and asset managers to make more informed decisions about how to achieve durable long-term returns. Crucially, to ease companies' concerns as they adopt these disclosures for the first time, governments should pair any mandate with temporary legal protections to shield companies from liability, as long as they make a best effort at representing material risks.\n\n## The silent crisis of retirement and what BlackRock is doing to help millions of people build savings\n\nTo build a more just and equitable society for more people, we also need to address the retirement crisis. While challenges vary country by country, we've\n\n## 2020 Sustainability Actions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 100% of active and advisory strategies ESGintegrated, covering $2.9 trillion in AUM\n- \u00b7 Introduced 100 new sustainable solutions in 2020 to provide investors with more choice\n- \u00b7 Launched Aladdin Climate, setting a new standard for assessing environmental risks across asset classes in investment portfolios\n- \u00b7 Added 1,200 sustainability metrics to Aladdin to enable clients to understand ESG and physical climate risks\n- \u00b7 Intensified engagement and transparency through investment stewardship\n\n## 2021 Sustainability Commitments\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 Incorporating climate considerations into our capital markets assumptions, which underpins portfolio construction at BlackRock\n- \u00b7 Publishing a temperature alignment metric for our public equity and bond funds, where sufficient data is available\n- \u00b7 Implementing a 'heightened-scrutiny model' in our active portfolios as a framework for managing holdings that pose significant\n\nknown for a long time that millions of people are approaching retirement with inadequate savings. In the U.S., nearly 50% of households over 55 years old have no retirement savings. 5 In Latin America, many existing retirement systems are unable to accommodate the growing wealth creation and rising income levels that are bringing millions of people into the middle class. And in several countries across East and Southeast Asia, an aging population is posing a significant challenge for their retirement systems.\n\nA year like 2020 puts people even further behind. The loss of millions of jobs as a result of the pandemic is causing real pain for families today, with many individuals now thinking they're going to have to continue to work in some capacity during retirement. And for too many people, retirement planning is deprioritized because of imminent needs.\n\nBlackRock is committed to building more intuitive, resilient retirement solutions so that more people can save for retirement. We are working with governments and the private sector across dozens of countries to provide our retirement system expertise, insights, products and services. With more than half of our assets linked to retirement, BlackRock's commitment to addressing the silent retirement crisis across the world is instrumental to our future success as an organization and central to fulfilling our purpose.\n\n- climate risk (including flagging holdings for potential exit)\n- \u00b7 Launching investment products with explicit temperature alignment goals, including products aligned to a net zero pathway\n- \u00b7 Using stewardship to encourage the companies that our clients are invested in to both mitigate climate risk and consider the opportunities presented by the net zero transition\n\n## Investing in growing markets, like China, to help more and more people experience financial well-being\n\nOur focus on investing for the long term and living our purpose is also reflected in the way we approach growing markets. The Chinese market represents a significant opportunity to help meet the long-term goals of investors in China and internationally. It also provides us an opportunity to help address the challenge of retirement for millions of people in China.\n\nMany of our global clients are looking to BlackRock to help them invest in this market for the return opportunities and portfolio diversification that Chinese assets offer. Although China represents the second-largest economy and capital market in the world, Chinese equity and bond markets are only 3% owned by foreign investors. 6\n\nWe are also committed to helping more people in China meet their long-term goals, such as retirement. China has a high savings rate, but most of that money is currently in bank accounts, where it is generating only a small amount of interest. For China to address its retirement challenge, these assets must be put to work in products that can offer greater returns.",

        "page_content": "As China's capital markets continue to open to foreign firms, BlackRock has taken meaningful actions to expand our onshore presence and respond to the needs of our clients. We are in the final stages of receiving regulatory approvals to set up a wholly-owned fund management company and an asset management joint venture with China Construction Bank and Temasek. As BlackRock deepens its partnerships and grows its presence in China, I am optimistic that we can help create a better future for more people.\n\n## Commitment to lead by example: Importance of transparency to drive accountability\n\nWhen BlackRock went public over 20 years ago, we understood that with access to more capital came greater responsibility. Being a public company brought a new type of transparency and discipline to our firm, with constant feedback from the market on where we were succeeding and where we needed to improve. At the time - in 1999 - that meant reporting quarterly and annual financial results and telling the market who we were, because few people knew us. Now, more than 20 years later, the external demand from all stakeholders for more transparency is growing exponentially. And it's no longer just about financial metrics.\n\nBlackRock's shareholders want more information to assess material sustainability risks and opportunities. They want to know: How does BlackRock instill and maintain its culture? What is BlackRock doing to advance racial and gender equity within our own organization and beyond our walls? What is BlackRock's strategy for achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050?\n\nClients increasingly want more transparency on their investments. They want to know what they're holding, from the underlying stocks and bonds in their portfolio to the carbon emissions of that portfolio. BlackRock has invested in making carbon emissions data and ESG scores available for our iShares ETFs and mutual funds globally, and we are working to raise the bar for transparency across the industry in pursuit of helping clients and meeting their needs.\n\nWe recognize that as our company has grown, there is increasing interest from all stakeholders in our stewardship efforts and we committed to providing more transparency on our work. For example, in 2020 we published 57 vote bulletins, which explain our vote decisions, and the engagement and analysis underpinning them, on certain high-profile proposals at company shareholder meetings. This is five times more than in the previous three years combined.\n\nAs a leading asset manager, we also embrace a broader set of responsibilities to improve markets and the investment landscape for all investors through our public policy efforts. We always strive for open dialogue and transparency on the important\n\nissues that we advocate for: policies that increase financial market transparency, protect investors and facilitate responsible growth of capital markets.\n\nEffective disclosure drives accountability and can lead to real change in how companies are managed for the benefit of all stakeholders. We are at the beginning of a major shift in the way companies provide data and disclosures and BlackRock intends to meet the same standards of transparency that our stewardship team asks of others and to lead by example. It is why we released our first Task Force on Climaterelated Financial Disclosures (TCFD)-aligned and Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB)aligned reports in 2020. It is why we released the EEO-1 data on the racial, ethnic and gender diversity of our workforce. It is also why we are expanding our Scope 3 emissions reporting to include the aggregate emissions attributable to the investment portfolios we manage on our clients' behalf, where data permits, and will be announcing an interim target on the proportion of our assets that will be aligned to net zero by 2030. As the sustainability landscape evolves, we will continue to refine and expand our disclosures to help all stakeholders assess our efforts on material environmental, social and governance matters.\n\nIn every aspect of our work, we are cognizant that whether we are working with asset management or Aladdin clients, counterparties, regulators, employees, communities or shareholders, we must always act in a way that will earn and maintain the trust and respect of those we interact with . That begins with acting in a transparent and accountable way, and we take this approach with all our stakeholders.\n\n## Guided by our Board of Directors\n\nMuch of BlackRock's success can be attributed to our engaged Board of Directors who act as stewards on behalf of our shareholders in overseeing BlackRock's management and operations, evaluating risk and opportunities for our business and challenging our management team. The Board regularly reviews the pillars that underpin BlackRock's ability to generate long-term value and our directors have played an integral role in helping us navigate our business through the pandemic.\n\nA key component of preparing the firm for the future is preparing the next generation of leaders. While I have no intention of leaving BlackRock anytime soon, I have worked diligently with the Board over the past decade on building a strong bench of talent that represents the breadth of our business. We continue to move our senior leaders into new roles that provide them with the diversity of experience, global perspective and One BlackRock mindset that will allow them to lead BlackRock to new heights long after Rob Kapito and I have moved on.\n\nThe diverse backgrounds of our individual directors also play a significant role in their ability to oversee our business from a variety of perspectives. We\n\n## Total return since BlackRock's IPO\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: S&P Global. The performance graph is not necessarily indicative of future investment performance. Please refer to the Important Notes section on page 25 for information on constituents of the SNL U.S. Asset Manager Index.\n\nmake diversity in gender, race, ethnicity, age, career experience and nationality, as well as diversity of mind, a priority when considering director candidates.\n\nIn March of this year, our Board voted unanimously to nominate Hans Vestberg, Chairman and CEO of Verizon, for election at our annual meeting. Hans brings a tremendous amount of senior leadership and international experience, as well as deep knowledge of technology and sustainability. I believe the Board and BlackRock will benefit greatly from his wisdom as we expand in key markets in Europe, use technology to continue transforming our business and further embed sustainability into our investment processes and corporate practices.\n\nAt the same time, we are incredibly fortunate to have had Mathis Cabiallavetta, who will be retiring from our Board this year, as a valued director of BlackRock. Mathis has given the Board invaluable guidance and leadership over his time with us. His global and financial expertise and knowledge of European financial markets has been critical as we have grown in the EMEA region and as a firm globally. His passion and dedication to BlackRock will be missed by the entire Board and by the BlackRock leadership team.\n\nWe will continue to evolve our Board over time to reflect the breadth of our global business and to guide us as we move forward in an ever-changing environment.\n\n## Moving forward together: Our commitment to you\n\nJust as BlackRock is a fiduciary to our clients, helping them invest for the future, I recognize many of you are investing in BlackRock to achieve your own long-term goals and I want to thank you for your continued support.\n\nBy investing in and operating our business for the benefit of all stakeholders, BlackRock has been able to deliver durable, long-term profitability for you - our shareholders. Since our company went public in 1999, our stock has delivered over 7,500% in total return and we will continue leveraging our scale, globally diverse investment platform and capabilities in technology and portfolio construction to differentiate ourselves as we look ahead.\u2077\n\nWe will continue to live by our purpose so we can: help millions of people invest to build savings; make investing easier and more affordable; advance sustainable investing; and contribute to a more resilient economy.\n\nAnd we will be guided by our culture and a set of newly enriched principles that reflect who we are today and in the future:\n\nWe are a fiduciary to our clients. Their interests come first.\n\nWe are One BlackRock. We work collaboratively to create the best outcomes for our clients, our firm and the communities where we operate.\n\nWe are passionate about performance. We are relentless about finding better ways to serve clients and improve our firm.\n\nWe take emotional ownership. The people we serve entrust us to help them prepare for the future. Our culture is defined by the deep sense of responsibility we feel to our clients and to each other.\n\nWe are committed to a better future. We are longterm thinkers, focused on helping people build a better tomorrow. And we always strive to serve more people, and to find new and innovative ways to help them achieve financial well-being.\n\nSincerely,\n\nLaurence D. Fink Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEach year, I have the privilege of writing to you about BlackRock's outlook and plans for the future.

Business\n\n## OVERVIEW\n\nBlackRock, Inc. (together, with its subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise indicates, 'BlackRock' or the 'Company') is a leading publicly traded investment management firm with $8.68 trillion of assets under management ('AUM') at December 31, 2020. With approximately 16,500 employees in more than 30 countries who serve clients in over 100 countries across the globe, BlackRock provides a broad range of investment management and technology services to institutional and retail clients worldwide.\n\nBlackRock's diverse platform of alpha-seeking active, index and cash management investment strategies across asset classes enables the Company to tailor investment outcomes and asset allocation solutions for clients. Product offerings include single- and multi-asset portfolios investing in equities, fixed income, alternatives and money market instruments. Products are offered directly and through intermediaries in a variety of vehicles, including open-end and closed-end mutual funds, iShares \u00ae exchange-traded funds ('ETFs'), separate accounts, collective trust funds and other pooled investment vehicles. BlackRock also offers technology services, including the investment and risk management technology platform, Aladdin \u00ae , Aladdin Wealth, eFront, Cachematrix and FutureAdvisor, as well as advisory services and solutions to a broad base of institutional and wealth management clients. The Company is highly regulated and manages its clients' assets as a fiduciary. The Company does not engage in proprietary trading activities that could conflict with the interests of its clients.\n\nBlackRock serves a diverse mix of institutional and retail clients across the globe. Clients include tax-exempt institutions, such as defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans, charities, foundations and endowments; official institutions, such as central banks, sovereign wealth funds, supranationals and other government entities; taxable institutions, including insurance companies, financial institutions, corporations and third-party fund sponsors, and retail intermediaries.\n\nBlackRock maintains a significant global sales and marketing presence that is focused on establishing and maintaining retail and institutional investment management and technology service relationships by marketing its services to investors directly and through third-party distribution relationships, including financial professionals and pension consultants.\n\nBlackRock is an independent, publicly traded company, with no single majority shareholder and over 85% of its Board of Directors consisting of independent directors.\n\nManagement seeks to deliver value for stockholders over time by, among other things, capitalizing on BlackRock's differentiated competitive position, including:\n\n- \u00b7 the Company's focus on strong performance providing alpha for active products and limited or no tracking error for index products;\n- \u00b7 the Company's global reach and commitment to best practices around the world, with approximately 50% of employees outside the United States serving clients locally and supporting local investment capabilities. Approximately 40% of total AUM is managed for clients domiciled outside the United States;\n- \u00b7 the Company's breadth of investment strategies, including market-cap weighted index, factors, systematic active, traditional fundamental active, high conviction alpha and illiquid alternative product offerings, which enhance its ability to tailor wholeportfolio investment solutions to address specific client needs;\n- \u00b7 the Company's differentiated client relationships and fiduciary focus, which enable effective positioning toward changing client needs and macro trends including the secular shift to index investing and ETFs, a focus on income and retirement, increasing demand for sustainable investment strategies and barbelling using index, active and illiquid alternatives products; and\n- \u00b7 the Company's longstanding commitment to innovation, technology services and the continued development of, and increased interest in, BlackRock technology products and solutions, including Aladdin , Aladdin Wealth, eFront, Cachematrix, and FutureAdvisor. This commitment is further extended by minority investments in distribution technologies including Envestnet, Scalable Capital, iCapital, Acorns and Embark. In January 2021, BlackRock also announced a minority investment in Clarity AI, a sustainability analytics and data science platform.\n\nBlackRock operates in a global marketplace impacted by changing market dynamics and economic uncertainty, factors that can significantly affect earnings and stockholder returns in any given period.\n\nThe Company's ability to increase revenue, earnings and stockholder value over time is predicated on its ability to generate new business, including business in Aladdin and other technology products and services. New business efforts depend on BlackRock's ability to achieve clients' investment objectives, in a manner consistent with their risk preferences, to deliver excellent client service and to innovate in technology to serve clients' evolving needs. All of these efforts require the commitment and contributions of BlackRock employees. Accordingly, the ability to attract, develop and retain talented professionals is critical to the Company's long-term success.\n\nBlackRock Annual Report 2020",

In general, reported AUM reflects the valuation methodology that corresponds to the basis used for determining revenue (for example, net asset value). Reported AUM does not include assets for which BlackRock provides risk management or other forms of nondiscretionary advice, or assets that the Company is retained to manage on a shortterm, temporary basis.\n\nInvestment management fees are typically earned as a percentage of AUM. BlackRock also earns performance fees on certain portfolios relative to an agreed-upon benchmark or return hurdle. On some products, the Company also may earn securities lending revenue. In addition, BlackRock offers its proprietary Aladdin investment system as well as risk management,\n\noutsourcing, advisory and other technology services, to institutional investors and wealth management intermediaries. Revenue for these services may be based on several criteria including value of positions, number of users, implementation go-lives, software solution delivery and support, and hosting services.\n\nAt December 31, 2020, total AUM was $8.68 trillion, representing a CAGR of 13% over the last five years. AUM growth during the period was achieved through the combination of net market valuation gains, net inflows and acquisitions, including BofA Global Capital Management, which added $80.6 billion of AUM in 2016, the First Reserve Transaction, which added $3.3 billion of AUMin 2017 and the net AUM impact from the TCP Transaction, the Citibanamex Transaction, the Aegon Transaction and the DSP Transaction, which added $27.5 billion of AUM in 2018. Our AUM mix encompasses a broadly diversified product range, as described below.\n\nThe Company considers the categorization of its AUM by client type, product type, investment style, and client region useful to understanding its business. The following discussion of the Company's AUM will be organized as follows:\n\n| Client Type     | Product Type      | Investment Style         | Client Region                                 |\n|-----------------|-------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| \u00b7 Retail        | \u00b7 Equity          | \u00b7 Active                 | \u00b7 Americas                                    |\n| \u00b7 iShares ETFs  | \u00b7 Fixed Income    | \u00b7 Index and iShares ETFs | \u00b7 Europe, the Middle East and Africa ('EMEA') |\n| \u00b7 Institutional | \u00b7 Multi-asset     |                          | \u00b7 Asia-Pacific                                |\n|                 | \u00b7 Alternatives    |                          |                                               |\n|                 | \u00b7 Cash Management |                          |                                               |\n\n## CLIENT TYPE\n\nBlackRock serves a diverse mix of institutional and retail clients across the globe, with a regionally focused business model. BlackRock leverages the benefits of scale across global investment, risk and technology platforms while at the same time using local distribution presence to deliver solutions for clients. Furthermore, our structure facilitates strong teamwork globally across both functions and regions in order to enhance our ability to leverage best practices to serve our clients and continue to develop our talent.\n\nClients include tax-exempt institutions, such as defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans, charities,\n\nfoundations and endowments; official institutions, such as central banks, sovereign wealth funds, supranationals and other government entities; taxable institutions, including insurance companies, financial institutions, corporations and third-party fund sponsors, and retail intermediaries.\n\niShares ETFs are a growing component of both institutional and retail client portfolios. However, as iShares ETFs are traded on exchanges, complete transparency on the ultimate end-client is unavailable. Therefore, iShares ETFs are presented as a separate client type below, with investments in iShares ETFs by institutions and retail clients excluded from figures and discussions in their respective sections.\n\nBlackRock Annual Report 2020",

Fixed income net inflows were diversified across exposures and products, with strong flows into high yield, total return and core bond offerings. Equity net inflows of $7.5 billion were led by flows into high-performing technology, health sciences and US growth equities franchises. Alternatives net inflows of $4.2 billion were driven by flows into the BlackRock Alternative Capital Strategies and Global Event Driven funds. Multi-asset net inflows of $2.8 billion included the successful close of the $2.2 billion BlackRock Capital Allocation Trust.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020, BlackRock announced the acquisition of Aperio, a pioneer in customizing tax-optimized index equity separately managed accounts ('SMA'), to enhance our wealth platform and provide whole-portfolio solutions to ultra-high\n\nBlackRock Annual Report 2020\n\nnet worth advisors.

Alternatives net inflows of $3.7 billion reflected demand for European Absolute Alpha and Global Event Driven funds.

The resilience and performance of iShares fixed income ETFs in periods of market disruption during the year drove increased confidence among investors that ETFs are valuable tools for liquidity, price transparency and market exposure, leading to strong inflows throughout 2020. iShares equity net inflows of $76.3 billion were driven by flows into sustainable and core equity ETFs. iShares Sustainable ETFs saw net inflows of $43.8 billion in 2020, primarily into equities, with AUM tripling to nearly $80 billion. iShares multi-asset and alternative ETFs contributed a combined $19.7 billion of net inflows, primarily into commodities funds.\n\niShares ETFs represented 33% of long-term AUM at December 31, 2020 and 40% of long-term base fees for 2020.\n\nComponent changes in iShares ETFs AUM for 2020 are presented below.\n\n| (in millions)    | December 31, 2019   | Net inflows (outflows)   | Market change   | FX impact   | December 31, 2020   |\n|------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|-----------------|-------------|---------------------|\n| Equity           | $ 1,632,972         | $ 76,307                 | $ 186,918       | $ 8,904     | $ 1,905,101         |\n| Fixed income     | 565,790             | 88,894                   | 28,009          | 7,340       | 690,033             |\n| Multi-asset      | 5,210               | 646                      | 388             | 24          | 6,268               |\n| Alternatives (1) | 36,093              | 19,038                   | 12,331          | 143         | 67,605              |\n| Total            | $ 2,240,065         | $ 184,885                | $ 227,646       | $ 16,411    | $ 2,669,007         |\n\nOur broad iShares ETF product range offers investors a precise, transparent and efficient way to gain exposure to a full range of asset classes and global markets that have been difficult for many investors to access, as well as the liquidity required to make adjustments to their exposures quickly and cost-efficiently.\n\n- \u00b7 USiShares ETF 1 AUMended 2020 at $2.0 trillion with $114.8 billion of net inflows driven by strong demand\n- 1 RegionaliSharesETF amounts based on jurisdiction of product, not underlying client.\n\n## Institutional\n\nBlackRock serves institutional investors on six continents in sub-categories including: pensions, endowments and foundations, official institutions, and financial institutions; institutional AUM is diversified across product and region.\n\nComponent changes in institutional long-term AUM for 2020 are presented below.\n\n| (in millions)   | December 31, 2019   | Net inflows (outflows)   | Market change   | FX impact   | December 31, 2020   |\n|-----------------|---------------------|--------------------------|-----------------|-------------|---------------------|\n| Active:         |                     |                          |                 |             |                     |\n| Equity          | $ 141,118           | $ 1,890                  | $ 24,045        | $ 2,469     | $ 169,522           |\n| Fixed income    | 651,368             | 6,598                    | 49,712          | 8,591       | 716,269             |\n| Multi-asset     | 434,233             | 13,639                   | 52,365          | 11,005      | 511,242             |\n| Alternatives    | 111,951             | 9,497                    | 3,861           | 2,120       | 127,429             |\n| Active subtotal | 1,338,670           | 31,624                   | 129,983         | 24,185      | 1,524,462           |\n| Index:          |                     |                          |                 |             |                     |\n| Equity          | 1,793,826           | (68,543)                 | 254,475         | 26,991      | 2,006,749           |\n| Fixed income    | 792,969             | 39,685                   | 67,623          | 27,441      | 927,718             |\n| Multi-asset     | 8,239               | (591)                    | 749             | 202         | 8,599               |\n| Alternatives    | 4,848               | 732                      | (50)            | 87          | 5,617               |\n| Index subtotal  | 2,599,882           | (28,717)                 | 322,797         | 54,721      | 2,948,683           |\n| Total           | $ 3,938,552         | $ 2,907                  | $ 452,780       | $ 78,906    | $ 4,473,145         |\n\nBlackRock Annual Report 2020\n\nfor a diverse range of fixed income, sustainable, core equity and commodities ETFs.\n\n- \u00b7 International iShares ETF 1 AUMended 2020 at $678.8 billion with net inflows of $70.1 billion, similarly reflecting strong flows into fixed income, sustainable and core equity ETFs.",

BlackRock is among the world's largest managers of pension plan assets with $3.0 trillion, or 66%, of long-term institutional AUM managed for defined benefit, defined contribution and other pension plans for corporations, governments and unions at December 31, 2020. The market landscape continues to shift from defined benefit to defined contribution, and our defined contribution channel represented $1.2 trillion of total pension AUM. BlackRock remains well positioned to capitalize on the on-going evolution of the defined contribution market and demand for outcome-oriented investments. An additional $76.9 billion, or 2%, of long-term institutional AUM was managed for other tax-exempt investors, including charities, foundations and endowments.\n- \u00b7 Official Institutions. BlackRock managed $275.4 billion, or 6%, of long-term institutional AUM for official institutions, including central banks, sovereign wealth funds, supranationals, multilateral entities and government ministries and agencies at year-end 2020. These clients often require specialized investment advice, the use of customized benchmarks and training support.\n- \u00b7 Financial and Other Institutions. BlackRock is a top independent manager of assets for insurance companies, which accounted for $450.3 billion, or 10%, of long-term institutional AUM at year-end 2020. Assets managed for other taxable institutions, including corporations, banks and third-party fund sponsors for which the Company provides sub-advisory services, totaled $696.6 billion, or 16%, of long-term institutional AUM at year-end.\n\n## CLIENT TYPE AND PRODUCT TYPE\n\nComponent changes in AUM by client type and product type for 2020 are presented below.\n\n| (in millions)          | December 31, 2019   | Net inflows (outflows)   | Market change   | FX impact   | December 31, 2020   |\n|------------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|-----------------|-------------|---------------------|\n| Retail:                |                     |                          |                 |             |                     |\n| Equity                 | $ 252,413           | $ 39,341                 | $ 42,545        | $ 4,135     | $ 338,434           |\n| Fixed income           | 305,265             | 22,784                   | 9,725           | 2,694       | 340,468             |\n| Multi-asset            | 120,439             | (481)                    | 12,262          | 404         | 132,624             |\n| Alternatives           | 25,180              | 7,912                    | 929             | 370         | 34,391              |\n| Retail subtotal        | 703,297             | 69,556                   | 65,461          | 7,603       | 845,917             |\n| iShares ETFs:          |                     |                          |                 |             |                     |\n| Equity                 | 1,632,972           | 76,307                   | 186,918         | 8,904       | 1,905,101           |\n| Fixed income           | 565,790             | 88,894                   | 28,009          | 7,340       | 690,033             |\n| Multi-asset            | 5,210               | 646                      | 388             | 24          | 6,268               |\n| Alternatives           | 36,093              | 19,038                   | 12,331          | 143         | 67,605              |\n| iShares ETFs subtotal  | 2,240,065           | 184,885                  | 227,646         | 16,411      | 2,669,007           |\n| Institutional:         |                     |                          |                 |             |                     |\n| Active:                |                     |                          |                 |             |                     |\n| Equity                 | 141,118             | 1,890                    | 24,045          | 2,469       | 169,522             |\n| Fixed income           | 651,368             | 6,598                    | 49,712          | 8,591       | 716,269             |\n| Multi-asset            | 434,233             | 13,639                   | 52,365          | 11,005      | 511,242             |\n| Alternatives           | 111,951             | 9,497                    | 3,861           | 2,120       | 127,429             |\n| Active subtotal        | 1,338,670           | 31,624                   | 129,983         | 24,185      | 1,524,462           |\n| Index:                 |                     |                          |                 |             |                     |\n| Equity                 | 1,793,826           | (68,543)                 | 254,475         | 26,991      | 2,006,749           |\n| Fixed income           | 792,969             | 39,685                   | 67,623          | 27,441      | 927,718             |\n| Multi-asset            | 8,239               | (591)                    | 749             | 202         | 8,599               |\n| Alternatives           | 4,848               | 732                      | (50)            | 87          | 5,617               |\n| Index subtotal         | 2,599,882           | (28,717)                 | 322,797         | 54,721      | 2,948,683           |\n| Institutional subtotal | 3,938,552           | 2,907                    | 452,780         | 78,906      | 4,473,145           |\n| Long-term              | 6,881,914           | 257,348                  | 745,887         | 102,920     | 7,988,069           |\n| Cash management        | 545,949             | 113,349                  | (63)            | 7,017       | 666,252             |\n| Advisory               | 1,770               | 20,141                   | 445             | 3           | 22,359              |\n| Total                  | $ 7,429,633         | $ 390,838                | $ 746,269       | $ 109,940   | $ 8,676,680         |\n\nLong-term product offerings include alpha-seeking active and index strategies. Our alpha-seeking active strategies seek to earn attractive returns in excess of a market benchmark or performance hurdle while maintaining an appropriate risk profile and leverage fundamental research and quantitative models to drive portfolio construction. In contrast, index strategies seek to closely track the returns of a corresponding index, generally by investing in substantially the same underlying securities within the index or in a subset of those securities selected to approximate a similar risk and return profile of the index. Index strategies include both our non-ETF index products and iShares ETFs.\n\nAlthough many clients use both alpha-seeking active and index strategies, the application of these strategies may differ. For example, clients may use index products to gain exposure to a market or asset class or may use a combination of index strategies to target active returns. In addition, institutional non-ETF index assignments tend to be very large (multi-billion dollars) and typically reflect low fee rates. Net flows in institutional index products generally have a small impact on BlackRock's revenues and earnings.\n\n## Equity\n\nYear-end 2020 equity AUM totaled $4.4 trillion, reflecting net inflows of $49.0 billion. Net inflows included $76.3 billion and $30.2 billion into iShares ETFs and active, respectively, partially offset by non-ETF index net outflows\n\nof $57.5 billion. Record active equity net inflows were driven by flows into high-performing technology, health sciences and US growth fundamental equities franchises, as well as flows into quantitative strategies.\n\nBlackRock's effective fee rates fluctuate due to changes in AUMmix. Approximately half of BlackRock's equity AUM is tied to international markets, including emerging markets, which tend to have higher fee rates than US equity strategies. Accordingly, fluctuations in international equity markets, which may not consistently move in tandem with US markets, have a greater impact on BlackRock's equity revenues and effective fee rate.\n\nEquity represented 55% of long-term AUM and 50% of long-term base fees for 2020.\n\n## Fixed Income\n\nFixed income AUM ended 2020 at $2.7 trillion, reflecting net inflows of $158.0 billion. iShares ETFs net inflows of $89.0 billion were led by flows into US investment grade corporate, core and high yield bond funds. Non-ETF index net inflows of $42.1 billion were driven by demand for liability-driven investment solutions and index mutual funds. Active net inflows of $26.9 billion reflected strong flows in high yield, Asian, total return and core bond offerings.\n\nFixed income represented 34% of long-term AUM and 30%of long-term base fees for 2020.\n\nBlackRock Annual Report 2020",

Investment\n\nsolutions might include a combination of long-only portfolios and alternative investments as well as tactical asset allocation overlays.\n\nMulti-asset represented 8% of long-term AUM and 10% of long-term base fees for 2020.\n\nComponent changes in multi-asset AUM for 2020 are presented below.\n\n| (in millions)                 | December 31, 2019   | Net inflows (outflows)   | Market change   | FX impact   | December 31, 2020   |\n|-------------------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|-----------------|-------------|---------------------|\n| Target date/risk              | $ 277,078           | $ 21,261                 | $ 39,143        | $ 1,236     | $ 338,718           |\n| Asset allocation and balanced | 185,454             | (9,578)                  | 12,693          | 2,632       | 191,201             |\n| Fiduciary                     | 105,589             | 1,530                    | 13,928          | 7,767       | 128,814             |\n| Total                         | $ 568,121           | $ 13,213                 | $ 65,764        | $ 11,635    | $ 658,733           |\n\nMulti-asset net inflows reflected ongoing institutional demand for our solutions-based advice with $13.0 billion of net inflows coming from institutional clients. Defined contribution plans of institutional clients remained a significant driver of flows and contributed $14.8 billion to institutional multi-asset net inflows in 2020, primarily into target date and target risk product offerings.\n\nThe Company's multi-asset strategies include the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Target date and target risk products generated net inflows of $21.3 billion. Institutional investors represented 90% of target date and target risk AUM, with defined contribution plans representing 84% of AUM. Flows were driven by defined contribution investments in our LifePath offerings. LifePath products utilize a proprietary active asset allocation overlay model that seeks to balance risk and return over an investment horizon based on the investor's expected retirement timing. Underlying investments are primarily index products.\n- \u00b7 Asset allocation and balanced products represented 29%of multi-asset AUM at year-end. These strategies combine equity, fixed income and alternative components for investors seeking a tailored solution relative to a specific benchmark and within a risk budget. In certain cases, these strategies seek to minimize downside risk through diversification, derivatives strategies and tactical asset allocation decisions. Flagship products include our Global Allocation and Multi-Asset Income fund families. This category also includes FutureAdvisor ,a digital wealth management platform that provides financial institutions with technology-enabled investment advisory capabilities to manage their clients' investments.\n- \u00b7 Fiduciary management services are complex mandates in which pension plan sponsors or endowments and foundations retain BlackRock to assume responsibility for some or all aspects of investment management, often with BlackRock acting as outsourced chief investment officer. These\n\nBlackRock Annual Report 2020\n\ncustomized services require strong partnership with the clients' investment staff and trustees in order to tailor investment strategies to meet client-specific risk budgets and return objectives.\n\n## Alternatives\n\nBlackRock alternatives focus on sourcing and managing high-alpha investments with lower correlation to public markets and developing a holistic approach to address client needs in alternatives investing. Our alternatives products fall into three main categories - 1) illiquid alternatives, 2) liquid alternatives, and 3) currency and commodities. Illiquid alternatives include offerings in alternative solutions, private equity, opportunistic and credit, real estate and infrastructure. Liquid alternatives include offerings in direct hedge funds and hedge fund solutions (funds of funds).\n\nIn 2020, liquid and illiquid alternatives generated a combined $17.4 billion of net inflows, or $25.7 billion excluding return of capital/investment of $8.3 billion. The largest contributors to return of capital/investment were private equity solutions, infrastructure and opportunistic and credit strategies. Net inflows were driven by direct hedge funds, infrastructure, private equity and opportunistic and credit strategies. At year-end, BlackRock had approximately $24 billion of non-fee paying, unfunded, uninvested commitments, which are expected to be deployed in future years; these commitments are not included in AUM or flows until they are fee-paying. Currency and commodities saw $19.8 billion of net inflows, primarily into commodities iShares ETFs.\n\nBlackRock believes that as alternatives become more conventional and investors adapt their asset allocation strategies, investors will further increase their use of alternative investments to complement core holdings. BlackRock's highly diversified alternatives franchise is well positioned to continue to meet growing demand from both institutional and retail investors.\n\nAlternatives represented 3% of long-term AUM and 10% of long-term base fees for 2020.\n\n36\n\n37\n\nComponent changes in alternatives AUM for 2020 are presented in the table below.\n\n| (in millions)                             | December 31, 2019   | Net inflows (outflows)   | Market change   | FX impact   | December 31, 2020   | Memo: return of capital/ investment (1)   | Memo: committed capital (2)   |\n|-------------------------------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|-----------------|-------------|---------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Illiquid alternatives:                    |                     |                          |                 |             |                     |                                           |                               |\n| Alternative solutions                     | $ 3,980             | $ 179                    | $ 72            | $ 37        | $ 4,268             | $ (623)                                   | $ 3,919                       |\n| Private equity and opportunistic:         |                     |                          |                 |             |                     |                                           |                               |\n| Private equity solutions                  | 14,374              | 2,644                    | (171)           | 98          | 16,945              | (2,960)                                   | 4,975                         |\n| Opportunistic and credit strategies       | 11,109              | 1,750                    | 47              | 144         | 13,050              | (1,727)                                   | 4,965                         |\n| Long Term Private Capital                 | 2,430               | 1,029                    | -

In 2020, alternative solutions portfolios had $4.3 billion in AUM.\n- \u00b7 Private Equity and Opportunistic included AUM of $16.9 billion in private equity solutions, $13.0 billion in opportunistic and credit offerings, and $3.5 billion in Long Term Private Capital ('LTPC'). Net inflows of $5.4 billion into private equity and opportunistic strategies included $2.6 billion of net inflows into private equity solutions, $1.8 billion of net inflows into opportunistic and credit offerings and $1.0 billion of net inflows into LTPC.\n- \u00b7 Real Assets, which includes infrastructure and real estate, totaled $48.0 billion in AUM, reflecting net inflows of $5.3 billion, led by infrastructure deployments.\n\n## Liquid Alternatives\n\nThe Company's liquid alternatives products' net inflows of $6.5 billion reflected net inflows of $5.7 billion and $0.8 billion from direct hedge funds and hedge fund solutions, respectively. Direct hedge fund AUM includes a variety of single- and multi-strategy offerings.\n\n## Currency and Commodities\n\nThe Company's currency and commodities products include a range of active and index products.\n\nCurrency and commodities products had $19.8 billion of net inflows, primarily driven by iShares ETFs. iShares ETFs commodities products represented $67.6 billion of AUM and are not eligible for performance fees.\n\n## Cash Management\n\nCash management AUM totaled $666.3 billion at December 31, 2020, reflecting a record $113.3 billion of net inflows. Cash management products include taxable and tax-exempt money market funds, short term investment funds and customized separate accounts. Portfolios are denominated in US dollars, Canadian dollars, Australian dollars, Euros, Swiss Francs, New Taiwan Dollars or British pounds. Strong growth in cash management reflects BlackRock's success in leveraging scale for clients and delivering innovative digital distribution and risk management solutions.\n\nBlackRock is currently voluntarily waiving a portion of its management fees on certain money market funds to ensure that they maintain a minimum level of daily net investment income. During 2020, these waivers resulted in a reduction of management fees of approximately $35 million, which was partially offset by a reduction of BlackRock's distribution and servicing costs paid to financial intermediaries. BlackRock has provided voluntary yield support waivers in prior periods and may increase or decrease the level of yield support waivers in future periods.

Aladdin is our proprietary technology platform, which serves as the investment and risk management system for both BlackRock and a growing number of institutional investors around the world. BlackRock offers risk reporting capabilities via Aladdin Risk, as well as investment accounting capabilities. Aladdin Provider is a tool used by BlackRock's custodial partners, connecting them to the platform to add operational efficiency. In 2020, BlackRock launched Aladdin Climate, a software application offering investors measures of both the physical risk of climate change and the transition risk to a low-carbon economy on portfolios with climate-adjusted security valuations and risk metrics. In 2019, BlackRock acquired eFront, a leading end-to-end alternative investment management software and solutions provider to enable clients to manage portfolios and risk across public and private asset classes on a single platform. Through our Cachematrix platform, BlackRock is also a leading provider of financial technology which simplifies the cash management process for banks and their corporate clients in a streamlined, open-architecture platform.\n\nBlackRock offers a number of wealth management technology tools offering digital advice, portfolio construction capabilities and risk analytics for retail distributors. These tools include Aladdin Wealth, which provides wealth management firms and their financial professionals with institutional-quality business management, portfolio construction, modeling and risk analytics capabilities, and FutureAdvisor, a digital wealth management platform that provides financial institutions with technology-enabled investment advisory capabilities to manage their clients' investments.\n\nTechnology services revenue of $1.1 billion was up 17% year-over-year, reflecting the impact of the eFront acquisition and continued growth in Aladdin . Aladdin , which represented the majority of technology services revenue for the year, continues to benefit from trends favoring global investment platform consolidation and\n\nmulti-asset risk solutions. Aladdin assignments are typically long-term contracts that provide recurring revenue.\n\nAt year-end, BlackRock technology services clients included banks, insurance companies, official institutions, pension funds, asset managers, asset servicers, retail distributors and other investors across North America, South America, Europe, Asia and Australia.\n\nIn addition, BlackRock has made minority investments in the digital distribution companies Envestnet, Scalable Capital, iCapital, Acorns and Embark. In January 2021, BlackRock also announced a minority investment in Clarity AI, a sustainability analytics and data science platform. BlackRock records its share of income related to minority investments accounted for under the equity method in other revenue and records gains and losses related to changes in value of other minority investments in nonoperating income (expense).\n\n## SECURITIES LENDING\n\nSecurities lending is managed by a dedicated team, supported by quantitative analysis, proprietary technology and disciplined risk management. BlackRock receives both cash (primarily for US domiciled portfolios) and noncash collateral under securities lending arrangements. The cash management team invests the cash received as collateral for securities on loan in other portfolios. Fees for securities lending for US domiciled portfolios can be structured as a share of earnings, or as a management fee based on a percentage of the value of the cash collateral or both. The value of the securities on loan and the revenue earned are captured in the corresponding asset class being managed. The value of the collateral is not included in AUM.\n\nOutstanding loan balances ended the year at approximately $352 billion, up from $290 billion at year-end 2019. Continued asset gathering in lending products and strong market performance resulted in higher balances compared to 2019. On average, relative to 2019, intrinsic lending spreads were lower, while average cash reinvestment spreads increased. Cash reinvestment spreads increased significantly in the second quarter, primarily as a result of cuts to the Federal Funds Target rate band in March and market dislocations during the period.\n\nBlackRock employs a conservative investment style for cash and securities lending collateral that emphasizes quality, liquidity and interest rate risk management. Disciplined risk management, including a rigorous credit surveillance process, is an integral part of the investment process. BlackRock's Cash Management Credit Committee has established risk limits, such as aggregate issuer exposure limits and maturity limits, across many of the products BlackRock manages, including over all of its cash management products. In the ordinary course of our business, there may be instances when a portfolio may exceed an internal risk limit or when an internal risk limit may be changed. No such instances, individually or in the aggregate, have been material to the Company. To the extent that daily evaluation and reporting of the profile of the portfolios identify that a limit has been exceeded, the relevant portfolio will be adjusted. To the extent a portfolio manager would like to obtain a temporary waiver of a risk\n\nBlackRock Annual Report 2020",

        "page_content": "limit, the portfolio manager must obtain approval from the credit research team, which is independent from the cash management portfolio managers. While a risk limit may be waived temporarily, such waivers are infrequent.\n\n## RISK & QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS\n\nAcross all asset classes, in addition to the efforts of the portfolio management teams, the Risk & Quantitative Analysis ('RQA') group at BlackRock draws on extensive analytical systems and proprietary and third-party data to identify, measure and manage a wide range of risks. RQA provides risk management advice and independent risk oversight of the investment management processes, identifies and helps manage counterparty and enterprise risks, coordinates standards for firm wide investment performance measurement and determines risk management-related analytical and information requirements. Where appropriate, RQA will work with portfolio managers and developers to facilitate the development or improvement of risk models and analytics.\n\n## COMPETITION\n\nBlackRock competes with investment management firms, mutual fund complexes, insurance companies, banks, brokerage firms and other financial institutions that offer products that are similar to, or alternatives to, those offered by BlackRock. In order to grow its business, BlackRock must be able to compete effectively for AUM. Key competitive factors include investment performance track records, the efficient delivery of beta for index products, investment style and discipline, price, client service and brand name recognition. Historically, the Company has competed principally on the basis of its long-term investment performance track record, its investment process, its risk management and analytic capabilities and the quality of its client service.\n\n## HUMAN CAPITAL\n\nWith approximately 16,500 employees in more than 30 countries, BlackRock provides a broad range of investment and technology services to institutional and retail clients in more than 100 countries across the globe. As an asset manager, BlackRock's long-term sustainability depends on its people and how it manages its workforce.\n\n## Culture and Principles\n\nBlackRock believes that developing a strong corporate culture is an important component of its human capital management practices and critical to the firm's long-term success. BlackRock's culture is underpinned by five core principles that unify its workforce: (1) We are a fiduciary to our clients; (2) We are One BlackRock; (3) We are passionate about performance; (4) We take emotional ownership; and (5) We are committed to a better future.\n\n## Diversity, Equity and Inclusion ('DEI')\n\nBlackRock believes a diverse workforce and an equitable and inclusive working environment are key factors in achieving better outcomes across all levels of its business. BlackRock has made a long-term commitment to cultivating diversity in its workforce and leadership team,\n\n40\n\n41\n\nBlackRock Annual Report 2020\n\nthrough its hiring, retention, promotion and development practices. As part of its long-term commitment, BlackRock has instituted a multi-year DEI strategy that it believes is actionable, measurable and designed to apply across the many countries in which the firm operates. The Company has aligned its DEI strategy with the firm's business priorities and long-term objectives and expects that it will evolve as the firm learns and adapts to a changing macro environment.\n\nA key goal of BlackRock's DEI strategy is developing a diverse talent pipeline through ongoing investment in recruiting, retention and engagement. In connection with this goal, the Company has: (1) expanded partnerships with external organizations and developed strategies to increase the diversity of its applicant pool; (2) strengthened talent acquisition and management processes in an effort to eliminate bias; and (3) implemented leadership development, sponsorship and coaching initiatives to engage and develop diverse talent. Another focus of BlackRock's DEI strategy is to cultivate an inclusive work environment in which employees feel connected to BlackRock's culture and supported in pursuit of their goals. To this end, BlackRock has committed to raising awareness of racial equity issues and resetting behavioral expectations for employees, as well as to holding firm leaders and managers accountable for continued progress against the firm's goals.\n\nBlackRock views transparency and accountability as a critical part of its DEI strategy, including as a means to inform, measure and improve its human capital management practices. To that end, in 2020 the firm published its first SASB-aligned disclosure, which includes information regarding workforce diversity that BlackRock plans to update annually. During 2020, it also set goals for increasing the overall workplace representation of Black and Latinx employees and growing the number of female, and US Black and Latinx, leaders (Director and above).\n\n## Board Oversight of Human Capital Management\n\nBlackRock's Board of Directors (the 'Board') plays an important role in the oversight of human capital management at BlackRock and devotes one full Board meeting annually to an in-depth review of BlackRock's culture, talent development, retention and recruiting initiatives, DEI strategy, leadership and succession planning and employee feedback. Moreover, year-end business assessments, which include a review of the progress that is being made against the firm's DEI goals, influence individual compensation outcomes that are reviewed and approved by the Board's Management Development and Compensation Committee.\n\nSuccession planning for BlackRock's Chief Executive Officer and other senior executives is a key part of the Board's annual review of human capital management issues. As part of this review, the Board focuses on whether BlackRock has the right people in place to execute the Company's long-term strategic plans, and on BlackRock's ability to identify, attract, develop and retain future senior executives. An important element of the succession planning across the organization is a commitment to building leadership from within and increasing diversity in leadership roles.\n\n## Employee Engagement\n\nBlackRock prioritizes continuous dialogue with its employees about their experiences at the firm in order to understand employee expectations and assess the efficacy of its human capital management practices. The Company uses several employee feedback mechanisms, including: (i) employee opinion surveys; (ii) interactive townhalls and communications; and (iii) the sponsorship of employee, professional and social impact networks. These employee engagement mechanisms provide BlackRock with actionable feedback for each team and for BlackRock as a whole. BlackRock's employee, professional and social impact networks also provide additional forums and opportunities for employees with diverse backgrounds to connect with one another and shape the firm's culture. More recently, these networks played an active role in BlackRock's response to COVID-19, including by instituting programs to combat isolation and more deeply understand the employee experience during the pandemic. The networks, which continue to grow in number, are sponsored by senior leaders and designed by employees, for employees.\n\n## Compensation, Wellness and Benefits\n\nBlackRock is committed to responsible business practices and believes that investing in the physical, emotional, mental and financial well-being of its employees is a critical component of the firm's human capital management strategy. To that end, the Company designs its compensation and benefits practices to: (i) attract and retain employees; (ii) align employee incentives and risk taking with that of the firm's and the interests of its clients; and (iii) support employees across many aspects of their lives. The Company has a strong pay-for-performance culture and an annual compensation process that takes into consideration firmwide results, individual business results and employee performance, as well as market benchmarks. BlackRock also offers a wide range of benefits that it regularly reviews in accordance with industry best practices and the local requirements of its offices, including retirement savings plans, a Flexible Time Off ('FTO') policy and flexible working arrangements, and parental leave and family support benefits, including fertility benefits, adoption and surrogacy assistance, and backup elder and childcare benefits. The Company provides comprehensive healthcare and mental-health benefits to eligible employees, including medical, dental and vision coverage, health savings and spending accounts, counseling services, an employee assistance program and access to telemedicine services.\n\nBlackRock prioritizes protecting the rights of its workforce and the equitable treatment of its employees. The Company has implemented policies related to harassment prevention and compliance with equal employment opportunity and overtime regulations. BlackRock is also committed to providing a safe and healthy working environment for its workforce. To do this, it designs global programs, including environmental and occupational health and safety programs, to meet or exceed local requirements. Moreover, BlackRock encourages all of its employees to raise issues of concern and assures employees that they may do so without fear of retaliation.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has further highlighted the importance of keeping employees safe and healthy and, following its onset, BlackRock implemented several\n\ninitiatives to support employees. The Company prioritized communication about the telemedicine and digital health resources it makes available, including mental, emotional and physical health offerings. In addition, BlackRock extended cross-border healthcare coverage and support to employees and their dependents temporarily working, or on FTO, outside of their home country as a result of the pandemic.\n\n## Training, Innovation and Development\n\nBlackRock is committed to innovation, learning and reinvention in all areas of its business and believes that developing the capabilities of its employees is integral to delivering long-term value. To that end, the Company's human capital management practices are designed to provide opportunities for employees to learn, innovate and enhance their skillsets at every stage of their career. These opportunities, which include the firm's comprehensive online suite of interactive resources and courses ( BlackRock Academies ), play an important role in engaging BlackRock's employees.\n\nIn addition, BlackRock believes that developing strong leaders is a driver of the firm's success. Select employees are invited to participate in leadership programs to help accelerate their growth, which include executive coaching, in-person and virtual learning, and senior management sponsorship.\n\n## REGULATION\n\nVirtually all aspects of BlackRock's business are subject to various laws and regulations around the world, some of which are summarized below. These laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect investment advisory clients, investors in registered and unregistered investment companies, and trust and other fiduciary clients of BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. ('BTC'). Under these laws and regulations, agencies that regulate investment advisers, investment funds and trust banks and other individuals and entities have broad administrative powers, including the power to limit, restrict or prohibit the regulated entity or person from carrying on business if it fails to comply with such laws and regulations. Possible sanctions for significant compliance failures include the suspension of individual employees, limitations on engaging in certain lines of business for specified periods of time, revocation of investment adviser and other registrations or bank charters, censures and fines both for individuals and BlackRock.\n\nThe rules governing the regulation of financial institutions and their holding companies and subsidiaries are very detailed and technical. Accordingly, the discussion below is general in nature, does not purport to be complete and is current only as of the date of this report.\n\n## GLOBAL REGULATORY REFORM\n\nBlackRock's business may be impacted by numerous regulatory reform initiatives occurring around the world. Any such initiative, or any new laws or regulations or changes to, or in the enforcement of, existing laws or regulations, could materially and adversely impact the scope or profitability of BlackRock's business activities, lead to business disruptions, require BlackRock to alter its\n\nBlackRock Annual Report 2020",

        "page_content": "business or operating activities and expose BlackRock to additional costs (including compliance and legal costs) as well as reputational harm. BlackRock's profitability also could be materially and adversely affected by modification of the rules and regulations that impact the business and financial communities in general, including changes to the laws governing banking, taxation, antitrust regulation and electronic commerce.\n\n## Systemically Important Financial Institution ('SIFI') Review\n\nThe Financial Stability Oversight Council ('FSOC') has the authority to designate nonbank financial institutions as SIFIs in the United States under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 ('Dodd-Frank'). In July 2014, the FSOC pivoted from its previous entity-specific approach to designation and indicated that it would focus on a products and activitiesbased approach to designation in connection with addressing potential risks in the financial system related to asset management. In December 2019, the FSOC re-affirmed this approach when it voted to change its methodology for assessing financial stability to a products and activities-based approach. This reduces the risk of entity-level designation, however it remains too early to predict the direction of the forthcoming regulatory environment and the FSOC retains the authority to designate an entity if an activities-based approach does not adequately address potential risks. In the event that BlackRock is designated as a SIFI, it could become subject to enhanced regulatory requirements and direct supervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve (the 'Federal Reserve').\n\n## Federal Trade Commission Proposal\n\nIn September 2020, the Federal Trade Commission ('FTC') released a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking proposing updates to premerger notification rules enacted under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 ('HSR') that require parties to certain transactions to provide the FTC and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice prior notice and observe a waiting period before consummation of such transactions. The proposals would: (i) require that investors aggregate holdings in an issuer across all associated funds when assessing HSR filing and exemption thresholds and (ii) create a new exemption for acquisitions resulting in aggregate holdings of up to 10% of an issuer, which would be unavailable to investors holding interests of more than 1%in competing firms. If enacted as drafted, the proposal requiring aggregation across associated funds could, absent exemptions for index-funds or certain types of registered funds, substantially increase BlackRock's pre-merger notification obligations, which may be costly, impair funds' ability to trade freely, require the implementation of monitoring tools and introduce additional compliance burdens for both BlackRock and the companies in which it invests. In instances where making a pre-merger notification may not be practicable, the proposed changes may serve to limit the size of BlackRock's aggregate position in certain issuers.\n\n## Taxation\n\nBlackRock's businesses may be directly or indirectly affected by tax legislation and regulation, or the modification of existing tax laws, by US or non-US tax\n\n42\n\n43\n\nBlackRock Annual Report 2020\n\nauthorities. In the US, legislation at both the federal and state level has been previously proposed to enact a financial transaction tax ('FTT') on stocks, bonds and a broad range of financial instruments and derivative transactions. In the European Union ('EU'), certain Member States have also enacted similar FTTs and the European Commission ('EC') has proposed legislation to harmonize these taxes and provide for the adoption of EU-level legislation applicable to some (but not all) EU Member States. If enacted as proposed, FTTs could have an adverse effect on BlackRock's financial results and clients' performance results.\n\nThe application of tax regulations involves numerous uncertainties and, in the normal course of business, US and non-US tax authorities may review and challenge tax positions adopted by BlackRock. These challenges may result in adjustments to, or impact the timing or amount of, taxable income, deductions or other tax allocations, which may adversely affect BlackRock's effective tax rate and overall financial condition. Similarly, the Company manages assets in products and accounts that have investment objectives which may conform to tax positions adopted by BlackRock or to specific tax rules. To the extent there are changes in tax law or policy, or regulatory challenges to tax positions adopted by BlackRock, the value or attractiveness of such investments may be diminished and BlackRock may suffer financial or reputational harm.\n\n## Regulation of Swaps and Derivatives\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission ('SEC'), Federal Reserve, the Internal Revenue Service and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ('CFTC') each continue to review practices and regulations relating to the use of futures, swaps and other derivatives. Such reviews could result in regulations that restrict or limit the use of such products by funds or accounts. If adopted, any such limitations or restrictions could require BlackRock to change certain business practices or implement new compliance processes, which could result in additional costs and/or restrictions.\n\nIn October 2020, the SEC adopted new regulations governing the use of derivatives by registered investment companies ('RICs'), including mutual funds (other than money market funds), ETFs and closed-end funds, as well as business development companies. RICs will be required to implement and comply with the new rule by the third quarter of 2022. Once implemented, the rule will, among other things, impose limits on the amount of derivatives transactions a RIC can enter into, eliminate the current asset segregation compliance framework and introduce new compliance requirements for funds, including the establishment of comprehensive risk management programs. The rule may impact certain RICs' usage of derivatives and investment strategy.\n\nJurisdictions outside the US in which BlackRock operates have adopted and implemented, or are in the process of considering, adopting or implementing, more pervasive regulation of many elements of the financial services industry, which could further impact BlackRock and the broader markets. For example, various global rules and regulations applicable to the use of financial products by funds, accounts and counterparties that have been adopted or proposed will require BlackRock to build and\n\nimplement new compliance monitoring procedures to address the enhanced level of oversight to which it and its clients will be subject. These rules impose requirements such as mandatory central clearing of certain swaps transactions, requiring execution of certain swaps transactions on or through registered electronic trading venues (as opposed to over the phone or other execution methods), reporting transactions to central data repositories, mandating certain documentation standards, requiring the posting and collection of initial and/or variation margin for bilateral swap transactions and subjecting certain types of listed and/or over-the-counter transactions to position limit or position reporting requirements.\n\nIn the US, certain interest rate swaps and certain index credit default swaps are subject to Dodd-Frank central clearing and trading venue execution requirements, with additional products and asset classes potentially becoming subject to these requirements in the future. In the EU, central clearing and trading venue requirements for certain swap transactions have become effective for certain types of BlackRock funds and accounts. On March 1, 2017, most derivatives transactions that are not centrally cleared, including non-deliverable foreign exchange forward transactions and currency option transactions, became subject to requirements in the US, EU and numerous other jurisdictions to post or collect mark-to-market margin payments. For certain BlackRock funds and accounts, initial margin requirements may apply in the future in addition to such mark-to-market margin payments. These rules and regulations have the potential to increase the complexity and cost of trading non-cleared derivatives for BlackRock's clients, and may produce regulatory inconsistencies in global derivatives trading rules and increase BlackRock's operational and legal risks.\n\n## Regulation of Exchange-Traded Funds\n\nAs part of a focus on financial stability issues and due to the significant growth of this product class over the last few years, regulators globally are examining the implications of an increased presence of ETFs in the markets, including those related to transparency, liquidity and structural resiliency. BlackRock and other sponsors of ETFs are working with market participants and regulators to address certain of these issues but there can be no assurance that structural or regulatory reforms will be implemented in a manner favorable to BlackRock, or at all. Depending on the outcome of this renewed regulatory analysis, or any associated structural reforms, ETF products may become subject to increased regulatory scrutiny or restrictions, which may require BlackRock to incur additional compliance and reporting expenses and adversely affect the Company's business.\n\n## Regulation of Money Market Funds\n\nIn October 2016, rules were implemented to reform the regulatory structure governing US money market funds to address perceived systemic risks of money market funds. The rules require institutional prime and institutional municipal money market funds to employ a floating net asset value per share method of pricing, which allows the daily share prices of these funds to fluctuate along with changes in the market-based value of fund assets. Retail money market funds continue operating with a constant\n\nnet asset value per share. The rules additionally provide for tools for institutional and retail money market funds' boards designed to address market shocks, including the ability to impose liquidity fees and redemption gates under certain circumstances.\n\nIn addition, following market liquidity issues that arose in March 2020 in connection with the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, regulatory authorities are focused on the need for further regulation for certain money market funds. In December 2020, the President's Working Group on Financial Markets issued a report outlining ten potential policy measures for consideration to improve the resiliency of money market funds and the broader shortterm funding markets. Although it remains too early to accurately predict the forthcoming regulatory environment, including with respect to regulation of money market funds, certain of these reforms, if ever adopted, could significantly impact money market funds and the money market fund industry.\n\n## Standards of Conduct Rulemaking\n\nIn June 2019, the SEC adopted a package of rulemakings and interpretations addressing investment adviser and broker-dealer standards of conduct. The package includes new rules requiring registered advisers and registered broker-dealers to provide a relationship summary to retail investors, a new rule establishing a standard of conduct for broker-dealers when making recommendations to retail customers and two new interpretations under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the 'Advisers Act'). These rulemakings and interpretations could increase BlackRock's disclosure obligations, impact distribution arrangements between BlackRock and its distribution partners, create compliance and operational challenges for BlackRock's distribution partners and limit BlackRock's ability to provide certain other services to its clients.\n\n## Securities and Exchange Commission Rulemakings for US Registered Funds and Investment Advisers\n\nBlackRock's business may also be impacted by SEC regulatory initiatives. The SEC and its staff recently have engaged in various initiatives and reviews that seek to improve and modernize the regulatory structure governing the asset management industry, and registered investment companies in particular. These efforts relate to, among other things, embedded leverage through the use of derivatives and other trading practices, cybersecurity, liquidity, enhanced regulatory and public reporting requirements and the evaluation of systemic risks. Over the past year, the SEC has adopted rules that include among other things: (i) a new regulatory framework for fund of funds structures; and (ii) updated eligibility requirements for submitting shareholder proposals under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 'Exchange Act'). These rules, and any additional rules or regulatory initiatives resulting from the SEC's efforts, may increase BlackRock's regulatory compliance requirements as well as disclosure requirements, which could be costly and may impede BlackRock's growth.\n\n## Financial Crimes Enforcement Network Proposed Rulemaking for Registered Investment Advisers\n\nIn 2015, the Financial Crime Enforcement Network ('FinCEN') issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking\n\nBlackRock Annual Report 2020",

        "page_content": "('Proposed Rule') that would extend to a number of BlackRock's subsidiaries, which are registered or required to be registered as investment advisers with the SEC under the Advisers Act, the requirement to establish written risk-based anti-money laundering programs and report suspicious activity to FinCEN under the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 (the 'Bank Secrecy Act'). The Proposed Rule would include investment advisers within the Bank Secrecy Act's definition of 'financial institutions', which would require them to comply with the Bank Secrecy Act reporting and recordkeeping requirements. If adopted in its current form, the Proposed Rule would expose BlackRock to additional compliance costs.\n\n## British Exit from the EU\n\nOn December 31, 2020, the United Kingdom ('UK') left the EU, and the UK and EU reverted to being distinct regulatory, legal and customs territories. Although an 'EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement' was agreed to in connection with the UK's departure from the EU, it does not include any substantive provisions with respect to financial services. As a result, from January 1, 2021, crossborder financial services trade between the UK and the EU will be governed by their respective financial services regulations and market access regimes. BlackRock has implemented a number of steps to prepare for this outcome. These steps, which are and have been time consuming and costly and may add complexity to BlackRock's future European operations, include effecting organizational, governance and operational changes, applying for and receiving additional licenses and permissions in the EU, and engaging in client communications. In addition, depending on how the future relationship between the UK and the EU develops, BlackRock may experience further organizational and operational challenges and incur additional costs in connection with its European operations, particularly with regards to delegation and outsourcing, which may impede the Company's growth or impact its financial performance.\n\n## UK Overseas Funds Regime\n\nAs part of its post-EU membership regulatory review, the Financial Conduct Authority ('FCA') is reviewing the requirements it will impose on EU-domiciled funds offered into the UK. Any new requirements could introduce cost and complexity to BlackRock's cross-border business model.\n\n## Enhanced Regulatory Scrutiny of Technology Service Providers to Financial Services Firms\n\nThere has been growing regulatory scrutiny of technology service providers on which financial services firms are reliant, including the Digital Operational Resilience Act ('DORA'), which was proposed by the EC in September 2020 and focuses on direct regulation of providers and users of technology- and data services. If enacted as proposed, DORA may, among other things: (i) introduce additional governance, risk management, incident reporting, testing and information sharing requirements to a number of BlackRock's European entities and certain Aladdin clients; and (ii) subject Aladdin to broad additional oversight. Separately, in November 2020, the Financial Stability Board ('FSB') released a Consultation on Regulatory and Supervisory Issues Relating to\n\n44\n\n45\n\nBlackRock Annual Report 2020\n\nOutsourcing and Third-Party Relationships, which explores direct supervision of technology service providers to financial services firms, in addition to detailing concerns around the potential for systemic risk in the provision of such services.\n\n## Reform of Investment Markets\n\nBlackRock is subject to numerous regulatory reform initiatives that may affect the Company's provision of investment services globally. In Europe, the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive ('MiFID') governing the provision of investment services has been revised and is accompanied by an associated Regulation (together with certain secondary regulation, 'MiFID II'). The Regulation's requirements generally apply consistently across the EU. The MiFID II reforms, which came into force in January 2018, were substantive, materially changing market transparency requirements, enhancing protections afforded to investors, and increasing operational complexity for the Company. Forthcoming proposals to review the operation of MiFID II and to develop a new EU Retail Investment Strategy may affect the European market structure and impact BlackRock's ability to operate in European markets. The broad nature of the MiFID II means future reforms could also affect product development, client servicing and distribution models. Similar reforms have been introduced in Switzerland and Australia.\n\n## Macroprudential Policies for Asset Managers\n\nCertain policymakers continue to raise long-standing concerns about liquidity and leverage risks in the asset management industry and wider market-based finance sector. The COVID-19 pandemic has heightened concerns and prompted a broad review of existing financial market regulations by international standard setters and regulators across the Americas, Europe and Asia, including an assessment of the adequacy of certain structural components of current markets in mitigating risks. In the event that either the longer-standing concerns or recent broad review result in regulatory or policy action, macroprudential tools may begin to apply to open-ended investment funds broadly. BlackRock may also be required to make changes to structural features of certain open-ended investment funds. Either eventuality could limit BlackRock's ability to offer products to certain clients and/or result in clients altering their investment strategies or allocations in a manner that is adverse to BlackRock.\n\n## Revised Capital Requirements for Investment Firms\n\nIn December 2017, the EC published a proposal for a new Directive and Regulation on prudential requirements for MiFID investment firms. The proposal passed the EU legislative process and the final texts of the Regulation and Directive were published in December 2019. The new legislative package, which comes into effect in 2021, will result in changes to the amount of regulatory capital BlackRock is required to hold in the EU and how such capital is calculated, as well as introduce revised disclosure obligations for large investment firms. The UK is also proposing the adoption of comparable rules, which will apply to UK-based investment firms from 2022.\n\n## EUMarket Access\n\nThe EC and certain EU Member States have recently advanced a more restrictive approach to the need for a third country (i.e. non-EU country) to obtain 'equivalence,' which is the process by which the legal, regulatory, and/or supervisory system in non-EU Member States is recognised by the EC as comparably effective to that in the EU, thereby allowing firms established in such non-EU Member States a degree of access to the EU single market in financial services. In addition, in 2019, the EC commenced a review of the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive ('AIFMD') to assess, among other things, the conditions for delegating portfolio management mandates to third countries, the effectiveness of regulation on third country fund marketing passports and the continuation of national private placement regimes. To the extent the review results in formal legislation that limits the scope of existing permitted activities and EU market access rights for asset management firms with non-EU operations, or extends more stringent rules to the Directive on Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities ('UCITS'), BlackRock's ability to offer collective investment funds and certain investment services to EU-based clients may be adversely affected.\n\n## Senior Managers and Certification Regime ('SMCR')\n\nIn the UK, the FCA extended the SMCR to all financial services firms in December 2019. The regime imposes greater accountability and responsibility across the senior management of UK financial services firms by making individuals in impacted firms more accountable for conduct and competence. SMCR impacts nearly all staff of the Company in the UK, and requires extensive documentation to support senior managers and evidence the discharge of their responsibilities.\n\n## UK Asset Management Market Study\n\nThe FCA has adopted requirements for UK fund managers to assess whether the retail collective investments they manage offer 'value' to investors. In 2020, the Company initiated the provision of an annual assessment based upon various factors including cost, performance and comparable services. If 'value' has not been provided to consumers, the Company will need to address any identified deficiencies. The FCA also requested that the UK's Competition and Markets Authority ('CMA') assess the investment consultant and fiduciary markets. The CMA's final report identified a number of competition issues in such markets and the UK regulatory regime was revised in 2020 to introduce mandatory tendering of investment consultancy and fiduciary management services, and new standards of disclosure of fees and performance. The CMA's remedies could have a significant impact on the Company's ability to enter into fiduciary and investment management mandates with UK pension fund clients.\n\n## Sustainability Regulation\n\nIn 2018, EC introduced a number of regulatory proposals to underpin sustainable investment products; require disclosure of sustainability-related information by market participants, investments products, and issuers; and\n\nrequire the integration of sustainability considerations into the investment and risk management processes of asset managers and other institutional investors. Rules arising from the reform proposals will take effect in March 2021. Regulators in Asia have been similarly focused on sustainability reform initiatives. In December 2020, the Monetary Authority of Singapore finalized its Guidelines on Environmental Risk Management for the asset management industry. The guidelines set forth enhanced environmental risk assessment, monitoring and oversight practices that certain funds registered or licensed in Singapore will be required to implement over an 18-month transition period. The Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission proposed similar enhancements to sustainability risk management practices and disclosure requirements for funds in a Consultation Paper it issued in October 2020.\n\n## Securities Financing Transaction Regulation ('SFTR')\n\nIn November 2015, the EU introduced a regulation on the reporting and transparency of securities financing transactions and total return swaps. The SFTR aims to improve the transparency surrounding securities financing transactions and total return swaps by, among other things, requiring reporting of securities financing transactions to a trade repository and requiring disclosure of the use of securities financing transactions and total return swaps to investors. During 2020, additional obligations became effective under the SFTR that require BlackRock to submit additional transaction reports with substantive details of trading activity to authorities. Compliance with the SFTR may subject BlackRock to additional expenses and could lead to modifications in BlackRock's securities financing transaction activities.\n\n## Central Securities Depository Regulation ('CSDR')\n\nA settlement discipline regime introduced by the CSDR will become effective in February 2022. The regime includes measures to address settlement failures including rules for trade allocation and confirmation processing, along with cash penalties for failed transactions and mandatory buy-in requirements. To the extent left unchanged by a review that is scheduled to take place during 2021, the regime will require BlackRock to introduce operational mechanisms to facilitate the mandatory buy-in of securities in instances where the seller fails to deliver securities in a timely manner which, if not complied with, may subject BlackRock to penalty.\n\n## Cessation of LIBOR\n\nThe FCA, which regulates the administrator of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) has announced that it will no longer compel panel banks to submit rates for LIBOR after year-end 2021. As a result, sterling LIBOR and certain other indices which are utilized as benchmarks may no longer be published. The disappearance, or change in the manner of administration, of these benchmarks could result in adverse consequences to the return on, value of and market for any BlackRock investments in instruments and securities linked to such benchmarks. BlackRock may also face operational challenges adopting successor benchmarks.\n\nBlackRock Annual Report 2020",

        "page_content": "## EXISTING US REGULATION - OVERVIEW\n\nBlackRock and certain of its US subsidiaries are currently subject to extensive regulation, primarily at the federal level, by the SEC, the Department of Labor ('DoL'), the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ('OCC'), the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ('FINRA'), the National Futures Association ('NFA'), the FTC, the Department of Justice, the CFTC and other federal government agencies and regulatory bodies.\n\nCertain of BlackRock's US subsidiaries are also subject to various anti-terrorist financing, privacy, anti-money laundering and economic sanctions laws and regulations established by various agencies. In addition, the Advisers Act imposes numerous obligations on registered investment advisers such as BlackRock, including recordkeeping, operational and marketing requirements, disclosure obligations and prohibitions on fraudulent activities. State level regulation through Attorneys General, Insurance Commissioners and other state level agencies also applies to certain BlackRock activities.\n\nThe Investment Company Act of 1940 (the 'Investment Company Act') imposes stringent governance, compliance, operational, disclosure and related obligations on registered investment companies and their investment advisers and distributors, such as BlackRock and its affiliates. The SEC is authorized to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of the Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, ranging from fines and censure to termination of an investment adviser's registration. Investment advisers also are subject to certain state securities laws and regulations. Non-compliance with the Advisers Act, the Investment Company Act or other federal and state securities laws and regulations could result in investigations, sanctions, disgorgement, fines and reputational damage.\n\nBlackRock's trading and investment activities for client accounts are regulated under the Exchange Act, as well as the rules of various securities exchanges and self-regulatory organizations, including laws governing trading on inside information, market manipulation and a broad number of technical requirements (e.g., short sale limits, volume limitations and reporting obligations) and market regulation policies. Violation of any of these laws and regulations could result in fines or sanctions, as well as restrictions on BlackRock's activities and damage to its reputation. Furthermore, Dodd-Frank requires one of BlackRock's subsidiaries, BTC, to register as a municipal advisor (as that term is defined in the Exchange Act) with the SEC and Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board ('MSRB'). The rules subject BTC to additional regulation by the SEC and MSRB.\n\nBlackRock manages a variety of private pools of capital, including hedge funds, funds of hedge funds, private equity funds, collateralized debt obligations, collateralized loan obligations, real estate funds, collective trust funds, managed futures funds and hybrid funds. Congress, regulators, tax authorities and others continue to explore, on their own and in response to demands from the investment community and the public, increased regulation related to private pools of capital, including changes with respect to investor eligibility, certain limitations on trading activities, record-keeping and reporting, the scope of anti-fraud protections, safekeeping of client assets and a variety of other matters. BlackRock may be materially and adversely affected by new legislation, rule-making or changes in the\n\n46\n\n47\n\nBlackRock Annual Report 2020\n\ninterpretation or enforcement of existing rules and regulations imposed by various regulators in this area.\n\nCertain BlackRock subsidiaries are subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ('ERISA'), and to regulations promulgated thereunder by the DoL, insofar as they act as a 'fiduciary' under ERISA with respect to benefit plan clients that are subject to ERISA. ERISA and applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries under ERISA, prohibit certain transactions involving ERISA plan clients and impose excise taxes for violations of these prohibitions, mandate certain required periodic reporting and disclosures and require certain BlackRock entities to carry bonds insuring against losses caused by fraud or dishonesty. ERISA also imposes additional compliance, reporting and operational requirements on BlackRock that otherwise are not applicable to clients that are not subject to ERISA.\n\nBlackRock has seven subsidiaries that are registered as commodity pool operators and/or commodity trading advisors with the CFTC and are members of the NFA. The CFTC and NFA each administer a comparable regulatory system covering futures contracts and various other financial instruments, including swaps as a result of DoddFrank, in which certain BlackRock clients may invest. In addition, two of BlackRock's subsidiaries are registered with the SEC as broker-dealers and are member-firms of FINRA. Each broker-dealer has a membership agreement with FINRA that limits the scope of such broker-dealer's permitted activities. One of the broker-dealers is also a member of the MSRB and is subject to MSRB rules.\n\nIn July 2020, BlackRock's business activity in California that involves the processing of personal information became subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act ('CCPA'), which provides for enhanced consumer protections for California residents. The CCPA imposes obligations on BlackRock for the handling, disclosure and deletion of personal information for California residents. Any failure by BlackRock to comply with the CCPA may result in fines, heightened regulatory scrutiny and/or reputational harm.\n\n## USBanking Regulation\n\nOne of BlackRock's subsidiaries, BTC, is organized as a nationally-chartered limited purpose trust company that does not accept deposits or make commercial loans. Accordingly, BTC is examined and supervised by the OCC and is subject to various banking laws and regulations enforced by the OCC, such as laws and regulations governing capital adequacy, fiduciary activities, conflicts of interest, self-dealing, and the prevention of financial crime, including money laundering. BTC is also a member of the Federal Reserve System and is subject to various Federal Reserve regulations applicable to member institutions, such as regulations restricting transactions with affiliates. Many of these laws and regulations are meant for the protection of BTC and/or BTC's customers rather than BlackRock, its affiliates or stockholders.\n\n## USRegulation of Securities Financing Transactions\n\nIn its 2014 Annual Report, FSOC identified securities lending indemnification by asset managers who act as lending agents as a potential systemic risk that required further review and monitoring. The Federal Reserve is also considering whether to impose specific margin or minimum haircut requirements for securities financing transactions.\n\n## EXISTING INTERNATIONAL REGULATION OVERVIEW\n\nBlackRock's international operations are subject to the laws and regulations of a number of international jurisdictions, as well as oversight by numerous regulatory agencies and bodies in those jurisdictions. In some instances, these operations are also affected by US laws and regulations that have extra-territorial application.\n\nBelow is a summary of certain international regulatory standards to which BlackRock is subject. It is not meant to be comprehensive as there are parallel legal and regulatory arrangements in force in many jurisdictions where BlackRock's subsidiaries conduct business.\n\nOf note among the various other international regulations to which BlackRock is subject, are the extensive and complex regulatory reporting requirements that necessitate the monitoring and reporting of issuer exposure levels (thresholds) across the holdings of managed funds and accounts and those of the Company.\n\n## European Regulation\n\nThe FCA currently regulates certain BlackRock subsidiaries in the UK. It is also responsible for the conduct of business regulation of the UK branches of certain of BlackRock's US subsidiaries. In addition, the Prudential Regulation Authority ('PRA') regulates one BlackRock UK insurance subsidiary. Authorization by the FCA and (where relevant) the PRA is required to conduct certain financial services-related business in the UK under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the 'FSMA'). The FCA's rules adopted under the FSMA govern the majority of a firm's capital resources requirements, senior management arrangements, conduct of business requirements, interaction with clients, and systems and controls, whereas the rules of the PRA focus solely on the prudential requirements that apply to BlackRock's UK-based insurance subsidiary. The FCA supervises BlackRock's UK-regulated subsidiaries through a combination of proactive engagement, event-driven and reactive supervision and theme-based reviews in order to monitor BlackRock's compliance with regulatory requirements. Breaches of the FCA's rules may result in a wide range of disciplinary actions against BlackRock's UK-regulated subsidiaries and/or its employees.\n\nIn addition, BlackRock has regulated entities in France, Germany, Ireland, Jersey, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Switzerland. Each of these entities is required to comply with regulatory rules in the country in which it has been established, including the branches of the Netherlands entity which operate across the EU.\n\nBlackRock's EU-subsidiaries and branches must comply with the pan-European regulatory regime established by MiFID and its accompanying Regulation. BlackRock's UK-regulated subsidiaries must comply with the UK version of MiFID II, which regulates the provision of investment services and activities in the UK. MiFID II, and the UK equivalent of MiFID II, sets out detailed requirements governing the organization and conduct of business of investment firms and regulated markets. The legislation also includes pre- and post-trade transparency requirements for equity and non-equity markets and extensive transaction reporting requirements. Certain BlackRock UK subsidiaries must also comply with the UK\n\nregulation which implements the Consolidated Life Directive and Insurance Distribution Directive. In addition, relevant entities must comply with revised obligations on capital resources for banks and certain investment firms. These include requirements on capital, as well as matters of governance and remuneration. Relevant BlackRock entities must also comply with the requirements of the UCITS Directive and the AIFMD, as implemented in the relevant EU jurisdictions or in the UK, which impose obligations on the authorization and capital, conduct of business, organization, transparency and marketing of retail and alternative investment funds respectively that are sold in, or marketed to, the EU. The obligations introduced through these regulations and directives will affect certain of BlackRock's European operations. Compliance with the UCITS Directives and the AIFMD may subject BlackRock to additional expenses associated with depositary oversight and other organizational requirements.\n\nBlackRock's European-regulated subsidiaries are also subject to the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (or the UK equivalent regulation in the case of BlackRock's UK-regulated subsidiaries), an EU regulation governing derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories, which requires (i) the central clearing of certain over-the-counter ('OTC') derivatives; (ii) the application of risk-mitigation techniques to non-centrally cleared OTC derivatives (including the exchange of collateral with certain counterparties); and (iii) the reporting of all derivative contracts to an European Securities and Markets Authority ('ESMA') registered or recognized derivatives trade repository (or a UK authorized trade repository in the case of the UK version of EMIR).\n\nThe EU has seen an increase in Common Supervisory Actions by ESMA to coordinate supervisory action by national EU regulators, most notably in areas such as product governance, liquidity management and fund costs and charges. BlackRock's European operations may be affected to the extent this initiative results in formal legislation or action.\n\nEU Member States and many other non-US jurisdictions have adopted statutes and/or regulations concerning privacy and data protection and requiring notification of data breaches. For example, in May 2018, the EU Data Protection Directive was replaced by a more extensive General Data Protection Regulation ('GDPR'). In addition, the UK incorporated GDPR into an equivalent UK law ('UK GDPR') that became effective when it left the EU on January 1, 2021. GDPR and UK GDPR, as well as other statutes and/or regulations concerning data privacy and security, increase compliance obligations, affect BlackRock's collection, processing and retention of personal data and reporting of data breaches, and provide for increased penalties for non-compliance.\n\n## Regulation in the Asia-Pacific Region\n\nIn Japan, a BlackRock subsidiary is subject to the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act ('FIEA') and the Act on Investment Trusts and Investment Corporations. These laws are administered and enforced by the Japanese Financial Services Agency ('JFSA'), which establishes standards for compliance, including capital adequacy and financial soundness requirements, customer protection requirements and conduct of business rules. The JFSA is empowered to conduct\n\nBlackRock Annual Report 2020",

This Japanese subsidiary also holds a license for real estate brokerage activities which subjects it to the regulations set forth in the Real Estate Brokerage Act.\n\nIn Australia, BlackRock's subsidiaries are subject to various Australian federal and state laws, and certain subsidiaries are regulated by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission ('ASIC'). ASIC regulates companies and financial services activities in Australia and is responsible for promoting investor, creditor and consumer protection.\n\nThe activities of certain BlackRock subsidiaries in Hong Kong are subject to the Securities and Futures Ordinance ('SFO'), which governs the securities and futures markets and regulates, among others, offers of investments to the public and provides for the licensing of intermediaries. The SFO is administered by the Securities and Futures Commission ('SFC'). The SFC is also empowered to establish standards for compliance as well as codes and guidelines. The relevant BlackRock subsidiaries and the employees conducting any of the regulated activities specified in the SFO are required to be licensed with the SFC, and are subject to the rules, codes and guidelines issued by the SFC. BlackRock's operations in Taiwan are regulated by the Taiwan Financial Supervisory Commission, which is responsible for regulating securities markets (including the Taiwan Stock Exchange and the Taiwan Futures Exchange), the banking industry and the insurance sector.\n\nBlackRock has obtained the approval from the China Securities Regulatory Commission for setting up a Fund Management Company ('FMC') and approval from the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission for setting up a Wealth Management Joint Venture Company ('WMC') with Temasek Holdings (Pte) Ltd and China Construction Bank Corp in China. BlackRock is preparing for the next stages of the regulatory license applications process prior to being issued with final regulatory approvals and the launch of its first investment products for both the FMC and WMC.\n\nOther financial regulators oversee BlackRock subsidiaries, branches and representative offices across the AsiaPacific region, including in Singapore and South Korea. Regulators in all of these jurisdictions have authority with respect to financial services including, among other things, the authority to grant, suspend or cancel required licenses or registrations. In addition, these regulators may subject certain BlackRock subsidiaries to net capital requirements.\n\n## AVAILABLE INFORMATION\n\nBlackRock files annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and all amendments to these reports and other information with the SEC. BlackRock makes available free-of-charge, on or through its website at http://www.blackrock.com, the Company's Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements and all amendments to those filings, as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with\n\n48\n\n49\n\nBlackRock Annual Report 2020\n\nor furnished to the SEC.

Risk Factors\n\nAs a global investment management firm, risk is an inherent part of BlackRock's business. Global markets, by their nature, are prone to uncertainty and subject participants to a variety of risks. While BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identify, measure, monitor, manage and analyze market, operating, legal, compliance, reputational, fiduciary and investment risks, BlackRock's business, financial condition, operating results and nonoperating results could be materially adversely affected and the Company's stock price could decline as a result of any of these risks and uncertainties, including the ones discussed below.\n\n## MARKET AND COMPETITION RISKS\n\nChanges in the value levels of equity, debt, real assets, commodities, foreign exchange or other asset markets, as well as the impact of global trade policies and tariffs, maycause assets under management ('AUM'), revenue and earnings to decline.\n\nBlackRock's investment management revenue is primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUMand, in some cases, performance fees which are normally expressed as a percentage of returns to the client. Numerous factors, including price movements in the equity, debt or currency markets, or in the price of real assets, commodities or alternative investments in which BlackRock invests, as well as the impact of global trade policies and tariffs, could cause:\n\n- \u00b7 the value of AUM, or the returns BlackRock realizes on AUM, to decrease;\n- \u00b7 the withdrawal of funds from BlackRock's products in favor of products offered by competitors;\n- \u00b7 the rebalancing or reallocating of assets into BlackRock products that yield lower fees;\n- \u00b7 an impairment to the value of intangible assets and goodwill; or\n- \u00b7 a decrease in the value of seed or co-investment capital.\n\nThe occurrence of any of these events may cause the Company's AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\n\n## Changes in interest or foreign exchange rates and/or divergent beta may cause BlackRock's AUM and base fees to fluctuate and introduce volatility to the Company's net income and operating cash flows.\n\nIn recent years, there have been prolonged periods of historically low interest rates, interspersed with periods in which certain central banks globally began increasing rates. BlackRock's business is directly and indirectly affected by changes in global interest rates. Similarly, due to the global nature of BlackRock's operations, a portion of its business is conducted in currencies other than the US dollar. Any failure by BlackRock to manage movements in foreign exchange rates relative to the US dollar or its exposure to interest rates may cause BlackRock's AUM to fluctuate and introduce volatility to the Company's base fees, net income and operating cash flows.\n\nIn addition, beta divergence between equity markets, where certain markets perform differently than others, may lead to an increase in the proportion of BlackRock AUMweighted toward lower fee equity products, resulting in a decline in BlackRock's effective fee rate. Divergent market factors may also erode the correlation between the growth rates of AUM and base fees.\n\n## BlackRock's investment advisory contracts may be terminated or may not be renewed by clients or fund boards on favorable terms and the liquidation of certain funds may be accelerated at the option of investors.\n\nBlackRock derives a substantial portion of its revenue from providing investment advisory services. The advisory or management contracts BlackRock has entered into with its clients, including the agreements that govern many of BlackRock's investment funds, provide investors or, in some cases, the independent directors of applicable investment funds, with significant latitude to terminate such contracts, withdraw funds or liquidate funds by simple majority vote with limited notice or penalty, or to remove BlackRock as a fund's investment advisor (or equivalent). BlackRock also manages its US mutual funds, closed-end and exchange-traded funds under management contracts that must be renewed and approved annually by the funds' respective boards of directors, a majority of whom are independent from the Company. BlackRock's fee arrangements under any of its advisory or management contracts may be reduced (including at the behest of a fund's board of directors). In addition, if a number of BlackRock's clients terminate their contracts, or otherwise remove BlackRock from its advisory roles, liquidate funds or fail to renew management contracts on favorable terms, the fees or carried interest BlackRock earns could be reduced, which may cause BlackRock's AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\n\n## The failure or negative performance of products offered by competitors may cause AUM in similar BlackRock products to decline irrespective of BlackRock's performance.\n\nMany competitors offer similar products to those offered by BlackRock and the failure or negative performance of competitors' products could lead to a loss of confidence in similar BlackRock products, irrespective of the performance of such products. Any loss of confidence in a product type could lead to withdrawals, redemptions and liquidity issues in such products, which may cause the Company's AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\n\n## Increased competition may cause BlackRock's AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\n\nThe investment management industry is highly competitive and BlackRock competes based on a number of factors including: investment performance, its technology and portfolio construction offerings, the level of fees charged, the quality and breadth of services and products provided, name recognition and reputation, and its ability to develop new investment strategies and products to meet the changing needs of investors. In addition, over the past several years there has been significant consolidation in the asset management and financial services industries as investors increasingly seek out firms that have the capacity to deliver broad multiasset investment capabilities and technological expertise, including in a manner that is responsive to ever more localized needs. This consolidation, together with the introduction of new technologies, as well as regulatory changes, continues to alter the competitive landscape for investment managers, which may lead to additional fee compression or require BlackRock to invest more to modify or adapt its product offerings to attract and retain customers and remain competitive with the products, services and geographic diversity offered by other financial institutions, technology companies, trading, advisory or asset management firms. Increased competition on the basis of any of these factors, including competition leading to fee reductions on existing or new business, may cause the Company's AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\n\n## Failure to maintain Aladdin's competitive position in a dynamic market could lead to a loss of clients and could impede BlackRock's productivity and growth.\n\nThe sophisticated risk analytics, portfolio management, trade execution and investment operations that BlackRock provides via its technology platform to support investment advisory and Aladdin clients are important elements of BlackRock's competitive success. Aladdin's competitive position is based in part on its ability to combine risk analytics with portfolio management, trading and operations tools on a single platform. Increased competition from risk analytics and investment management technology providers, including as a result of growing industry consolidation giving rise to competitors with increasingly sophisticated and comprehensive product offerings, or a shift in client demand away to standalone or internally developed solutions, whether due to price competition, perceived client market share, platform flexibility or market-based or regulatory factors, may weaken Aladdin's competitive position and may cause the Company's revenue and earnings to decline. In addition, to the extent that Aladdin competitors are able to innovate more effectively than BlackRock or leverage delivery models that provide clients faster time to market, lower costs or the ability to more seamlessly combine or bundle with other service offerings, BlackRock may lose existing clients or fail to capture future market share, which may impede its productivity and growth. Moreover, although BlackRock takes steps to safeguard against infringements of its intellectual property, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to effectively protect and enforce its intellectual property rights in Aladdin .\n\nBlackRock Annual Report 2020",

Conversely, the development and introduction of new products and services, including the creation of products with a focus on environmental, social and governance matters, requires continued innovative effort on the part of BlackRock and may require significant time and resources as well as ongoing support and investment. Substantial risk and uncertainties are associated with the introduction of new products and services, including the implementation of new and appropriate operational controls and procedures, shifting client and market preferences, the introduction of competing products or services and compliance with regulatory requirements. There can be no assurance that BlackRock will be able to innovate effectively in order to develop new products or services that address the needs of its clients on the timescale they require. Any failure to develop new products and services, or successfully manage associated operational risks, could harm BlackRock's reputation and expose the Company to additional costs, which may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\n\n## Changes in the value of seed and co-investments that BlackRock owns could affect its income and could increase the volatility of its earnings.\n\nAt December 31, 2020, BlackRock's net economic investment exposure of approximately $2.9 billion in its investments (see Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsInvestments ) primarily resulted from co-investments and seed investments in its sponsored investment funds. Movements in the equity, debt or currency markets, or in the price of real assets, commodities or other alternative investments, could lower the value of these investments as well as other minority investments, increase the volatility of BlackRock's earnings and cause earnings to decline.\n\n## BlackRock indemnifies certain securities lending clients for specified losses as a result of a borrower default.\n\nBlackRock provides borrower default indemnification to certain of its securities lending clients. In the event of a borrower default, BlackRock would use the collateral pledged by the borrower to repurchase securities out on loan in order to replace them in a client's account. Borrower default indemnification is limited to the shortfall that occurs in the event the collateral available at the time of the borrower's default is insufficient to repurchase those securities out on loan. BlackRock requires all borrowers to mark to market their pledged collateral daily to levels in excess of the value of the securities out on loan to mitigate the likelihood of the indemnity being triggered. Where the collateral is in the form of cash, the indemnities BlackRock provides do not guarantee, assume or otherwise insure the investment performance or return of any cash collateral vehicle into which that cash collateral is invested. The amount of securities on loan as of December 31, 2020 and subject to this type of\n\n50\n\n51\n\nBlackRock Annual Report 2020\n\nindemnification was $270 billion. In the Company's capacity as lending agent, cash and securities totaling $289 billion was held as collateral for indemnified securities on loan at December 31, 2020. Significant borrower defaults occurring simultaneously with rapid declines in the value of collateral pledged and/or increases in the value of the securities loaned may create collateral shortfalls, which could result in material liabilities under these indemnities and may cause the Company's revenue and earnings to decline.\n\n## BlackRock's decision to provide support to particular products from time to time, or the inability to provide support, may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\n\nWhile not legally mandated, BlackRock may, at its option, from time to time choose to support investment products through capital or credit support for commercial or other reasons. Any decision by BlackRock to support products may utilize capital and liquidity that would otherwise be available for other corporate purposes. BlackRock's ability to support certain products may be restricted by regulation or by the Company's failure to have or make available sufficient capital or liquidity. Moreover, inherent constraints arising from the business models of certain asset managers, including BlackRock, may during periods of market volatility result in BlackRock having fewer options for accessing liquidity than asset managers with alternate business models, which may adversely impact its ability to support certain products. Any decision by BlackRock to support particular products, or the inability to provide such support, may result in losses, which may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\n\n## Increased geopolitical unrest and other events outside of BlackRock's control could adversely affect the global economy or specific international, regional and domestic markets, which may cause BlackRock's AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\n\nGeopolitical risks, including those arising from trade tension and/or the imposition of trade tariffs, European fragmentation, unrest in the Middle East and terrorist activity, as well as acts of civil or international hostility, are increasing. Similarly, other events outside of BlackRock's control, including natural disasters, pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) or health crises may arise from time to time and be accompanied by governmental actions that may increase international tension. Any such events, and responses thereto, may cause significant volatility and declines in the global markets, disruptions to commerce (including to economic activity, travel and supply chains), loss of life and property damage, and may adversely affect the global economy or capital markets, as well as the Company's products, clients, vendors and employees, which may cause BlackRock's AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. BlackRock's exposure to geopolitical risks may be heightened to the extent such risks arise in countries in which BlackRock currently operates or is seeking to expand its presence.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE\n\n## Poor investment performance could lead to the loss of clients and may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\n\nThe Company's management believes that investment performance, including the efficient delivery of beta, is one of the most important factors for the growth and retention of AUM. Poor investment performance relative to applicable portfolio benchmarks, aggregate fee levels or competitors may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline as a result of:\n\n- \u00b7 client withdrawals in favor of better performing products offered by competitors;\n- \u00b7 client shifts to products that charge lower fees;\n- \u00b7 the diminishing ability to attract additional funds from existing and new clients;\n- \u00b7 reduced, minimal or no performance fees;\n- \u00b7 an impairment to the value of intangible assets and goodwill; or\n- \u00b7 a decrease in the valuations of seed and co-investment capital.\n\n## Performance fees may increase volatility of both revenue and earnings.\n\nA portion of BlackRock's revenue is derived from performance fees on investment advisory assignments. Performance fees represented $1.1 billion, or 7%, of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020. Generally, the Company is entitled to a performance fee only if the agreement under which it is managing the assets provides for one and if returns on the related portfolio exceed agreed-upon periodic or cumulative return targets. If these targets are not exceeded, a performance fee for that period will not be earned and, if targets are based on cumulative returns, the Company may not earn performance fees in future periods. The volatility of the Company's future revenue and earnings may also be affected due to illiquid alternatives becoming an increasing component of the overall composition of the Company's performance fee generating assets. In particular, as BlackRock takes on more advisory assignments for illiquid investments, performance fees will generally be recognized over substantially longer multi-year periods than those associated with more liquid products.\n\n## Failure to identify errors in the quantitative models BlackRock utilizes to manage its business could adversely affect product performance and client relationships.\n\nBlackRock employs various quantitative models to support its investment processes, including those related to risk assessment, portfolio management, trading and hedging activities and product valuations. Any errors in the underlying models or model assumptions, as well as any failure of BlackRock's governance, approval, testing and validation standards in respect of such models or model assumptions, could have unanticipated and adverse consequences on BlackRock's business and reputation.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC\n\n## The COVID-19 pandemic may adversely affect BlackRock's business, operations and financial condition which may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused and is causing significant harm to the global economy and may adversely affect BlackRock's business, including its operations and financial condition, and may cause the Company's AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to result in governmental authorities taking numerous measures to contain the spread and impact of COVID-19, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders, and limitations on business activity, including closures. These measures may continue to, among other things, severely restrict global economic activity, which can disrupt supply chains, lower asset valuations, significantly increase unemployment and underemployment levels, decrease liquidity in markets for certain securities and cause significant volatility and disruption in the financial markets.\n\nTowards the end of the first quarter of 2020 the pandemic began to impact BlackRock's business. While global markets have significantly recovered since then, the effects of the pandemic are ongoing, and such impact may continue in future quarters if conditions persist or worsen. Should current economic conditions persist or deteriorate, there may be an ongoing adverse effect on BlackRock's business, including its operations and financial condition, as a result of, among other things:\n\n- \u00b7 reduced AUM, resulting in lower base fees, as well as a reduction in the value of BlackRock's investment portfolio, including its coinvestments and seed investments in sponsored investment funds;\n- \u00b7 lower alpha generation which may adversely affect future organic growth and BlackRock's ability to generate performance fees;\n- \u00b7 reduced client and prospective client demand for BlackRock products and services and/or changing client risk preferences which may adversely affect future organic growth;\n- \u00b7 a decline in technology revenue growth as a result of extended sales cycles and longer implementation periods as clients work remotely;\n- \u00b7 negative impact of the pandemic on BlackRock's clients, and key vendors (such as pricing providers), market participants and other third-parties with whomit does business;\n- \u00b7 the negative operational effects of an extended remote working environment, including strain on Aladdin and/or BlackRock's other internal and external technology resources leveraged at the firm, as well as the potential for heightened operational risks, such as cybersecurity and fraud risks;\n- \u00b7 the possibility that prolonged periods away from physical office locations and daily in-person interactions with colleagues may cause members of BlackRock's workforce to become disconnected with corporate culture and policies, which may increase operational issues arising from human error and/or individual attempts to circumvent controls due to distractions, fatigue or a lack of oversight; and\n\nBlackRock Annual Report 2020",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 the disruption to BlackRock's workforce due to illness and health concerns, potential limitations of its remote work environment (including any complications associated with hiring and onboarding new employees remotely), and government-imposed restrictions, laws and regulations.\n\nThe aggregate extent to which COVID-19, and the related global economic crisis, affect BlackRock's business, results of operations and financial condition, will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic and any recovery period, future actions taken by governmental authorities, central banks and other third parties (including new financial regulation and other regulatory reform) in response to the pandemic, and the effects on BlackRock's products, clients, vendors and employees and may exacerbate the other risks described herein.\n\n## TECHNOLOGY AND OPERATIONAL RISKS\n\n## A failure in, or disruption to, BlackRock's operational systems or infrastructure, including business continuity plans, could adversely affect operations, damage the Company's reputation and cause BlackRock's AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\n\nBlackRock's infrastructure, including its technological capacity, data centers and office space, is vital to the competitiveness of its business. Moreover, a significant portion of BlackRock's critical business operations are concentrated in a limited number of geographic areas, including San Francisco, New York, London, Budapest, Atlanta and Gurgaon. The failure to maintain an infrastructure commensurate with the size and scope of BlackRock's business, or the occurrence of a business outage or event outside BlackRock's control, including a major earthquake, hurricane, fire, terrorist act, pandemic (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), health crisis or other catastrophic event, or the actions of individuals or groups seeking to disrupt BlackRock's operations in any location at which BlackRock maintains a major presence, could materially impact operations, result in disruption to the business or impede its growth.\n\nIn addition, despite BlackRock's efforts to ensure business continuity, if it fails to keep business continuity plans up-to-date or if such plans, including secure back-up facilities and systems and the availability of back-up employees, are improperly implemented or deployed during a disruption, the Company's ability to operate could be adversely impacted which may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline or impact the Company's ability to comply with regulatory obligations leading to reputational harm, regulatory fines and/or sanctions.\n\n## A cyber-attack or a failure to implement effective information and cybersecurity policies, procedures and capabilities could disrupt operations and lead to financial losses and reputational harm, which may cause BlackRock's AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\n\nBlackRock is dependent on the effectiveness of the information and cybersecurity policies, procedures and capabilities it maintains to protect its computer and telecommunications systems and the data that resides on or is transmitted through them. An externally caused information security incident, such as a cyber-attack\n\n52\n\n53\n\nBlackRock Annual Report 2020\n\nincluding a phishing scam, business email compromise, malware, or denial-of-service or ransomware attack, or an internally caused incident, such as failure to control access to sensitive systems, could materially interrupt business operations or cause disclosure or modification of sensitive or confidential client or competitive information. Moreover, developments in BlackRock's use of process automation, as well as the increased use of remote access by employees and mobile and cloud technologies, could heighten these and other operational risks, as certain aspects of the security of such technologies may be complex, unpredictable or beyond BlackRock's control. BlackRock's growing exposure to the public Internet, as well as reliance on mobile or cloud technology or any failure by mobile technology and cloud service providers to adequately safeguard their systems and prevent cyberattacks, could disrupt BlackRock's operations and result in misappropriation, corruption or loss of personal, confidential or proprietary information. In addition, there is a risk that encryption and other protective measures may be circumvented, particularly to the extent that new computing technologies increase the speed and computing power available.\n\nThere have been a number of recent highly publicized cases involving financial services and consumer-based companies reporting the unauthorized disclosure of client or customer information and the unauthorized transfer of customer funds, as well as cyber-attacks involving the dissemination, theft and destruction of corporate information or other assets, as a result of failure to follow procedures by employees or contractors or as a result of actions by third parties, including nation state actors and terrorist organizations. BlackRock has been the target of attempted cyber-attacks, as well as the co-opting of its brand, and must monitor and develop its systems to protect its technology infrastructure and data from misappropriation or corruption, as the failure to do so could disrupt BlackRock's operations and cause financial losses. Although BlackRock has implemented policies and controls, and takes protective measures involving significant expense, to strengthen its computer systems, processes, software, technology assets and networks to prevent and address potential data breaches, inadvertent disclosures, increasingly sophisticated cyber-attacks and cyber-related fraud, there can be no assurance that any of these measures prove effective. Moreover, due to the complexity and interconnectedness of BlackRock's systems, the process of upgrading or patching the Company's protective measures could itself create a risk of security issues or system disruptions for the Company, as well as for clients who rely upon, or have exposure to, BlackRock's systems.\n\nIn addition, due to BlackRock's interconnectivity with third-party vendors, advisors, central agents, exchanges, clearing houses and other financial institutions, BlackRock may be adversely affected if any of them is subject to a successful cyber-attack or other information security event, including those arising due to the use of mobile technology or a third-party cloud environment. BlackRock also routinely transmits and receives personal, confidential or proprietary information by email and other electronic means. The Company collaborates with clients, vendors and other third parties to develop secure transmission capabilities and protect against cyberattacks. However, BlackRock cannot ensure that it or such third parties have all appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of such information.\n\nAny information security incident or cyber-attack against BlackRock or third parties with whom it is connected, including any interception, mishandling or misuse of personal, confidential or proprietary information, could result in material financial loss, loss of competitive position, regulatory fines and/or sanctions, breach of client contracts, reputational harm or legal liability, which, in turn, may cause BlackRock's AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\n\n## Failure or unavailability of third-party dependencies may adversely affect Aladdin operations, which could cause reputational harm, lead to a loss of clients and impede BlackRock's productivity and growth.\n\nBlackRock must maintain effective infrastructure, including a robust and secure technological framework, in order to maximize the benefit of the Aladdin platform. In so doing, it relies in part on certain third-party service providers. For example, Aladdin's data architecture depends on third-party providers of technology solutions, including the ability of such parties to scale and perform in response to Aladdin's growth. In addition, the analytical capabilities of Aladdin depend on the ability of a number of third parties to provide data and other information as inputs into Aladdin's analytical calculations. Although BlackRock has implemented internal controls and procedures, and maintains a robust vendor management program designed to perform diligence and monitor third parties that support the Aladdin platform, there can be no assurance that these measures will prove effective. Any failure by third parties to maintain infrastructure that is commensurate with Aladdin's size and growth, or provide the data or information required to support its varying capabilities, could compromise Aladdin's resilience, result in operational difficulties, cause reputational harm and adversely impact BlackRock's ability to provide services to its investment advisory and Aladdin clients.\n\nContinuing enhancements to Aladdin's capabilities, as well as the expansion of the Aladdin platform into new markets and geographies, have led to significant growth in Aladdin's processing scale, which may expose BlackRock to reputational harm, increased regulatory scrutiny and heightened operational, data management, cyber- and information-security risks.\n\nThe operation of BlackRock's Aladdin platform routinely involves updating existing capabilities, configuration change management, developing, testing and rolling out new functionalities and expanding coverage into new markets and geographies, including in connection with inorganic transactions or to address client or regulatory requirements. These updates and expansion initiatives, which have led to significant growth in Aladdin's processing scale, frequently occur on accelerated time frames and may expose BlackRock to additional cyberand information-security risks, as well as increased execution, operational and data management risks. If BlackRock is unable to manage the pace of, or provide the operational resiliency and stability for, the expansion of Aladdin and associated growth of its processing scale, BlackRock may experience client attrition, reduced business, reputational harm or regulatory fines and/or sanctions, which may cause BlackRock's AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\n\nIn addition, the highly regulated business activities of many Aladdin clients may expose BlackRock to heightened\n\nregulatory scrutiny. For example, the changing political and regulatory environment in certain jurisdictions in which Aladdin clients are based has required BlackRock to open new data centers in those jurisdictions in order to host client data in the client's home location. Operating new data centers in foreign jurisdictions may expose BlackRock to increased operational complexity, as well as additional regulatory risks associated with the compliance requirements of such jurisdictions.\n\n## Failure to maintain adequate corporate and contingent liquidity may cause BlackRock's AUM, liquidity and earnings to decline, as well as harm its prospects for growth.\n\nBlackRock's ability to meet anticipated cash needs depends upon a number of factors, including its creditworthiness and ability to generate operating cash flows. In addition, while BlackRock, Inc. is not subject to regulatory capital or liquidity requirements, certain of its subsidiaries are subject to regulatory capital and liquidity frameworks as well as certain other prudential requirements and standards, which require them to maintain certain levels of capital and liquidity. Failure to maintain adequate liquidity could lead to unanticipated costs and force BlackRock to revise existing strategic and business initiatives. BlackRock's access to equity and debt markets and its ability to issue public or private debt, or secure lines of credit or commercial paper back-up lines, on reasonable terms may be limited by adverse market conditions, a reduction in its long- or short-term credit ratings, or changes in government regulations, including tax and interest rates. Failure to obtain funds and/or financing, or any adverse change to the cost of obtaining such funds and/or financing, may cause BlackRock's AUM, liquidity and earnings to decline, curtail its operations and limit or impede its prospects for growth.\n\n## Operating risks associated with BlackRock's securities lending program may result in client losses.\n\nBlackRock lends securities to banks and broker-dealers on behalf of certain of its clients. In these securities lending transactions, the borrower is required to provide and maintain collateral at or above regulatory minimums. Securities on loan are marked to market daily to determine if the borrower is required to pledge additional collateral. BlackRock must manage this process and is charged with mitigating the associated operational risks. The failure of BlackRock's controls to mitigate such operational risks could result in financial losses for the Company's clients that participate in its securities lending programs (separate from the risks of collateral investments), and BlackRock may be held liable for any failure to manage such risks.\n\n## Inorganic transactions may harm the Company's competitive or financial position if they are not successful.\n\nBlackRock employs a variety of organic and inorganic strategies intended to enhance earnings, increase product offerings, deliver whole-portfolio solutions, access new clients, leverage advances in technology and expand into new geographies. Inorganic strategies have included hiring smaller-sized investment teams, making minority investments in early- to mid-stage technological and other ventures, entering into strategic joint ventures and acquiring investment management and technology\n\nBlackRock Annual Report 2020",

        "page_content": "businesses. Inorganic transactions involve a number of financial, accounting, tax, regulatory, geographical and operational challenges and uncertainties, including in some cases the assumption of pre-existing liabilities, which must be managed in order for BlackRock to realize the benefit of such transactions. The success of BlackRock's inorganic strategy also depends in large part on its ability to integrate the workforce, operations, strategies, technologies and other components of a target business following the completion of an acquisition. BlackRock may be required to commit significant management time, as well as create new, or grow existing, operational and support functions, to facilitate the integration of acquired businesses, manage combined future growth and maintain a cohesive corporate culture. There can be no assurance that BlackRock will be able to successfully integrate acquired businesses, retain associated talent, scale support functions or realize other intended benefits of its inorganic strategy. Moreover, the challenges associated with BlackRock's inorganic strategy may be heightened when inorganic transactions are in new geographic locations, involve new markets, products or business lines or are delivered via technology that differs from that employed by BlackRock. In addition, in the case of minority investments and joint ventures, BlackRock may be subject to risks due to reputational harm, liability or loss resulting from, or relating to operating systems, risk management controls, and employees that are outside of BlackRock's control. Any failure to identify and mitigate the risks associated with acquisitions, joint ventures or minority investments through due diligence, indemnification provisions and/or operational expertise, or to manage the integration of acquisitions effectively, could have an adverse effect on BlackRock's reputation or cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline, which may harm the Company's competitive position in the investment management industry.\n\n## Client investments in real assets, such as real estate, infrastructure and energy assets, may expose BlackRock and its funds and accounts to new or increased risks and liabilities, as well as reputational harm.\n\nBlackRock makes investments on behalf of its clients in real assets, including real estate, infrastructure and energy assets, that may expose BlackRock and its funds and accounts to increased risks and liabilities that are inherent in the ownership and management of such assets. These may include:\n\n- \u00b7 construction risks, including as a result of force majeure, labor disputes or work stoppages, shortages of material or interruptions to the availability of necessary equipment;\n- \u00b7 accidents, pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), health crises or catastrophic events, such as explosions, fires or terrorist activity beyond BlackRock's control;\n- \u00b7 risks associated with global climate change, including the greater frequency or intensity of adverse weather and natural disasters;\n- \u00b7 personal injury or property damage;\n- \u00b7 failures on the part of third-party managers or sub-contractors appointed in connection with\n\nBlackRock Annual Report 2020\n\n54\n\n55\n\n- investments or projects to adequately perform their contractual duties or operate in accordance with applicable laws;\n- \u00b7 exposure to stringent and complex foreign, federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, including those related to financial crime, permits, government contracting, conservation, exploration and production, tenancy, occupational health and safety, foreign investment and environmental protection;\n- \u00b7 environmental hazards, such as natural gas leaks, product and waste spills, pipeline and tank ruptures, and unauthorized discharges of products, wastes and other pollutants;\n- \u00b7 changes to the supply and demand for properties and/or tenancies or fluctuations in the price of commodities;\n- \u00b7 the financial resources of tenants; and\n- \u00b7 contingent liabilities on disposition of assets.\n\nThe above risks may expose BlackRock's funds and accounts to additional expenses and liabilities, including costs associated with delays or remediation costs, and increased legal or regulatory costs, all of which could impact the returns earned by BlackRock's clients. These risks could also result in direct liability for BlackRock by exposing BlackRock to losses, regulatory sanction or litigation, including claims for compensatory or punitive damages. Similarly, market conditions may change during the course of developments or projects in which BlackRock invests that make such development or project less attractive than at the time it was commenced and potentially harm the investment returns of BlackRock's clients. The occurrence of any such events may expose BlackRock to reputational harm, divert management's attention away from BlackRock's other business activities or cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\n\n## Operating in international markets increases BlackRock's operational, political, regulatory and other risks.\n\nAs a result of BlackRock's extensive international operations, the Company faces associated operational, regulatory, reputational, political and foreign exchange rate risks, many of which are outside of the Company's control. Operating outside the United States ('US') may also expose BlackRock to increased compliance risks, as well as higher compliance costs to comply with US and non-US anti-corruption, anti-money laundering and sanctions laws and regulations. Similarly, certain jurisdictions in which BlackRock operates may not have comparable levels of protection for corporate assets, such as intellectual property, and client information and records, as the US. As a result, there may also be heightened information security or privacy risks in those jurisdictions. Any theft of data, technology or intellectual property may negatively impact BlackRock's business operations and reputation. The failure of the Company's systems of internal control to mitigate such risks, or of its operating infrastructure to support its global activities, could result in operational failures and regulatory fines and/or sanctions, which may cause the Company's AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO HUMAN CAPITAL\n\nThe potential for human error in connection with BlackRock's operational systems could disrupt operations, cause losses, lead to regulatory fines or damagethe Company's reputation and may cause BlackRock's AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\n\nMany of BlackRock's operations are highly complex and are dependent on the Company's ability to process and monitor a large number of transactions, many of which occur across numerous markets and currencies at high volumes and frequencies. Although BlackRock expends considerable resources on systemic controls, supervision, technology and training in an effort to ensure that such transactions do not violate client guidelines and applicable rules and regulations or adversely affect clients, counterparties or the Company, BlackRock's operations are dependent on its employees. From time-to-time, employees make mistakes that are not always immediately detected by systems, controls, policies and procedures intended to prevent and detect such errors. These can include calculation errors, errors in software implementation or development, failure to ensure data security, follow processes, patch systems or report issues, or errors in judgment. Human errors, even if promptly discovered and remediated, may disrupt operations or result in regulatory fines and/or sanctions, breach of client contracts, reputational harm or legal liability, which, in turn, may cause BlackRock's AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\n\n## Fraud, the circumvention of controls or the violation of risk management and workplace policies could have an adverse effect on BlackRock's reputation, which may cause the Company's AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\n\nBlackRock seeks to foster a positive workplace culture, has adopted a comprehensive risk management process and continues to enhance various controls, procedures, policies and systems to monitor and manage risks. Notwithstanding these measures, BlackRock cannot ensure that its workplace culture or such controls, procedures, policies and systems will successfully identify and manage internal and external risks and BlackRock employees have in the past engaged in improper conduct. In addition, BlackRock is subject to the risk that its employees, contractors or other third parties may in the future deliberately or recklessly seek to circumvent established controls to commit fraud, pay or solicit bribes or otherwise act in ways that are inconsistent with the Company's controls, policies, procedures, workplace culture or principles. This risk may be heightened as BlackRock expands into new markets and increases the breadth of its business offerings, both of which introduce additional complexity to its risk management program. Persistent attempts to circumvent policies and controls or repeated incidents involving fraud, conflicts of interests or transgressions of policies and controls could have an adverse effect on BlackRock's reputation, cause adverse publicity, and result in litigation, regulatory inquiries, fines and/or sanctions, which may cause the Company's AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\n\n## The failure to recruit and retain employees and develop and implement effective executive succession could lead to the loss of clients and may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\n\nBlackRock's success is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of its highly skilled workforce and the Company's ability to plan for the future long-term growth of the business by identifying and developing those employees who can ultimately transition into key roles within BlackRock. The global market for qualified fund managers, investment analysts, technology and risk specialists and other professionals is competitive, and factors that affect BlackRock's ability to attract and retain such employees include the Company's reputation and workplace culture, the immigration policies in the jurisdictions in which BlackRock has offices, the compensation and benefits it provides, and its commitment to effectively managing executive succession, including the development and training of qualified individuals.\n\nIn addition, a percentage of the deferred compensation that BlackRock pays to its employees is tied to the Company's share price. As such, if BlackRock's share price were to decrease, the retention value of such deferred compensation would decrease. There can be no assurance that the Company will continue to be successful in its efforts to recruit and retain employees and effectively manage executive succession. If BlackRock is unable to offer competitive compensation or otherwise attract and retain talented individuals, or if it fails to effectively manage executive succession, the Company's ability to compete effectively and retain its existing clients may be materially impacted.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO KEY THIRD-PARTY RELATIONSHIPS\n\nThe impairment or failure of third parties may negatively impact the performance of products and accounts that BlackRock manages, which may cause BlackRock's AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\n\nBlackRock's investment management activities expose the products and accounts it manages for its clients to many different industries and counterparties, including distributors, brokers and dealers, commercial and investment banks, clearing organizations, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. Transactions with counterparties expose BlackRock's clients to credit risk in the event the applicable counterparty defaults. Although BlackRock maintains a robust vendor management program and regularly assesses risks posed by its counterparties, such counterparties may be subject to sudden swings in the financial and credit markets that may impair their ability to perform or they may fail to meet their obligations. Counterparties may also experience lapses in their internal controls or risk management systems or expose BlackRock and/or its clients to losses on account of employee malfeasance, negligence or human error. In addition, the concentration of certain financial institutions that BlackRock uses to facilitate securities and derivatives transactions for its clients, including clearing organizations, exchanges and central agents, increases the risk that a technical or operational issue at, or default by, one such institution could introduce operational issues or delays impacting multiple BlackRock clients. Any such operational issue, impairment or failure\n\nBlackRock Annual Report 2020",

BlackRock relies upon a relatively concentrated group of third-party index providers to deliver services that are integral to its clients' investment decisions. The index provider industry is characterized by large vendors and the use of long-term contracts remains the market standard. This industry structure may limit BlackRock's ability to renegotiate its index provider contracts on favorable terms or at all. While BlackRock performs focused diligence on its vendors in an effort to ensure they operate in accordance with expectations, to the extent any significant deficiencies are uncovered, there may be few, or no, alternative vendors available. Moreover, in situations where BlackRock has limited access to alternative vendors, or where the nature of BlackRock's arrangement with a vendor requires a long term-commitment, BlackRock may be dependent on such vendor for continuous operational reliability and may be unable to avoid incurring costs if such vendor introduces required upgrades to its services.\n\nBlackRock may from time to time transfer key contracts from one vendor to another. Key contract transfers may be costly and complex, and expose BlackRock to heightened operational risks. Any failure to mitigate such risks could result in reputational harm, as well as financial losses to BlackRock and its clients. The failure or inability of BlackRock to diversify its sources for key services or the failure of any key vendor to fulfill its obligations could result in activities inconsistent with clients' investment management or other agreements, have an adverse financial impact on BlackRock products or lead to operational and regulatory issues for the Company, which could result in reputational harm or legal liability, fines and/or sanctions and may cause BlackRock's AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\n\n## Any disruption to the Company's distribution channels maycause BlackRock's AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\n\nBlackRock relies on a number of third parties to provide distribution, portfolio administration and servicing for certain BlackRock investment management products and services through their various distribution channels. BlackRock's ability to maintain strong relationships with its distributors may impact the Company's future performance, and its relationships with distributors are subject to periodic renegotiation that may result in increased distribution costs and/or reductions in the amount of BlackRock products and services being marketed or distributed. Moreover, new fiduciary regulations could lead to significant shifts in distributors' business models and more limited product offerings,\n\n56\n\n57\n\nBlackRock Annual Report 2020\n\npotentially resulting in reduced distribution and/or marketing of certain of the Company's products and services and fee compression. If BlackRock is unable to distribute its products and services successfully or if it is unable to replace or renew existing distribution arrangements, BlackRock's AUM, revenue and earnings may decline. In addition, improper activities, as well as inadequate anti-money laundering diligence conducted by third-party distributors, could create reputational and regulatory harm to BlackRock.\n\n## Key technology partnerships may expose BlackRock to increased regulatory oversight, as well as migration, execution, technology and operational risks.\n\nIn April 2020, BlackRock announced a strategic partnership to host Aladdin infrastructure on the Microsoft Azure cloud and commenced a multi-year plan to migrate the Aladdin environments for BlackRock and its external Aladdin clients to the cloud. The benefits of a cloud-based platform are significant and BlackRock has adopted a robust risk-based approach to its migration strategy; however the partnership also introduces new risks, including: (i) risks associated with relying on a third-party for aspects of the reliability and stability of Aladdin 's infrastructure; (ii) software and information security risks arising from the use of cloud technology; (iii) operational and execution risks, including those related to migration; and (iv) risks related to increased regulatory oversight and new compliance obligations. Any failure by BlackRock to manage these risks, and/or risks associated with future potential technology partnerships, may result in escalating costs, financial loss, client dissatisfaction or attrition, regulatory fines and/or sanctions, reputational harm or legal liability, which, in turn, may cause BlackRock's AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\n\n## Disruption to the operations of third parties whose functions are integral to BlackRock's Exchange-Traded Fund ('ETF') platform may adversely affect the prices at which ETFs trade, particularly during periods of market volatility.\n\nBlackRock is the largest provider of ETFs globally. Shares of ETFs trade on stock exchanges at prices at, above or below the ETF's most recent net asset value ('NAV'). The NAV of an ETF is calculated at the end of each business day and fluctuates with changes in the market value of the ETF's holdings. The trading price of the ETF's shares fluctuates continuously throughout trading hours. The creation/redemption feature and arbitrage mechanism of an ETF are designed to make it more likely that the ETF's shares normally will trade at prices close to the NAV. Notwithstanding these features, exchange prices have in the past deviated measurably from the NAV of certain ETFs and may under certain circumstances do so in the future. ETF market prices are subject to numerous potential risks, including trading halts invoked by a stock exchange, and the inability or unwillingness of market makers, authorized participants, settlement systems or other market participants to perform functions necessary for an ETF's arbitrage mechanism to function effectively. These risks may be heightened as a result of significant market volatility, the accelerating growth of the ETF industry combined with increased market activity, as well as the complexity associated with the growing demand for product customization. Although certain structural improvements have contributed to the increasing\n\nresilience, stability and transparency of ETF markets, including during periods of volatility, and despite BlackRock's continuing work with regulators and other third parties to implement additional ETF reforms, there can be no assurance that any such reforms will be implemented in a timely or effective fashion, or at all. Moreover, if market events lead to incidences where ETFs trade at prices that deviate meaningfully from an ETF's NAV, or trading halts are invoked by the relevant stock exchange or market, investors may lose confidence in ETF products and redeem their holdings, which may cause BlackRock's AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\n\n## LEGAL, REGULATORY AND REPUTATIONAL RISKS\n\n## BlackRock is subject to extensive regulation around the world.\n\nBlackRock's business is subject to extensive regulation around the world. These regulations subject BlackRock's business activities to an array of increasingly detailed operational requirements, compliance with which is costly and complex. In addition, many of BlackRock's legal entities may be subject to laws and regulations aimed at preventing corruption, money laundering, inappropriate employment practices, illegal payments and engaging in business activities with certain individuals, countries or groups, including but not limited to the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, the Bank Secrecy Act, the UK Bribery Act, sanctions imposed by the US Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, the United Nations and the European Union ('EU') and its member states, as well as those imposed by other countries in which BlackRock operates, such as Her Majesty's Treasury's Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation. BlackRock is also subject to certain risk retention rules and regulation, as well as regulatory capital requirements, which require the Company to maintain capital to support certain of its businesses. Furthermore, many jurisdictions in which BlackRock operates have laws and regulations relating to data privacy, cybersecurity and protection of personal information, including the General Data Protection Regulation, which expands data protection rules for individuals within the EU and for personal data exported outside the EU. BlackRock is additionally subject to scrutiny from various government agencies that focus on antitrust and competition laws and regulations within the US and internationally, including in connection with merger control proceedings and proposed investments. Any determination of a failure to comply with any such laws or regulations could result in fines and/or sanctions against the Company, as well as reputational harm. Moreover, to the extent that these laws and regulations become more stringent, or if BlackRock is required to hold increased levels of capital to support its businesses, the Company's financial performance or plans for growth may be adversely impacted.\n\nBlackRock may also be adversely affected by a failure to comply with existing laws and regulations or by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of such laws and regulations, including those discussed above. Challenges associated with interpreting regulations issued in numerous countries in a globally consistent manner may add to such risks, if regulators in different jurisdictions have inconsistent views or provide only limited regulatory guidance. In particular, violation of applicable laws or\n\nregulations could result in fines and/or sanctions, temporary or permanent prohibition of certain activities, reputational harm and related client terminations, suspensions of employees or revocation of their licenses, suspension or termination of investment adviser, brokerdealer or other registrations, or suspension or termination of BlackRock's bank charter or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on BlackRock's reputation or business and may cause the Company's AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. For a more extensive discussion of the laws, regulations and regulators to which BlackRock is subject and regulated by, see Item 1, Business - Regulation .\n\n## Regulatory reforms in the United States expose BlackRock to increasing regulatory scrutiny, as well as regulatory uncertainty.\n\nIn recent years a number of regulatory reforms have been proposed or fully or partially implemented in the United States, and the level of regulatory scrutiny to which BlackRock is subject has increased. BlackRock, as well as its clients, vendors and distributors, have expended resources and altered certain of their business or operating activities to prepare for, address and meet the requirements that such regulatory reforms impose. While BlackRock is, or may become, subject to numerous reform initiatives in the United States, see Item 1, Business Regulation , key regulatory reforms that may impact the Company include:\n\n- \u00b7 Designation as a systemically important financial institution ('SIFI'): The Financial Stability Oversight Council ('FSOC') has the authority to designate nonbank financial institutions as SIFIs in the United States under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. In July 2014, the FSOC pivoted from its previous entity-specific approach to designation and indicated that it would focus on a products and activities-based approach to designation in connection with addressing potential risks in the financial system related to asset management. In December 2019, the FSOC re-affirmed this approach when it voted to change its methodology for assessing financial stability to a products and activities-based approach. This reduces the risk of an entity-level designation, however it remains too early to predict the direction of the forthcoming regulatory environment and the FSOC retains the authority to designate an entity if an activities-based approach does not adequately address potential risks. In the event that BlackRock is designated as a SIFI, it could become subject to enhanced regulatory requirements and direct supervision by the Federal Reserve.\n- \u00b7 Federal Trade Commission Proposal: In September 2020, the Federal Trade Commission ('FTC') released a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking proposing updates to premerger notification rules enacted under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 ('HSR') that require parties to certain transactions to provide the FTC and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice prior notice and observe a waiting period before consummation of such transactions. The proposals would: (i) require that investors aggregate holdings in an issuer across all associated funds when assessing HSR filing and exemption thresholds and (ii) create a new exemption\n\nBlackRock Annual Report 2020",

If enacted as drafted, the proposal requiring aggregation across associated funds could, absent exemptions for index-funds or certain types of registered funds, substantially increase BlackRock's pre-merger notification obligations, which may be costly, impair funds' ability to trade freely, require the implementation of monitoring tools and introduce additional compliance burdens for both BlackRock and the companies in which it invests. In instances where making a pre-merger notification may not be practicable, the proposed changes may serve to limit the size of BlackRock's aggregate position in certain issuers.\n\n- \u00b7 Securities and Exchange Commission ('SEC') Rulemakings for US Registered Funds and Investment Advisers: The SEC and its staff recently have engaged in various initiatives and reviews that seek to improve and modernize the regulatory structure governing the asset management industry, and registered investment companies in particular. These efforts relate to, among other things, embedded leverage through the use of derivatives and other trading practices, cybersecurity, liquidity, enhanced regulatory and public reporting requirements and the evaluation of systemic risks. Over the past year, the SEC has adopted rules that include among other things: (i) the regulation of the use of derivatives; (ii) a new regulatory framework for fund of funds structures; and (iii) updated eligibility requirements for submitting shareholder proposals under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These rules, and any additional rules or regulatory initiatives resulting from the SEC's efforts, may increase BlackRock's regulatory compliance requirements as well as disclosure requirements, which could be costly and may impede BlackRock's growth.\n- \u00b7 Standards of Conduct Rulemaking: In June 2019, the SEC adopted a package of rulemakings and interpretations addressing investment adviser and broker-dealer standards of conduct. The package included new rules requiring registered advisers and registered broker-dealers to provide a relationship summary to retail investors, a new rule establishing a standard of conduct for broker-dealers when making recommendations to retail customers, and two new interpretations under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. These rulemakings and interpretations could increase BlackRock's disclosure obligations, impact distribution arrangements between BlackRock and its distribution partners, create compliance and operational challenges for BlackRock's distribution partners and limit BlackRock's ability to provide certain other services to its clients.\n- \u00b7 Money Market Reform : Following market liquidity issues that arose in March 2020 in connection with the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, regulatory authorities are focused on the need for further regulation for certain money market funds. In December 2020, the President's Working Group on Financial Markets issued a report outlining ten potential policy measures for consideration to improve the resiliency of money market funds and the broader short-term funding markets. Although it\n\nBlackRock Annual Report 2020\n\nremains too early to accurately predict the forthcoming regulatory environment, including with respect to regulation of money market funds, certain of these reforms, if ever adopted, could significantly impact money market funds and the money market fund industry.\n\nRegulatory reforms in the United States could require BlackRock to alter its future business or operating activities, which could be costly, impede the Company's growth and cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. Regulatory reform may also impact BlackRock's banking, insurance company and pension fund clients, which could cause them to change their investment strategies or allocations in manners that may be adverse to BlackRock.\n\n## International regulatory reforms expose BlackRock and its clients to increasing regulatory scrutiny, as well as regulatory uncertainty.\n\nBlackRock's business and operating activities are subject to increasing regulatory oversight outside of the United States and the Company may be affected by a number of proposed or fully or partially implemented reform initiatives in EMEA and the Asia-Pacific region, as well as volatility associated with international regulatory uncertainty, including:\n\n- \u00b7 British Exit from the EU : On December 31, 2020, the United Kingdom ('UK') left the EU, and the UK and EU reverted to being distinct regulatory, legal and customs territories. Although an 'EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement' was agreed to in connection with the UK's departure from the EU, it does not include any substantive provisions with respect to financial services. As a result, from January 1, 2021, cross-border financial services trade between the UK and the EU will be governed by their respective financial services regulations and market access regimes. BlackRock has implemented a number of steps to prepare for this outcome. These steps, which are and have been time consuming and costly and may add complexity to BlackRock's future European operations, include effecting organizational, governance and operational changes, applying for and receiving additional licenses and permissions in the EU, and engaging in client communications. In addition, depending on how the future relationship between the UK and the EU develops, BlackRock may experience further organizational and operational challenges and incur additional costs in connection with its European operations, particularly with regards to delegation and outsourcing, which may impede the Company's growth or impact its financial performance.\n- \u00b7 UK Overseas Funds Regime: As part of its post-EU membership regulatory review, the Financial Conduct Authority ('FCA') is reviewing the requirements it will impose on EU-domiciled funds offered into the UK. Any new requirements could introduce cost and complexity to BlackRock's cross-border business model.\n- \u00b7 Enhanced regulatory scrutiny of technology service providers to financial services firms: There has been growing regulatory scrutiny of technology service providers on which financial services firms are reliant, including the Digital Operational Resilience Act\n- ('DORA'), which was proposed by the EC in September 2020 and focuses on direct regulation of providers and users of technology and data services. If enacted as proposed, DORA may, among other things: (i) introduce additional governance, risk management, incident reporting, testing and information sharing requirements to a number of BlackRock's European entities and certain Aladdin clients; and (ii) subject Aladdin to broad additional oversight. Separately, in November 2020, the Financial Stability Board released a Consultation on Regulatory and Supervisory Issues Relating to Outsourcing and Third-Party Relationships, which explores direct supervision of technology service providers to financial services firms, in addition to detailing concerns around the potential for systemic risk in the provision of such services.\n- \u00b7 Macroprudential policies for asset managers: Certain policymakers continue to raise long-standing concerns about liquidity and leverage risks in the asset management industry and wider market-based finance sector. The COVID-19 pandemic has heightened concerns and prompted a broad review of existing financial market regulations by international standard setters and regulators across the Americas, Europe and Asia, including an assessment of the adequacy of certain structural components of current markets in mitigating risks. In the event that either the longer-standing concerns or recent broad review result in regulatory or policy action, macroprudential tools may begin to apply to open-ended investment funds broadly. BlackRock may also be required to make changes to structural features of certain openended investment funds. Either eventuality could limit BlackRock's ability to offer products to certain clients and/or result in clients altering their investment strategies or allocations in a manner that is adverse to BlackRock.\n- \u00b7 Revised capital requirements for investment firms : In December 2017, the European Commission ('EC') published a proposal for a new Directive and Regulation on prudential requirements for Markets in Financial Instruments Directive investment firms. The proposal passed the EU legislative process and the final texts of the Regulation and Directive were published in December 2019. The new legislative package, which comes into effect in 2021, will result in changes to the amount of regulatory capital BlackRock is required to hold in the EU and how such capital is calculated, as well as introduce revised disclosure obligations for large investment firms. The UK is also proposing the adoption of comparable rules, which will apply to UK-based investment firms from 2022.\n- \u00b7 EUmarket access: In 2019, the EC commenced a review of the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive to assess, among other things, the conditions for delegating portfolio management mandates to third countries, the effectiveness of regulation on third country fund marketing passports and the continuation of national private placement regimes. To the extent the review results in formal legislation that limits the scope of existing permitted activities and EU market access rights for asset management firms with non-EU operations, or extends more stringent rules to the Directive on\n\n- Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities ('UCITS'), BlackRock's ability to offer collective investment funds and certain investment services to EU-based clients may be adversely affected.\n- \u00b7 Senior Managers and Certification Regime : In the UK, the FCA extended the Senior Managers and Certification Regime ('SMCR') to all financial services firms in December 2019. The regime imposes greater accountability and responsibility across the senior management of UK financial services firms by making individuals in impacted firms more accountable for conduct and competence. SMCR impacts nearly all staff of the Company in the UK, and requires extensive documentation to support senior managers and evidence the discharge of their responsibilities.\n- \u00b7 UK asset management market study: The FCA has adopted requirements for UK fund managers to assess whether the retail collective investments they manage offer 'value' to investors. In 2020, the Company initiated the provision of an annual assessment based upon various factors including cost, performance and comparable services. If 'value' has not been provided to consumers, the Company will need to address any identified deficiencies. The FCA also requested that the UK's Competition and Markets Authority ('CMA') assess the investment consultant and fiduciary markets. The CMA's final report identified a number of competition issues in such markets and the UK regulatory regime was revised in 2020 to introduce mandatory tendering of investment consultancy and fiduciary management services, and new standards of disclosure of fees and performance. The CMA's remedies could have a significant impact on the Company's ability to enter into fiduciary and investment management mandates with UK pension fund clients.\n- \u00b7 Sustainability Regulation : In 2018, the EC introduced a number of regulatory proposals to underpin sustainable investment products; require disclosure of sustainability-related information by market participants, investments products, and issuers; and require the integration of sustainability considerations into the investment and risk management processes of asset managers and other institutional investors. Rules arising from the reform proposals will take effect in March 2021. Regulators in Asia have been similarly focused on sustainability reform initiatives. In December 2020, the Monetary Authority of Singapore finalized its Guidelines on Environmental Risk Management for the asset management industry. The guidelines set forth enhanced environmental risk assessment, monitoring and oversight practices that certain funds registered or licensed in Singapore will be required to implement over an 18-month transition period. The Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission proposed similar enhancements to sustainability risk management practices and disclosure requirements for funds in a Consultation Paper it issued in October 2020.\n- \u00b7 Securities Financing Transaction Regulation ('SFTR'): In November 2015, the EU introduced a regulation on the reporting and transparency of securities financing transactions and total return swaps. The SFTR aims to improve the transparency surrounding securities financing transactions and total return swaps by,\n\nBlackRock Annual Report 2020",

        "page_content": "among other things, requiring reporting of securities financing transactions to a trade repository and requiring disclosure of the use of securities financing transactions and total return swaps to investors. During 2020, additional obligations became effective under the SFTR that require BlackRock to submit additional transaction reports with substantive details of trading activity to authorities. Compliance with the SFTR may subject BlackRock to additional expenses and could lead to modifications in BlackRock's securities financing transaction activities.\n\n- \u00b7 Central Securities Depository Regulation: A settlement discipline regime introduced by the Central Securities Depository Regulation will become effective in February 2022. The regime includes measures to address settlement failures including rules for trade allocation and confirmation processing, along with cash penalties for failed transactions and mandatory buy-in requirements. To the extent left unchanged by a review that is scheduled to take place during 2021, the regime will require BlackRock to introduce operational mechanisms to facilitate the mandatory buy-in of securities in instances where the seller fails to deliver securities in a timely manner which, if not complied with, may subject BlackRock to penalty.\n\nInternational regulatory reforms could require BlackRock to alter its future business or operating activities, which could be time-consuming and costly, impede the Company's growth and cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. Regulatory reform may also impact BlackRock's internationally-based clients, which could cause them to change their investment strategies or allocations in manners that may be adverse to BlackRock.\n\n## Legal proceedings may cause the Company's AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\n\nBlackRock is subject to a number of sources of potential legal liability and the Company, certain of the investment funds it manages and certain of its subsidiaries and employees have been named as defendants in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation arising in connection with BlackRock's activities. Certain of BlackRock's subsidiaries and employees are also subject to periodic examination, special inquiries and potential proceedings by regulatory authorities, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ('OCC'), Department of Labor, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Financial Conduct Authority, Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financial and Federal Reserve. Similarly, from time to time, BlackRock receives subpoenas or other requests for information from various US and non-US governmental and regulatory authorities in connection with certain industry-wide, company-specific or other investigations, proceedings or litigations. These examinations, inquiries and proceedings have in the past and could in the future, if compliance failures or other violations are found, cause the relevant governmental or regulatory authority to institute proceedings and/or impose sanctions for violations. Any such action may also result in litigation by investors in BlackRock's funds, other BlackRock clients or BlackRock's shareholders, which could harm the Company's reputation and may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline, potentially harm the investment returns of the applicable fund, or result in the Company being liable for damages.\n\n60\n\n61\n\nBlackRock Annual Report 2020\n\nIn addition, when clients retain BlackRock to manage their assets or provide them with products or services, they typically specify contractual requirements or guidelines that BlackRock must observe in the provision of its services. A failure to comply with these guidelines or requirements could expose BlackRock to lawsuits, harm its reputation or cause clients to withdraw assets or terminate contracts.\n\n## Damageto BlackRock's reputation may harm its business.\n\nBlackRock's reputation is critical to its relationships with its clients, employees, shareholders and business partners. BlackRock's reputation may be harmed by, among other factors, regulatory or enforcement actions, technology or operational failures, poor investment performance, ineffective management or monitoring of key third-party relationships, cyber-security or other privacy incidents, employee errors or misconduct, a failure to manage environmental, social, and governance risks, or a failure to manage conflicts of interest. In addition, BlackRock's business, scale and investments subject it to significant media coverage and increasing attention from a broad range of stakeholders. This heightened scrutiny has resulted in negative publicity for BlackRock in the past and may do so in the future. In addition, the increasing popularity of social media and non-mainstream Internet news sources may lead to faster and wider dissemination of any adverse publicity or inaccurate information about BlackRock, making effective remediation more difficult. Damage to BlackRock's reputation may impact BlackRock's ability to attract and retain clients, employees, shareholders and business partners, which may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\n\n## A failure to effectively manage potential conflicts of interest could result in litigation or enforcement actions and/or adversely affect BlackRock's business and reputation, which may cause BlackRock's AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\n\nAs a global investment management firm that provides investment and technology services to a diverse range of clients, the Company must routinely address and manage conflicts of interest, as well as the perception of conflicts of interest, between itself and its clients, employees or vendors. While BlackRock has policies, controls and disclosure protocols in place to manage and address potential conflicts of interest, identifying and mitigating conflicts of interest can be complex and is the subject of increasing regulatory and media scrutiny. It is possible that actual, potential or perceived conflicts could give rise to investor or client dissatisfaction, adverse publicity, litigation or enforcement actions. In particular, BlackRock's broad range of investment, advisory and technology offerings, and its focus on providing clients with whole portfolio solutions, may result in clients working with multiple BlackRock businesses and/or BlackRock being engaged by institutions that have a nexus to industries or jurisdictions in which BlackRock operates, which may increase the potential for actual or perceived conflicts of interest and improper information sharing. To the extent that BlackRock fails, or appears to fail, to deal appropriately with any conflict of interest, it may face adverse publicity, reputational damage, litigation, regulatory proceedings, client attrition, penalties, fines and/or sanctions, any of which may cause BlackRock's AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\n\n## BlackRock is subject to US banking regulations that may limit its business activities.\n\nBlackRock's trust bank subsidiary, which is a national banking association chartered by the OCC, is subject to OCCregulation and capital requirements. The OCC has broad supervisory and enforcement authority over BlackRock's trust bank. Being subject to banking regulation may put BlackRock at a competitive disadvantage because certain of its competitors are not subject to these limitations.\n\n## The implications of complying with threshold limits and/ or any failure to comply with ownership reporting requirements could result in harm to BlackRock's reputation, impact the performance of certain BlackRock funds and may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\n\nOf note among the various international regulations to which BlackRock is subject are the extensive and increasingly stringent regulatory reporting requirements that necessitate the monitoring and reporting of issuer exposure levels (thresholds) across the holdings of managed funds and accounts and those of the Company. The specific triggers and the reporting methods that these threshold filings entail vary significantly by regulator and across jurisdictions. BlackRock continues to invest in technology, training and its employees to further enhance its monitoring and reporting functions. Despite these investments, the complexity of the various threshold reporting requirements combined with the breadth of the assets managed by the Company and high volume of securities trading have caused errors and omissions to occur in the past, and pose a risk that errors or omissions may occur in the future. Any such errors may expose BlackRock to monetary penalties or other sanctions, which could have an adverse effect on BlackRock's reputation and may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\n\nMoreover, as BlackRock's business grows it is becoming subject to a greater number of regulatory, industry-level or issuer-specific threshold limits that may prevent BlackRock from holding positions in certain equity securities, securities convertible into equity securities or futures contracts in excess of certain thresholds. Although BlackRock is actively engaged in regulatory, issuerspecific and structural initiatives to create additional investment capacity, threshold limits may nonetheless prevent the purchase of certain securities which may, in turn, impact the performance of certain BlackRock index funds by increasing tracking error relative to the funds' benchmarks and impact the performance of certain BlackRock actively managed funds by preventing them from taking advantage of alpha generating opportunities.\n\n## BlackRock has been the subject of commentary citing concerns about index investing and common ownership.\n\nAs a leader in the index investing and asset management industry, BlackRock has been the subject of commentary citing concerns about the growth of index investing, as well as perceived competition issues associated with asset managers managing stakes in multiple companies within certain industries, known as 'common ownership'. The commentators argue that index funds have the potential to distort investment flows, create stock price bubbles, or conversely, exacerbate a decline in market prices. Additional commentary focuses on competition issues\n\nassociated with common ownership and purports to link aggregated equity positions in certain concentrated industries with higher consumer prices and executive compensation, among other things. In the US, the FTC during 2018 held hearings on Competition and Consumer Protection in the 21 st Century, which included a discussion of common ownership, and in 2020, common ownership was cited as a disqualifying factor in a newly proposed exemption from the FTC's pre-merger notification rules. Common ownership was also cited as a consideration underlying the FTC's consultation on the rules that apply to acquisitions of voting securities by investment entities. Although the FTC acknowledged that the common ownership debate remains unsettled, it is expected that common ownership may be given greater consideration in connection with FTC rule proposals, policy decisions and/or the scrutiny of mergers. In the EU, both the EC and the European Parliament released reports in 2020 on common ownership. Neither report took a position that common ownership had an adverse impact on competition. It is expected that common ownership will continue to be a focus for the EC, among others, including in the assessment of mergers and investigations. There is substantial literature highlighting the benefits of index investing, as well as casting doubt on the assumptions, data, methodology and conclusions associated with common ownership arguments. Nevertheless, some commentators have proposed remedies, including limits on stakes managed by asset managers that, if enacted into policy, could have a negative impact on the capital markets, increase transaction costs and limit the availability of products for investors. This may, in turn, adversely affect BlackRock.\n\n## Newtax legislation or changes to existing US and non-US tax laws, treaties and regulations or challenges to BlackRock's historical taxation practices may adversely affect BlackRock's effective tax rate, business and overall financial condition.\n\nBlackRock's businesses may be directly or indirectly affected by tax legislation and regulation, or the modification of existing tax laws, by US or non-US tax authorities. In the US, legislation at both the federal and state level has been previously proposed to enact a financial transaction tax ('FTT') on stocks, bonds and a broad range of financial instruments and derivative transactions. In the EU, certain Member States have also enacted similar FTTs and the EC has proposed legislation to harmonize these taxes and provide for the adoption of EU-level legislation applicable to some (but not all) EU Member States. If enacted as proposed, FTTs could have an adverse effect on BlackRock's financial results and clients' performance results.\n\nThe application of tax regulations involves numerous uncertainties, and in the normal course of business US and non-US tax authorities may review and challenge tax positions adopted by BlackRock. These challenges may result in adjustments to, or impact the timing or amount of, taxable income, deductions or other tax allocations, which may adversely affect BlackRock's effective tax rate and overall financial condition. Similarly, the Company manages assets in products and accounts that have investment objectives which may conform to tax positions adopted by BlackRock or to specific tax rules. To the extent there are changes in tax law or policy, or regulatory challenges to tax positions adopted by BlackRock, the value or attractiveness of such investments may be diminished and BlackRock may suffer financial or reputational harm.\n\nBlackRock Annual Report 2020",

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\n## FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\n\nThis report, and other statements that BlackRock may make, may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, with respect to BlackRock's future financial or business performance, strategies or expectations. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words or phrases such as 'trend,' 'potential,' 'opportunity,' 'pipeline,' 'believe,' 'comfortable,' 'expect,' 'anticipate,' 'current,' 'intention,' 'estimate,' 'position,' 'assume,' 'outlook,' 'continue,' 'remain,' 'maintain,' 'sustain,' 'seek,' 'achieve,' and similar expressions, or future or conditional verbs such as 'will,' 'would,' 'should,' 'could,' 'may' and similar expressions.\n\nBlackRock cautions that forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties, which change over time. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and BlackRock assumes no duty to and does not undertake to update forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements and future results could differ materially from historical performance.\n\nBlackRock has previously disclosed risk factors in its Securities and Exchange Commission ('SEC') reports. These risk factors and those identified elsewhere in this report, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements or historical performance and include: (1) a pandemic or health crisis, including the COVID-19 pandemic, and its continued impact on financial institutions, the global economy or capital markets, as well as BlackRock's products, clients, vendors and employees, and BlackRock's results of operations, the full extent of which may be unknown; (2) the introduction, withdrawal, success and timing of business initiatives and strategies; (3) changes and volatility in political, economic or industry conditions, the interest rate environment, foreign exchange rates or financial and capital markets, which could result in changes in demand for products or services or in the value of assets under management ('AUM'); (4) the relative and absolute investment performance of BlackRock's investment products; (5) BlackRock's ability to develop new products and services that address client preferences; (6) the impact of increased competition; (7) the impact of future acquisitions or divestitures; (8) BlackRock's ability to integrate acquired businesses successfully; (9) the unfavorable resolution of legal proceedings; (10) the extent and timing of any share repurchases; (11) the impact, extent and timing of technological changes and the adequacy of intellectual property, information and cyber security protection; (12) attempts to circumvent BlackRock's operational control environment or the potential for human error in connection with BlackRock's operational systems; (13) the impact of legislative and regulatory actions and reforms and regulatory, supervisory or enforcement actions of government agencies relating to BlackRock; (14) changes in law and policy and\n\n64\n\n65\n\nBlackRock Annual Report 2020\n\nuncertainty pending any such changes; (15) any failure to effectively manage conflicts of interest; (16) damage to BlackRock's reputation; (17) terrorist activities, civil unrest, international hostilities and natural disasters, which may adversely affect the general economy, domestic and local financial and capital markets, specific industries or BlackRock; (18) the ability to attract and retain highly talented professionals; (19) fluctuations in the carrying value of BlackRock's economic investments; (20) the impact of changes to tax legislation, including income, payroll and transaction taxes, and taxation on products or transactions, which could affect the value proposition to clients and, generally, the tax position of the Company; (21) BlackRock's success in negotiating distribution arrangements and maintaining distribution channels for its products; (22) the failure by a key vendor of BlackRock to fulfill its obligations to the Company; (23) operational, technological and regulatory risks associated with BlackRock's major technology partnerships; (24) any disruption to the operations of third parties whose functions are integral to BlackRock's exchange-traded funds ('ETF') platform; (25) the impact of BlackRock electing to provide support to its products from time to time and any potential liabilities related to securities lending or other indemnification obligations; and (26) the impact of problems at other financial institutions or the failure or negative performance of products at other financial institutions.\n\n## OVERVIEW\n\nBlackRock, Inc. (together, with its subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise indicates, 'BlackRock' or the 'Company') is a leading publicly traded investment management firm with $8.68 trillion of AUM at December 31, 2020. With approximately 16,500 employees in more than 30 countries, BlackRock provides a broad range of investment and technology services to institutional and retail clients in more than 100 countries across the globe. For further information see Note 1, Business Overview , and Note 27, Segment Information , in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8.\n\nThe following discussion includes a comparison of BlackRock's results for 2020 and 2019. For a discussion of BlackRock's results for 2018 and a comparison of results for 2019 and 2018, see Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, which was filed with the SEC on February 28, 2020.\n\nOn May 15, 2020, a subsidiary of The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. ('PNC') completed the secondary offering of 31,628,573 shares of the Company's common stock at a price of $420 per share, which included 823,188 shares of common stock issued upon the conversion of the Company's Series B Convertible Participating Preferred Stock and 2,875,325 shares of common stock under the fully exercised underwriters' option to purchase additional shares. Also on May 15, 2020, PNC completed the sale of 2,650,857 shares to the Company at a price of $414.96 per share. The shares repurchased by the Company were in addition to the share repurchase authorization under the Company's existing share\n\nrepurchase program. The secondary offering and the Company's share repurchase resulted in PNC's exit of its entire ownership position in the Company.\n\nCertain prior period presentations and disclosures, while not required to be recast, were reclassified to ensure comparability with current period classifications.\n\n## United Kingdom Exit from European Union\n\nOn December 31, 2020, the United Kingdom ('UK') left the European Union ('EU'), and the UK and EU reverted to being distinct regulatory, legal and customs territories. Although an 'EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement' was agreed to in connection with the UK's departure from the EU, it does not include any substantive provisions with respect to financial services. As a result, from January 1, 2021, cross-border financial services trade between the UK and the EU will be governed by their respective financial services regulations and market access regimes. BlackRock has implemented a number of steps to prepare for this outcome. These steps, which are and have been time consuming and costly and may add complexity to BlackRock's future European operations, include effecting organizational, governance and operational changes, applying for and receiving additional licenses and permissions in the EU, and engaging in client communications. In addition, depending on how the future relationship between the UK and the EU develops, BlackRock may experience further organizational and operational challenges and incur additional costs in connection with its European operations, particularly with regards to delegation and outsourcing, which may impede the Company's growth or impact its financial performance.\n\n## Other Development\n\nOn February 13, 2020, BlackRock announced the establishment of The BlackRock Foundation (the 'Foundation') and the contribution of its remaining 20% stake in PennyMac Financial Services, Inc. ('PennyMac') to the Foundation and the BlackRock Charitable Fund, which BlackRock established in 2013 (together, the 'Charitable Contribution'). The Charitable Contribution resulted in an operating expense of $589 million, which was offset by a $122 million noncash, nonoperating pre-tax gain on the contributed shares and a tax benefit of $241 million in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Charitable Contribution provides long-term funding for BlackRock's philanthropic investments and partnerships. The general and administration expense, nonoperating gain and associated tax benefit related to the Charitable Contribution have been excluded from as adjusted results.\n\n## Business Outlook\n\nBlackRock's framework for long-term value creation is predicated on generating differentiated organic growth, leveraging scale to increase operating margins over time, and returning capital to shareholders on a consistent basis. BlackRock's diversified platform, in terms of style, product, client and geography, enables it to generate more stable cash flows through market cycles, positioning BlackRock to invest for the long-term by striking an appropriate balance between investing for future growth and prudent discretionary expense management.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to result in governmental authorities taking numerous measures to contain the spread and impact of COVID-19, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders, and limitations on business activity, including closures. These measures may continue to, among other things, severely restrict global economic activity, which can disrupt supply chains, lower asset valuations, significantly increase unemployment and underemployment levels, decrease liquidity in markets for certain securities and cause significant volatility and disruption in the financial markets.\n\nTowards the end of the first quarter of 2020 the pandemic began to impact BlackRock's business. While global markets have significantly recovered since then, the effects of the pandemic are ongoing, and such impact may continue in future quarters if conditions persist or worsen.\n\nThe aggregate extent to which COVID-19, and the related global economic crisis, affect BlackRock's business, results of operations and financial condition, will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic and any recovery period, future actions taken by governmental authorities, central banks and other third parties (including new financial regulation and other regulatory reform) in response to the pandemic, and the effects on BlackRock's products, clients, vendors and employees. See Part I, Item 1ARisk Factors herein for information on the possible future effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our results.\n\nIn addition, although the forthcoming environment remains uncertain, BlackRock's business may be impacted by governmental changes, as well as potential regulations, foreign and trade policies and fiscal spending that may arise as a result of such changes.\n\nBlackRock's investment management revenue is primarily comprised of fees earned as a percentage of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees, which are normally expressed as a percentage of fund returns to the client. Numerous factors, including price movements in the equity, debt or currency markets, or in the price of real assets, commodities or alternative investments in which BlackRock invests on behalf of clients, could impact BlackRock's AUM, revenue and earnings.\n\nBlackRock is currently voluntarily waiving a portion of its management fees on certain money market funds to ensure that they maintain a minimum level of daily net investment income. These waivers result in a reduction of management fees, a portion of which is partially offset by a reduction of BlackRock's distribution and servicing costs paid to financial intermediaries. BlackRock has provided voluntary yield support waivers in prior periods and may increase or decrease the level of fee waivers in future periods.\n\nBlackRock manages $4.4 trillion of equity assets across markets globally. Beta divergence between equity markets, where certain markets perform differently than others, may lead to an increase in the proportion of BlackRock AUMweighted toward lower fee equity products, resulting in a decline in BlackRock's effective fee rate. Divergent market factors may also erode the correlation between the\n\nBlackRock Annual Report 2020",

BlackRock is positioned to provide alpha-seeking active, index and cash management investment strategies across asset classes and geographies. In addition, BlackRock leverages its world-class risk management, analytics and technology capabilities, including the Aladdin platform, on behalf of clients. BlackRock serves a diverse mix of institutional and retail clients across the globe, including investors in iShares ETFs, maintaining differentiated client relationships and a fiduciary focus. The diversity of BlackRock's platform facilitates the generation of organic growth in various market environments, and as client preferences evolve. Client demand continues for ETFs and illiquid alternatives, which are two areas of focus for BlackRock.\n\nThe index investing industry has been growing rapidly with ETFs as a major beneficiary - driven by structural tailwinds including the migration from commission-based to fee-based wealth management, clients' focus on value for money, the use of ETFs as alpha tools and the growth of all-to-all networked trading. iShares ETFs' growth strategy is centered on increasing scale and pursuing global growth themes in client and product segments, including Core, Strategic, which includes Fixed Income, Factors, Sustainable and Megatrends ETFs, and Precision Exposures.\n\nAs the wealth management landscape shifts globally from individual product selection to a whole-portfolio approach, BlackRock's retail strategy is focused on creating outcome-oriented client solutions. This includes having a diverse platform of alpha-seeking active, index and alternative products, as well as enhanced distribution and portfolio construction technology offerings.

In February 2021, BlackRock acquired Aperio, a pioneer in customizing tax-optimized index equity SMAs, to enhance our wealth platform and provide whole-portfolio solutions to ultrahigh net worth advisors. By combining Aperio with BlackRock's existing SMA franchise, the Company plans to expand the breadth of personalization capabilities available to wealth managers from BlackRock via tax-managed strategies across factors, broad market indexing, and investor Environmental, Social, and Governance preferences across all asset classes.\n\nBlackRock continues to invest in technology services offerings, which enhance the ability to manage portfolios and risk, effectively serve clients and operate efficiently. Anticipated industry consolidation and regulatory requirements should continue to drive demand for holistic and flexible technology solutions. BlackRock's Aladdin platform provides clients with an ability to manage portfolios and risk across public and private asset classes on a single platform.\n\nAcross BlackRock, more clients are focusing on the impact of sustainability on their portfolios. This shift has been driven by an increased understanding of how sustainability-related factors can affect economic growth, asset values, and financial markets as a whole.

Operating income of $5,695 million increased $144 million and operating margin of 35.1% decreased 310 bps from 2019. Operating income and operating margin reflected higher base fees, performance fees and technology services revenue, which were more than offset by higher expense, including the impact of $589 million related to the Charitable Contribution, higher compensation and benefits expense, and higher product launch costs in 2020. Product launch costs in 2020 included $87 million and $83 million associated with the close of the $2.3 billion BlackRock Health Sciences Trust II and the $2 billion BlackRock Capital Allocation Trust, respectively. Product launch costs for 2019 included $61 million associated with the close of the $1.4 billion BlackRock Science and Technology Trust II.\n\nNonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests ('NCI'), increased $289 million from 2019 driven by the impact of a pre-tax gain of approximately $240 million in connection with a recapitalization of iCapital Network, Inc. ('iCapital') and $122 million pre-tax gain related to the Charitable Contribution, partially offset by lower mark-to-market gains on un-hedged seed capital investments and lower interest income.\n\nIncome tax expense for 2020 included a discrete tax benefit of $241 million recognized in connection with the Charitable Contribution, partially offset by a noncash net expense of approximately $79 million associated with the revaluation of certain deferred income tax assets and liabilities related to\n\nthe legislation enacted in the United Kingdom increasing its corporate tax rate and state and local income tax changes. Income tax expense for 2020 also included $139 million of net discrete tax benefits, including benefits related to changes in the Company's organizational entity structure and stock-based compensation awards. Income tax expense for 2019 included $28 million of discrete tax benefits, primarily related to stock-based compensation awards.\n\nDiluted earnings per common share increased $3.42, or 12%, from 2019, reflecting higher revenue and nonoperating income and a lower diluted share count, partially offset by the impact of the Charitable Contribution and higher product launch costs for 2020.\n\nAs Adjusted . Operating income of $6,284 million increased $733 million and operating margin of 44.9% increased 120 bps from 2019. Diluted earnings per common share increased $5.34, or 19%, from 2019, primarily due to higher operating and nonoperating income and a lower diluted share count in 2020. The financial impact related to the Charitable Contribution and the noncash net tax expense associated with the revaluation of certain deferred income tax assets and liabilities described above has been excluded from as adjusted results.\n\nSee Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further information on as adjusted items.\n\nFor further discussion of BlackRock's revenue, expense, nonoperating results and income tax expense, see Discussion of Financial Results herein.\n\nBlackRock Annual Report 2020",

        "page_content": "## NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\n\nBlackRock reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ('GAAP'); however, management believes evaluating the Company's ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have additional non-GAAP financial measures. Management reviews non-GAAP financial measures to assess ongoing operations and considers them to be helpful, for both management and investors, in evaluating BlackRock's financial performance over time. Management also uses non-GAAP financial measures as a benchmark to compare its performance with other companies and to enhance the comparability of this information for the reporting periods presented. Non-GAAP measures may pose limitations because they\n\ndo not include all of BlackRock's revenue and expense. BlackRock's management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\n\nManagement uses both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating BlackRock's financial performance. Adjustments to GAAP financial measures ('non-GAAP adjustments') include certain items management deems nonrecurring or that occur infrequently, transactions that ultimately will not impact BlackRock's book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow.\n\nComputations for all periods are derived from the consolidated statements of income as follows:\n\n## (1) Operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted:\n\n| (in millions)                                            | 2020     | 2019     |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| Operating income, GAAP basis                             | $ 5,695  | $ 5,551  |\n| Non-GAAP expense adjustments:                            |          |          |\n| Charitable Contribution                                  | 589      | -        |\n| Operating income, as adjusted                            | 6,284    | 5,551    |\n| Product launch costs and commissions                     | 172      | 61       |\n| Operating income used for operating 10margin measurement | $ 6,456  | $ 5,612  |\n| Revenue, GAAP basis                                      | $ 16,205 | $ 14,539 |\n| Non-GAAP adjustments:                                    |          |          |\n| Distribution fees                                        | (1,131)  | (1,069)  |\n| Investment advisory fees                                 | (704)    | (616)    |\n| Revenue used for operating margin measurement            | $ 14,370 | $ 12,854 |\n| Operating margin, GAAP basis                             | 35.1%    | 38.2%    |\n| Operating margin, as adjusted                            | 44.9%    | 43.7%    |\n\nManagement believes operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are effective indicators of BlackRock's financial performance over time and, therefore, provide useful disclosure to investors. Management believes that operating margin, as adjusted, reflects the Company's long-term ability to manage ongoing costs in relation to its revenues. The Company uses operating margin, as adjusted, to assess the Company's financial performance and to determine the long-term and annual compensation of the Company's senior-level employees. Furthermore, this metric is used to evaluate the Company's relative performance against industry peers, as it eliminates margin variability arising from the accounting of revenues and expenses related to distributing different product structures in multiple distribution channels utilized by asset managers.\n\n- \u00b7 Operating income, as adjusted, includes non-GAAP expense adjustments. In 2020, the Charitable Contribution expense of $589 million has been excluded from operating income, as adjusted, due to its nonrecurring nature.\n- \u00b7 Operating income used for measuring operating margin, as adjusted, is equal to operating income, as adjusted, excluding the impact of product launch costs (e.g. closed-end fund launch costs) and related commissions. Management believes the exclusion of such costs and related commissions is useful because these costs can fluctuate considerably and\n\nBlackRock Annual Report 2020\n\nrevenue associated with the expenditure of these costs will not fully impact BlackRock's results until future periods.\n\n- \u00b7 Revenue used for calculating operating margin, as adjusted, is reduced to exclude all of the Company's distribution fees, which are recorded as a separate line item on the consolidated statements of income, as well as a portion of investment advisory fees received that is used to pay distribution and servicing costs. For certain products, based on distinct arrangements, distribution fees are collected by the Company and then passedthrough to third-party client intermediaries. For other products, investment advisory fees are collected by the Company and a portion is passed-through to thirdparty client intermediaries. However, in both structures, the third-party client intermediary similarly owns the relationship with the retail client and is responsible for distributing the product and servicing the client. The amount of distribution and investment advisory fees fluctuates each period primarily based on a predetermined percentage of the value of AUM during the period. These fees also vary based on the type of investment product sold and the geographic location where it is sold. In addition, the Company may waive fees on certain products that could result in the reduction of payments to the third-party intermediaries.\n\n68\n\n69\n\n## (2) Nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted:\n\n| (in millions)                                                                          | 2020   | 2019   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Nonoperating income (expense), GAAP basis                                              | $ 829  | $ 236  |\n| Less: Net income (loss) attributable to NCI                                            | 354    | 50     |\n| Nonoperating income (expense), net of NCI                                              | 475    | 186    |\n| Less: Gain related to the Charitable Contribution                                      | 122    | -      |\n| Nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted | $ 353  | $ 186  |\n\nManagement believes nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, is an effective measure for reviewing BlackRock's nonoperating contribution to its results and provides comparability of this information among reporting periods. Management believes nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, provides a useful measure, for both management and\n\ninvestors, of BlackRock's nonoperating results, which ultimately impact BlackRock's book value. In 2020, the noncash, nonoperating pre-tax gain of $122 million related to the Charitable Contribution has been excluded from nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, due to its nonrecurring nature.\n\n## (3) Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted:\n\n| (in millions, except per share data)                    | 2020    | 2019    |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., GAAP basis  | $ 4,932 | $ 4,476 |\n| Non-GAAP adjustments:                                   |         |         |\n| Charitable Contribution, net of tax                     | 226     | -       |\n| Income tax matters                                      | 79      | 8       |\n| Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted | $ 5,237 | $ 4,484 |\n| Diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding(4)   | 154.8   | 157.5   |\n| Diluted earnings per common share, GAAP basis(4)        | $ 31.85 | $ 28.43 |\n| Diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted(4)       | $ 33.82 | $ 28.48 |\n\nManagement believes net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, and diluted earnings per commonshare, as adjusted, are useful measures of BlackRock's profitability and financial performance. Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, equals net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., GAAP basis, adjusted for significant nonrecurring items, charges that ultimately will not impact BlackRock's book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow.\n\nSee aforementioned discussion regarding operating income, as adjusted, operating margin, as adjusted, and nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted for information on the Charitable Contribution.\n\nIn 2020, a discrete tax benefit of $241 million was recognized in connection with the Charitable Contribution. The discrete tax benefit has been excluded from as adjusted results due to the non-recurring nature of the\n\nCharitable Contribution. Amounts for income tax matters represent net noncash (benefits) expense primarily associated with the revaluation of certain deferred tax liabilities related to intangible assets and goodwill as a result of tax rate changes. The amount for 2020 included a $79 million net noncash expense related to the impact of legislation enacted in the United Kingdom increasing its corporate tax rate and state and local income tax changes. These amounts have been excluded from the as adjusted results as these items will not have a cash flow impact and to ensure comparability among periods presented.\n\nPer share amounts reflect net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted divided by diluted weightedaverage common shares outstanding.\n\n(4) Nonvoting participating preferred stock is considered to be a common stock equivalent for purposes of determining basic and diluted earnings per share calculations. As of December 31, 2020, there were no shares of preferred stock outstanding.\n\nBlackRock Annual Report 2020",

flows across all investment styles and product types.\n\n74\n\n75\n\nBlackRock Annual Report 2020\n\nNet market appreciation of $994.1 billion was driven primarily by higher global equity and fixed income markets.\n\nAUMincreased $31 billion due to the impact of foreign exchange movements, primarily due to the weakening of the US dollar, largely against the British pound.\n\n## DISCUSSION OF FINANCIAL RESULTS\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe Company derives a substantial portion of its revenue from investment advisory and administration fees, which are recognized as the services are performed over time because the customer is receiving and consuming the benefits as they are provided by the Company. Fees are primarily based on agreed-upon percentages of AUM and recognized for services provided during the period, which are distinct from services provided in other periods. Such fees are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation, foreign exchange translation and net inflows or outflows. Net inflows or outflows represent the sum of new client assets, additional fundings from existing clients (including dividend reinvestment), withdrawals of assets from, and termination of, client accounts and distributions to investors representing return of capital and return on investments to investors. Market appreciation or depreciation includes current income earned on, and changes in the fair value of, securities held in client accounts. Foreign exchange translation reflects the impact of translating non-US dollar denominated AUM into US dollars for reporting purposes.\n\nThe Company also earns revenue by lending securities on behalf of clients, primarily to highly rated banks and broker-dealers. The securities loaned are secured by collateral in the form of cash or securities, with minimum collateral generally ranging from approximately 102% to 112%of the value of the loaned securities. Generally, the revenue earned is shared between the Company and the funds or accounts managed by the Company from which the securities are borrowed.\n\nInvestment advisory agreements for certain separate accounts and investment funds provide for performance fees based upon relative and/or absolute investment performance, in addition to base fees based on AUM. Investment advisory performance fees generally are earned after a given period of time and when investment performance exceeds a contractual threshold. As such, the timing of recognition of performance fees may increase the volatility of the Company's revenue and earnings. The magnitude of performance fees can fluctuate quarterly due to the timing of carried interest recognition on alternative products; however, the third and fourth quarters have a greater number of nonalternative products with performance measurement periods that end on either September 30 or December 31.\n\nThe Company offers investment management technology systems, risk management services, wealth management and digital distribution tools, all on a fee basis. Clients include banks, insurance companies, official institutions, pension funds, asset managers, retail distributors and other investors. Fees earned for technology services are primarily recorded as services are performed over time and are generally determined using the value of positions on the Aladdin platform, or on a fixed-rate basis. Revenue derived from the sale of software licenses is recognized upon the granting of access rights.\n\nThe Company earns distribution and service fees for distributing investment products and providing support services to investments portfolios. The fees are based on AUMandare recognized when the amount of fees is known.\n\nThe Company advises global financial institutions, regulators, and government entities across a range of risk, regulatory, capital markets and strategic services. Fees earned for advisory services, which are included in advisory and other revenue, are determined using fixedrate fees and are recognized over time as the related services are completed.\n\nThe Company earns fees for transition management services primarily comprised of commissions recognized in connection with buying and selling securities on behalf of its customers. Commissions related to transition management services, which are included in advisory and other revenue, are recorded on a trade-date basis as transactions occur.\n\nThe Company also earns revenue related to certain minority investments accounted for as equity method investments.\n\nOperating expense reflects employee compensation and benefits, distribution and servicing costs, direct fund expense, general and administration expense and amortization of finite-lived intangible assets.\n\n- \u00b7 Employee compensation and benefits expense includes salaries, commissions, temporary help, deferred and incentive compensation, employer payroll taxes, severance and related benefit costs.\n- \u00b7 Distribution and servicing costs, which are primarily AUMdriven, include payments to third parties, primarily associated with distribution and servicing of client investments in certain Company products.\n- \u00b7 Direct fund expense primarily consists of third-party nonadvisory expenses incurred by the Company related to certain funds for the use of index trademarks, reference data for indices, custodial services, fund administration, fund accounting, transfer agent services, shareholder reporting services, legal expense, and audit and tax services as well as other fund-related expenses directly attributable to the nonadvisory operations of the fund. These expenses may vary over time with fluctuations in AUM, number of shareholder accounts, or other attributes directly related to volume of business.\n- \u00b7 General and administration expense includes marketing and promotional, occupancy and officerelated costs, portfolio services (including clearing expense related to transition management services), technology, professional services, communications, contingent consideration fair value adjustments, product launch costs, the impact of foreign currency remeasurement, and other general and administration expense. Foreign currency remeasurement losses were $6 million and $31 million for 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\nApproximately 75% of the Company's revenue is generated in US dollars. The Company's revenue and expense generated in foreign currencies (primarily the Euro and British pound) are impacted by foreign exchange rates. Any effect of foreign exchange rate change on revenue is partially offset by a change in expense driven by the Company's considerable non-dollar expense base related to its operations outside the United States.\n\nBlackRock Annual Report 2020",

Investments generally are made for co-investment purposes, to establish a performance track record or for regulatory purposes, including Federal Reserve Bank\n\nstock. The Company does not engage in proprietary trading activities that could conflict with the interests of its clients.\n\nIn addition, nonoperating income (expense) includes the impact of changes in the valuations of consolidated sponsored investment funds.

by higher base and performance fees and 17%growth in technology services revenue.\n\nBase fees of $12,639 million in 2020 increased $862 million from $11,777 million in 2019, primarily driven by organic growth, the positive impact of market beta and foreign exchange movements on average AUM and higher securities lending revenue, partially offset by the impact of fee reductions on certain products. Securities lending revenue of $652 million increased $35 million from $617 million in 2019, primarily reflecting higher average balances of securities on loan and higher cash reinvestment spreads, partially offset by lower asset spreads.\n\nInvestment advisory performance fees of $1,104 million in 2020 increased $654 million from $450 million in 2019,\n\nprimarily reflecting higher revenue from liquid alternative and long-only equity products. Approximately 60% of the full year increase in performance fees was attributable to a single hedge fund strategy that delivered strong performance during the year.\n\nTechnology services revenue of $1,139 million for 2020 increased $165 million from $974 million in 2019, primarily reflecting higher revenue from Aladdin and the impact of the eFront acquisition, which closed in May of 2019.\n\nAdvisory and other revenue of $192 million in 2020 decreased $77 million from $269 million in 2019, primarily reflecting the impact of the Charitable Contribution of BlackRock's remaining 20% stake in PennyMac in 2020 and lower advisory assignments.\n\nBlackRock Annual Report 2020",

The significant foreign jurisdictions that have different statutory tax rates than the US federal statutory rate of 21% include the United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada and Germany.\n\n2020 Income tax expense (GAAP) reflected:\n\n- \u00b7 a discrete tax benefit of $241 million recognized in connection with the Charitable Contribution;\n- \u00b7 a discrete tax benefit of $139 million, including benefits related to changes in the Company's organizational entity structure and stock-based compensation awards that vested in 2020; and\n- \u00b7 a $79 million net noncash expense associated with the revaluation of certain deferred income tax assets and liabilities related to legislation enacted in the United Kingdom increasing its corporate tax rate and state and local income tax changes.\n\nThe as adjusted effective tax rate of 21.1% for 2020 excluded the $241 million discrete tax benefit in connection with the Charitable contribution due to its non-recurring nature and the $79 million noncash\n\ndeferred tax revaluation noncash expense mentioned above as it will not have a cash flow impact and to ensure comparability among periods presented.\n\n2019 Income tax expense (GAAP) reflected:\n\n- \u00b7 a discrete tax benefit of $28 million primarily related to stock-based compensation awards that vested in 2020.\n\n## BALANCE SHEET OVERVIEW\n\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the consolidated statement of financial condition presented on a GAAP basis to the consolidated statement of financial condition, excluding the impact of separate account assets and separate account collateral held under securities lending agreements (directly related to lending separate account securities) and separate account liabilities and separate account collateral liabilities under securities lending agreements and consolidated sponsored investment products.\n\nThe Company presents the as adjusted balance sheet as additional information to enable investors to exclude certain assets that have equal and offsetting liabilities or noncontrolling interests that ultimately do not have an\n\nBlackRock Annual Report 2020",

Management views the as adjusted balance sheet, which contains non-GAAP financial measures, as an economic presentation of the Company's total assets and liabilities; however, it does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\nSeparate Account Assets and Liabilities and Separate Account Collateral Held under Securities Lending Agreements\n\nSeparate account assets are maintained by BlackRock Life Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company that is a registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom, and represent segregated assets held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The Company records equal and offsetting separate account liabilities. The separate account assets are not available to creditors of the Company and the holders of the pension contracts have no recourse to the Company's assets. The net investment income attributable to separate account assets accrues directly to the contract owners and is not reported on the consolidated statements of income. While BlackRock has no economic interest in these assets or liabilities, BlackRock earns an investment advisory fee for the service of managing these assets on behalf of its clients.\n\nIn addition, the Company records on its consolidated statements of financial condition the separate account collateral received under BlackRock Life Limited securities lending arrangements as its own asset in addition to an equal and offsetting separate account collateral liability for the obligation to return the collateral. The collateral is not available to creditors of the Company, and the borrowers under the securities lending arrangements have no recourse to the Company's assets.\n\n## Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products\n\nThe Company consolidates certain sponsored investment products accounted for as variable interest entities ('VIEs') and voting rights entities ('VREs'), (collectively, 'consolidated sponsored investment products'). See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies , in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing for more information on the Company's consolidation policy.\n\nThe Company cannot readily access cash and cash equivalents or other assets held by consolidated sponsored investment products to use in its operating activities. In addition, the Company cannot readily sell investments held by consolidated sponsored investment products in order to obtain cash for use in the Company's operations.\n\n|                                                                                             | December 31, 2020   | December 31, 2020                       | December 31, 2020                              | December 31, 2020   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|---------------------|\n| (in millions)                                                                               | GAAP Basis          | Separate Account Assets/ Collateral (1) | Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products (2) | As Adjusted         |\n| Assets                                                                                      |                     |                                         |                                                |                     |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                                                                   | $ 8,664             | $ -

Please see the consolidated statements of financial condition as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing. The discussion does not include changes related to assets and liabilities that are equal and offsetting and have no impact on BlackRock's stockholders' equity.\n\nAssets. Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2020 and 2019 included $206 million and $141 million, respectively, of cash held by consolidated sponsored investment products (see Liquidity and Capital Resources for details on the change in cash and cash equivalents during 2020).\n\nAccounts receivable at December 31, 2020 increased $356 million from December 31, 2019, primarily due to higher performance and base fees receivables. Investments, including the impact of consolidated sponsored investment products increased $1,430 million from December 31, 2019 (for more information see Investments herein). Goodwill and intangible assets decreased $117 million from December 31, 2019, primarily due to amortization of intangible assets. Other assets (including operating lease right-of-use ('ROU') assets and property and equipment) decreased $4 million from December 31, 2019, primarily due to a net decrease in certain corporate minority investments, primarily related to the previously discussed Charitable Contribution of BlackRock's remaining 20% stake in PennyMac, partially offset by an increase in unit trust receivables (substantially offset by an increase in unit trust payables recorded within other liabilities).\n\nLiabilities. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2020 increased $442 million from December 31, 2019, primarily due to higher 2020 incentive compensation accruals. Other liabilities increased $222 million from December 31, 2019, primarily due to higher other liabilities of consolidated sponsored investment products and higher unit trust payables (substantially offset by an increase in unit trust receivables recorded within other assets), partially offset by lower contingent liabilities related to certain acquisitions. Net deferred income tax liabilities at\n\nDecember 31, 2020 decreased $61 million from December 31, 2019, primarily due to the effects of temporary differences associated with stock-based compensation, investment income and the income tax benefit related to the Charitable Contribution, partially offset by the effects of temporary differences associated with the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities due to tax legislation enacted in the United Kingdom and state and local income tax changes.\n\n## Investments\n\nThe Company's investments were $6,919 million and $5,489 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Investments include consolidated investments held by sponsored investment products accounted for as VIEs and VREs. Management reviews BlackRock's investments on an 'economic' basis, which eliminates the portion of investments that does not impact BlackRock's book value or net income attributable to BlackRock. BlackRock's management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\nThe Company presents investments, as adjusted, to enable investors to understand the portion of investments that is owned by the Company, net of NCI, as a gauge to measure the impact of changes in net nonoperating income (expense) on investments to net income (loss) attributable to BlackRock.\n\nThe Company further presents net 'economic' investment exposure, net of deferred compensation investments and hedged investments, to reflect another helpful measure for investors. The economic impact of investments held pursuant to deferred compensation arrangements is offset by a change in compensation expense. The impact of certain investments is substantially mitigated by swap hedges. Carried interest capital allocations are excluded as there is no impact to BlackRock's stockholders' equity until such amounts are realized as performance fees. Finally, the Company's regulatory investment in Federal Reserve Bank stock, which is not subject to market or interest rate risk, is excluded from the Company's net economic investment exposure.\n\n| (in millions)                                                  | December 31, 2020   | December 31, 2019   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Investments, GAAP                                              | $ 6,919             | $ 5,489             |\n| Investments held by consolidated sponsored investment products | (4,976)             | (3,784)             |\n| Net interest in consolidated sponsored investment products (1) | 2,490               | 2,290               |\n| Investments, as adjusted                                       | 4,433               | 3,995               |\n| Federal Reserve Bank stock                                     | (94)                | (93)                |\n| Deferred compensation investments                              | (6)                 | (23)                |\n| Hedged investments                                             | (833)               | (644)               |\n| Carried interest                                               | (627)               | (528)               |\n| Total 'economic' investment exposure (2)                       | $ 2,873             | $ 2,707             |\n\nBlackRock Annual Report 2020",

BlackRock uses its cash to pay for all operating expense, interest and principal on borrowings, income taxes, dividends on BlackRock's capital stock, repurchases of the Company's stock, acquisitions, capital expenditures and purchases of co-investments and seed investments.\n\nFor details of the Company's GAAP cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, see the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing.\n\nCash flows provided by/(used in) operating activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment products, primarily include the receipt of investment advisory and administration fees, securities lending revenue and performance fees offset by the payment of operating expenses incurred in the normal course of business, including year-end incentive compensation accrued for in the prior year.\n\nCash flows used in investing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment products, for 2020 were $183 million and reflected $194 million of purchases of property and equipment and $172 million of net investment purchases, partially offset by $183 million of distributions of capital from equity method investees.\n\nCash flows used in financing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment products, for 2020 were $1.9 billion, primarily resulting from $1.8 billion of share repurchases, including $1.1 billion from PNC, $412 million in open market transactions and $297 million of employee tax withholdings related to employee stock transactions, and $2.3 billion of cash dividend payments, partially offset by $2.2 billion of proceeds from long-term borrowings.\n\nThe Company manages its financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. Liquidity resources at December 31, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:\n\n| (in millions)                                                                    | December 31, 2020   | December 31, 2019   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Cash and cash equivalents (1)                                                    | $ 8,664             | $ 4,829             |\n| Cash and cash equivalents held by consolidated sponsored investment products (2) | (206)               | (141)               |\n| Subtotal                                                                         | 8,458               | 4,688               |\n| Credit facility - undrawn                                                        | 4,000               | 4,000               |\n| Total liquidity resources (3)                                                    | $ 12,458            | $ 8,688             |\n\nTotal liquidity resources increased $3,770 million during 2020, primarily reflecting $2.2 billion of proceeds from long-term borrowings and cash flows from other operating\n\nactivities, partially offset by cash dividend payments of $2.3 billion and share repurchases of $1.8 billion.\n\nA significant portion of the Company's $4,433 million of investments, as adjusted, is illiquid in nature and, as such, cannot be readily convertible to cash.\n\nThe Company's liquidity and capital resources were not materially impacted by COVID-19 and related economic conditions during 2020. The Company will continue to monitor its liquidity and capital resources due to the current pandemic.\n\nShare Repurchases. During 2020, the Company repurchased an aggregate of approximately $1.5 billion of commonshares, including the repurchase from PNC and 0.8 million common shares under the Company's existing share repurchase program for approximately $412 million. At December 31, 2020, there were 5.1 million shares still authorized to be repurchased under the program.\n\nNet Capital Requirements. The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries within a number of jurisdictions, which is partially maintained by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those subsidiaries or jurisdictions. As a result, such subsidiaries of the Company may be restricted in their ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions and to their parents. Additionally, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers.\n\nBlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. ('BTC') is chartered as a national bank that does not accept deposits or make commercial loans and whose powers are limited to trust and other fiduciary activities. BTC provides investment management and other fiduciary services, including investment advisory and securities lending agency services, to institutional clients. BTC is subject to regulatory capital and liquid asset requirements administered by the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.\n\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company was required to maintain approximately $2.2 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, in net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries, including BTC, entities regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority and Prudential Regulation Authority in the United Kingdom, and the Company's broker-dealers. The Company was in compliance with all applicable regulatory net capital requirements.\n\nUndistributed Earnings of Foreign Subsidiaries. As a result of The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the one-time mandatory deemed repatriation tax on untaxed accumulated foreign earnings, US income taxes were provided on the Company's undistributed foreign earnings. The financial statement basis in excess of tax basis of its foreign subsidiaries remains indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. The Company will continue to evaluate its capital management plans.\n\n## Short-Term Borrowings\n\n2020 Revolving Credit Facility. The Company's credit facility has an aggregate commitment amount of $4 billion and was amended in March 2020 to extend the maturity date to March 2025 (the '2020 credit facility').

The 2020 credit facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, where net debt equals total debt less unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied with a ratio of less than 1 to 1 at December 31, 2020. The 2020 credit facility provides\n\nback-up liquidity to fund ongoing working capital for general corporate purposes and various investment opportunities. At December 31, 2020, the Company had no amount outstanding under the 2020 credit facility.\n\nCommercial Paper Program. The Company can issue unsecured commercial paper notes (the 'CP Notes') on a private-placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $4 billion. The commercial paper program is currently supported by the 2020 credit facility.

The Company leases its primary office locations under agreements that expire on varying dates through 2043. In connection with certain lease agreements, the Company is responsible for escalation payments. The contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease-related payments.\n\nIn May 2017, the Company entered into an agreement with 50 HYMC Owner LLC, for the lease of approximately 847,000 square feet of office space located at 50 Hudson Yards, New York, New York. The term of the lease includes 20 years of cash rental payments expected to begin in May 2023, with the option to renew for a specified term. The lease requires annual base rental payments of approximately $51 million per year during the first five years of the lease term, increasing every five years to $58 million, $66 million and $74 million per year (or approximately $1.2 billion in base rent over a 20-year period). In November 2019, the Company exercised its initial expansion option with respect to two additional floors aggregating approximately 122,000 square feet of office space. The additional space requires approximately $185 million in base rent over the 20-year period.\n\nFor more information on the Company's operating leases, see Note 13, Leases , in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing.\n\nPurchase Obligations. In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts, which are either noncancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2020, the Company's obligations primarily reflected standard service contracts for portfolio services,\n\nmarket data, office-related services and third-party marketing and promotional services, and obligations for equipment. Purchase obligations are recorded on the consolidated financial statements when services are provided and, as such, obligations for services and equipment not received are not included in the consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2020.\n\nInvestment Commitments. At December 31, 2020, the Company had $789 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment products, including consolidated sponsored investment products. These products include private equity funds, real assets funds and opportunistic funds. This amount excludes additional commitments made by consolidated funds of funds to underlying third-party funds as third-party noncontrolling interest holders have the legal obligation to fund the respective commitments of such funds of funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown and the commitments are callable on demand at any time prior to the expiration of the commitment. These unfunded commitments are not recorded on the consolidated statements of financial condition. These commitments do not include potential future commitments approved by the Company that are not yet legally binding. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to fund additional investment products for, and with, its clients.\n\nContingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions . In connection with certain acquisitions, BlackRock is required to make contingent payments, subject to achieving specified performance targets, which may include revenue related to acquired contracts or new capital commitments for certain products. The fair value of the remaining aggregate contingent payments at December 31, 2020 totaled $26 million and is included in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition.\n\nBlackRock Annual Report 2020",

        "page_content": "The following items have not been included in the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies table:\n\nCarried Interest Clawback. As a general partner in certain investment products, including private equity partnerships and certain hedge funds, the Company may receive carried interest cash distributions from the partnerships in accordance with distribution provisions of the partnership agreements. The Company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a return as specified in the various partnership agreements. Therefore, BlackRock records carried interest subject to such clawback provisions in investments, or cash and cash equivalents to the extent that it is distributed, and as a deferred carried interest liability on its consolidated statements of financial condition. Carried interest is recorded as performance fees on BlackRock's consolidated statements of income when fees are no longer probable of significant reversal.\n\nIndemnifications. In the ordinary course of business or in connection with certain acquisition agreements, BlackRock enters into contracts pursuant to which it may agree to indemnify third parties in certain circumstances. The terms of these indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined or the likelihood of any liability is considered remote and, therefore, has not been included in the table above or recorded in the consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2020. See further discussion in Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies , in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing.\n\nOnbehalf of certain clients, the Company lends securities to highly rated banks and broker-dealers. In these securities lending transactions, the borrower is required to provide and maintain collateral at or above regulatory minimums. Securities on loan are marked to market daily to determine if the borrower is required to pledge additional collateral. In connection with securities lending transactions, BlackRock has agreed to indemnify certain securities lending clients against potential loss resulting from a borrower's failure to fulfill its obligations under the securities lending agreement should the value of the collateral pledged by the borrower at the time of default be insufficient to cover the borrower's obligation under the securities lending agreement. The amount of securities on loan as of December 31, 2020 and subject to this type of indemnification was $270 billion. In the Company's capacity as lending agent, cash and securities totaling $289 billion was held as collateral for indemnified securities on loan at December 31, 2020. The fair value of these indemnifications was not material at December 31, 2020.\n\nWhile the collateral pledged by a borrower is intended to be sufficient to offset the borrower's obligations to return securities borrowed and any other amounts owing to the lender under the relevant securities lending agreement, in the event of a borrower default, the Company can give no assurance that the collateral pledged by the borrower will be sufficient to fulfill such obligations. If the amount of such pledged collateral is not sufficient to fulfill such obligations to a client for whom the Company has provided indemnification, BlackRock would be responsible for the amount of the shortfall. These indemnifications\n\n86\n\n87\n\nBlackRock Annual Report 2020\n\ncover only the collateral shortfall described above, and do not in any way guarantee, assume or otherwise insure the investment performance or return of any cash collateral vehicle into which securities lending cash collateral is invested.\n\nCompensation and Benefit Obligations. The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the contractual obligations and commitments table above. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2020 totaled $2,500 million and included annual incentive compensation of $1,685 million, deferred compensation of $428 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $387 million. Substantially all of the incentive compensation liability was paid in the first quarter of 2021, while the deferred compensation obligations are payable over various periods, with the majority payable over periods of up to three years.\n\nAcquisition. On February 1, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of 100% of the equity interests of Aperio, a pioneer in customizing tax-optimized index equity separately managed accounts ('SMAs') for approximately $1.1 billion in cash, using existing cash resources. The acquisition of Aperio increased BlackRock's SMA assets and is expected to expand the breadth of the Company's capabilities via tax-managed strategies across factors, broad market indexing, and investor Environmental, Social, and Governance preferences across all asset classes. In connection with the acquisition, the Company recorded an initial estimate of purchase price allocation at the date of the transaction primarily related to goodwill of approximately $0.8 billion and $0.3 billion of finite-lived intangible assets (mainly customer relationships), which will be amortized over their estimated lives, which range from 10 to 12 years, with a weighted-average estimated life of approximately 10 years. The goodwill recognized in connection with the acquisition is primarily attributable to anticipated synergies from the transaction. The amount of goodwill expected to be deductible for tax purposes is approximately $0.5 billion.\n\n## CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the consolidated financial statements. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies , in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this filing.\n\n## Consolidation\n\nIn the normal course of business, the Company is the manager of various types of sponsored investment vehicles. The Company performs an analysis for\n\ninvestment products to determine if the product is a VIE or a VRE. Assessing whether an entity is a VIE or a VRE involves judgment and analysis. Factors considered in this assessment include the entity's legal organization, the entity's capital structure and equity ownership, and any related party or de facto agent implications of the Company's involvement with the entity. Investments that are determined to be VREs are consolidated if the Company can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is greater than 50% voting interest. Investments that are determined to be VIEs are consolidated if the Company is the primary beneficiary ('PB') of the entity. BlackRock is deemed to be the PB of a VIE if it has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entities' economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that potentially could be significant to the VIE. The Company generally consolidates VIEs in which it holds an economic interest of 10% or greater and deconsolidates such VIEs once equity ownership falls below 10%. See Note 6, Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products , in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing for more information.\n\n## Investments\n\nEquity Method Investments . For equity investments where BlackRock does not control the investee, and where it is not the PB of a VIE, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the Company follows the equity method of accounting. The evaluation of whether the Company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. Factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement, including investor voting or other rights, the terms of BlackRock's advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence BlackRock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the fund's operating documents and the relationship between BlackRock and other investors in the entity.\n\nBlackRock's equity method investees that are investment companies record their underlying investments at fair value. Therefore, under the equity method of accounting, BlackRock's share of the investee's underlying net income predominantly represents fair value adjustments in the investments held by the equity method investees. BlackRock's share of the investee's underlying net income or loss is based upon the most currently available information and is recorded as nonoperating income (expense) for investments in investment companies, or as advisory and other revenue for certain corporate minority investments, which are recorded in other assets, since such investees are considered to be an extension of BlackRock's core business.\n\nAt December 31, 2020, the Company had $1,081 million and $399 million of equity method investments, included in investments and other assets, respectively, and at December 31, 2019, the Company had $943 million and $531 million of equity method investments included in investments and other assets, respectively.\n\nOther nonequity method corporate minority investments. Other nonequity method corporate minority investments are recorded within other assets on the consolidated statements of financial condition. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, these investments totaled $272 million and $282 million, respectively, and included investments in equity securities, which are generally measured at fair value or under the measurement alternative to fair value for nonmarketable securities. Changes in value of these securities are recorded in nonoperating income (expense) on the consolidated statements of income. See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies , in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing for more information.\n\nImpairments of Investments. Evaluation of impairments involves significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results, and these differences could have a material impact on the consolidated statements of income. See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies , in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing for more information.\n\n## Fair Value Measurements\n\nThe Company's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement according to the fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2 and 3 inputs, as defined) in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies , in the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing for more information on fair value measurements.\n\nChanges in Valuation. Changes in value on $6,919 million of investments will impact the Company's nonoperating income (expense), $404 million are held at cost or amortized cost and the remaining $627 million relates to carried interest, which will not impact nonoperating income (expense). At December 31, 2020, changes in fair value of $4,372 million of consolidated sponsored investment products will impact BlackRock's net income (loss) attributable to NCI on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRock's net exposure to changes in fair value of consolidated sponsored investment products was $1,886 million.\n\n## Leases\n\nThe Company determines if a contract is a lease or contains a lease at inception. The identification of whether a contract contains a lease requires judgment, including determining whether there are identified assets in the contract that the Company has control over for a specified period of time in exchange for consideration.\n\nFixed lease payments are included in the measurement of ROUassets and lease liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. The Company recognizes ROUassets and lease liabilities based on the present value of these future lease payments over the lease term at the commencement date discounted using the Company's incremental borrowing rate ('IBR'). Management judgment is required in determining the Company's IBR, including assessing the Company's credit rating using various financial metrics, such as revenue, operating margin and revenue growth, and, as\n\nBlackRock Annual Report 2020",

The assignment of indefinite lives to such investment fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. In addition, trade names/trademarks are considered indefinite-lived intangibles if they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. Indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized.\n\nFinite-lived management contracts, which relate to acquired separate accounts and funds, investor/customer relationships, and technology related assets that are expected to contribute to the future cash flows of the Company for a specified period of time are amortized over their remaining expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2020 ranged from 1 to 10 years with a weighted-average remaining estimated useful life of seven years.\n\nGoodwill. The Company assesses its goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as the book value and the market capitalization of the Company. The impairment assessment performed as of July 31, 2020 indicated no impairment charge was required. The Company continues to monitor its book value per share compared with closing prices of its commonstock for potential indicators of impairment. At December 31, 2020, the Company's common stock closed at $721.54, which exceeded its book value of approximately $231.31 per share.\n\nIndefinite-lived and finite-lived intangibles. The Company performs assessments to determine if any intangible assets are impaired and whether the indefinite-life and finite-life classifications are still appropriate.\n\nIn evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of indefinite-lived intangibles is less than carrying value, BlackRock performed certain quantitative assessments and assessed various significant qualitative factors including AUM, revenue basis points, projected AUMgrowth rates, operating margins, tax rates and discount rates. In addition, the Company considered other factors including: (i) macroeconomic conditions such as a deterioration in general economic conditions, limitations on accessing capital, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, or other developments in equity and credit markets; (ii) industry and market considerations such as a deterioration in the environment in which the Company operates, an increased competitive environment, a decline in market-dependent multiples or metrics, a change in the\n\n88\n\n89\n\nBlackRock Annual Report 2020\n\nmarket for an entity's services, or regulatory, legal or political developments; and (iii) the Company-specific events, such as a change in management or key personnel, overall financial performance and litigation that could affect significant inputs used to determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset. If an indefinite-lived intangible is determined to be more likely than not impaired, then the fair value of the asset is compared with its carrying value and any excess of the carrying value over the fair value would be recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs.\n\nFor finite-lived intangible assets, if potential impairment circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform a recoverability test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. Actual results could differ from these cash flow estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. If the carrying value of the asset is determined not to be recoverable based on the undiscounted cash flow test, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value would be recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs.\n\nIn addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which finite-lived intangible assets will contribute to the Company's cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite-lived intangible asset to a finite-lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Company's amortization expense, which was $106 million, $97 million and $50 million for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n\nIn 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company performed impairment tests, including evaluating various qualitative factors and performing certain quantitative assessments. The Company determined that no impairment charges were required and that the classification of indefinite-lived versus finite-lived intangibles was still appropriate and no changes were required to the expected lives of the finitelived intangibles. The Company continuously monitors various factors, including AUM, for potential indicators of impairment.\n\n## Contingent Consideration Liabilities\n\nIn connection with certain acquisitions, BlackRock is required to make contingent payments, subject to achieving specified performance targets. The fair value of this contingent consideration is estimated at the time of acquisition closing and is included in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. As the fair value of the expected payments amount subsequently changes, the contingent consideration liability is adjusted, resulting in contingent consideration fair value adjustments recorded within general and administration expense of the consolidated statements of income. Cash payments up to the acquisition date fair value amount of the contingent consideration liability are reflected as financing activities with excess (if any) cash payments classified in operating activities. Any cash payments made soon after the acquisition date will be classified in investing activities.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nRevenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised services to customers in an amount to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those services. The Company enters into contracts that can include multiple services, which are accounted for separately if they are determined to be distinct. Management judgment is required to identify distinct services and involves assessing such factors as whether the promised services significantly modify or customize one another or are highly interdependent or interrelated. Management judgment may be also required when determining the following: when variable consideration is no longer probable of significant reversal (and hence can be included in revenue); whether certain revenue should be presented gross or net of certain related costs; when a promised service transfers to the customer; and the applicable method of measuring progress for services transferred to the customer over time. Many of BlackRock's promised services represent a series of distinct services (e.g., investment advisory services) in which the associated variable consideration (e.g., management fees) is allocated to specific days of service as opposed to over the entire contract term.\n\nInvestment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed over time because the customer is receiving and consuming the benefits as they are provided by the Company. Fees are primarily based on agreed-upon percentages of AUM and recognized for services provided during the period, which are distinct from services provided in other periods. Such fees are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation, foreign exchange translation and net inflows or outflows. AUM represents the broad range of financial assets the Company manages for clients on a discretionary basis pursuant to investment management and trust agreements that are expected to continue for at least 12 months. In general, reported AUM reflects the valuation methodology that corresponds to the basis used for determining revenue (for example, net asset values).\n\nThe Company earns revenue by lending securities on behalf of clients, primarily to highly rated banks and broker-dealers. The securities loaned are secured by collateral, generally ranging from 102% to 112% of the value of the loaned securities. For 2020, 2019 and 2018, securities lending revenue earned by the Company totaled $652 million, $617 million and $627 million, respectively, and is recorded in investment advisory, administration and securities lending revenue on the consolidated statements of income. Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue are reported together as the fees for these services often are agreed upon with clients as a bundled fee.\n\nThe Company receives investment advisory performance fees, including incentive allocations (carried interest) from certain actively managed investment funds and certain separately managed accounts. These performance fees are dependent upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds, which may vary by product or account, and include monthly, quarterly, annual or longer measurement periods.\n\nPerformance fees, including carried interest, are recognized when it is determined that they are no longer probable of significant reversal (such as upon the sale of a\n\nfund's investment or when the amount of AUM becomes known as of the end of a specified measurement period). Given the unique nature of each fee arrangement, contracts with customers are evaluated on an individual basis to determine the timing of revenue recognition. Significant judgement is involved in making such determination. Performance fees typically arise from investment management services that began in prior reporting periods. Consequently, a portion of the fees the Company recognizes may be partially related to the services performed in prior periods that meet the recognition criteria in the current period. At each reporting date, the Company considers various factors in estimating performance fees to be recognized, including carried interest. These factors include but are not limited to whether: (1) the fees are dependent on the market and thus are highly susceptible to factors outside the Company's influence; (2) the fees have a large number and a broad range of possible amounts; and (3) the funds or separately managed accounts have the ability to invest or reinvest their sales proceeds.\n\nThe Company is allocated carried interest from certain alternative investment products upon exceeding performance thresholds. The Company may be required to reverse/return all, or part, of such carried interest allocations/distributions depending upon future performance of these products. Carried interest subject to such clawback provisions is recorded in investments or cash and cash equivalents to the extent that it is distributed, on its consolidated statements of financial condition.\n\nThe Company records a liability for deferred carried interest to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations related to carried interest prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had $584 million and $483 million, respectively, of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. A portion of the deferred carried interest may also be paid to certain employees. The ultimate timing of the recognition of performance fee revenue and related compensation expense, if any, for these products is unknown. See Note 17, Revenue , in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for detailed changes in the deferred carried interest liability balance for 2020 and 2019.\n\nFees earned for technology services are primarily recorded as services are performed and are generally determined using the value of positions on the Aladdin platform or on a fixed-rate basis. Revenue derived from the sale of software licenses is recognized upon the granting of access rights.\n\nDistribution and service fees earned for distributing investment products and providing support services to investment portfolios, are based on AUM, and are recognized when the amount of fees is known.\n\nAdjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates recorded historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRock's investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated based on AUM and since the Company does not record performance fee revenue until: (1) performance thresholds have been exceeded and (2) management determines the fees are no longer probable of significant reversal.\n\nBlackRock Annual Report 2020",

        "page_content": "## Income Taxes\n\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\n\nSignificant management judgment is required in estimating the ranges of possible outcomes and determining the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes. Actual future tax consequences relating to uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Company's current estimates. At December 31, 2020, BlackRock had $940 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $565 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate.\n\nManagement is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred income tax assets and assess deferred income tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred income tax assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2020, the Company had deferred income tax assets of $304 million and deferred income tax liabilities of $3,673 million on the consolidated statement of financial condition. Changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company.\n\nThe Company assesses whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred income tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. The assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecast of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods, the Company's experience with tax attributes expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives.\n\nThe Company records income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company's actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company had current income taxes receivables of approximately $175 million and current income taxes payables of $131 million at December 31, 2020.\n\n## Accounting Developments\n\nFor accounting pronouncements that the Company adopted during the year ended December 31, 2020, see Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies , in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing.\n\n90\n\n91\n\nBlackRock Annual Report 2020\n\n## Item 7a. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\n\nAUMMarket Price Risk. BlackRock's investment advisory and administration fees are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on AUM. At December 31, 2020, the majority of the Company's investment advisory and administration fees were based on average or period end AUMof the applicable investment funds or separate accounts. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates/credit spreads, foreign exchange rates or all three could cause the value of AUM to decline, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees.\n\nCorporate Investments Portfolio Risks. As a leading investment management firm, BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing and analyzing market and operating risks, including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio. The Board of Directors of the Company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the Company, requiring, among other things, that investments be reviewed by certain senior officers of the Company, and that certain investments may be referred to the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors, depending on the circumstances, for approval.\n\nIn the normal course of its business, BlackRock is exposed to equity market price risk, interest rate/credit spread risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments.\n\nBlackRock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes, including real assets, private equity and hedge funds. Investments generally are made for co-investment purposes, to establish a performance track record, to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans or for regulatory purposes. Currently, the Company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into swaps to hedge market and interest rate exposure to certain investments. At December 31, 2020, the Company had outstanding total return swaps with an aggregate notional value of approximately $833 million. At December 31, 2020, there were no outstanding interest rate swaps.\n\nAt December 31, 2020, approximately $5.0 billion of BlackRock's investments were maintained in consolidated sponsored investment products accounted for as variable interest entities and voting rights entities. Excluding the impact of the Federal Reserve Bank stock, carried interest, investments made to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans and certain investments that are hedged via the seed capital hedging program, the Company's economic exposure to its investment portfolio is $2.9 billion. See Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Balance Sheet Overview -Investments for further information on the Company's investments.\n\nEquity Market Price Risk. At December 31, 2020, the Company's net exposure to equity market price risk in its investment portfolio was approximately $1,048 million of the Company's total economic investment exposure. Investments subject to market price risk include private equity and real assets investments, hedge funds and funds of funds as well as mutual funds. The Company estimates that a hypothetical 10% adverse change in market prices would result in a decrease of approximately $105 million in the carrying value of such investments.\n\nInterest-Rate/Credit Spread Risk. At December 31, 2020, the Company was exposed to interest rate risk and credit spread risk as a result of approximately $1,825 million of investments in debt securities and sponsored investment products that invest primarily in debt securities. Management considered a hypothetical 100 basis point fluctuation in interest rates or credit spreads and estimates that the impact of such a fluctuation on these investments, in the aggregate, would result in a decrease, or increase, of approximately $38 million in the carrying value of such investments.\n\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk. As discussed above, the Company invests in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. The carrying value of the total economic investment exposure denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound and Euro, was $947 million at December 31, 2020. A 10% adverse change in the applicable foreign exchange rates would result in approximately a $95 million decline in the carrying value of such investments.\n\nOther Market Risks. The Company executes forward foreign currency exchange contracts to mitigate the risk of certain foreign exchange risk movements. At December 31, 2020, the Company had outstanding forward foreign currency exchange contracts with an aggregate notional value of approximately $2.8 billion.\n\n## Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplemental Data\n\nThe report of the independent registered public accounting firm and financial statements listed in the accompanying index are included in Item 15 of this report. See Index to the consolidated financial statements on page F-1 of this Form 10-K.\n\n## Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\n\nThere have been no disagreements on accounting and financial disclosure matters. BlackRock has not changed accountants in the two most recent fiscal years.\n\n## Item 9a. Controls and Procedures\n\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures. Under the direction of BlackRock's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, BlackRock evaluated the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on Form 10-K. Based on this evaluation, BlackRock's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that BlackRock's disclosure controls and procedures were effective.\n\nInternal Control over Financial Reporting. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ending December 31, 2020 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, there was no material impact to our internal control over financial reporting while most of our employees are working remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company is continually monitoring and assessing the COVID-19 situation to determine any potential impact on the design and operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\n\nBlackRock Annual Report 2020",

(the 'Company') is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the Company's board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and includes those policies and procedures that:\n\n- \u00b7 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;\n- \u00b7 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with the authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and\n- \u00b7 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2020, the Company's internal control over financial reporting is effective.\n\nThe Company's independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n\nFebruary 25, 2021\n\n92\n\n93\n\nBlackRock Annual Report 2020\n\n## REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\n\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of BlackRock, Inc.:\n\n## Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nWehave audited the internal control over financial reporting of BlackRock, Inc. and subsidiaries (the 'Company') as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\n\nWehave also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated statement of financial condition as of December 31, 2020 and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for the year then ended of the Company and our report dated February 25, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThe Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWeconducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche, LLP\n\nNew York, New York February 25, 2021\n\nBlackRock Annual Report 2020",

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOBand are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWeconducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n## Impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets - Refer to Notes 2 and 12 to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nThe Company's indefinite-lived intangible assets are comprised of management contracts and trade names/trademarks acquired in business acquisitions. The Company performs its impairment assessment of its indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually, as of July 31st. In evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of indefinitelived intangibles is less than carrying value, the Company performs certain quantitative assessments and assesses various significant qualitative factors. If an indefinite-lived intangible asset is determined to be more likely than not impaired, the fair value of the asset is then compared with its carrying value and any excess of the carrying value over the fair value would be recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs. The determination of fair value requires management to make estimates and assumptions related to projected assets under management ('AUM') growth rates, revenue basis points, operating margins, tax rates, and discount rates.\n\nGiven the significant judgments made by management to estimate the fair value of its indefinite-lived intangible assets, performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management's estimates and assumptions related to projected AUM growth rates, revenue basis points, operating margins, tax rates, and discount rates, required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists.\n\n## Howthe Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures related to the determination of fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets included the following, among others:\n\n- \u00b7 Wetested the design, implementation and operating effectiveness of controls over the Company's indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment analysis, including those related to management's determination of fair value for the\n\nBlackRock Annual Report 2020\n\nBlackRock Annual Report 2020",

management's projected AUM growth rates, revenue basis points, operating margins, and tax rates by comparing management's projections to:\n- -historical amounts,\n- -internal communications to management and the Board of Directors, and\n- -forecasted information included in analyst and industry reports for the Company and certain of its peer companies.\n- \u00b7 Weevaluated management's ability to accurately project AUM growth rates, operating margins, and tax rates by comparing actual results to management's historical forecasts.\n- \u00b7 With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the Company's valuation methodology and assumptions, including the selection of the discount rate by: (1) testing the source information underlying the determination of the discount rate and the mathematical accuracy of the evaluation and (2) developing a range of independent estimates and compared those to the discount rate selected by management.\n- \u00b7 Weevaluated the impact of changes in management's forecasts from July 31, 2020, the annual impairment assessment date, to December 31, 2020.\n\n## /s/ Deloitte & Touche,

(together, with its subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise indicates, 'BlackRock' or the 'Company') is a leading publicly traded investment management firm providing a broad range of investment and technology services to institutional and retail clients worldwide.\n\nBlackRock's diverse platform of alpha-seeking active, index and cash management investment strategies across asset classes enables the Company to tailor investment outcomes and asset allocation solutions for clients. Product offerings include single- and multi-asset portfolios investing in equities, fixed income, alternatives and money market instruments. Products are offered directly and through intermediaries in a variety of vehicles, including open-end and closed-end mutual funds, iShares \u00ae exchange-traded funds ('ETFs'), separate accounts, collective trust funds ('CTFs') and other pooled investment vehicles. BlackRock also offers technology services, including the investment and risk management technology platform, Aladdin \u00ae , Aladdin Wealth, eFront, Cachematrix and FutureAdvisor, as well as advisory services and solutions to a broad base of institutional and wealth management clients.\n\n## 2. Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Basis of Presentation\n\nThese consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ('GAAP') and include the accounts of the Company and its controlled subsidiaries. Noncontrolling interests ('NCI') on the consolidated statements of financial condition represents the portion of consolidated sponsored investment funds in which the Company does not have direct equity ownership. Accounts and transactions between consolidated entities have been eliminated.\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n\nCertain prior period presentations and disclosures, while not required to be recast, were reclassified to ensure comparability with current period classifications.\n\n## Accounting Pronouncements Adopted in 2020\n\nMeasurement of Credit Losses. In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update ('ASU') 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments ('ASU 2016-13'), which significantly changes the accounting and disclosures for credit losses for most financial assets. The new guidance requires an estimate of expected lifetime credit losses and eliminates the existing recognition thresholds under current guidance. The adoption of ASU 2016-13, which was\n\nBlackRock Annual Report 2020\n\neffective for the Company on January 1, 2020, did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\n\nCash and Cash Equivalents . Cash and cash equivalents primarily consists of cash, money market funds and shortterm, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less in which the Company is exposed to market and credit risk. Cash and cash equivalent balances that are legally restricted from use by the Company are recorded in other assets on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Cash balances maintained by consolidated VIEs and voting rights entities ('VREs') are not considered legally restricted and are included in cash and cash equivalents on the consolidated statements of financial condition.\n\n## Investments\n\nInvestments in Debt Securities. The Company classifies debt investments as held-to-maturity or trading based on the Company's intent and ability to hold the debt security to maturity or, its intent to sell the security.\n\nHeld-to-maturity securities are purchased with the positive intent and ability to be held to maturity and are recorded at amortized cost on the consolidated statements of financial condition.\n\nTrading securities are those investments that are purchased principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term. Trading securities are carried at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition with changes in fair value recorded in nonoperating income (expense) on the consolidated statements of income. Trading securities include certain investments in collateralized loan obligations ('CLOs') for which the fair value option is elected in order to reduce operational complexity of bifurcating embedded derivatives.\n\nInvestments in Equity Securities. Equity securities are generally carried at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition with changes in the fair value recorded through net income ('FVTNI') within nonoperating income (expense). For nonmarketable equity securities, the Company generally elects to apply the practicality exception to fair value measurement, under which such securities will be measured at cost, less impairment, plus or minus observable price changes for identical or similar securities of the same issuer with such changes recorded in the consolidated statements of income. Dividends received are recorded as dividend income within nonoperating income (expense).\n\nEquity Method. The Company applies the equity method of accounting for equity investments where the Company does not consolidate the investee, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee. The Company's share of the investee's underlying net income or loss is recorded as net gain (loss) on investments within nonoperating income (expense) and as other revenue for certain corporate minority investments since such investees are considered to be an extension of the Company's core business. The Company's share of net income of the investee is recorded based upon the most current information available at the time, which may precede the date of the consolidated statement of financial condition. Distributions received reduce the Company's carrying value of the investee and the cost basis if deemed to be a return of capital.\n\nImpairments of Investments. Management periodically assesses equity method and held-to-maturity investments for other-than-temporary impairment ('OTTI'). If an OTTI exists, an impairment charge would be recorded for the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value in the consolidated statements of income.\n\nFor equity method investments and held-to-maturity investments, if circumstances indicate that an OTTI may exist, the investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment.\n\nFor the Company's investments in CLOs, the Company reviews cash flow estimates over the life of each CLO investment. On a quarterly basis, if the present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and there is an adverse change in estimated cash flows, an impairment is considered to be other-than-temporary.\n\nIn addition, for nonmarketable equity securities that are accounted for under the measurement alternative to fair value, the Company applies the impairment model that does not require the Company to consider whether the impairment is other-than-temporary.\n\nConsolidation. The Company performs an analysis for investment products to determine if the product is a VIE or a VRE. Assessing whether an entity is a VIE or a VRE involves judgment and analysis. Factors considered in this assessment include the entity's legal organization, the entity's capital structure and equity ownership, and any related party or de facto agent implications of the Company's involvement with the entity. Investments that are determined to be VIEs are consolidated if the Company is the primary beneficiary ('PB') of the entity. VREs are typically consolidated if the Company holds the majority voting interest. Upon the occurrence of certain events (such as contributions and redemptions, either by the Company, or third parties, or amendments to the governing documents of the Company's investment products), management reviews and reconsiders its previous conclusion regarding the status of an entity as a VIE or a VRE. Additionally, management continually reconsiders whether the Company is deemed to be a VIE's PB that consolidates such entity.\n\nConsolidation of Variable Interest Entities . Certain investment products for which a controlling financial interest is achieved through arrangements that do not involve or are not directly linked to voting interests are deemed VIEs. BlackRock reviews factors, including whether or not i) the entity has equity at risk that is sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated support from other parties and ii) the equity holders at risk have the obligation to absorb losses, the right to receive residual returns, and the right to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance, to determine if the investment product is a VIE. BlackRock re-evaluates such factors as facts and circumstances change.\n\nThe PB of a VIE is defined as the variable interest holder that has a controlling financial interest in the VIE. A controlling financial interest is defined as (i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly\n\nimpact its economic performance and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that potentially could be significant to the VIE. The Company generally consolidates VIEs in which it holds an economic interest of 10% or greater and deconsolidates such VIEs once equity ownership falls below 10%.\n\nConsolidation of Voting Rights Entities . BlackRock is required to consolidate an investee to the extent that BlackRock can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is a greater than 50% voting equity interest.\n\nRetention of Specialized Investment Company Accounting Principles. Upon consolidation of sponsored investment funds, the Company retains the specialized investment company accounting principles of the underlying funds. All of the underlying investments held by such consolidated sponsored investment funds are carried at fair value with corresponding changes in the investments' fair values reflected in nonoperating income (expense) on the consolidated statements of income. When the Company no longer controls these funds due to reduced ownership percentage or other reasons, the funds are deconsolidated and accounted for as an equity method investment or equity securities FVTNI if the Company still maintains an investment.\n\nSeparate Account Assets and Liabilities . Separate account assets are maintained by BlackRock Life Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, which is a registered life insurance company in the United Kingdom, and represent segregated assets held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The life insurance company does not underwrite any insurance contracts that involve any insurance risk transfer from the insured to the life insurance company. The separate account assets primarily include equity securities, debt securities, money market funds and derivatives. The separate account assets are not subject to general claims of the creditors of BlackRock. These separate account assets and the related equal and offsetting liabilities are recorded as separate account assets and separate account liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition.\n\nThe net investment income attributable to separate account assets supporting individual and group pension contracts accrues directly to the contract owner and is not reported on the consolidated statements of income. While BlackRock has no economic interest in these separate account assets and liabilities, BlackRock earns policy administration and management fees associated with these products, which are included in investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue on the consolidated statements of income.\n\nSeparate Account Collateral Assets Held and Liabilities Under Securities Lending Agreements. The Company facilitates securities lending arrangements whereby securities held by separate accounts maintained by BlackRock Life Limited are lent to third parties under global master securities lending agreements. In exchange, the Company receives legal title to the collateral with minimum values generally ranging from approximately 102%to 112% of the value of the securities lent in order to reduce counterparty risk. The required collateral value is calculated on a daily basis. The global master securities\n\nBlackRock Annual Report 2020",

        "page_content": "110\n\n111\n\nlending agreements provide the Company the right to request additional collateral or, in the event of borrower default, the right to liquidate collateral. The securities lending transactions entered into by the Company are accompanied by an agreement that entitles the Company to request the borrower to return the securities at any time; therefore, these transactions are not reported as sales.\n\nThe Company records on the consolidated statements of financial condition the cash and noncash collateral received under these BlackRock Life Limited securities lending arrangements as its own asset in addition to an equal and offsetting collateral liability for the obligation to return the collateral. The securities lending revenue earned from lending securities held by the separate accounts is included in investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue on the consolidated statements of income. During 2020 and 2019, the Company had not resold or repledged any of the collateral received under these arrangements. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the fair value of loaned securities held by separate accounts was approximately $15.2 billion and $14.4 billion, respectively, and the fair value of the collateral held under these securities lending agreements was approximately $16.5 billion and $15.5 billion, respectively.\n\nProperty and Equipment . Property and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is generally determined by cost less any estimated residual value using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the various classes of property and equipment. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life or the remaining lease term.\n\nThe Company capitalizes certain costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining software within property and equipment. Capitalized software costs are amortized, beginning when the software product is ready for its intended use, over the estimated useful life of the software of approximately three years.\n\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets . Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. The Company has determined that it has one reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing purposes, the consolidated BlackRock single operating segment, which is consistent with internal management reporting and management's oversight of operations. In its assessment of goodwill for impairment, the Company considers such factors as the book value and market capitalization of the Company.\n\nOn a quarterly basis, the Company considers if triggering events have occurred that may indicate a potential goodwill impairment. If a triggering event has occurred, the Company performs assessments, which may include reviews of significant valuation assumptions, to determine if goodwill may be impaired. The Company performs an impairment assessment of its goodwill at least annually, as of July 31 st .\n\nIntangible assets are comprised of indefinite-lived intangible assets and finite-lived intangible assets acquired in a business acquisition. The value of contracts to manage assets in proprietary open-end funds and collective trust funds and certain other commingled\n\nBlackRock Annual Report 2020\n\nproducts without a specified termination date is generally classified as indefinite-lived intangible assets. The assignment of indefinite lives to such contracts primarily is based upon the following: (i) the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these products; (ii) the Company expects to, and has the ability to, continue to operate these products indefinitely; (iii) the products have multiple investors and are not reliant on a single investor or small group of investors for their continued operation; (iv) current competitive factors and economic conditions do not indicate a finite life; and (v) there is a high likelihood of continued renewal based on historical experience. In addition, trade names/ trademarks are considered indefinite-lived intangible assets when they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely.\n\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Finite-lived management contracts, which relate to acquired separate accounts and funds and investor/customer relationships, and technology-related assets that are expected to contribute to the future cash flows of the Company for a specified period of time, are amortized over their remaining useful lives.\n\nThe Company performs assessments to determine if any intangible assets are potentially impaired and whether the indefinite-lived and finite-lived classifications are still appropriate at least annually, as of July 31 st . The carrying value of finite-lived assets and their remaining useful lives are reviewed at least annually to determine if circumstances exist which may indicate a potential impairment or revisions to the amortization period.\n\nIn evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of indefinite-lived intangibles is less than its carrying value, BlackRock assesses various significant qualitative factors, including assets under management ('AUM'), revenue basis points, projected AUM growth rates, operating margins, tax rates and discount rates. In addition, the Company considers other factors, including (i) macroeconomic conditions such as a deterioration in general economic conditions, limitations on accessing capital, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, or other developments in equity and credit markets; (ii) industry and market considerations such as a deterioration in the environment in which the entity operates, an increased competitive environment, a decline in market-dependent multiples or metrics, a change in the market for an entity's services, or regulatory, legal or political developments; and (iii) entity-specific events, such as a change in management or key personnel, overall financial performance and litigation that could affect significant inputs used to determine the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset. If an indefinite-lived intangible is determined to be more likely than not impaired, then the fair value of the asset is compared with its carrying value and any excess of the carrying value over the fair value would be recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs.\n\nFor finite-lived intangible assets, if potential impairment circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform a recoverability test using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. Actual results could differ from these cash flow estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. If the carrying value of the asset is determined not to be recoverable based on the\n\nundiscounted cash flow test, the difference between the carrying value of the asset and its current fair value would be recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs.\n\nNoncontrolling Interests. The Company reports noncontrolling interests as equity, separate from the parent's equity, on the consolidated statements of financial condition. In addition, the Company's consolidated net income on the consolidated statements of income includes the income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest holders of the Company's consolidated sponsored investment products. Income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests is not adjusted for income taxes for consolidated sponsored investment products that are treated as pass-through entities for tax purposes.\n\n## Classification and Measurement of Redeemable\n\nSecurities. The Company includes redeemable noncontrolling interests related to certain consolidated sponsored investment products in temporary equity on the consolidated statements of financial condition.\n\nTreasury Stock . The Company records common stock purchased for treasury at cost. At the date of subsequent reissuance, the treasury stock account is reduced by the cost of such stock using the average cost method.\n\nRevenue Recognition. Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised services to customers in an amount to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those services. The Company enters into contracts that can include multiple services, which are accounted for separately if they are determined to be distinct. Consideration for the Company's services is generally in the form of variable consideration because the amount of fees is subject to market conditions that are outside of the Company's influence. The Company includes variable consideration in revenue when it is no longer probable of significant reversal, i.e. when the associated uncertainty is resolved. For some contracts with customers, the Company has discretion to involve a third party in providing services to the customer. Generally, the Company is deemed to be the principal in these arrangements because the Company controls the promised services before they are transferred to customers, and accordingly presents the revenue gross of related costs.\n\nInvestment Advisory, Administration Fees and Securities Lending Revenue. Investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed over time because the customer is receiving and consuming the benefits as they are provided by the Company. Fees are primarily based on agreed-upon percentages of AUM and recognized for services provided during the period, which are distinct from services provided in other periods. Such fees are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation, foreign exchange translation and net inflows or outflows. Investment advisory and administration fees for investment funds are shown net of fee waivers. In addition, the Company may contract with third parties to provide sub-advisory services on its behalf. The Company presents the investment advisory fees and associated costs to such third-party advisors on a gross basis where it is deemed to be the principal and on a net basis where it is deemed to be the agent. Management judgment involved in making these\n\nassessments is focused on ascertaining whether the Company is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promised service.\n\nThe Company earns revenue by lending securities on behalf of clients, primarily to highly rated banks and broker-dealers. Revenue is recognized over time as services are performed. Generally, the securities lending fees are shared between the Company and the funds or other third-party accounts managed by the Company from which the securities are borrowed.\n\nMoney Market Fee Waivers. The Company may voluntarily waive a portion of its management fees on certain money market funds to ensure that they maintain a targeted level of daily net investment income (the 'Yield Support waivers'). During 2020, these waivers resulted in a reduction of management fees of approximately $35 million, which was partially offset by a reduction of BlackRock's distribution and servicing costs paid to financial intermediaries. There were no Yield Support waivers in 2019 and 2018. The Company may increase or decrease the level of Yield Support waivers in future periods.\n\nInvestment Advisory Performance Fees / Carried Interest. The Company receives investment advisory performance fees, including incentive allocations (carried interest) from certain actively managed investment funds and certain separately managed accounts. These performance fees are dependent upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds, which may vary by product or account, and include monthly, quarterly, annual or longer measurement periods.\n\nPerformance fees, including carried interest, are recognized when it is determined that they are no longer probable of significant reversal (such as upon the sale of a fund's investment or when the amount of AUM becomes known as of the end of a specified measurement period). Given the unique nature of each fee arrangement, contracts with customers are evaluated on an individual basis to determine the timing of revenue recognition. Significant judgement is involved in making such determination. Performance fees typically arise from investment management services that began in prior reporting periods. Consequently, a portion of the fees the Company recognizes may be partially related to the services performed in prior periods that meet the recognition criteria in the current period. At each reporting date, the Company considers various factors in estimating performance fees to be recognized, including carried interest. These factors include but are not limited to whether: (1) the fees are dependent on the market and thus are highly susceptible to factors outside the Company's influence; (2) the fees have a large number and a broad range of possible amounts; and (3) the funds or separately managed accounts have the ability to invest or reinvest their sales proceeds.\n\nThe Company is allocated carried interest from certain alternative investment products upon exceeding performance thresholds. The Company may be required to reverse/return all, or part, of such carried interest allocations/distributions depending upon future performance of these funds. Carried interest subject to such clawback provisions is recorded in investments or cash and cash equivalents to the extent that it is distributed, on its consolidated statements of financial condition.\n\nBlackRock Annual Report 2020",

A portion of the deferred carried interest may also be paid to certain employees. The ultimate timing of the recognition of performance fee revenue and related compensation expense, if any, for these products is unknown.\n\nTechnology services revenue. The Company offers investment management technology systems, risk management services, wealth management and digital distribution tools, all on a fee basis. Clients include banks, insurance companies, official institutions, pension funds, asset managers, retail distributors and other investors. Fees earned for technology services are primarily recorded as services are performed over time and are generally determined using the value of positions on the Aladdin platform, or on a fixed-rate basis. Revenue derived from the sale of software licenses is recognized upon the granting of access rights.\n\nDistribution Fees. The Company earns distribution and service fees for distributing investment products and providing ongoing shareholder support services to investment portfolios. Distribution fees are passedthrough to third-party distributors, which perform various fund distribution services and shareholder servicing of certain funds on the Company's behalf, and are recognized as distribution and servicing costs. The Company presents distribution fees and related distribution and servicing costs incurred on a gross basis.\n\nDistribution fees primarily consist of ongoing distribution fees, shareholder servicing fees and upfront sales commissions for serving as the principal underwriter and/ or distributor for certain managed mutual funds. The service of distribution is satisfied at the point in time when an investor makes an investment in a share class of the managed mutual funds. Fees are generally considered variable consideration because they are based on the value of AUM and are uncertain on trade date. Accordingly, the Company recognizes distribution fees over the investment period as the amounts become known and the portion recognized in the current period may relate to distribution services performed in prior periods. Upfront sales commissions are recognized on a trade date basis. Shareholder servicing fees are based on AUM and recognized in revenue as the services are performed.\n\nAdvisory and other revenue. Advisory and other revenue primarily includes fees earned for advisory services, fees earned for transition management services primarily comprised of commissions recognized in connection with buying and selling securities on behalf of customers, and equity method investment earnings related to certain corporate minority investments.\n\nAdvisory services fees are determined using fixed-rate fees and are recognized over time as the related services are completed.\n\nCommissions related to transition management services are recorded on a trade-date basis as transactions occur.\n\nStock-based Compensation . The Company recognizes compensation cost for equity classified awards based on the grant-date fair value of the award. The compensation cost is recognized over the period during which an\n\nBlackRock Annual Report 2020\n\nemployee is required to provide service (usually the vesting period) in exchange for the stock-based award.\n\nThe Company measures the grant-date fair value of restricted stock units ('RSUs') using the Company's stock price on the date of grant. For employee stock options and instruments with market conditions, the Company uses pricing models. Stock option awards may have performance, market and/or service conditions. If a stockbased award is modified after the grant-date, incremental compensation cost is recognized for an amount equal to the excess of the fair value of the modified award over the fair value of the original award immediately before the modification. Awards under the Company's stock-based compensation plans vest over various periods. Compensation cost is recorded by the Company on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separate vesting portion of the award as if the award is, in-substance, multiple awards and is adjusted for actual forfeitures as they occur.\n\nThe Company amortizes the grant-date fair value of stockbased compensation awards made to retirement-eligible employees over the requisite service period. Upon notification of retirement, the Company accelerates the unamortized portion of the award over the contractually required retirement notification period.\n\nThe Company recognizes all excess tax benefits and deficiencies in income tax expense on the consolidated statements of income, which results in volatility of income tax expense as a result of fluctuations in the Company's stock price. Accordingly, the Company recorded a discrete income tax benefit of $36 million, $23 million and $64 million during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, for vested RSUs where the grant date stock price was lower than the vesting date stock price.\n\nDistribution and Servicing Costs . Distribution and servicing costs include payments to third parties, primarily associated with distribution and servicing of client investments in certain BlackRock products. Distribution and servicing costs are expensed when incurred.\n\nDirect Fund Expense . Direct fund expense, which is expensed as incurred, primarily consists of third-party nonadvisory expense incurred by BlackRock related to certain funds for the use of certain index trademarks, reference data for certain indices, custodial services, fund administration, fund accounting, transfer agent services, shareholder reporting services, audit and tax services as well as other fund-related expense directly attributable to the nonadvisory operations of the fund.\n\nLeases . The Company determines if a contract is a lease or contains a lease at inception. The Company accounts for its office facility leases as operating leases, which may include escalation clauses that are based on an index or market rate. The Company accounts for lease and non-lease components, including common areas maintenance charges, as a single component for its leases. The Company elected the short-term lease exception for leases with an initial term of 12 months or less. Consequently, such leases are not recorded on the consolidated statements of financial condition. The Company's lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain they will be exercised or not, respectively.\n\nFixed lease payments are included in right-of-use ('ROU') assets and lease liabilities within other assets and other liabilities, respectively, on the consolidated statements of financial condition. The Company recognizes ROU assets and lease liabilities based on the present value of these future lease payments over the lease term at the commencement date discounted using the Company's incremental borrowing rate ('IBR'). The Company determines its IBR, by assessing the Company's credit rating using various financial metrics, such as revenue, operating margin and revenue growth, and, as appropriate, performing market analysis of yields on publicly traded bonds (secured or unsecured) with similar terms of comparable companies in a similar economic environment. Fixed lease payments made over the lease term are recorded as lease expense on a straight-line basis. Variable lease payments based on usage, changes in an index or market rate are expensed as incurred.\n\nUpon adoption of ASU 2016-02, Leases and several amendments (collectively, 'ASU 2016-02'), for existing leases, the Company elected to determine the discount rate based on the remaining lease term as of January 1, 2019 and for lease payments based on an index or rate to apply the rate at commencement date. For new leases, the discount rates are based on the entire noncancelable lease term.\n\nForeign Exchange . Foreign currency transactions are recorded at the exchange rates prevailing on the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are subsequently remeasured into the functional currencies of the Company's subsidiaries at the rates prevailing at each balance sheet date. Gains and losses arising on remeasurement are included in general and administration expense on the consolidated statements of income. Revenue and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the period. Gains or losses resulting from translating foreign currency financial statements into US dollars are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) ('AOCI'), a separate component of stockholders' equity, on the consolidated statements of financial condition.\n\nIncome Taxes . Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred income tax assets and liabilities is recognized on the consolidated statements of income in the period that includes the enactment date.\n\nManagement periodically assesses the recoverability of its deferred income tax assets based upon expected future earnings, taxable income in prior carryback years, future deductibility of the asset, changes in applicable tax laws and other factors. If management determines that it is not more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be fully recoverable in the future, a valuation allowance will be established for the difference between the asset balance and the amount expected to be recoverable in the future. This allowance will result in additional income tax expense. Further, the Company records its income taxes receivable and payable based upon its estimated income tax position.\n\nExcess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation are recognized as an income tax benefit on the consolidated statements of income and are reflected as operating cash flows on the consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\nEarnings per Share ('EPS') . Basic EPS is calculated by dividing net income applicable to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS includes the determinants of basic EPS and common stock equivalents outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is computed using the treasury stock method.\n\nDue to the similarities in terms between BlackRock's nonvoting participating preferred stock and the Company's common stock, the Company considered its nonvoting participating preferred stock to be a common stock equivalent for purposes of EPS calculations. As such, the Company has included the outstanding nonvoting participating preferred stock in the calculation of average basic and diluted shares outstanding. As of December 31, 2020, there were no shares of preferred stock outstanding.\n\nBusiness Segments . The Company's management directs BlackRock's operations as one business, the asset management business. The Company utilizes a consolidated approach to assess performance and allocate resources. As such, the Company operates in one business segment.\n\n## Fair Value Measurements\n\nHierarchy of Fair Value Inputs. The Company uses a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation approaches used to measure fair value. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories:\n\n## Level 1 Inputs:\n\nQuoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the reporting date.\n\n- \u00b7 Level 1 assets may include listed mutual funds, ETFs, listed equities and certain exchange-traded derivatives.\n\n## Level 2 Inputs:\n\nQuoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities that are not active; quotes from pricing services or brokers for which the Company can determine that orderly transactions took place at the quoted price or that the inputs used to arrive at the price are observable; and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, such as models or other valuation methodologies.\n\n- \u00b7 Level 2 assets may include debt securities, investments in CLOs, bank loans, short-term floatingrate notes, asset-backed securities, securities held within consolidated hedge funds, restricted public securities valued at a discount, as well as over-the-counter derivatives, including interest and\n\nBlackRock Annual Report 2020",

Level 3 assets include investments for which there is little, if any, market activity. These inputs require significant management judgment or estimation.\n\n- \u00b7 Level 3 assets may include direct private equity investments held within consolidated funds, investments in CLOs and bank loans held within consolidated CLOs.\n- \u00b7 Level 3 liabilities may include contingent liabilities related to borrowings of consolidated CLOs and acquisitions valued based upon discounted cash flow analyses using unobservable market data.\n\nSignificance of Inputs. The Company's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument.\n\nValuation Approaches. The fair values of certain Level 3 assets and liabilities were determined using various valuation approaches as appropriate, including third-party pricing vendors, broker quotes and market and income approaches.\n\nA significant number of inputs used to value equity, debt securities, investments in CLOs and bank loans is sourced from third-party pricing vendors. Generally, prices obtained from pricing vendors are categorized as Level 1 inputs for identical securities traded in active markets and as Level 2 for other similar securities if the vendor uses observable inputs in determining the price.\n\nIn addition, quotes obtained from brokers generally are nonbinding and categorized as Level 3 inputs. However, if the Company is able to determine that market participants have transacted for the asset in an orderly manner near the quoted price or if the Company can determine that the inputs used by the broker are observable, the quote is classified as a Level 2 input.\n\nInvestments Measured at Net Asset Value. As a practical expedient, the Company uses net asset value ('NAV') as the fair value for certain investments. The inputs to value these investments may include the Company's capital accounts for its partnership interests in various alternative investments, including hedge funds, real assets and private equity funds, which may be adjusted by using the returns of certain market indices. The various partnerships generally are investment companies, which record their underlying investments at fair value based on fair value policies established by management of the underlying fund. Fair value policies at the underlying fund generally require the fund to utilize pricing/valuation information from third-party sources, including independent appraisals. However, in some instances, current valuation information for illiquid securities or securities in markets that are not active may not be available from any thirdparty source or fund management may conclude that the valuations that are available from third-party sources are not reliable. In these instances, fund management may\n\nBlackRock Annual Report 2020\n\nperform model-based analytical valuations that could be used as an input to value these investments.\n\nFair Value Assets and Liabilities of Consolidated CLO. The Company applies the fair value option provisions for eligible assets, including bank loans, held by a consolidated CLO. As the fair value of the financial assets of the consolidated CLO is more observable than the fair value of the borrowings of the consolidated CLO, the Company measures the fair value of the borrowings of the consolidated CLO equal to the fair value of the assets of the consolidated CLO less the fair value of the Company's economic interest in the CLO.\n\nDerivatives and Hedging Activities . The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The Company uses derivative financial instruments primarily for purposes of hedging exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates of certain assets and liabilities, and market exposures for certain seed investments. However, certain consolidated sponsored investment funds may also utilize derivatives as a part of their investment strategy.\n\nThe Company records all derivative financial instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value on a gross basis in the consolidated statements of financial condition. Credit risks are managed through master netting and collateral support agreements. The amounts related to the right to reclaim or the obligation to return cash collateral may not be used to offset amounts due under the derivative instruments in the normal course of settlement. Therefore, such amounts are not offset against fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments with the same counterparty and are included in other assets and other liabilities. Changes in the fair value of the Company's derivative financial instruments are recognized in earnings and, where applicable, are offset by the corresponding gain or loss on the related foreigndenominated assets or liabilities or hedged investments, on the consolidated statements of income.\n\nThe Company may also use financial instruments designated as net investment hedges for accounting purposes to hedge net investments in international subsidiaries whose functional currency is not US dollars. The gain or loss from revaluing net investment hedges at the spot rate is deferred and reported within AOCI on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Amounts excluded from the effectiveness assessment are reported in the consolidated statements of income using a systematic and rational method. The Company reassesses the effectiveness of its net investment hedge at least quarterly.\n\n## 3. Acquisition\n\nOn May 10, 2019, the Company acquired 100% of the equity interests of eFront Holding SAS ('eFront Transaction' or 'eFront'), a leading alternative investment management software and solutions provider for approximately $1.3 billion, excluding the settlement of eFront's outstanding debt. The acquisition of eFront expanded Aladdin 's illiquid alternative capabilities and enables BlackRock to provide individual alternative or whole-portfolio technology solutions to clients.\n\nThe purchase price was funded through a combination of existing cash and issuance of commercial paper (subsequently repaid with existing cash) and long-term\n\nnotes in April 2019. See Note 15, Borrowings , for information on the debt issuance in April 2019. A summary of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in this acquisition is as follows:\n\n| (in millions)                                                                    | Fair Value   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|\n| Accounts receivable                                                              | $ 61         |\n| Finite-lived intangible assets:                                                  |              |\n| Customer relationships                                                           | 400          |\n| Technology-related                                                               | 203          |\n| Trade name                                                                       | 14           |\n| Goodwill                                                                         | 1,044        |\n| Other assets                                                                     | 49           |\n| Deferred income tax liabilities                                                  | (146)        |\n| Other liabilities assumed                                                        | (125)        |\n| Total consideration, net of cash acquired                                        | $ 1,500      |\n| Summary of consideration, net of cash acquired:                                  |              |\n| Cash paid including settlement of outstanding debt of approximately $0.2 billion | $ 1,555      |\n| Cash acquired                                                                    | (55)         |\n| Total consideration, net of cash acquired                                        | $ 1,500      |\n\n## 4.

Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products\n\nThe Company consolidates certain sponsored investment funds accounted for as VREs because it is deemed to control such funds.\n\nIn the normal course of business, the Company is the manager of various types of sponsored investment vehicles, which may be considered VIEs. The Company may from time to time own equity or debt securities or enter into derivatives with the vehicles, each of which are considered variable interests. The Company's involvement in financing the operations of the VIEs is generally limited\n\nto its investments in the entity. The Company's consolidated VIEs include certain sponsored investment products in which BlackRock has an investment and as the investment manager, is deemed to have both the power to direct the most significant activities of the products and the right to receive benefits (or the obligation to absorb losses) that could potentially be significant to these sponsored investment products. The assets of these VIEs are not available to creditors of the Company. In addition, the investors in these VIEs have no recourse to the credit of the Company.\n\nThe following table presents the balances related to these consolidated sponsored investment products accounted for as VIEs and VREs that were recorded on the consolidated statements of financial condition, including BlackRock's net interest in these products:\n\n|                                                              | December 31, 2020   | December 31, 2020   | December 31, 2020   | December 31, 2019   | December 31, 2019   | December 31, 2019   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| (in millions)                                                | VIEs                | VREs                | Total               | VIEs                | VREs                | Total               |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                                    | $ 155               | $ 51                | $ 206               | $ 131               | $ 10                | $ 141               |\n| Investments:                                                 |                     |                     |                     |                     |                     |                     |\n| Trading debt securities                                      | 1,618               | 310                 | 1,928               | 1,059               | 151                 | $ 1,210             |\n| Equity securities at FVTNI                                   | 1,592               | 413                 | 2,005               | 1,330               | 332                 | 1,662               |\n| Bank loans                                                   | 248                 | -                   | 248                 | 204                 | -                   | 204                 |\n| Other investments                                            | 191                 | -                   | 191                 | 194                 | -                   | 194                 |\n| Carried interest                                             | 604                 | -                   | 604                 | 514                 | -                   | 514                 |\n| Total investments                                            | 4,253               | 723                 | 4,976               | 3,301               | 483                 | 3,784               |\n| Other assets                                                 | 90                  | 9                   | 99                  | 68                  | 5                   | 73                  |\n| Other liabilities (1)                                        | (952)               | (70)                | (1,022)             | (820)               | (20)                | (840)               |\n| Noncontrolling interests                                     | (2,193)             | (180)               | (2,373)             | (1,348)             | (34)                | (1,382)             |\n| BlackRock's net interest in consolidated investment products | $ 1,353             | $ 533               | $ 1,886             | $ 1,332             | $ 444               | $ 1,776             |\n\nBlackRock's total exposure to consolidated sponsored investment products represents the value of its economic ownership interest in these sponsored investment products.

Realized and unrealized gains (losses) recorded for Level 3 assets and liabilities are reported in nonoperating income (expense) on the consolidated statements of income. A portion of net income (loss) for consolidated sponsored investment funds are allocated to noncontrolling interests to reflect net income (loss) not attributable to the Company.\n\nTransfers in and/or out of Levels. Transfers in and/or out of levels are reflected when significant inputs, including market inputs or performance attributes, used for the fair value measurement become observable/unobservable, or when the carrying value of certain equity method investments no longer represents fair value as determined under valuation methodologies.\n\nBlackRock Annual Report 2020",

The term of the lease includes 20 years of cash rental payments expected to begin in May 2023, with the option to renew for a specified term. The lease requires annual base rental payments of approximately $51 million per year during the first five years of the lease term, increasing every five years to $58 million, $66 million and $74 million per year (or approximately $1.2 billion in base rent over a 20-year period). In November 2019, the Company exercised its initial expansion option with respect to two additional floors aggregating approximately 122,000 square feet of office space. The additional space requires approximately $185 million in base rent over the 20-year period.\n\n## 14. Other Assets\n\n## PennyMac\n\nOn February 13, 2020, BlackRock announced the establishment of The BlackRock Foundation (the 'Foundation') and the contribution of its remaining 20% stake in PennyMac Financial Services, Inc. ('PennyMac') to the Foundation and the BlackRock Charitable Fund,\n\nBlackRock Annual Report 2020\n\nwhich BlackRock established in 2013 (together, the 'Charitable Contribution'). The Charitable Contribution resulted in an operating expense of $589 million, which was offset by a $122 million noncash, nonoperating pre-tax gain on the contributed shares and a tax benefit of $241 million in the consolidated statement of income for 2020.\n\nThe Company accounted for its interest in PennyMac as an equity method investment. At December 31, 2019, the Company's investment in PennyMac was included in other assets on the consolidated statements of financial condition. The carrying value and market value of the Company's interest (approximately 20% or 16 million shares) was approximately $451 million and $530 million, respectively, at December 31, 2019. The market value of the Company's interest reflected the PennyMac stock price at December 31, 2019 (a Level 1 input). As a result of the Charitable Contribution, the Company no longer recorded an investment in PennyMac at December 31, 2020.\n\n## iCapital\n\nOn March 10, 2020, in connection with a recapitalization of iCapital Network, Inc. ('iCapital'), BlackRock received additional stock in exchange for certain securities it held, which resulted in a nonoperating pre-tax gain of approximately $240 million in the consolidated statement of income for 2020. Following this transaction, the Company accounts for its interest in iCapital as an equity method investment, which is included in other assets on the consolidated statements of financial condition. At December 31, 2020, the carrying value of the Company's interest in iCapital was approximately $296 million.\n\n## 15. Borrowings\n\n## Short-Term Borrowings\n\n2020 Revolving Credit Facility. The Company's credit facility has an aggregate commitment amount of $4 billion and was amended in March 2020 to extend the maturity date to March 2025 (the '2020 credit facility'). The 2020 credit facility permits the Company to request up to an additional $1 billion of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, increasing the overall size of the 2020 credit facility to an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $5 billion. Interest on borrowings outstanding accrues at a rate based on the applicable London Interbank Offered Rate plus a spread. The 2020 credit facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to earnings\n\nbefore interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, where net debt equals total debt less unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied with a ratio of less than 1 to 1 at December 31, 2020. The 2020 credit facility provides back-up liquidity to fund ongoing working capital for general corporate purposes and various investment opportunities. At December 31, 2020, the Company had no amount outstanding under the 2020 credit facility.\n\nCommercial Paper Program.

At December 31, 2020, the Company had $789 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment products, including consolidated sponsored investment products. These products include private equity funds, real assets funds and opportunistic funds. This amount excludes additional commitments made by consolidated funds of funds to underlying third-party funds as third-party noncontrolling interest holders have the legal obligation to fund the respective commitments of such funds of funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown and the commitments are callable on demand at any time prior to the expiration of the commitment. These unfunded commitments are not recorded on the consolidated statements of financial condition. These commitments do not include potential future commitments approved by the Company that are not yet legally binding. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to fund additional investment products for, and with, its clients.\n\n## Contingencies\n\nContingent Payments Related to Business Acquisitions . In connection with certain acquisitions, BlackRock is required to make contingent payments, subject to achieving specified performance targets, which may include revenue related to acquired contracts or new capital commitments for certain products. The fair value of the remaining aggregate contingent payments at December 31, 2020 totaled $26 million and is included in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition.\n\nOther Contingent Payments. The Company acts as the portfolio manager in a series of derivative transactions and has a maximum potential exposure of $17 million between the Company and counterparty. See Note 9, Derivatives and Hedging , for further discussion.\n\nLegal Proceedings. From time to time, BlackRock receives subpoenas or other requests for information from various US federal and state governmental and regulatory authorities and international governmental and regulatory\n\nauthorities in connection with industry-wide or other investigations or proceedings. It is BlackRock's policy to cooperate fully with such matters. The Company, certain of its subsidiaries and employees have been named as defendants in various legal actions, including arbitrations and other litigation arising in connection with BlackRock's activities. Additionally, BlackRock-advised investment portfolios may be subject to lawsuits, any of which potentially could harm the investment returns of the applicable portfolio or result in the Company being liable to the portfolios for any resulting damages.\n\nOn April 5, 2017, BlackRock, Inc., BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. ('BTC'), the BlackRock, Inc. Retirement Committee and various sub-committees, and a BlackRock employee were named as defendants in a purported class action lawsuit brought in the US District Court for the Northern District of California by a former employee on behalf of all participants and beneficiaries in the BlackRock employee 401(k) Plan (the 'Plan') from April 5, 2011 to the present. The lawsuit generally alleges that the defendants breached their duties towards Plan participants in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 by, among other things, offering investment options that were overly expensive, underperformed unaffiliated peer funds, focused disproportionately on active versus passive strategies, and were unduly concentrated in investment options managed by BlackRock. On October 18, 2017, the plaintiffs filed an Amended Complaint, which, among other things, added as defendants certain current and former members of the BlackRock Retirement and Investment Committees. The Amended Complaint also included a new purported class claim on behalf of investors in certain CTFs managed by BTC. Specifically, the plaintiffs allege that BTC, as fiduciary to the CTFs, engaged in self-dealing by, most significantly, selecting itself as the securities lending agent on terms that the plaintiffs claim were excessive. The Amended Complaint also alleged that BlackRock took undue risks in its management of securities lending cash reinvestment vehicles during the financial crisis. On August 23, 2018, the court granted permission to the plaintiffs to file a Second Amended Complaint ('SAC') which added as defendants the BlackRock, Inc. Management Development and Compensation Committee, the Plan's independent investment consultant and the Plan's Administrative Committee and its members. On October 22, 2018, BlackRock filed a motion to dismiss the SAC, and on June 3, 2019, the plaintiffs filed a motion seeking to certify both the Plan and the CTF classes. On September 3, 2019, the court granted BlackRock's motion to dismiss part of the plaintiffs' claim seeking to recover alleged losses in the securities lending vehicles but denied the motion to dismiss in all other respects. On February 11, 2020, the court denied the\n\nplaintiffs' motion to certify the CTF class and granted their motion to certify the Plan class. On April 27, 2020, the Ninth Circuit denied the plaintiffs' request to immediately appeal the class certification ruling. On September 24, 2020, the parties cross-moved for summary judgment, both of which were denied on January 12, 2021. On February 5, 2021, the parties reached a settlement in principle that will resolve the lawsuit, and are negotiating final terms for presentation to the court, which must approve the settlement for it to be effective.\n\nManagement, after consultation with legal counsel, currently does not anticipate that the aggregate liability arising out of regulatory matters or lawsuits will have a material effect on BlackRock's results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. However, there is no assurance as to whether any such pending or threatened matters will have a material effect on BlackRock's results of operations, financial position or cash flows in any future reporting period. Due to uncertainties surrounding the outcome of these matters, management cannot reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss that may arise from these matters.\n\nIndemnifications. In the ordinary course of business or in connection with certain acquisition agreements, BlackRock enters into contracts pursuant to which it may agree to indemnify third parties in certain circumstances. The terms of these indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined or the likelihood of any liability is considered remote. Consequently, no liability has been recorded on the consolidated statements of financial condition.\n\nIn connection with securities lending transactions, BlackRock has agreed to indemnify certain securities lending clients against potential loss resulting from a borrower's failure to fulfill its obligations under the securities lending agreement should the value of the collateral pledged by the borrower at the time of default be insufficient to cover the borrower's obligation under the securities lending agreement. The amount of securities on loan as of December 31, 2020 and subject to this type of indemnification was $270 billion. In the Company's capacity as lending agent, cash and securities totaling $289 billion was held as collateral for indemnified securities on loan at December 31, 2020. The fair value of these indemnifications was not material at December 31, 2020.\n\nBlackRock Annual Report 2020",

Pursuant to the BlackRock, Inc. Second Amended and Restated 1999 Stock Award and Incentive Plan (the 'Award Plan'), options to purchase shares of the Company's common stock at an exercise price not less than the market value of BlackRock's common stock on the date of grant in the form of stock options, restricted stock or RSUs may be granted to employees and nonemployee directors. A maximum of 41,500,000 shares of common stock were authorized for issuance under the Award Plan. Of this amount, 6,068,624 shares remain available for future awards at December 31, 2020. Upon exercise of employee stock options, the issuance of restricted stock or the vesting of RSUs, the Company issues shares out of treasury to the extent available.\n\nBlackRock Annual Report 2020\n\nRestricted Stock and RSUs. Pursuant to the Award Plan, restricted stock grants and RSUs may be granted to certain employees. Substantially all restricted stock and RSUs vest over periods ranging from one to three years and are expensed using the straight-line method over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award as if the award was, in-substance, multiple awards. Restricted stock and RSUs are not considered participating securities for purposes of calculating EPS as the dividend equivalents are subject to forfeiture prior to vesting of the award.\n\nRestricted stock and RSU activity for 2020 is summarized below.\n\n| Outstanding at    | Restricted Stock and RSUs   | Weighted- Average Grant Date Fair Value   |\n|-------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| December 31, 2019 | 2,236,452                   | $444.02                                   |\n| Granted           | 969,095                     | $533.31                                   |\n| Converted         | (981,385)                   | $429.48                                   |\n| Forfeited         | (84,232)                    | $477.29                                   |\n| December 31, 2020 | 2,139,930                   | $489.81                                   |\n\nThe Company values restricted stock and RSUs at their grant-date fair value as measured by BlackRock's commonstock price.

The unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over the remaining weightedaverage period of 1.1 years.\n\nIn January 2021, the Company granted under the Award Plan:\n\n- \u00b7 470,253 RSUs or shares of restricted stock to employees as part of annual incentive compensation that vest ratably over three years from the date of grant; and\n- \u00b7 247,621 RSUs or shares of restricted stock to employees that cliff vest 100% on January 31, 2024.\n- \u00b7 55,994 RSUs or shares of restricted stock to employees with various vesting schedules.\n\nPerformance-Based RSUs. Pursuant to the Award Plan, performance-based RSUs may be granted to certain employees. Each performance-based award consists of a 'base' number of RSUs granted to the employee. The number of shares that an employee ultimately receives at vesting will be equal to the base number of performancebased RSUs granted, multiplied by a predetermined percentage determined in accordance with the level of attainment of Company performance measures during the performance period and could be higher or lower than the original RSU grant. Performance-based RSUs are not considered participating securities as the dividend equivalents are subject to forfeiture prior to vesting of the award.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company granted 238,478, 283,014, and 199,068, respectively, performance-based RSUs to certain employees that cliff vest 100% on January 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 respectively. These awards are amortized over a service period of three years. The number of shares distributed at vesting could be higher or lower than the original grant based on the level of attainment of predetermined Company performance measures. In January 2020, the Company granted 30,600 additional RSUs to certain employees based on the attainment of Company performance measures during the performance period.\n\nPerformance-based RSU activity for 2020 is summarized below.\n\n| Outstanding at                                                      | Performance- Based RSUs   | Weighted- Average Grant Date Fair Value   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| December 31, 2019                                                   | 742,918                   | $436.84                                   |\n| Granted                                                             | 238,478                   | $533.58                                   |\n| Additional shares granted due to attainment of performance measures | 30,600                    | $375.26                                   |\n| Converted                                                           | (311,779)                 | $375.26                                   |\n| December 31, 2020                                                   | 700,217                   | $494.51                                   |\n\nThe Company initially values performance-based RSUs at their grant-date fair value as measured by BlackRock's commonstock price. The total grant-date fair market value of performance-based RSUs granted to employees during 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $139 million, $117 million and $121 million, respectively.\n\nAt December 31, 2020, the intrinsic value of outstanding performance-based RSUs was $505 million reflecting a closing stock price of $721.54.\n\nAt December 31, 2020, total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to unvested performancebased awards was $132 million. The unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted-average period of 1.2 years.\n\nIn January 2021, the Company granted 162,029 performance-based RSUs to certain employees that cliff vest 100% on January 31, 2024. These awards are amortized over a service period of three years. The number of shares distributed at vesting could be higher or lower than the original grant based on the level of attainment of predetermined Company performance measures.\n\nPerformance-based Stock Options. Pursuant to the Award Plan, performance-based stock options may be granted to certain employees. Vesting of the performance-based stock options is contingent upon the achievement of obtaining 125% of BlackRock's grant-date stock price within five years from the grant date and the attainment of Company performance measures during the four-year performance period. If both hurdles are achieved, the award will vest in three equal installments at the end of years five, six and seven. Vested options can then be exercised up to nine years following the grant date. At December 31, 2020, the weighted average remaining life of the awards is approximately 5.9 years. The awards are generally forfeited if the employee leaves the Company before the respective vesting date. The expense for each tranche is amortized over the respective requisite service period. The Company assumes the performance condition will be achieved. If such condition is not met, no compensation cost is recognized and any recognized compensation cost is reversed. Stock option activity for 2020 is summarized below.\n\n| Outstanding at    | Shares Under Option   | Weighted Average Exercise Price   |\n|-------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| December 31, 2019 | 1,941,145             | $513.50                           |\n| Forfeited         | (25,353)              | $513.50                           |\n| December 31, 2020 | 1,915,792             | $513.50                           |\n\nThe options have a strike price of $513.50, which was the closing price of the shares on the grant date. The grantdate fair value of the awards issued in 2017 was $208 million and was estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation with an embedded lattice model using the assumptions included in the following table:\n\n|   Grant Year |   Expected Term (Years) | Expected Stock Volatility   | Expected Dividend Yield   | Risk-Free Interest Rate   |\n|--------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n|         2017 |                    6.56 | 22.23%                      | 2.16%                     | 2.33%                     |\n\nThe expected term was derived using a Monte Carlo simulation with the embedded lattice model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The expected stock volatility was based upon an average of historical stock price fluctuations of BlackRock's common stock and an implied volatility at the grant date. The dividend yield was calculated as the most recent quarterly dividend divided by the average three-month stock price as of the grant\n\nBlackRock Annual Report 2020",

The risk-free interest rate is based on the US Treasury Constant Maturities yield curve at date of grant.\n\nAt December 31, 2020, total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to unvested performancebased stock options was $82 million. The unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted-average period of 2.9 years.\n\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan ('ESPP'). The ESPP allows eligible employees to purchase the Company's commonstock at 95% of the fair market value on the last day of each three-month offering period. The Company does not record compensation expense related to employees purchasing shares under the ESPP.\n\n## 19. Employee Benefit Plans\n\n## Deferred Compensation Plans\n\nVoluntary Deferred Compensation Plan. The Company adopted a Voluntary Deferred Compensation Plan ('VDCP') that allows eligible employees in the United States to elect to defer between 1% and 100% of their annual cash incentive compensation. The participants must specify a deferral period of up to 10 years from the year of deferral and additionally, elect to receive distributions in the form of a lump sum or in up to 10 annual installments. The Company may fund the obligation through the rabbi trust on behalf of the plan's participants.\n\nThe rabbi trust established for the VDCP, with assets totaling $6 million and $23 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, is reflected in investments on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Such investments are classified as trading investments. The liability balance of $82 million and $80 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, is reflected on the consolidated statements of financial condition as accrued compensation and benefits. Earnings in the rabbi trust, including unrealized appreciation or depreciation, are reflected as nonoperating income (expense) and changes in the liability are reflected as employee compensation and benefits expense on the consolidated statements of income.\n\nLeadership Retention Carry Plan. In 2019, the Company adopted a carried interest retention incentive program referred to as the BlackRock Leadership Retention Carry Plan, pursuant to which senior-level employees (but not including the Chief Executive Officer), as may be determined by the Company from time to time, will be eligible to receive a portion of the cash payments, based on their percentage points, in the total carried interest distributions payable to the Company from participating carry funds. Cash payments, if any, with respect to these percentage points will be made following the recipient's termination of employment due to qualified retirement, death or disability, subject to his or her execution of a release of claims and continued compliance with his or her restrictive covenant obligations following termination. There was no impact to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nOther Deferred Compensation Plans. The Company has additional compensation plans for the purpose of providing deferred compensation and retention incentives to certain employees. For these plans, the final value of the deferred amount to be distributed in cash upon vesting is\n\nBlackRock Annual Report 2020\n\nassociated with investment returns of certain investment funds. The liabilities for these plans were $339 million and $311 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and are reflected in the consolidated statements of financial condition as accrued compensation and benefits. In January 2021, the Company granted approximately $321 million of additional deferred compensation that will fluctuate with investment returns and will vest ratably over three years from the date of grant.\n\n## Defined Contribution Plans\n\nThe Company has several defined contribution plans primarily in the United States and United Kingdom.\n\nCertain of the Company's US employees participate in a defined contribution plan. Employee contributions of up to 8%ofeligible compensation, as defined by the plan and subject to Internal Revenue Code limitations, are matched by the Company at 50% up to a maximum of $5,000 annually. In addition, the Company makes an annual retirement contribution to eligible participants equal to 3-5% of eligible compensation. The Company's contribution expense related to this plan was $93 million in 2020, $66 million in 2019, and $63 million in 2018.\n\nCertain United Kingdom ('UK') wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company contribute to defined contribution plans for their employees. The contributions range between 6% and 15% of each employee's eligible compensation. The Company's contribution expense related to these plans was $45 million in 2020, $41 million in 2019, and $35 million in 2018.\n\nIn addition, the contribution expense related to defined contribution plans in other regions was $34 million in 2020, $29 million in 2019 and $22 million in 2018.\n\nDefined Benefit Plans. The Company has several defined benefit pension plans with plan assets of approximately $36 million and $28 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The underfunded obligations at December 31, 2020 and 2019 were not material. Benefit payments for the next five years and in aggregate for the five years thereafter are not expected to be material.\n\n## 20. Related Party Transactions\n\n## Determination of Related Parties\n\nPNC . The Company considered PNC, along with its affiliates, to be a related party based on its level of capital stock ownership prior to the secondary offering in May 2020 by PNC of shares of the Company's stock. See Note 23, Capital Stock , for more information on PNC secondary offering. At December 31, 2020, PNC did not own any of the Company's capital stock and is no longer considered a related party.\n\nRegistered Investment Companies and Equity Method Investments. The Company considers the registered investment companies that it manages, which include mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, to be related parties as a result of the Company's advisory relationship. In addition, equity method investments are considered related parties, due to the Company's influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee.\n\n## Revenue from Related Parties\n\nRevenue for services provided by the Company to these and other related parties are as follows:\n\n| (in millions)                                                               | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue (1) | $9,079 | $8,323 | $8,226 |\n| Investment advisory performance fees (1)                                    | 301    | 131    | 112    |\n| Technology services revenue (2)                                             | 4      | 9      | 9      |\n| Advisory and other revenue (3)                                              | 19     | 59     | 65     |\n| Total revenue from related parties                                          | $9,403 | $8,522 | $8,412 |\n\nThe Company provides investment advisory and administration services to its open- and closed-end funds and other commingled or pooled funds and separate accounts in which related parties invest.\n\nReceivables and Payables with Related Parties. Due from related parties, which is included within other assets on the consolidated statements of financial condition was $109 million and $119 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and primarily represented receivables from certain investment products managed by BlackRock. Accounts receivable at December 31, 2020 and 2019 included $1.1 billion and $995 million, respectively,\n\nrelated to receivables from BlackRock mutual funds and iShares ETFs, for investment advisory and administration services.\n\nDue to related parties, which is included within other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition, was $17 million and $12 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and primarily represented payables to certain investment products managed by BlackRock.\n\n## 21. Net Capital Requirements\n\nThe Company is required to maintain net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries within a number of jurisdictions, which is partially maintained by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those subsidiaries or jurisdictions. As a result, such subsidiaries of the Company may be restricted in their ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions and to their parents. Additionally, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers.\n\nBanking Regulatory Requirements. BTC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, is chartered as a national bank whose powers are limited to trust and other fiduciary activities and which is subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Federal banking regulators would be required to take certain actions and permitted to take other actions in the event of BTC's failure to meet minimum capital requirements that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\n\nQuantitative measures established by regulators to ensure capital adequacy require BTC to maintain a minimum CommonEquity Tier 1 capital and Tier 1 leverage ratio, as well as Tier 1 and total risk-based capital ratios. Based on BTC's calculations as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, it exceeded the applicable capital adequacy requirements.\n\n|                                                       |        |        | For Capital Adequacy Purposes   | For Capital Adequacy Purposes   | To Be Well Capitalized Under Prompt Corrective Action Provisions   | To Be Well Capitalized Under Prompt Corrective Action Provisions   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| (in millions)                                         | Amount | Ratio  | Amount                          | Ratio                           | Amount                                                             | Ratio                                                              |\n| December 31, 2020                                     |        |        |                                 |                                 |                                                                    |                                                                    |\n| Total capital (to risk weighted assets)               | $740   | 184.6% | $32                             | 8.0%                            | $40                                                                | 10.0%                                                              |\n| CommonEquity Tier 1 capital (to risk weighted assets) | $740   | 184.6% | $18                             | 4.5%                            | $26                                                                | 6.5%                                                               |\n| Tier 1 capital (to risk weighted assets)              | $740   | 184.6% | $24                             | 6.0%                            | $32                                                                | 8.0%                                                               |\n| Tier 1 capital (to average assets)                    | $740   | 71.3%  | $41                             | 4.0%                            | $52                                                                | 5.0%                                                               |\n| December 31, 2019                                     |        |        |                                 |                                 |                                                                    |                                                                    |\n| Total capital (to risk weighted assets)               | $686   | 137.7% | $40                             | 8.0%                            | $50                                                                | 10.0%                                                              |\n| CommonEquity Tier 1 capital (to risk weighted assets) | $686   | 137.7% | $22                             | 4.5%                            | $32                                                                | 6.5%                                                               |\n| Tier 1 capital (to risk weighted assets)              | $686   | 137.7% | $30                             | 6.0%                            | $40                                                                | 8.0%                                                               |\n| Tier 1 capital (to average assets)                    | $686   | 72.8%  | $38                             | 4.0%                            | $47                                                                | 5.0%                                                               |\n\nBroker-dealers.

No state and local income tax audits are expected to result in an assessment material to BlackRock's consolidated financial statements.\n\nUpon conclusion of its examination, Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs ('HMRC') issued a closure notice during 2017 for various UK BlackRock subsidiaries for tax years 2009 and years after. At that time, the Company decided to pursue litigation for the tax matters included on such notice. During 2020, the Company received a favorable decision from the First Tier Tribunal, however, HMRChasreceived permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal. BlackRock does not expect the ultimate resolution to result in a material impact to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nFrom time to time, BlackRock may receive or be subject to tax authorities' assessments and challenges related to income taxes. BlackRock does not currently expect the ultimate resolution of any existing matters to be material to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nAt December 31, 2020, it is reasonably possible the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will change within the next twelve months due to completion of tax authorities' exams or the expiration of statues of limitations. Management estimates that the existing liability for uncertain tax positions could decrease by approximately $5 million to $15 million within the next twelve months.\n\n## 26. Earnings Per Share\n\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted EPS for 2020, 2019 and 2018:\n\n| (in millions, except shares and per share data)    | 2020        | 2019        | 2018        |\n|----------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc.         | $ 4,932     | $ 4,476 $   | 4,305       |\n| Basic weighted- average shares outstanding         | 153,489,422 | 156,014,343 | 160,301,116 |\n| Dilutive effect of:                                |             |             |             |\n| Nonparticipating RSUs                              | 1,275,733   | 1,445,203   | 1,647,616   |\n| Stock options                                      | 75,427      | -           | -           |\n| Total diluted weighted- average shares outstanding | 154,840,582 | 157,459,546 | 161,948,732 |\n| Basic earnings per share                           | $ 32.13     | $ 28.69 $   | 26.86       |\n| Diluted earnings per share                         | $ 31.85     | $ 28.43 $   | 26.58       |\n\nAnti-dilutive RSUs and stock options for 2020, 2019 and 2018 were immaterial. Certain performance-based RSUs were excluded from diluted EPS calculation because the designated contingency was not met for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. In addition, performance-based stock options were excluded from diluted EPS calculation for 2019 and 2018 because the designated contingency was not met.\n\nBlackRock Annual Report 2020",

Subsequent Events\n\nOn January 21, 2021, the Board of Directors approved BlackRock's quarterly dividend of $4.13 per share to be paid on March 23, 2021 to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 5, 2021.\n\nOn February 1, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of 100% of the equity interests of Aperio, a pioneer in customizing tax-optimized index equity separately managed accounts ('SMAs') for approximately $1.1 billion in cash, using existing cash resources. The acquisition of Aperio increased BlackRock's SMA assets and is expected to expand the breadth of the Company's capabilities via tax-managed strategies across factors, broad market indexing, and investor Environmental, Social, and Governance preferences across all asset classes. In connection with the acquisition, the Company recorded an initial estimate of purchase price allocation at the date of the transaction primarily related to goodwill of approximately $0.8 billion and $0.3 billion of finite-lived intangible assets (mainly customer relationships), which will be amortized over their estimated lives, which range from 10 to 12 years, with a weighted-average estimated life of approximately 10 years. The goodwill recognized in connection with the acquisition is primarily attributable to anticipated synergies from the transaction. The amount of goodwill expected to be deductible for tax purposes is approximately $0.5 billion.\n\nThe Company conducted a review for additional subsequent events and determined that no subsequent events had occurred that would require accrual or additional disclosures.\n\n[THIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK]\n\nBlackRock Annual Report 2020",
