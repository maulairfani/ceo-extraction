The individual and collective responses of people, communities and businesses have been remarkable in the face of such adversity. Kerry's own response to the pandemic has been truly inspirational and testament to the strength of its purpose, values and culture. The Board received regular updates throughout the year from Executive Management on how COVID-19 was impacting on the Group's employees, strategic priorities, operations and financial performance.\n\nThe Group's actions through this period focused on three main priorities:\n\n- \u00b7 Protecting the health and wellbeing of employees with measures including remote working, segregation and zoning, increased sanitisation and screening;\n- \u00b7 Supporting our customers and ensuring continuity of supply with supply chains challenged, Kerry helped ensure food products continued to reach consumers; and\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 Supporting our local communities in a multitude of ways from donating PPE, sanitiser and food, to pledging 26,000 volunteer days and \u20ac1 million through the MyCommunity Initiative.\n\nThe pandemic has led to significant disruption for virtually every global business. While Kerry's performance in the foodservice channel was most impacted, the Group demonstrated its resilience by delivering overall revenue of \u20ac7.0 billion, trading profit of \u20ac797m and free cash flow of \u20ac412m in 2020.\n\n## Strategic Update\n\nGood progress was made on the strategic front, with the acquisitions of Tecnispice, S.A. in Guatemala, Bio-K Plus International Inc. in Canada and Jining Nature Group in China completed during the year for a total consideration of \u20ac280m. These acquisitions further enhance Kerry's integrated solutions capability, while also expanding the Group's footprint and leading position in developing markets.\n\nThe Board is confident that Kerry's strategic priorities for growth will continue to be the key drivers of organic growth and acquisition investment in the future.\n\n## Sustainability\n\nIn October 2020, Kerry launched its 2030 sustainability strategy Beyond the Horizon along with a refreshed brand identity, reflecting the evolution of the business, as Kerry continues to meet the changing needs of both customers and consumers. Beyond the Horizon will see Kerry work with customers to promote healthier and more sustainable diets, aiming to reach over two billion people by 2030.\n\nThe range of ambitious science based targets announced will address key impacts across the areas of nutrition and health, emissions, energy, circular economy, raw materials and social impact. The combination of achieving these targets in conjunction with Kerry's leading innovation with its customers will mean a better impact for people, society and the planet. Details of the Group's sustainability strategy are outlined in the Sustainability Review on pages 46-70.\n\n## Corporate Governance\n\nThe Board is firmly committed to maintaining the highest standards of corporate governance in line with best practice.",

        "page_content": "During the year, the Remuneration Committee undertook a review of the Executive Directors' Remuneration Policy as part of the three-year review cycle. The updated Remuneration Policy has incorporated structural changes in line with best market practice and will be put to an advisory vote at the 2021 AGM.\n\nDuring 2020, the Board expanded the role of the Nomination Committee to provide guidance and oversight of the implementation of the Group's sustainability strategy. The Nomination Committee was renamed the Governance, Nomination and Sustainability Committee and its Terms of Reference were updated to reflect its additional responsibilities.\n\n## Board Changes\n\nJames C. Kenny retired from the Board following the Company's Annual General Meeting on 30 April 2020. On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank James for his contribution and service to the organisation.\n\nI am delighted to welcome Emer Gilvarry and Jinlong Wang who joined the Board as non-Executive Directors on 1 November 2020 and 5 January 2021 respectively. Emer is a highly experienced professional who brings legal, business and corporate governance expertise to the Board. Jinlong is an experienced leader with over 30 years' experience in global business development, consumer branding and general management. His in-depth understanding of Asian markets, coupled with his extensive knowledge of the Food & Beverage industry, brings a key set of skills to the Board. I look forward to both of them making significant contributions to the Board in the years ahead.\n\n## Purpose and Values\n\nOur Purpose, Inspiring Food, Nourishing Life, and our Values of Courage, Ownership, Inclusiveness, Open-mindedness and Enterprising Spirit are core elements of The Kerry Way framework. During 2020, the Board continued to ensure that management promote our purpose and values as a guide to our employees in the way we do business.\n\nThe response of our people during the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated how our purpose is fully embedded in how we do business and will underpin and sustain the Group's evolution in the years ahead.\n\n## People and Engagement\n\nCentral to Kerry's continued success is the hard work and commitment of all our employees. The Board is proud of the response of our employees to the challenges faced during the COVID-19 pandemic. The creativity and resilience demonstrated, in adapting to the challenging and changing conditions, combined with continuity of supply and innovation, is the single largest contributor to Kerry successfully navigating the challenges associated with the pandemic.\n\nThe Board also recognises the importance of employee engagement to the success of the Group and is continuously developing its engagement activities. During 2020, Mr. Tom Moran, the designated workforce engagement Director, undertook a detailed programme of activities where he had the opportunity to visit sites, engage with a range of employees, participate in employee events and obtain a first-hand view of how Kerry responded to the COVID-19 pandemic. While some events were completed in person in quarter one, all activities from March onwards were held virtually. Details of employee engagement activities during the year, including the work undertaken by the designated workforce engagement Director, are outlined in the Corporate Governance Report on pages 94-106.\n\n## Dividend\n\nThe Board recommends a final dividend of 60.6 cent per share (an increase of 10.0% on the 2019 final dividend) payable on 14 May 2021 to shareholders registered on the record date 16 April 2021.\n\nTogether with the interim dividend of 25.9 cent per share, this brings the total dividend for the year to 86.5 cent, an increase of 10.1% on 2019.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Prospects\n\nThe Board remains confident that the Group's business model and strategies will continue to deliver shareholder value and benefit our other stakeholders in the years to come. Kerry will continue to pursue organic and acquisitive growth opportunities and the Group's balance sheet is well placed to support our objectives. While recognising that the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to impact all businesses in 2021, we welcome the greater clarity from the recent Brexit trade deal and look forward to another successful year. The view of management regarding the business outlook for 2021 is presented in the Chief Executive Officer's Review.\n\nCOVID-19 has made the task of leadership significantly more challenging. On behalf of the Board, I would like to sincerely thank Edmond and the Executive Management team for their exceptional leadership and thank everyone throughout the organisation for their hard work and commitment during this most challenging of years.\n\nPhilip Toomey Chairman 15 February 2021\n\n<!-- image -->",

Their adaptability was tested, as work practices changed almost overnight. Their courage was vital in ensuring that Kerry played an important role through this period of crisis in our industry and within our communities. The strength of our global supply chain was instrumental in ensuring food and beverage products continued to reach consumers. The enterprising spirit of our teams in supporting our customers was displayed in a variety of ways. This included sharing our COVID-19 safety playbook with customers to ensure their operations were not compromised, supplying PPE and sanitiser, providing insights on developments in product categories, and adapting the innovation process for virtual collaboration with many products launched at record speed. These examples highlight the resilience and proactive nature of Kerry's business model, as we continue to strive to be our customers' most valued partner.\n\nIn addition to these efforts, we supported our local communities throughout, by leading support initiatives with vulnerable groups, volunteering, and making donations of food, PPE, and sanitiser to local frontline staff.\n\nI am immensely proud of Kerry's response to the pandemic and would like to thank everyone for their extraordinary efforts throughout.\n\n## Market\n\nThis year has seen major changes in the daily lives of consumers across the globe, with purchasing and consumption behaviours significantly disrupted, leading to a much more dynamic marketplace. At-home consumption has been elevated, as consumers adapted to changes in daily routines and work practices. The foodservice channel has been significantly impacted due to restrictions on operations and consumer mobility, leading to increased demand for online and delivery. Our foodservice business was most impacted in the second quarter, as many of our customers were closed for extended periods, with performance significantly improving through the year as they adapted their offerings to cater for the changing marketplace.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has served to accelerate the key trends that were on the rise at the beginning of the year, with increased demand for health and immunity enhancement, plant protein options, and products addressing a diverse range of sustainability",

Customers are increasingly focusing on sustainability as an enabler of growth, leading to significant opportunity for Kerry and our differentiated portfolio of sustainable nutrition solutions. As customers adapt to this dynamic operating environment, product portfolios and menu offerings continue to be evaluated, with new product development strategies focused on these rapidly changing consumer demands. These dynamics are leading to significant challenges and opportunities across the industry.\n\n## Strategic Developments\n\nWe made good progress across a number of strategic fronts in the year despite the challenges posed by COVID-19. We moved into our new Technology & Innovation Centre in Shanghai earlier in the year, while continuing to make good progress in expanding our capacity and deploying our technologies in the APMEA region. We commenced the strategic development of our Georgia, US operation, which is an important step in creating a state-of-the-art facility to meet the increasing demand for integrated solutions across a variety of protein applications.\n\nWe enhanced our proactive nutrition capabilities through the acquisition of Bio-K Plus International Inc., a leading biotechnology company, with a number of probiotics in beverage and supplement applications in Canada. We also enhanced our local taste capabilities in APMEA and LATAM through the acquisitions of Jining Nature Group in China and Tecnispice, S.A. in Guatemala, both of which are leaders in savoury taste in their respective markets. We made good progress in enhancing our portfolio of food protection solutions, with the 2019 acquisitions of Biosecur and Isoage complementing our industry-leading capability and enhancing our ability to further extend the shelf life of products through our range of natural sustainable solutions.\n\nFollowing the successful completion of our Towards 2020 programme, we refreshed our sustainability strategy to reflect the changing marketplace and the increased demand for sustainable food and beverage products. Our goal of reaching over two billion people with sustainable nutrition solutions by 2030, combined with our range of science based targets demonstrate how sustainable innovation and co-creation will be central to Kerry's growth strategy in the coming decade and beyond.\n\nIn the year, net capital expenditure amounted to \u20ac311m (2019: \u20ac315m) and research and development expenditure was \u20ac282m (2019: \u20ac291m). We continued to invest under our strategic priorities for growth and allocated resources to key growth areas that have accelerated through COVID-19, in particular the areas of health and wellness, plant protein and natural preservation.\n\n## Results\n\nGroup revenue of \u20ac7 billion reflected a reported decrease of 4.0%, with an overall volume reduction of 2.9% in the year. This performance reflected a strong recovery since April with a return to volume growth of 2.2% in the fourth quarter. The Group reported trading profit of \u20ac797.2m (2019: \u20ac902.7m). Group trading margin decreased to 11.5% as a result of significant operating deleverage and COVID-related costs partially offset by cost mitigation actions, with significant recovery in business margins across the second half of the year.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Good volume growth of 3.8% in the retail channel was more than offset by the volume reduction of 19.0% in the foodservice channel, where restrictions on movement were introduced and customers were closed for extended periods of time.\n\nOur performance in the foodservice channel significantly improved through the year, recovering from April when the impact was most pronounced. This was led by North America, where operators adapted quickly to changes in regulations, followed by a similar recovery in Europe and APMEA over the course of the year.\n\nIn the retail channel, our performance in the Americas was strong, led by Beverage, Dairy and Meals. Europe delivered good growth in Beverage, Snacks and Meat, while APMEA continued to progress through the year and achieved excellent growth in Snacks and Dairy.\n\nRead More\n\nTaste & Nutrition Business Review Pages 40-43\n\nConsumer Foods Business Review Pages 44-45\n\nStrong growth achieved in Nutrition & Wellness in particular through proactive health and immunity-enhancing solutions.\n\nConsumer Foods had a reported revenue decrease of 2.1%, reflecting a volume decrease of 2.6%, as underlying volume growth of 2.2% driven by good growth in snacking and strong performances across our plant-based ranges was more than offset by the impact of the ready meals contract exit in the prior year.\n\n## Future Prospects\n\nThe scale and pace of change seen over the last 12 months has led to customers fundamentally reassessing their portfolios, ways of working and business models. This has created an environment where customers are more open to change and are looking for partners to help them pivot at pace, to address both short term challenges and opportunities, while also allowing them to target more meaningful, purposeful, step change innovations as they look out into the future. Sustainability, localisation, speed to market and innovation process agility have been elevated in importance as customers strive to win market share.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Kerry's proactive approach and co-creation business model is ideally placed to support customers through these changing market dynamics.\n\nLooking to the year ahead, within Taste & Nutrition, we see strong growth prospects in the retail channel, with continued recovery in foodservice, underpinned by a very good innovation pipeline and strong customer engagement.\n\nOur Consumer Foods business has a good growth outlook supported by continued innovation and the strength of our brands.\n\nWe will continue to invest for growth and enablement of our business model, while continuing to pursue M&A opportunities aligned to our strategic growth priorities. Kerry's unique business model, broad taste and nutrition portfolio and industryleading integrated solutions capabilities are more critical than ever, as we support our customers through this dynamic environment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEdmond Scanlon Chief Executive Officer 15 February 2021\n\n<!-- image -->",

We invest in continually building the engagement capabilities of our people leaders as champions of a healthy listening culture focused on continuous improvement, and every year we pulse-check on the progress we are making, where and how we can continue to improve. This year, we were delighted that 86% of our people participated in our third groupwide engagement survey to identify areas of strength and areas for continuous improvement within our business, an increase of 1% on 2019. Our unwavering focus on our customers and our Safety First, Quality Always mindset remains a clear area of strength for Kerry and we saw a significant uplift in our global engagement priorities for improvement: Leadership, Simplification and Career development.\n\nOur three global engagement priorities remain a focus for 2021, along with continued enhancement of our approach to Reward and Recognition. We will continue to monitor our progress through ongoing dialogue with our leadership teams, our people and through targeted pulse surveys during 2021.\n\nFinally, in 2019 the Board appointed Mr. Tom Moran, non-Executive Board Director, as our designated workforce engagement Director to ensure the Board adequately take into consideration the interests and views of our people in their decision making. Despite the challenges that COVID-19 presented, Mr. Moran was able to follow an active and participative employee engagement plan with a cross-section of employees from across the Group throughout 2020, reporting back to the Board and other executives on his observations and recommendations.\n\n## Throughout 2020 we continued to focus on these three priorities as follows:\n\n## Leadership\n\n## Simplification\n\n## Career Development\n\nOur focus has been on improving how our leaders engage and collaborate in a consistent way, how we lead and role model by living our values consistently every day. Since the 2019 survey, we have ensured that all people leaders have an annual 'people leadership' goal in their objectives, accounting for at least 15% of their overall performance assessment. From our 2020 survey, we have seen an improvement in feedback that our leaders are taking the necessary actions to position the company for long-term success, providing a clear vision of what Kerry is trying to achieve, and generating excitement about the future of the business.\n\nMany of our people have shared what they are doing to make things easier for our employees and for our customers to do business with us. From putting in place a portal for collaboration with our customers, to establishing a regulatory self-service documentation platform, to improving our standard product portfolio and sample turnaround time - these examples show the progress we are making to simplify our business and continue to transform for the future. Our employees believe our organisational structures are helping us to achieve our goals and feel that they have appropriate influence in decision making, contributing their ideas to help shape our plans and achieve our vision.\n\nWe aspire to be the first choice for the best talent - where everyone can fulfil their potential and have interesting and varied careers. Through our Management Effectiveness programme, we have a global standard for consistent team leadership, creating a better employee experience. This includes the expectation that all employees have meaningful one-to-one conversations about their performance and career potential. To date over 1,700 people leaders have participated in this programme. We have seen a significant improvement in our employees' belief that we are developing a workforce that adapts well to change and that we are actively supporting the learning and development of our employees.",

In 2020 we demonstrated our commitment to promoting a diverse and inclusive workplace through fully embedding our Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging strategy within our sustainability strategy for 2030 Beyond the Horizon .\n\nAs a global business, we appreciate and value the dynamic mix of people who bring new perspectives, experiences and thought leadership to enable our organisation to continuously grow and innovate for our customers. Our ambition is to build a highly inclusive workplace where everyone can be at their best, contribute to our success and excel personally and professionally. We will monitor our progress against this ambition through a newly established Inclusion Index, as part of our Employee Engagement Survey.\n\nThis relies on our leaders behaving inclusively, ensuring all voices are heard and that individual opinions and perspectives are visibly valued. During 2020, we sought to support our leaders in becoming more aware of their own potential biases and preferences, in actively seeking out and considering different views and perspectives to inform better decision making, inspiring improvements in individual and organisational performance. We will further build on this programme in 2021.\n\nWhilst limited opportunities existed to bring our people together this year, we continued to rally our people behind a series of International Diversity Days such as International Day of Women and Girls in Science, International Women's Day and Pride. Our local Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging Committees are now firmly established in key locations, and have continued to flourish this year, actively educating and raising awareness of global and local issues, inspiring our people to come together to celebrate and promote this important agenda within our business.\n\nOur ambition is to build a highly inclusive workplace where everyone can be at their best, contribute to our success and excel personally and professionally.\n\nExternally, we continue to strengthen our strategic partnerships within Ireland and globally. This includes our partnership with the Women Foodservice Forum in North America, our membership of the Irish and United Kingdom Chapters of the 30% club, the Agri-Food Diversity & Inclusion Forum led by Bord Bia in Ireland and our membership of the Valuable 500 in the United Kingdom. We are challenging ourselves to do more to pathway employment opportunities for individuals with intellectual disabilities within our business and continue to nourish their potential through our renewed sponsorship of Special Olympics, with whom we have been partnering since 2018 across Ireland, Great Britain, Poland and more recently Germany, who will host the Special Olympics World Summer Games in 2023.\n\nFinally, we are making progress on our journey to increase representation of women and improve cultural diversity within our senior leadership teams, improving on key measures agreed with our executives in 2019, endorsed by our Board. This will ensure our leadership teams and internal talent pools better reflect the broader mix of capabilities we have within our organisation. Our aim is to further strengthen our approach in 2021 through broader diversity goals incorporated within our sustainability strategy for 2030.\n\nRead More\n\nSustainability Review Pages 46-70\n\n<!-- image -->",

The capitalised element of the cost of this project is being amortised over a seven year period.\n\n## Brand Related Intangible Asset Amortisation\n\nBrand related intangible asset amortisation increased to \u20ac41.7m (2019: \u20ac37.8m) which is reflective of recent acquisition activity.\n\n## Finance Costs (net)\n\nFinance costs (net) for the year decreased by \u20ac9.2m to \u20ac72.4m (2019: \u20ac81.6m) primarily due to lower interest rates. The Group's average interest rate for the year was 3.0% (2019: 3.7%).\n\n## Taxation\n\nThe tax charge for the year before non-trading items was \u20ac85.1m (2019: \u20ac98.6m) representing an effective tax rate of 13.0% (2019: 13.0%) and is reflective of the geographical mix of earnings.\n\n## Acquisitions\n\nDuring the year, the Group completed three acquisitions for a total consideration of \u20ac280.0m . These acquisitions were aligned to the Group's strategic priorities for growth; enhancing both the Group's taste and nutrition technologies, expanding its presence in developing markets and in the foodservice channel.\n\n## Non-Trading Items\n\nDuring the year, the Group incurred a non-trading item charge of \u20ac15.5m (2019: \u20ac91.7m) net of tax. The charge in the year primarily related to costs associated with the integration of business acquisitions.\n\n## Adjusted EPS in Constant Currency\n\nAdjusted EPS in constant currency decreased by 9.4% to 345.4 cent (2019: +8.3%) due to the impact of COVID-19 on business performance.\n\n## Basic EPS\n\nBasic EPS decreased by 2.3% to 313.0 cent (2019: 320.4 cent). Basic EPS is calculated after accounting for brand related intangible asset amortisation of 23.6 cent (2019: 21.4 cent) and a non-trading item charge of 8.8 cent net of related tax (2019: 51.9 cent).\n\n## Return on Average Capital Employed\n\nROACE in the year was 9.8% (2019: 11.8%) reflecting the impact of COVID-19 on current year profits.",

The Board has proposed a final dividend of 60.6 cent per A ordinary share, payable on 14 May 2021 to shareholders registered on the record date of 16 April 2021. When combined with the interim dividend, the total dividend for the year amounts to 86.5 cent per share (2019: 78.6 cent per share), which is an increase of 10.1% over last year's dividend. The Group's aim is to have double digit dividend growth each year. Over 34 years as a listed company, the Group has grown its dividend at a compound rate of 16.5%.\n\n## Balance Sheet\n\nA summary balance sheet as at 31 December is provided below:\n\n|                             | 2020  \u20ac'm   | 2019  \u20ac'm   |\n|-----------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Property, plant & equipment | 1,990.6     | 2,062.9     |\n| Intangible assets           | 4,687.1     | 4,589.7     |\n| Other non-current assets    | 170.6       | 179.5       |\n| Current assets              | 2,594.8     | 2,672.2     |\n| Total assets                | 9,443.1     | 9,504.3     |\n| Current liabilities         | 1,696.3     | 2,014.0     |\n| Non-current liabilities     | 3,091.3     | 2,928.1     |\n| Total liabilities           | 4,787.6     | 4,942.1     |\n| Net assets                  | 4,655.5     | 4,562.2     |\n| Shareholders' equity        | 4,655.5     | 4,562.2     |\n\n## Property, Plant & Equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment decreased by \u20ac72.3m to \u20ac1,990.6m (2019: \u20ac2,062.9m) primarily due to the depreciation charge and the impact of foreign exchange translation partially offset by additions made in the period. Net capital expenditure in the year (including computer software) amounted to \u20ac310.7m (2019: \u20ac315.3m). The level of capital investment supports the Group's growth initiatives and included the strategic development of its Georgia, US facility, creating a world-leading manufacturing facility to meet increasing demand for integrated solutions across a variety of protein applications.",

        "page_content": "## Intangible Assets & Acquisitions\n\nIntangible assets increased by \u20ac97.4m to \u20ac4,687.1m (2019: \u20ac4,589.7m) due to the acquisitions made in the year partially offset by amortisation charge and the impact of foreign exchange translation.\n\n## Current Assets\n\nCurrent assets decreased by \u20ac77.4m to \u20ac2,594.8m (2019: \u20ac2,672.2m) due to decreased inventory and trade and other receivables.\n\n## Retirement Benefits\n\nAt the balance sheet date, the total net deficit for all defined benefit schemes (after deferred tax) was \u20ac43.6m (2019: \u20ac8.6m). The increase in the net deficit was driven primarily by lower discount rates which increased schemes' liabilities, partially offset by strong returns on schemes' assets. The net deficit expressed as a percentage of market capitalisation at 31 December 2020 was 0.2% (2019: 0.04%).\n\n## Shareholders' Equity\n\nShareholders' equity increased by \u20ac93.3m to \u20ac4,655.5m (2019: \u20ac4,562.2m), resulting from profits generated during the year, offset in part by dividends.\n\nA full reconciliation of shareholders' equity is disclosed in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity on page 162.\n\n## Capital Structure\n\nThe Group finances its operations through a combination of equity and borrowing facilities, including bank borrowings and senior notes from capital markets.\n\nThe financing structure of the Group is managed in order to optimise shareholder value while allowing the Group to take advantage of opportunities that might arise to grow the business. The Group targets acquisition and investment opportunities that are value enhancing and the Group's policy is to fund these transactions from cash flow or borrowings while maintaining its investment grade debt status.\n\nThis is managed by setting Net debt to EBITDA targets while allowing flexibility to accommodate significant acquisition opportunities. Any expected variation from these targets should be reversible between 18 and 24 months; otherwise consideration would be given to issuing additional equity in the Group.\n\n## Free Cash Flow\n\nIn 2020, the Group achieved free cash flow of \u20ac412.0m (2019: \u20ac514.6m).\n\n| Free Cash Flow                                  | 2020  \u20ac'm   | 2019  \u20ac'm   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Trading profit                                  | 797.2       | 902.7       |\n| Depreciation (net)                              | 200.7       | 191.4       |\n| Movement in average working capital             | (102.5)     | (89.5)      |\n| Pension contributions paid less pension expense | (23.4)      | (26.7)      |\n| Cash flow from operations                       | 872.0       | 977.9       |\n| Finance costs paid (net)                        | (74.6)      | (80.8)      |\n| Income taxes paid                               | (74.7)      | (67.2)      |\n| Purchase of non-current assets                  | (310.7)     | (315.3)     |\n| Free cash flow                                  | 412.0       | 514.6       |\n| Cash conversion\u00b9                                | 67%         | 74%         |",

Taste & Nutrition began the year strongly before the global spread of COVID-19. While performance was most impacted in the second quarter, business volumes recovered well since then and returned to growth in the fourth quarter. We saw a significant change in the nature of innovation through the year, as product ideation, collaboration and co-creation was adapted to cater for virtual engagement through this period. Kerry's nutrition and wellness technology portfolio had a very good performance within the retail channel through customised solutions incorporating our broad protein portfolio, fermented ingredients, probiotics and immunity enhancing technologies.\n\nBusiness volumes in the foodservice channel declined 19.0% in the year, with many out-of-home food and beverage outlets closed for an extended period of time. This impact was the primary driver of overall performance in developing markets, where business volumes declined by 1.2%.\n\nIn the year, we completed a number of key strategic acquisitions. These included Bio-K Plus International Inc., a leading biotechnology company with a number of probiotics in beverage and supplement applications in Canada, and we acquired Jining Nature Group in China and Tecnispice, S.A. in Guatemala, both of which are local leaders in savoury taste in their respective markets within APMEA and LATAM.",

Within the Food EUM, Meals achieved very strong growth through clean label innovations incorporating Kerry's natural stocks and broths, with a number of plant-based launches also supporting growth.

Within the Food EUM, Snacks had strong growth through clean-label and healthier innovations in savoury applications with a number of large customers.

This growth was led by China and the Middle East, while there remained variations in performance across the region aligned to local conditions. The foodservice channel continued to recover through the year as restrictions on mobility eased. The retail channel performed well, led by the Food EUM of Snacks, where we saw a lot of innovation in the category across the region. Demand increased for indulgent offerings as consumers spent more time at home, while healthier snacks with nutritional claims also had a strong performance in the year, benefitting from increasing emphasis on ingredient label declarations for children in China. Meals was more challenged, as many consumers opted for more traditional food offerings during the initial period where restrictions were in place. Dairy had strong growth from increased demand with regional leaders for Kerry's clean label solutions, with Meat also performing well, particularly in the Middle East.\n\nThe Group continued to make good progress in expanding its capacity and deploying technology capabilities in China and the Middle East, while also moving into the new Technology & Innovation Centre in Shanghai.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Meeting the Global Challenge\n\nIn 2015, world leaders agreed to a UN roadmap for more sustainable global development by 2030. Through a set of seventeen Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and associated targets, they adopted a pathway to address poverty, protect the planet and improve the lives and prospects for all. As we enter 2021, the achievement of these goals is in doubt without an accelerated and concerted effort by all parts of society to deliver on the SDGs.\n\nThe food system has a critical role to play in the achievement of these goals. According to the World Health Organisation, good nutrition is central to the achievement of twelve of the seventeen SDGs. However, today we know that more than two billion people globally are overweight or obese while almost 700 million go hungry every day. Food production is also responsible for a significant share of greenhouse gas emissions and global resource use and yet it is estimated that a third of all calories produced are not consumed due to food loss and waste.\n\nAt Kerry, we look beyond the horizon to a future of sustainable nutrition; one that provides positive and balanced nutrition to consumers globally.\n\n## Responsible Consumption and Production\n\nAt Kerry, we look beyond the horizon to a future of sustainable nutrition; one that provides positive and balanced nutrition to consumers globally and where consumers are offered sustainable choices that involve no compromise on taste or quality; a future where farmers are supported to produce in harmony with nature, employing practices that help protect biodiversity, store carbon and regenerate soils; a future where all companies produce and consume while respecting the principles of the circular economy.\n\nAs we pursue this vision, we will continue to contribute to the achievement of the UN Sustainable Development Goals. While all seventeen goals are critically important, Kerry's global results, commitments and innovations mean that we are best placed to make the most significant contribution to the targets associated with goals 2, 3, and 12.\n\n## Zero Hunger\n\nWe can play a key role in helping people access sufficient amounts of the right nutrition while working with producers to sustainably intensify production and improve livelihoods\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Good Health & Well-being\n\nWe work with customers to support good health and wellbeing and reduce mortality through creating products that help improve diets\n\nWe seek to use natural resources responsibly and through our innovation and technology portfolio, we enable our customers to consume and produce more sustainably",

To help guide our reporting, the material in this report references the Global Reporting Initiative's (GRI) framework and within this review we identify where specific standards are GRIreferenced. All data relates to the full year 2020 unless otherwise stated. For environmental metrics, the impact of recent acquisitions is excluded from our performance and we use a 2017 baseline for our targets.\n\nOur 2017 baseline was chosen as it provided the most recent full year of data when the target setting process commenced. The Greenhouse Gas (GHG), waste and water performance data presented in this report is independently assured by Jacobs UK Ltd to AA1000 Assurance Standard.

Kerry is committed to ongoing and constructive engagement with our stakeholders through structured two-way dialogue and analysis to ensure we incorporate their views into our business activities.\n\nThrough stakeholder analysis, we clearly identify those groups we impact on as well as those groups that can influence and impact on Kerry. We engage these key stakeholders through a variety of channels, many of which are tailored for specific stakeholder groups. These include one-to-one interactions, engagement with representative bodies and relevant multistakeholder platforms to clearly identify potentially impactful issues and groups.\n\nAmong our key stakeholders are employees, customers, consumers, shareholders, suppliers, communities and government. We understand that among and within these groups, there can be different and sometimes conflicting views. As part of our engagement, we seek to balance these competing interests and respond in a way that maximises the value for all those connected with the organisation.

Most notably in 2020, there has been a very significant focus on employee and consumer health and wellbeing while areas such as climate, human rights and biodiversity continue to gain momentum.\n\nNutrition\n\nWe have outlined below how each relevant material aspect fits within our Beyond the Horizo n strategy. Topics of growth, geo-political risk and regulation go beyond this review and are dealt with across other sections of this report. All of these topics are reviewed as part of the broader risk assessment process, and further details on the Group's principal risks is outlined in the Risk Management Report on pages 71-83.

The Governance, Nomination and Sustainability Committee of the Board will now have responsibility for guidance and oversight of the implementation of the Group's sustainability strategy and will be supported in this work by the Global Sustainability Council. In addition, sustainability metrics will form part of the long-term incentive plan for executive directors and senior executives from 2021, as outlined in the Directors' Remuneration Report on page 136.\n\nThe Sustainability Council, chaired by the Chief Executive Officer, comprises the Executive team and functional leaders from across the Group. It meets quarterly to review and monitor the effectiveness of the Group's strategy and to discuss ongoing performance versus goals.\n\nIn 2020, a key focus for the Sustainability Council has been the completion and launch of the Beyond the Horizon strategy and the further integration of sustainability as part of Kerry's day-to-day operations. To support the strategic steering and management of the Sustainability Council, a number of cross-functional councils have also been established based on key themes covering material topics. These councils are responsible for designing and executing projects and activities, developing and establishing best practices involving all functions and businesses and measuring performance.

According to the World Bank, malnutrition is one of the world's most serious yet least-addressed challenges. The burden of malnutrition occurs when the right foods are not available, affordable, convenient, or they involve some compromise on taste, or other important characteristics, making them less desirable or accessible for consumers. The result is poor quality diets that prevent people reaching their potential or lead to obesity or the onset of illnesses such as heart disease and diabetes.\n\nConsumers are increasingly conscious of the link between diet and health and as outlined on page 25, the '&' consumer is seeking out products and brands that meet multiple requirements including their desire to make a positive impact on their health and the world around them. As food and beverage manufacturers seek to respond to these changing consumer preferences, demand for partners who can support them in creating products that deliver more sustainable nutrition is growing.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Through our unique capabilities and solutions portfolio, we co-create products that deliver better nutrition for consumers with no compromise on taste. Our application expertise and delivery systems allow us to bring tasty, convenient and familiar food to the consumer, increasing the availability of nutritious options with positive health benefits.\n\nTo highlight the role of Kerry as a sustainable nutrition partner for the industry, we have profiled the nutritional contribution of our ingredients portfolio. In the absence of an existing measurement framework to evaluate ingredients, our scientific experts developed a rigorous methodology based on the independent and externally validated UK nutrient profiling model. It allows us to assess and classify the nutritional contribution of each solution to a final consumer product. We have used very stringent criteria and do not allow for any offsetting in order to provide an objective and transparent result.\n\nOur assessment shows that more than 80% of our Taste & Nutrition portfolio is already delivering positive or balanced nutrition solutions for over one billion consumers today. Over the next ten years, we will increase the impact from our portfolio, through innovation and partnerships, creating sustainable solutions that will reach more than two billion people. Given the strength of our portfolio and its potential for positive impact, we aim to bring these solutions to as many consumers as possible, helping us to fulfil our Purpose of Inspiring Food, Nourishing Life.\n\nIn 2020, we continued to expand our impact and despite the challenging context, we increased our reach with positive and balanced nutrition solutions by more than thirty million to over one billion people. This growth was driven by the increase in positive nutrition solutions within our portfolio and our geographical expansion in developing regions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOf our Taste & Nutrition portfolio is already delivering positive or balanced nutrition solutions for over one billion consumers today.\n\n## >80%\n\n## OUR COMMITMENTS IN ACTION\n\n## Integrated Solutions\n\nRadicle\u2122 by Kerry is a unique portfolio of plantbased ingredients and solutions that can help customers create and deliver sustainable products which are nutritionally optimised. With the ability to reduce saturated fat by up to 87% versus meat, our technology also helps customers to create low carbon products with cleaner labels, authentic taste and appealing texture.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Consumer Brands\n\nWithin our Consumer Foods division, we are also focused on helping consumers access better nutrition, as we work towards the achievement of category specific targets for salt, sugar and calorie reduction. Over the last five years, we have made continuous progress on nutritional improvement across our brands and in 2020, we relaunched our Dairygold spread with 27% less salt and converted the product packaging to make it 100% recyclable.\n\n## OUR REACH\n\nBy 2030, our ambition is to reach over two billion people with positive and balanced nutrition solutions. Our approach to calculating this reach was developed in partnership with independent third parties and combines the outputs from our industry leading nutritional assessment with external market data and Kerry's business insight. We use a bottom up model taking information by country and end use market and eliminate potential double counting through the application of accepted statistical methods.",

We work with customers and products that span the entire nutritional spectrum and our goal is to support our partners on their nutrition and broader sustainability journey, helping them to positively impact their product portfolio and create products that are better for consumers.\n\nTaste remains the key driver of consumer purchase behaviour and we know that creating nutritious products that do not satisfy consumer desires for great taste, will not win in the marketplace. Kerry's business model and positioning at the intersection of taste and nutrition provide us with the unique ability to deliver tailored customer-specific solutions. This capability, together with our reach and broad portfolio of foundational technologies is what will allow us to make impactful change at scale.\n\n## Our Sustainable Solutions\n\nOur natural Tastesense\u2122 taste modulator reduces sugar to improve nutrition while also delivering lower greenhouse gas and water impacts. Our customers leverage Tastesense\u2122 to reduce up to 30% of sugar in their finished products without sacrificing taste. Furthermore, this technology can reduce embedded CO 2 emissions and water use in the final product.

Supported by an independent Scientific Advisory Council, KHNI is enabling those within the sector to acquire new knowledge from our scientists, academics and other experts, as they explore challenges in the food and beverage industry.\n\nThis digital hub of scientific know how provides in-depth articles, webinars and white papers, written for those working in the food industry, by experts within the food industry. To date, KHNI has published more than 225 in-depth articles, 18 white papers and led 13 industry webinars that have attracted thousands of viewers from over 50 countries and over 250 of the world's largest CPG companies, academia and public health institutions.\n\nIn 2020, the focus of these webinars was increasingly aligned with our vision, with content focused on challenges and opportunities within plant protein, food waste and fermented food science.

We create solutions that are healthier and more sustainable by design and continue to integrate sustainability criteria in our product development process.\n\nAlready home to the industry's leading portfolio of integrated taste and nutrition technologies, our innovation programme brings together Kerry's unrivalled global capabilities to create solutions that meet consumer needs and preferences. Uniquely, almost 90% of our portfolio is naturally derived and we maintain a focus on developing solutions that are from-food-for-food.

We deliver the highest quality products, following rigorous food safety and quality end-to-end procedures from farm to fork. We incorporate robust preventative controls, sanitation, microbiological monitoring programmes, crisis management, continuous improvement through horizon scanning and embedding food safety best practices. Our governance, policies and due diligence programmes, are verified and refined in line with evolving customer requirements and Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI) standards and we continue to participate in peer reviews and benchmarking with customers and industry leading organisations such as SSAFE.\n\nWe partner with suppliers operating in nearly 60 countries and mandate strict compliance with the quality and food safety requirements laid out in the Group's Supplier Requirements Manual. Our Supply Quality team risk assess all direct suppliers and in 2020, had engagement with 1,600 suppliers across all regions to identify impacts from COVID-19 and potential supply chain disruptions, conducting 820 physical audits, while maintaining the highest levels of health & safety for our colleagues.\n\nAcross all our operations, we have designed and implemented a Global Quality Management System and all our sites are certified to the GFSI standard for food safety. Our dedicated quality teams also partner with our RD&A teams in ensuring quality and food safety are key considerations throughout the development and production process.\n\n## Product Labelling\n\nAs a predominantly B2B business, most of our marketing and communication is not directed to consumers, however, our customers rely on timely and accurate information around the handling and use of our products for the creation of safe products for their consumers. Clear labelling and dedicated marketing and customer care teams provide required product information, while specialist regulatory colleagues act as an expert resource supporting our customers on product specifications, claims and relevant regulations across different global markets.\n\nWithin our Consumer Foods division, all advertising and brand positioning conform to national advertising codes of practice and we are conscious of the potential impact of marketing to children and young people. We provide on-pack nutritional labelling and additional information services e.g. brand websites, to help consumers make informed choices. The Group has established best practice guidelines for nutritional labelling across our portfolio, in line with Food Information to Consumers legislation, and support the voluntary addition of front-of-pack 'Reference Intake' information to aid consumer choice.",

We conduct our business guided by our purpose and underpinned by our values, and the Group's comprehensive Code of Conduct clearly defines the standards and expectations for all Kerry colleagues. It sets out how we respect each other, live our values, protect our assets and obey the law. The policies behind the code provide clear guidance for our daily interactions and are reviewed annually. The ongoing responsibility for their implementation rests with the Executive team, supported by relevant functions including HR, Legal and Internal Audit.\n\nThe Code of Conduct is available in multiple languages and applied to all aspects of business across the Group. All colleagues are required to familiarise themselves with this code on joining Kerry and we mandate ongoing training thereafter through our Learning Academy, on at least a bi-annual basis. 85% of all eligible colleagues had achieved Code of Conduct certification by year end 2020.\n\nWhere employees have concerns about business conduct, the Group provides clear guidance on reporting. The Employee Concerns Disclosure Policy details the appropriate means of reporting alleged misconduct. It encourages employees to speak up if they believe something is not right and is clear about the protection afforded to whistleblowers. To facilitate anyone who wishes to express a concern, the Group operates an ethics hotline, through which employees and third parties can report an issue anonymously (www.kerrygroup.ethicspoint.com).\n\nIn 2020, we continued to monitor and investigate all reported issues via this 'Express a Concern' facility. In the period there were approximately 0.3 cases reported per 100 employees (which includes a small number of reports from external parties) with 84% of concerns reported relating to internal HR matters. The Board continues to review the effective operation of this facility and the related reports on an ongoing basis. Further details are outlined under 'Whistleblowing Arrangement' in the Corporate Governance Report on page 102. We also seek to extend our values on ethical business practice to those with whom we do business and our requirements are reflected in our Supplier Code of Conduct.\n\nRead More\n\nCorporate Governance Report Pages 94-106\n\nOur Purpose and Vision Pages 4-5\n\n## Upholding Labour and Human Rights\n\n[GRI 407: Freedom of Association and Collective Bargaining 2016; GRI 408: Child Labour 2016; GRI 409: Forced or Compulsory Labour 2016; GRI 412: Human Rights Assessment 2016, 412-1]\n\nWe are fully committed to upholding internationally recognised human rights. Kerry's Global Human Rights Policy reflects this commitment and is guided by the Universal Declaration on Human Rights and the International Labour Organisation's Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. The policy outlines our commitment to respect the rights and dignity of all people, complying with all applicable laws and regulations and conducting ongoing human rights due diligence to assess and mitigate potential human rights infringements.\n\nKerry's Code of Conduct and Human Rights Policy applies to all employees and sets out our expectations for business and supply chain partners to conduct their business in a way that upholds our standards. In 2020, we established a dedicated cross-functional team on human rights. Reporting to the Chief Human Resources Officer, its objective is to further integrate the Group's commitments across our operations and supply chain. We also published a detailed Human Rights Statement outlining our approach and identified a number of salient human rights issues including forced labour, child labour, discrimination and freedom of association. We have dedicated policies and due diligence processes in each of these areas across all our operations and protections mandated within our Supplier Code of Conduct for workers within our supply chain.\n\nAll sites are registered with the Supplier Ethical Data Exchange (SEDEX) and through this platform we complete a detailed assessment aligned with the key issues outlined above. In addition, we continue to pursue independent SEDEX Members Ethical Trade Audit (SMETA) or equivalent audit protocols across our sites. Across our supply chain, our Supplier Code of Conduct is explicit in demanding that those who seek to do business with the Group uphold the same high standards and it expressly forbids the use of child, forced or involuntary labour of any type. Our responsible sourcing team provides training to all our buyers globally on risks relevant to their categories and on new requirements for suppliers to address these. We have also provided our buyers with access to tools that help them understand and assess key risks associated with the commodities they source.\n\nWe use SEDEX to assist us in monitoring compliance across our supply chain and for global contracts, over 92% of vendors are registered with this platform. We recognise that human rights infringements can occur at any point in the value chain and achieving visibility across a broad global supply base is a challenge. We take a risk-based approach to supplier assessment, focusing on commodities and/or geographies where there is a greater likelihood of non-compliance with our standards. To enhance and expand our due diligence process, we began to revise our assessment criteria, bringing additional suppliers within scope for assessment in 2020. This work is ongoing and we expect to complete it in 2021.",

These standards are non-negotiable and apply to everyone working at Kerry.

These specialist colleagues provide advice and guidance to managers and employees across our sites, focusing on employee engagement and behaviour based safety programmes to realise our goal of Safety First, Quality Always.\n\nKerry also continues to develop its proactive safety programmes, creating channels for employees to speak up and act immediately once they identify safety hazards or potential improvements. In 2020, we placed an emphasis on serious incidents through deployment of a targeted training and awareness programme and are pleased to see further positive momentum in our health & safety performance. A focus was also placed on root cause analysis and investigations of all types of injuries and near misses ensuring that best practices and corrective actions are implemented throughout all Kerry locations globally. While we recognise that there is no acceptable level of accident or injury, we are pleased to report that there were no fatalities and we recorded a 5% reduction in total incidents versus the previous twelve months.\n\nFighting Bribery and Corruption\n\n<!-- image -->",

We believe this structured approach will accelerate our journey to fostering the healthiest and most inclusive culture, one that is aligned with our Kerry Way framework and supports our ambition to be first choice for the best talent. We will establish a baseline for this new metric from our 2021 engagement survey and will provide detail on progress in future reports. As part of our ongoing work on inclusion, we also continue to increase the representation of women in senior leadership roles across the Group. In 2020, this increased from 25% to 28%, putting us in a strong position to deliver on our target of 35% by 2025.

In support of these efforts, Kerry launched a global MyCommunity programme, mobilising our resources and expertise while facilitating employees to volunteer with locally-led community initiatives which directly supported food, nutrition and health needs.\n\nThe response from our colleagues has been inspirational and around the world, Kerry employees have volunteered their time and talents to support and nourish their communities. Together we have supported, participated and contributed to over 110 initiatives, from local food relief, to deliveries of food to vulnerable groups, providing Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for frontline workers and producing hand sanitiser. To date almost three quarters of the \u20ac1 million pledged to the programme has been deployed in support of local communities.\n\n## MyCommunity\n\n## Improving Nutrition within Communities\n\nWe continue to work with community partners on redistribution of food to those in need. In 2020, Kerry Foods donated the equivalent of over 1 million meals to FareShare from 14 manufacturing sites across the UK.\n\n## Protecting Health During COVID-19\n\nAt our Barueri site in Campinas, employees stepped up during the COVID-19 crisis to produce alcohol for use as sanitiser by a local hospital, serving more than two thousand people daily.\n\nAlongside this work we have continued to partner with world leading organisations such as Special Olympics, UN World Food Programme (WFP), and Concern Worldwide, helping them to tackle exclusion, poverty, hunger and malnutrition in some of the world's poorest regions. Through these programmes we seek to make a lasting impact on individuals and communities most in need.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Creating Sustainable Futures with World Food Programme (WFP)\n\nIn 2020, we were delighted to see the World Food Programme's work recognised with the award of the Nobel Peace Prize for its efforts to combat hunger. Since 2017, we have been partnering with WFP on Project Leche in Honduras, leveraging Kerry's dairy heritage and nutritional capabilities to assist smallholder farmers with milk production, ensuring more sustainable dairy products are included in WFP's Homegrown School Meals programme.\n\nOur 2020 impact report highlights some key community achievements that Project Leche helped contribute to:\n\n- \u00b7 Milk production levels doubled on project farms\n- \u00b7 7,600 children in 178 schools benefitted from nutritionally enhanced meals\n- \u00b7 Improvement in physical growth and a reduction in child stunting of 18.5%\n- \u00b7 Lower rates of wasting among schoolchildren down from 8.1% to 1.5%, with no children presenting severe wasting by end of project.\n\nTo build on the positive outcomes of this programme, in 2020 we extended our partnership with WFP and commenced a new project in Burundi.\n\nThe goal of this joint programme, Project Amata (which means 'milk' in Kirundi), is to contribute to the improvement of food security and nutrition through strengthening of the milk value chain across the Gitega province and beyond in Burundi.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nChildren in 178 schools benefitted from nutritionally enhanced meals\n\nMilk production levels doubled on project farms\n\n7,600\n\nx2",

We know too that food and packaging waste is having an impact on the environment around us as plastic finds its way into waterways and oceans, impacting on water quality and marine life.\n\nThrough the Beyond the Horizon strategy, we are building on our achievements to date to address the key environmental impact areas across our business and value chains. The Group's Environmental Policy outlines Kerry's commitment to carrying out activities in a responsible manner, complying with all applicable legislation, implementing good environmental practice and continuously improving our performance. To achieve these aims, we have set environmental targets across our facilities, and dedicated site colleagues, working with global specialists to identify and implement improvement projects across all regions. In some target areas we will accelerate progress more quickly while other improvements will come through multi-year capital investment. We continue to pursue independent certification of best practice under ISO 14001 and key energy users are accredited under ISO 50001. Kerry also has a comprehensive environmental monitoring and reporting framework in place across all sites and performance is reviewed by our operations teams and the Global Sustainability Council on an ongoing basis.\n\nAs the industry's innovation partner of choice, we will also continue working with our suppliers and customers, amplifying our impact across our operations and supply chains, sourcing more sustainable raw materials and ingredients and creating more sustainable solutions, allowing our customers to reduce their footprint and in turn create products that provide more sustainable nutrition to consumers.\n\n## Taking Action on Climate Change\n\n[GRI 305: Emissions 2016, 305-1, 305-2, 305-4]\n\nWith increasing focus on the impacts of climate change, there is an accelerating emphasis on a global transition to a low-carbon economy. In 2020, we saw further evidence of this momentum, including increasingly ambitious national and corporate commitments. At Kerry, we generate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions directly through the operation of our facilities (Scope 1), indirectly through the energy we purchase (Scope 2) and other activities such as the production of our raw materials by our suppliers (Scope 3). These emissions contribute to global climate change and the associated impacts on the environment and society. We understand that climate change presents both risks and opportunities for our business and we are progressively integrating the recommendations of the Taskforce on Climate related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) in both our climate strategy and our reporting.",

        "page_content": "## Summary Approach to Aligning with TCFD Guidance\n\n## Governance\n\nThe Group's Sustainability Council is the key governance body, defining Kerry's strategy on climate change and its integration within broader strategic decision making (page 50). As a supporting structure to the Council, there is a dedicated work stream on climate, led by the Chief Operating Officer where performance and programmes for achievement of our climate goals are kept under ongoing review. Our carbon performance is also reported internally to the Executive team alongside financial metrics and the climate data in this review is verified and assured by an independent third party. For more details, see page 48.\n\n## Strategy\n\nOur climate strategy is focused on mitigating risks for our business and strengthening our resilience to climate-related impacts. Over the last decade, we have made significant progress reducing our Scope 1 and 2 emissions. We achieved this through a sustained focus on more carbon efficient production, investing in energy efficiency and switching to lower-carbon fuels. We will continue with these targeted programmes, together with broader communication and engagement plans to drive further action on this key theme and looking for innovation that can support a step change in our Scope 1. On Scope 2, we have made a commitment to switch to 100% renewable electricity across our entire operations by 2025.\n\nTo tackle our Scope 3 emissions, we will work with our suppliers to lower the carbon footprint of the raw materials we use. As we source thousands of raw materials globally, we do not underestimate the challenge associated with achieving this target. However, we have experience of working with suppliers on climate mitigation. As an example, we will introduce an innovative rewards programme for milk suppliers in 2021 to incentivise further emissions reduction at farm level.\n\nAt product level, we have undertaken an assessment of our portfolio to understand its contribution to our overall footprint and accelerate our response to market risks and opportunities. We continue to grow the revenue contribution of lower carbon products, particularly plant protein. Kerry can play a critical role as an enabler of sustainable nutrition for consumers and we continue to integrate sustainability criteria, including climate considerations, within our innovation and product development process. Across our business, we already have a range of technologies that can deliver significant carbon reductions for our customers, including CleanSmoke\u2122, Tastesense\u2122 and our leading portfolio of natural preservation technologies.\n\n## Climate Related Risks and Opportunities\n\nThe assessment of climate related risk is fully integrated into Kerry's enterprise risk management (ERM) framework and processes, which identify, assess, monitor and report on our organisation's risks (page 71). Potentially significant physical and transition climate-related risks and opportunities are outlined below and these will be further tested through scenario analysis.\n\n| Risk Description                                                                                                                                                                                | Potential Impact                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Mitigation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Physical risks resulting  from climate change can  be event driven (acute) or  longer-term shifts (chronic)  in climate patterns.                                                               | Extreme weather events have the potential to impact  on sites of production and/or on processing and  distribution infrastructure.

Significant waste impacts can occur at each stage of the value chain, from the production of agricultural raw materials, to their processing and the finished food and beverage products.\n\nTo address these impacts, our industry needs to transition away from the traditional linear model of take-make-dispose to a more circular approach where resources are kept in productive use for longer. Under the Beyond the Horizon strategy, we have placed our focus on the most material waste aspects within our operations, food waste and plastic packaging, while continuing to retain a focus on our overall waste intensity.\n\n## 2020 Waste Recovery\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2020 Waste by Destination\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLandfill volumes include waste sent for incineration without energy recovery.\n\n10%\n\nachieved\n\nWe aim to achieve zero waste to landfill, diverting resources and keeping materials in use for longer. In keeping with our unique from-food-for-food heritage and our commitment to creating natural solutions, more than 99% of the by-product we generate is nonhazardous and can be put to other productive uses in support of a more circular bioeconomy. In 2020, 92% of our waste volumes were diverted from landfill and we continue to implement programmes that will support us to realise our target. 50% Target\n\n## 92%\n\nOf our waste volumes were diverted from landfill in 2020.\n\n## Halving Food Loss and Waste\n\nAs the world struggles to feed 10 billion people sustainably by 2050, estimated annual food loss and waste is projected to reach more than 2 billion tonnes by 2030 1 . According to the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) of the UN, one third of all food produced is lost or wasted, representing valuable resources and calories that ultimately do not provide any nutritional benefit. In addition to the economic loss, the contribution to environmental impact is significant, as evidenced by the associated GHG footprint, which represents 8% of total global emissions.\n\nTo tackle this issue, we have been working to reduce food waste from our operations as part of our broader efforts on waste. In 2020, we announced our commitment to halving food loss and waste across our operations by 2030. Given the diverse nature of our portfolio, the achievement of this goal involves working across sites to understand the key drivers of food waste locally and implementing the most appropriate actions to deliver on our targets. In 2020, we have performed well versus our goal with a 10% reduction versus our baseline. This has been driven by a focus primarily on food waste reduction and diversion strategies across sites. For example, in a pilot initiative across sites in the UK, teams have been engaging with customers to look at how working collaboratively on order fulfilment can meet their needs and prevent the creation of excess product that could end up as waste. Customer feedback from this initiative has been extremely positive and has supported our sites towards achievement of their targets. This approach will be expanded upon in 2021.

        "page_content": "## Supporting Our Customers\n\nWhile tackling food waste across our operations is vitally important, there are substantial opportunities for Kerry to impact on the food waste elsewhere in the value chain, particularly downstream. In developed markets, the proportion of total food lost or wasted at the consumer level can be more than 60%. As consumers increasingly demand natural, clean label products that do not contain artificial preservatives, manufacturers are challenged to meet these evolving consumer demands, while maintaining or improving shelf life. With the industry's largest portfolio of clean label preservation technologies, Kerry is ideally placed to support our customers in meeting these requirements. For more on how we are helping customers reduce food waste see kerry.com/insights.\n\n## Tackling Plastic Waste\n\nOf the 78 million tonnes of plastic produced annually, more than 70% ends up in landfill or finds its way into the natural environment, including our waterways and oceans 2 .\n\nAt Kerry, we fully support efforts to promote a more circular approach to plastics and we have committed to making all our plastic packaging reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2025.\n\nSince 2018, our Consumer Foods division has been leading our efforts to meet growing customer, consumer and regulatory demand for more sustainable packaging alternatives. This is a priority focus area, as the packaging we use has a critical contribution in maintaining product integrity and safety and in minimising food waste. As we innovate, we are finding new ways to overcome both the food safety and the environmental challenges. We have made very significant progress against our goals and today 85% of the packaging we use across our branded and private label consumer products is recyclable. We continue to look at ways to address the remaining volumes, with plans already in place for how we can tackle some of the more challenging plastic materials and packaging formats.\n\n## 85%\n\n## We have committed to making all our plastic packaging reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2025.\n\n## Innovating with New Packaging Formats\n\nIn addition to product packaging we are also examining other areas where more sustainable materials can be introduced across our business. In 2020, we introduced our sustainable sample box packaging to replace polystyrene boxes. These new boxes contain 100% FSC certified, recycled cardboard and the insulation is made using natural sheep's wool.\n\nWithin our B2B operations, much of the plastic packaging we use is sent to organisations who, like Kerry, have strong waste management programmes in place and commitments in respect of environmental management. However, we recognise that we can support their ambitions on waste reduction and plastic through our choice of packaging materials. We use sustainable packaging where possible, favouring reusable, returnable, or certified paper-based material. We aim to meet our 2025 commitments for all plastic packaging to be reusable, recyclable or compostable and to reduce our use of virgin plastic across the Group by 25% over the same period.\n\n## Protecting Water Resources\n\n[GRI 303: Water and Effluents 2018, 303-3a]\n\nThe fundamental importance of water means that access is internationally recognised as a basic human right, however, water availability is becoming less secure and predictable. More than two billion people live in countries experiencing high water stress and this situation will likely worsen as demand and the effects of climate change intensify 3 . Higher temperatures and more extreme weather conditions will affect availability and distribution, increasing scarcity in some regions while causing flooding in others.\n\nAt Kerry, water is vital to our operations, the production of our raw materials, and in some instances, the use of our products. Given the growing demand for fresh water, it is essential that we act to protect water sources and ensure equitable access to this resource for all users. Kerry's approach to water stewardship continues to evolve and building on our progress to date, we aim to improve water efficiency across our operations by a further 15% by 2025, while ensuring we protect water quality and broader access for communities where we operate.\n\nOf the packaging we use across our branded and private label consumer products is recyclable.\n\n- 2 www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/explore/plastics-and-the-circular-economy",

Given the uneven distribution of water resources, some of our locations are potentially more vulnerable to physical water risk. Using the World Resources Institute's Aqueduct Tool, we identified 8 priority sites where we continue to monitor our footprint closely. In 2020, efficiency across these sites continued to significantly exceed that for the Group and is 28% lower versus our base year. However, we did see a marginal increase versus 2019, as a result of COVID-19. m 3 /tonne 2017 Baseline\n\nAs part of our Beyond the Horizon strategy, we have commenced a revised water risk assessment across all sites, looking at water consumption and related risks more broadly and we expect to update our priority sites in 2021, as a result of this review. 5 6\n\n## 2020 Water Withdrawal by Source (Megalitres)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Water Intensity\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNotes:\n\n7\n\nOur target for water is a relative measure of metres cubed (m 3 ) divided by tonnes of finished product produced. 1%\n\nOur data reflects water use across our manufacturing facilities and is a like for like performance versus our base year.\n\nWe also understand that water discharges from our sites can have an impact on local water quality and make every effort to ensure we protect local water sources.

As we have expanded our responsible sourcing goals (see page 69), we have assessed priority categories against a range of criteria, including water risk. As we work to achieve our goals, we will partner with suppliers on key aspects, including water, for relevant categories within our supply chain. In some instances, this will focus on areas of water scarcity while in others the focus may be on quality and access. 7\n\n## Protecting Water Quality\n\nIn Ireland, Kerry is engaging with its milk suppliers to help contribute towards improvements in water quality and to enhance habitats surrounding water courses. Our dedicated resources on water work directly with farmers, helping them to implement farm management practices and to assess infrastructure investments which will ensure water courses and aquatic environments are protected from potential sources of pollution. This includes the trialing of innovative new technology that provides real time data and creation of new decision support tools to assist with better and more timely decision making on farms.\n\n## Reducing Water Consumption for Customers\n\nKerry's CleanSmoke\u2122 technology removes many of the harmful substances derived through conventional smoking. As well as these health benefits, the process is more efficient and consistent, resulting in significantly lower carbon emissions and lower water consumption. In fact, CleanSmoke\u2122 can help processors reduce their water consumption by up to 88% versus conventional smoking methods.\n\n21,095\n\nWithdrawals\n\nTotal Water\n\nTotal Water\n\nWithdrawals\n\nMunicipal Water",

The ROC is comprised of senior leadership, and is chaired by the CFO, who maintain the Group risk register and provide regular updates on changes in the principal or emerging risks to the Audit Committee and the Board.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Executive Management\n\nExecutive management are responsible for the effective operation of internal controls designed to manage and mitigate the principal risks and uncertainties. The 3LOD model ensures accountability for risk management is embedded into processes and procedures. Key management committees support risk management including the Group Finance Committee, the ICT Security Steering Committee, the Sustainability Council, and the Quality, Safety, Health & Environmental Leadership Team.\n\n## 1st LINE OF DEFENCE:\n\nOperational Management are responsible for risk identification, managing the internal control environment and monitoring changes in the risk profile of Kerry.\n\n## 2nd LINE OF DEFENCE:\n\nGroup functional teams ensure first line is operating as designed, manage performance reviews, internal control verifications, facilitate risk assessments. Includes Quality, Health & Safety, Information & Cyber Security, Legal and Financial Control functions.\n\n## Enterprise Risk Management Process\n\nOur risk assessment process incorporates a groupwide top down and bottom up evaluation to determine the likelihood of occurrence and potential impact of risks on the Group at a residual level. Input is obtained from senior business and functional management through a series of workshops, one-to-one interviews and surveys which are consolidated to produce the Group Risk Register. Our risk universe forms the basis of conversations and additional new and emerging risks are added, as appropriate, when identified. A standard risk scoring methodology has been devised to provide context and ensure consistency in reporting and evaluation of risks.\n\nThe output from this process is consolidated to determine the principal risks and uncertainties for the Group. Executive Management and the ROC review and validate these risks providing further input where necessary before submission to the Audit Committee and Board for final consideration and approval.\n\nDuring the year we continued to improve our risk management processes initiating a programme of work to enhance our approach to defining risk appetite.\n\n## 3rd LINE OF DEFENCE:\n\nGroup Internal Audit function with other external assurance providers perform reviews which give independent assurance over the operation of the internal control framework, risk management systems and governance processes.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "We engaged with Executive Management, the ROC, the Audit Committee and external subject matter experts to develop a methodology which encompassed a five-point scale ranging from 'Risk Averse' to 'Risk Seeking'. Each of our principal risks was assigned a score on this scale in addition to the articulation of a risk appetite statement. The Audit Committee and Board approved the risk appetite for each of our principal risks and in 2021 we plan to further enhance this reporting. For risks which may negatively impact our brand or reputation such as food safety and employee health & safety the Group is risk averse, but is more risk seeking and willing to pursue potential opportunities in relation to risks which will contribute towards our growth goals such as developing market expansion, acquisitions or capital investments.\n\nEach principal risk is assigned an executive owner who is responsible for ensuring mitigating actions are sufficient to bring risks to within the agreed appetite and the 3LOD model ensures that these mitigations and internal controls are embedded and operate effectively throughout the organisation.\n\nThe annual Board and the Audit Committee agendas include a series of updates from risk owners in relation to the Group's principal risks. These updates include the history of the risk to date, key mitigating actions and controls, an outline of the residual risk and any future actions planned to address control weaknesses. During 2020, the Board and Audit Committee received updates relating to Business Acquisition and Divestiture, Taxation, Intellectual Property Management, Information Security and Cybercrime, Food Safety & Quality and Health & Safety risks as well as regular updates on Brexit and COVID-19.\n\nThe Audit Committee receive regular updates on risk management and internal control effectiveness from the Head of Internal Audit (HIA) along with agreed mitigating actions to resolve any weaknesses identified. The Audit Committee also received a report from the HIA and management following a review of the Group's second line of defence structures. This report identified some opportunities to strengthen the Group's risk management governance framework and work on these opportunities was initiated in 2020 and will continue to be a focus for the Group in 2021.\n\nThe Audit Committee and Board formally approved the principal risks and risk appetite and have confirmed in the Corporate Governance Report on page 106 that a robust assessment of the Group's principal and emerging risks was completed including those risks that could threaten the business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity of the Group.\n\n## Principal Risks and Uncertainties\n\nThe table on pages 76-82 describes the principal risks and uncertainties, which the Board have determined could impact the achievement of strategic objectives and have been identified through the risk assessment process, as well as the mitigating actions in place and an update on any change in the profile of each risk during the year. Additionally, each risk has been linked to the Group's strategies for growth and margin expansion as outlined in the Strategic Report on pages 26-28.\n\nThis table presents the Board's view of the Group's principal risks and uncertainties and is not an exhaustive list of all the risks which may impact the Group. There are additional risks which are not yet considered material, or which are not yet known to the Board, which could become significant in the future. Likewise, some of the current risks may reduce in importance as management actions are implemented or changes in the operating environment occur. The Board will continue to monitor risk in the context of growth through geographic expansion and ongoing acquisitions, as well as other changes in the external environment, which may create future risks.\n\n## Changes to Our Principal Risks\n\nThe Group operates in a dynamic environment and during the risk assessment process the Board consider if there are new risks which have the potential to disrupt, or if there are risks that no longer materially impact our ability to achieve our strategic objectives. The Board acknowledges that risks do not exist in isolation and that the crystallisation of one risk may have an intensification effect on other potential risks, significantly impacting the Group.\n\nDuring 2020, the significant disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic increased the potential impact of many risks, including health & safety, ICT and cybersecurity, margin management and particularly our supply chain operations. As a result, Operational and Supply Chain Continuity risk has been included as a principal risk, recognising the importance of maintaining consistent and high quality supply and service to our customers.\n\nGiven the increasing focus on the impacts of social responsibility and climate change combined with the accelerating emphasis on a global transition to a lowcarbon economy, sustainability/environmental risk, which was previously an emerging risk, has now been deemed a principal risk.\n\nDuring 2020, significant work was completed to ensure the Group was prepared for the new trading relationship between the EU and the UK. Following the conclusion of the EU-UK Trade and Co-operation Agreement, Brexit is no longer considered as a standalone principal risk for the Group and any ongoing issues with regard to the movement of goods are considered as part of either Geopolitical/Developing Markets risk or Operational and Supply Chain Continuity risk.",

        "page_content": "The KerryConnect project, to roll out a common ICT solution and standard ways of working groupwide, has now been deployed to 84% of our manufacturing locations globally and remains on target to be substantially complete by the end of 2021. On the basis of this, it is no longer considered a principal risk for the Group. However, given the materiality of the sites within the 2021 deployment schedule, the existing project governance frameworks and processes will be maintained until the project is fully complete.\n\n## Emerging Risks\n\nWe define emerging risks as those that do not currently have a significant impact on the achievement of strategic objectives but may have a disruptive impact in the future. Emerging risks are considered as part of the risk assessment process and are identified through horizon scanning, continual dialogue with the business and keeping abreast of market and industry changes.\n\nFollowing the annual risk assessment a number of risks are being monitored which could potentially impact the Group in the future, including: changes to the working model as result of the COVID-19 pandemic, ensuring a diverse and inclusive workforce, keeping pace with digital advancements and disruption to availability of water in water-stressed areas.\n\n## Management of Climate Related Risks\n\nWith our global presence and leadership position within the food and beverage industry, we are very aware of the increased global focus on the impacts of climate change and the accelerating emphasis being placed on transitioning to a low-carbon economy. We are very clear on the risks and opportunities presented by climate change and take a proactive approach to understanding the implications across our entire business portfolio.\n\nThe potential risk presented by climate change is recognised within our risk universe and was considered as part of our risk assessment process. The Board, in conjunction with the Governance, Nomination and Sustainability Committee, has oversight of our sustainability strategy, including our response to climate related risks, while Kerry's Sustainability Council is responsible for the ongoing achievement of specific climate related goals. Our climate strategy is focused on mitigating climate risks for our business and strengthening our resilience to climate related impacts. During 2020, the Board supported and approved the Group's sustainability strategy, Beyond the Horizon , with climate related commitments to achieve net zero emissions across our operations before 2050 and a Science Based Target for carbon that includes a 33% reduction in absolute greenhouse gas emissions from our operations (Scope 1 and 2) by 2030.\n\nRead More\n\nFind our Beyond the Horizon strategy at www.kerry.com/ sustainability\n\nWe acknowledge and support the objectives of the Task Force for Climate Related Financial Disclosure (TCFD) and are committed to aligning our reporting with its recommendations. For more see our Sustainability Review on pages 46-70 where key climate related risks and opportunities are discussed in more detail.\n\n## Our Response to COVID-19\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic presented significant challenges for our business and has impacted our performance. We do not consider COVID-19 as just one individual risk but rather the amplifying effect it has had on a number of the Group's principal risks as well as highlighting the interdependencies that exist between many risks. Since February 2020, when the potential impact of the pandemic became apparent, the Board and Audit Committee have provided critical support and guidance to Executive Management.\n\nAt an early stage, the Group's crisis management protocols were invoked, and a Global COVID-19 Taskforce comprising of senior functional leadership and led by the Global Chief Operating Officer was established. This team was supported by local management teams in each of our regions. These teams led the overall Group response and through informed and timely decision making ensured that we were proactive in addressing the challenges which were presented. Learnings were shared across all regions and best in class protocols were implemented groupwide to ensure a consistent and robust control environment remained intact. The Chief Financial Officer led the Group's response to minimise the financial impact of lower volumes and higher costs as well as overseeing initiatives to further strengthen the liquidity position of the Group. Where required, additional mitigating actions were implemented to manage increased risk in other areas, including appropriate measures to ensure the protection of employees and increased cybersecurity awareness campaigns to respond to the heightened threats.\n\nAt an early stage, the Group's crisis management protocols were invoked, and a Global COVID-19 Taskforce comprising of senior functional leadership and led by the Global Chief Operating Officer was established.",

We have prioritised protecting the safety and wellbeing of our people at all times, along with ensuring continuity of service to our customers and supporting the communities in which we operate.\n\n## Our People: safeguarding their safety and wellbeing\n\nKerry implemented best in class safety protocols to ensure the health and wellbeing of our people has been prioritised at all times including segregation and zoning, use of appropriate personal protective equipment, increased sanitisation measures and employee and visitor screening. Where possible remote working was encouraged, and the rollout of new software was fast-tracked to enhance collaboration and connectivity. Regular, consistent and transparent communication helped to minimise uncertainty and kept our people informed and supported. As well as the global employee assistance programme, wellbeing toolkits and additional training were made available to support employees through these challenging times. A full review of sick pay schemes was undertaken to ensure there was no unnecessary impact on our employees as a result of COVID-19 related absences.\n\nWe have prioritised protecting the safety and wellbeing of our people at all times, along with ensuring continuity of service to our customers and supporting the communities in which we operate.\n\n## Our Customers: ensuring continuity of supply and innovation\n\nThe Group has remained focused on ensuring continuity of supply for its customers as well as supporting and partnering with them as they navigate the disruption caused by the crisis. Our manufacturing and supply chain teams have responded with agility to dramatic shifts in demand patterns. In response to the changes in the marketplace, we collaborated with customers sharing expertise and insights on emerging consumer trends. To maintain customer engagement and collaboration on innovation projects, technology was leveraged to conduct commercial meetings and virtual product trials.\n\n## Our Community: supporting our local communities\n\nWhen global supply was impacted, we shifted production to making hand sanitiser in a number of our facilities. Additionally, we donated and continue to donate PPE and sanitiser to front-line staff through our MyCommunity initiative and pledged 26,000 volunteer days and a \u20ac1 million fund to support local community initiatives.\n\nAs the Group navigates the ongoing challenges of the disruptive environment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, prioritising the health and wellbeing of our people will continue to remain our number one priority. The agility and adaptability of our people supported by a dedicated management team allows us to continue delivering innovative solutions, sustaining global food supply chains and being our customers co-creation partner of choice.",

        "page_content": "## GOING CONCERN AND VIABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe Board, taking into consideration the Group's principal risks and uncertainties, including emerging risks, assessed the going concern and long-term viability of the Group in line with the requirements of the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code and the Irish Annex. Its conclusions on these assessments are outlined below.\n\n## Going Concern\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nThe Directors considered the Group's business activities and how it generates value, together with the main trends and factors likely to affect future development, business performance and position of the Group, including the impact of the current COVID-19 pandemic, as described in the Business Reviews on pages 40-45. The Group's 2021 budget was reviewed and approved at the December Board meeting. The Directors have also examined the financial position of the Group, including cash flows, liquidity position, borrowing facilities, financial instruments and financial risk management, as described on pages 32-39 and additionally as described in note 23 to the financial statements. Due to the uncertainty of the ongoing duration and impact of the pandemic on mobility restrictions in different countries around the world, additional stressed scenarios, reflecting different levels and timing of the recovery, have been considered. In these scenarios, the Group has sufficient resources and liquidity headroom. There are no material uncertainties that cast a significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern over a period of at least 12 months.\n\nAs a result of this review, the Directors report that they have satisfied themselves and consider it appropriate that the Group and the Company is a going concern, having adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and have not identified any material uncertainties that cast a significant doubt on the Group's and the Company's ability to continue as a going concern over a period of at least 12 months.\n\n## Viability Assessment Assessment of Prospects\n\nIn line with Provision 31 of the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code, the Directors have carried out a rigorous review of the prospects of the Group over the medium term. In assessing the prospects of the Group and its ability to meet its liabilities as they fall due, the Board has taken account of the Group's medium term strategic planning cycle, capital investment plans, the business model, its diverse portfolio and the innovation pipeline. The Directors have also considered the Group's strong cash generation and debt maturity profile in addition to the principal risks and uncertainties detailed on pages 73-82. This included a consideration of the COVID-19 pandemic and the range of outcomes that the pandemic could have on the prospects of the Group. The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are outlined in the financial review on pages 32-39.\n\n## Assessment of Viability\n\nAlthough the Group's strategic planning cycle covers a period of five years, the Board considers that three years is the most appropriate period to assess the longer-term viability of the Group as current capital expenditure plans, commercial arrangements and financial projections are considered to be more reliable and robust over this period.\n\nThe Board has considered how the occurrence of one or more of the Group's principal risks and uncertainties could materially impact the Group's business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity by assessing the impact of these risks in severe but plausible scenarios.\n\nWhile each of the principal risks and uncertainties could have an impact on the Group's performance, a significant food quality failure, an acquisition not delivering expected returns or a failure to achieve targeted revenue or margins were considered most likely to threaten the Group's long-term viability. In addition, the projected prolonged impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was considered as a risk for the Group.\n\nThree scenarios were stress tested both individually and in combination to assess their potential impact on the Group's solvency, liquidity and cash flow. The projected impact of COVID-19 was considered both in the base case and in the stressed scenarios. This analysis indicated that, notwithstanding the current global pandemic, significant liquidity headroom existed in all scenarios tested. In addition, the Board considers that the diverse nature of the Group's geographies, markets, customer base, and product portfolio provide significant mitigation against the impact of a serious business interruption.\n\n## Viability Statement\n\nBased on their assessment of prospects and viability, the Directors have concluded that they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three year period of the assessment.",

In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are required to:\n\n- -  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;\n- -  state that the financial statements comply with IFRS and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and\n- -  make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;\n- -  prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group will continue in business.\n\nThe Directors are responsible for ensuring that the Company keeps adequate accounting records which correctly explain and record the transactions of the Company, enabling at any time the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company to be determined with reasonable accuracy and ensuring that the financial statements are prepared in accordance with IFRSs and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, comply with the Companies Act 2014 and as regards to the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and enable the financial statements to be audited.\n\nThe Directors are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Group's website www.kerrygroup.com. Irish legislation governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.\n\nIn accordance with the Transparency (Directive 2004/109/EC) Regulations 2007 and the Transparency Rules of the Central Bank of Ireland, the Directors are required to include a management report containing a fair review of the business and a description of the principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group.

On behalf of the Board I can confirm that for the year under review the Group has complied with all relevant Provisions of the Code other than certain remuneration related Provisions which required structural changes to the existing Remuneration Policy. The required changes have been incorporated into a new Remuneration Policy that will be put to an advisory vote at the 2021 AGM. Further details are outlined in the Remuneration Committee Report on pages 120-122.\n\nFollowing the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic, additional Board meetings were held, as the Board focused on the impact of the pandemic and oversaw the Group's response by providing critical guidance and support to Executive Management. Physical Board meetings became impossible due to the imposition of COVID-19 related restrictions with all Board meetings held via video conference from April onwards.\n\nThe Board sets the tone and shared values for the way in which the Group operates and recognises the importance of culture to the success of the business model. During 2020, the Board continued to assess and monitor the Group's culture to ensure that it is aligned with the Group's strategy and values and is adequately embedded across the Group.\n\nAs a Board, we recognise the benefits of understanding the views of all our stakeholders and we ensure that their interests are regarded in Board discussions and in our decision making. Details of stakeholder engagement activities during the year, including the work of the designated workforce engagement Director, are outlined on pages 98-101.\n\nThe Board, in conjunction with the Governance, Nomination and Sustainability Committee, ensures that there are robust plans in place to facilitate Board, executive and senior management succession. During 2020, the Board undertook a formal process to recruit two new non-Executive Directors both of whom bring skills and experience that will strengthen the Board. Details of the non-Executive Director and Committee changes that occurred during the year, are set out in the Governance, Nomination and Sustainability Committee Report on page 116.\n\nI will have served nine years as a Director, including less than three years as Chairman, on 19 February 2021. The Governance, Nomination and Sustainability Committee is aware of the Provisions of the Code in respect of Chairman tenure and is undertaking a formal succession process which is being led by Ms. Joan Garahy as Senior Independent Director. The Board has recommended that I continue as Chairman until the AGM in 2022, to allow appropriate time to identify a successor and to enable an orderly succession to the role.\n\nThe Board recognises its role in providing guidance and strategic oversight to the Group in implementing its 2030 sustainability strategy, Beyond the Horizon which was officially launched in October 2020. Following the launch, the Board expanded the role of the Nomination Committee to reflect its additional responsibilities of sustainability oversight and approved updated Terms of Reference. The Nomination Committee was renamed the Governance, Nomination and Sustainability Committee.\n\nDiversity at Board level has been a focus for the Governance, Nomination and Sustainability Committee for a number of years and also continues to be a key factor when considering Board refreshment. During 2020, the Governance, Nomination and Sustainability Committee also monitored the progress made against the diversity targets at senior management level to ensure the appropriate level of skills and diversity exists to support the delivery of the Group's strategy and financial targets. Improving and monitoring diversity beyond gender and below Board level will continue to be a key area of focus for the Board and the Executive Management in 2021.\n\nEach year the Board undertakes a formal evaluation of its effectiveness and that of its Committees. In 2020, this was an internal selfassessment which was conducted by the Chairman and the Senior Independent Director. The evaluation concluded that the Board and its Committees are performing effectively. Details of the process and the resulting actions from this review are outlined on page 105.\n\nDetails of the Group's activities and the operations of the Board, contained in the following report, outline the manner in which the Group has achieved compliance with the Code through the activities and operations of the Board and its Committees during the year.\n\nPhilip Toomey Chairman of the Board\n\n<!-- image -->",

A COVID-19 Taskforce comprising of key executives, supported by local management teams, co-ordinated the Group's response and were responsible for approving and directing the actions required to help mitigate the many challenges presented by the pandemic. The Board was provided with regular updates on progress, in relation to the health & safety of employees, support for customers and communities, continuity of supply both from suppliers and to customers, and the Group's financial and operational performance.\n\nDetails of the COVID-19 Taskforce and the Group's response to the risks posed by the pandemic are outlined in the Risk Management Report on pages 74-75.\n\nThe Board has a formal schedule of matters specifically reserved to it for decision as noted below and has delegated other responsibilities to management for dayto-day operations within the context of the Kerry Group Governance Framework as outlined above.\n\n## Schedule of Matters Reserved for the Board\n\n- -  appointments to the Board;\n- -  ensuring compliance with corporate governance, legal, statutory and regulatory requirements;\n- -  approval of the overall Group strategic and operating plans;\n- -  monitoring and reviewing risk management and internal control systems;\n- -  monitoring and assessing culture;\n- -  reviewing and assessing the adequacy of the Group's whistleblowing arrangements;\n- -  approval of acquisitions and divestitures;\n- -  approval of significant capital expenditure;\n- -  approval of Treasury policy including changes to the Group's capital structure;\n- -  approval of dividend policy and dividends;\n- -  approval of annual budgets;\n- -  approval of preliminary results, interim management statements and interim financial statements;\n- -  assessment of the long-term viability of the Group and the going concern assumption; and\n- -  the preparation of, and confirmation that, the annual report and financial statements present a fair, balanced and understandable assessment of the Company's position, performance and prospects.",

        "page_content": "## Information Flow\n\nThe Chairman ensures that all Directors have full and timely access to such information as they require to discharge their responsibilities fully and effectively. Board papers are issued to each Director at least one week in advance of Board meetings and include the meeting agenda, minutes of the previous Board meeting and all papers relevant to the agenda. The Chairman, in conjunction with the Company Secretary, has primary responsibility for setting the agenda for each meeting. All Directors continually receive comprehensive reports and documentation on all matters for which they have responsibility to allow them to fully complete their duties as a Director. All Directors participate in discussing strategy, trading updates, financial performance, significant risks and operational activities in addition to the Group's purpose, vision, values and culture. Board meetings are of sufficient duration to ensure that all agenda items and any other material non-agenda items that may arise are adequately addressed. In addition to formal meetings, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer maintain regular contact with all Directors. The Chairman holds informal meetings or calls with nonExecutive Directors without the Executive Directors to discuss issues affecting the Group.\n\nAll directors have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary, who is responsible for advising the Board on all governance matters. In accordance with an agreed procedure, in the furtherance of their duties, each Director has the authority to engage independent professional advice at the Company's expense.\n\n## Strategy\n\nDuring 2020, as part of the annual strategy review, the Board received and considered presentations from Executive Directors on progress to date implementing the strategies for volume growth, margin expansion and return on investment that underpin the Group's five year plan and its associated financial targets.\n\nThe Board approved the Group's sustainability strategy Beyond the Horizon in October 2020 which underpins the Group's growth strategy. Presentations were also received from the Company's advisors on matters such as the mergers and acquisitions landscape, the 'New Normal' post COVID-19, corporate defence and shareholder activism throughout the year. Through these reviews and ongoing discussions on strategy the Board is confident that Kerry's strategic priorities for growth will continue to be the key drivers of organic growth and acquisition investment in the future.\n\nThe Board ensures that the decisions it makes are aligned with the achievement of the Group's strategy and are made in the long-term interest of the Group and its stakeholders. This is particularly the case when deciding how to prioritise the allocation of resources (human and financial capital) across competing research and development activities, acquisition opportunities and major capital expenditure projects.\n\nDuring the year, the Board also reviewed the business model and how it is executed. The Board is satisfied that the business model is both sustainable in the long-term and optimally structured to enable delivery of the Group's strategy. Details of the Group's strategy are outlined in Strategy and Financial Targets on pages 26-28.\n\n## Purpose, Values and Culture\n\nAs the world leader in taste and nutrition, our Purpose Inspiring Food, Nourishing Life was approved by the Board in 2019.\n\nThe Group's purpose is guided by the Group's new Vision to be our customers' most valued partner, creating a world of sustainable nutrition. The Board is satisfied that the strategies for the Taste & Nutrition and Consumer Foods businesses are aligned to the Group's Purpose which is guided by our Values of Courage, Ownership, Inclusiveness, Open-mindedness and Enterprising Spirit. The Board is also led by the Group's Purpose during its discussions and when making decisions on the matters that are reserved for its consideration. Further details of the Group's purpose and values are outlined on pages 4-5.\n\nThe Group's culture is based on a common understanding of our values, underpinned by our practices of Safety First, Quality Always and a robust risk management framework consisting of policies and procedures, including a Code of Conduct which defines business conduct standards for anyone working for, or on behalf of the Group.\n\nThe Board recognises the importance of its role in setting the tone of Kerry's culture and embedding it throughout the Group. In addition to the Board, the executives have responsibility to ensure that the policies and behaviours set at Board level are effectively communicated and implemented throughout the Group. The Kerry Way framework articulates the Group's purpose and values and the MyKerry intranet site provides a platform for employees to access the Group's policies.\n\nThe Board monitors and assesses the culture of the Group through a number of mechanisms including compliance with Group policies, internal audit, formal and informal channels for employees to raise concerns including the Leader Pulse Check, OurVoice employee engagement survey and the Group's whistleblowing arrangement and feedback from the designated workforce engagement Director. If the Board is concerned or dissatisfied with any behaviors or actions, it seeks assurance from the executives that corrective action is being taken.",

Engagement with stakeholders enables better informed decision making, thereby increasing the likelihood of long-term successful outcomes. Similarly, the Board also recognises the need to maintain a reputation for high standards of business conduct in its actions and decisions. Following the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic by the World Health Organisation in early 2020, balancing the needs and expectations of our stakeholders has never been more important and challenging. Details of our stakeholder engagement are set out below:\n\n## Shareholders  Our Engagement\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nShareholders\n\nEmployees\n\nThe Board ensures it has an effective channel of communication with existing and potential shareholders. The Investor Relations team and Executive Management maintain ongoing engagement with the investment community, through a variety of different mediums including investor meetings and conferences, investor events, ongoing investor calls and correspondence. During 2020, meetings were held with over 800 investors and Kerry's management teams participated at 21 investor conferences. Kerry met investors in eight different cities and then engaged virtually from April onwards following the imposition of COVID-19 related restrictions.\n\nIn addition, a significant amount of published material including results releases, presentations, share price information and news releases are accessible to all shareholders on the Group's website www.kerrygroup.com.\n\nShareholder presentations are made at the time of release of the Group's full year and half year results and interim management statements, following which the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer provide the Board with an update on feedback received. Regular updates are provided by the Chief Financial Officer to the Board on matters raised by shareholders and analysts as well as updates on the composition of the Group's share register.\n\nThe Company's Annual General Meeting (AGM) provides an opportunity for the Directors to deliver presentations and to answer questions of shareholders, both institutional and private. Whilst this was not possible in 2020 due to COVID-19 related restrictions, all shareholders were able to exercise their right to vote through the appointment of a proxy. Shareholders were also invited to join and listen to the business of the meeting via webcast which was accessed through the Company's website. The Company also provided a facility for shareholders to submit questions by email or by post in advance of the AGM.\n\n## Material Matters\n\nMatters of importance to shareholders included the impact of COVID-19 on the Group's performance and outlook.

During October 2020, 86% of employees participated in the OurVoice employee engagement survey. Interim Leader Pulse Checks were also conducted in March and July with senior management. The leader led Kerry Way workshops, to embed the Group's purpose and refreshed values, which commenced in 2019 were completed in early 2020.

The Group's response to employees during the COVID-19 pandemic is outlined above and in the Sustainability Review on page 58.\n\n## Our Engagement\n\nKerry operates a proven customer-centric business model that enables us to work side by side with customers as their co-creation partner. The Group interacts with customers on a daily basis at multiple levels from dedicated relationship and account managers to tailored innovation forums. Community Customers and Consumers\n\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Group supported its customers by ensuring continuity of supply and helping them to innovate their product portfolios to meet changing consumer needs and preferences and the evolving operating environment. The Group engaged with its customers by introducing new innovative processes for virtual collaboration and via its dedicated COVID-19 web page. The Group also shared its COVID-19 safety playbook with customers to ensure their operations were not compromised. Suppliers Shareholders\n\nDuring 2020, the Group conducted a global customer satisfaction survey with its major customers and continued to engage with customers on the Group's sustainability strategy.\n\nFeedback from customer engagement activities was discussed at each Board meeting as part of the business updates provided by the Executive Directors. The Board also considers customer engagement matters as part of the overall Group sustainability strategy.\n\n## Material Matters\n\nMatters of importance included the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on, the end-to-end supply chain, changing consumer needs and preferences and the customers' ability to operate.\n\nOur customers are also responding to the acceleration of key trends in the food and beverage industry, with increased demand for health and immunity enhancement, plant protein options, and products addressing a diverse range of sustainability criteria.\n\n## Our Response\n\nThe Board approves the Group's significant investment in Research & Development activities and together with management ensures that this resource is focused on those projects that can best meet customers' needs and thereby enable the Group to achieve its strategic objectives in relation to revenue growth, margin expansion, return on investment and enabling food production in a more environmentally sustainable manner. During 2020, the Board approved investments in areas such as developing immunity enhancing products, expanding the Group's Radicle\u2122 portfolio of plant-based food ingredient solutions and developing innovative food delivery solutions. The Board also approved a number of acquisitions during the year which complement the Group's capabilities in areas such as proactive nutrition, taste and food protection solutions to meet the changing needs of customers and consumers. Further details are outlined in Our Business Model on pages 20-21, Strategy and Financial Targets on pages 26-28 and the Sustainability Review on pages 52-55.\n\nAs Kerry continues to meet the changing needs of both customers and consumers, the Board approved the 2030 sustainability strategy Beyond the Horizon along with a refreshed brand identity, reflecting the evolution of the business. This underpins Kerry's growth strategy as it continues to partner with its customers to create a world of sustainable nutrition.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Board ensures that material decisions, which could impact on stakeholder groups, are taken with due regard to their interests.\n\n## GOVERNANCE IN ACTION:\n\n## Designated Workforce Engagement Director - Activities and Feedback in 2020\n\nA plan for 2020 was developed by the Group Human Resources Team, in conjunction with the designated workforce engagement Director Mr. Tom Moran, to ensure he had the opportunity to engage with or visit each of the Group's regions, meet with a range of employees in their day to day settings and attend a variety of employee events. While some in person events were completed in the first quarter of 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the plan was revised and moved to a totally virtual plan from March 2020 onwards. Details of the employee engagement activities undertaken by Mr. Tom Moran during 2020 are outlined below.\n\n- -  visit to Kerry Foods manufacturing site in Coleraine, Northern Ireland;\n- -  participation in our International Women's Day event in Naas, Ireland;\n- -  participation in groupwide webinars hosted by the Chief Executive Officer;\n- -  participation in leadership team meetings in Europe and Russia and LATAM regions;\n- -  attendance at the virtual Kerry Global Leadership Forum. Further details are outlined on page 99;\n- -  attendance at a global Town Hall event hosted by the Research, Development and Application team, for over 1,000 employees globally;\n- -  1:1 briefings with key leaders showcasing career development, diversity, inclusion and belonging and community activities across the Group;\n- -  ongoing updates with key representatives from the Group Human Resources team to provide a first-hand view of Kerry's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including measures taken to prioritise the health, safety and wellbeing of all employees whether working at home or continuing to work onsite and the preparations for their future return to the workplace; and\n- -  ongoing updates on the results from the Leader Pulse Checks and the OurVoice employee engagement survey activities.\n\n## The global priorities for employee engagement during 2020 were as follows:\n\n- -  integrating employee engagement as a key organisational measure to drive sustainable and successful business improvement activities;\n- -  maintaining a continued focus on employee engagement activities during the COVID-19 pandemic and providing additional support to senior management in leading teams through uncertain times, managing a more dispersed workforce and dealing with prolonged disruption to day to day working practices;\n- -  providing the right level of organisational support, to prioritise employees' safety, health and wellbeing needs, to partner effectively with customers, and to help our communities during the COVID-19 pandemic; and\n- -  actively fostering diversity, inclusion and belonging in the workplace to ensure all employees felt valued, stayed connected, received relevant and timely updates as matters evolved and were able to connect their own roles and contribute fully to meaningful work aligned to our purpose.\n\nMr. Tom Moran held regular meetings with the Chief Human Resources Officer and the Group Human Resources Team to provide his feedback from the engagement activities. He also presented regular reports to the Board on the activities undertaken and shared his feedback and findings where applicable.\n\nMr. Tom Moran is satisfied that the employee engagement process is being successfully operated within the Group and, despite the pandemic constraints, has been very productive. He, and the officers leading the process, have kept the Board informed on its progress and on the views of the workforce.",

        "page_content": "## Annual General Meeting\n\nAll Directors attend the AGM and are available to meet with shareholders and answer questions as required. Notice of the AGM, proxy statement and the Annual Report and financial statements are sent to shareholders at least 20 working days before the meeting. A separate resolution is proposed at the AGM on each substantially separate issue including a particular resolution relating to the adoption of the Directors' and Auditors' reports and the financial statements. Details of the proxy votes for and against each resolution, together with details of votes withheld are announced after the result of the votes by hand. These details are published on the Group's website following the conclusion of the AGM. At the AGM held on 30 April 2020, there were no material votes cast against any resolutions.\n\n## Division of Responsibilities\n\n## Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\nThe roles of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer are separate and the division of duties between them is formally established, set out in writing and agreed by the Board. The Chairman is responsible for leadership of the Board and ensuring its effectiveness in all respects. The Executive Directors, led by the Chief Executive Officer, are responsible for the management of the Group's business and the implementation of Group strategy and policy.\n\n## Senior Independent Director\n\nThe principal role of the Senior Independent Director (SID) is to provide a sounding board for the Chairman and to act as an intermediary for other Directors as required. The SID is responsible for the appraisal of the Chairman's performance throughout the year. The SID is also responsible for leading a formal succession process for the role of Chairman. The SID is available to meet shareholders upon request, in particular if they have concerns that cannot be resolved through the Chairman or the Chief Executive Officer.\n\n## Non-Executive Directors\n\nThe non-Executive Directors' main responsibilities are to review the performance of management and the Group's financial information, assist in strategy development, and ensure that appropriate and effective systems of internal control and risk management are in place. The nonExecutive Directors review the relationship with external auditors through the Audit Committee and monitor the remuneration structures and policy through the Remuneration Committee.\n\nThe non-Executive Directors provide a valuable breadth of experience and independent judgement to Board discussions.\n\n## Whistleblowing Arrangement\n\nThe Group's whistleblowing arrangement includes an externally facilitated multi-lingual hotline 'Express a Concern' through which all employees and third parties can raise concerns in confidence about possible wrong doings in financial reporting and other matters, 24 hours a day by phone or online.\n\nAll whistleblowing incidents are reviewed by the Head of Internal Audit and formally investigated by the relevant functional heads depending on the nature of the concern raised.\n\nIn 2020, the Audit Committee reviewed the whistleblowing incidents and outcomes and provided updates to the Board which enabled the Board to assess the adequacy of the whistleblowing arrangements and to review the reports arising from its operation. The Board is satisfied that the Group's whistleblowing arrangements are operating effectively.\n\n## Company Secretary\n\nEach Director has access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary, whose responsibilities include ensuring that Board procedures are followed, assisting the Chairman in relation to corporate governance matters, ensuring the Company complies with its legal and regulatory obligations and facilitating appropriate quality information flows between the business and the Board.\n\n## Commitments\n\nUnder the terms of their appointment all Directors agreed to the time commitment schedule which requires them to allocate sufficient time to discharge their responsibilities effectively. This matter is considered by the Governance, Nomination and Sustainability Committee on an ongoing basis in accordance with its Terms of Reference.\n\nAll Directors must seek prior approval of the Board in advance of undertaking any additional external appointments. Before approving any additional external appointment, the Board considers the time commitment required for the role. Each proposed external appointment is reviewed independently.\n\n## Independence\n\nThe Board, as a whole, has assessed the non-Executive Directors' independence and confirmed that, in its opinion, all non-Executive Directors are independent in accordance with the Code. The Board notes that Dr. Hugh Brady and Ms. Joan Garahy serve on the Board of ICON plc. The Board is satisfied that they are able to apply objective and independent judgement to act in the best interest of the Company.",

Reports on the activities of the individual Committees are presented to the Board by the respective Committee Chairs.\n\nFurther details on the duties, operation and activities of all Board Committees can be found in their respective reports on pages 107-149 and these reports form part of the Governance Report.\n\n## Meetings and Attendance\n\nThe Board meets sufficiently regularly to ensure that all its duties are discharged effectively. All Directors are expected to prepare for and attend meetings of the Board, the Committees of which they are members and the AGM. In the event that a Board member cannot attend or participate in the meeting, the Director may discuss and share opinions on agenda items with the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, Senior Independent Director or Company Secretary in advance of the meeting.\n\nDuring the year, additional Board meetings were convened to discuss the Group's response to the COVID-19 pandemic and to consider strategic acquisition opportunities. As a result, a total of 14 meetings were held in 2020, with all meetings held virtually from April onwards due to the imposition of COVID-19 related restrictions and to ensure that the health & safety of our Board and colleagues was protected.

        "page_content": "Throughout the year, the Board as a whole engages in development through a series of consultations with subject matter experts on a range of topics including corporate governance and strategy. Presentations are also made by Executive Directors and senior management on various topics throughout the year in relation to their areas of responsibility.\n\nOn an annual basis, an 'off-site' Board meeting is scheduled at a Group location and is combined with a comprehensive schedule of activities over a week long period, to allow non-Executive Directors further develop their understanding of the Group's activities and meet with local senior management and emerging talent. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Board visit scheduled for June 2020 was cancelled.\n\nThe Board along with 400 senior managers attended a virtual three day Kerry Global Leadership Forum in October 2020 at which the Group's new vision statement, brand identity and sustainability strategy were unveiled. It also provided the Board with an opportunity to listen to and obtain feedback from senior management across the Group on subject matters such as leadership competencies, culture and values.\n\nAs part of their personal development plans, individual non-Executive Directors were also afforded the opportunity to visit a number of the Group's international facilities and operations. In 2020, Mr. Tom Moran, in his role as designated workforce engagement Director, visited two sites in Ireland: Kerry Foods in Coleraine and the Global Technology & Innovation Centre in Naas. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, all other non-Executive Directors' international site visits were cancelled.\n\nIndividual Board members training requirements are reviewed with the Chairman and Company Secretary and training is provided to address these needs.\n\n## Board Performance Evaluation\n\nIn accordance with provisions of the Code, a performance evaluation of the Board is carried out annually and facilitated externally every third year.\n\nIn 2020, the Board conducted an internal self-evaluation of the performance of the Board, Board Committees, the Chairman and individual Directors against a set of pre-defined key criteria. The review was led by the Chairman of the Board and the Senior Independent Director and was facilitated by the Company Secretary. The review was undertaken using Thinking Board, Independent Audit Limited's governance self-assessment process. Independent Audit Limited, based in the UK, is recognised as a leading firm of board reviewers, and has no other connections to the Group.\n\nTopics covered during the Board Performance Evaluation included Board composition and succession planning, board meetings and papers, strategy and business model, mergers and acquisitions, risk management and the response to COVID-19.\n\nThe Chairman appraised the performance of each of the non-Executive Directors by meeting each Director individually. The key areas reviewed were independence, contribution and attendance at Board meetings, interaction with Executive Directors, the Company Secretary and senior management, ability to communicate issues of importance and concern, their knowledge and effectiveness at meetings and the overall time and commitment to their role on the Board.\n\nIn addition, the Senior Independent Director formally appraised the performance of the Chairman. This appraisal was similar to the non-Executive Director evaluation process which included feedback from all Directors on the Chairman's performance during the year.\n\nIn December 2020, the non-Executive Directors met without the presence of the Executive Directors and, led by the Chairman, undertook a formal review of the performance of the individual Executive Directors.\n\nTo conclude on the appraisal of the non-Executive Directors, the Chairman and the Executive Directors, results are collated, summarised and presented to the Board. The appraisal process concluded that each Director is performing well and is committed to their role in terms of dedication of time and attendance at meetings.\n\nAt the December Board meeting, the Board considered the outcomes of the Board evaluation report (including the Board Committees). Overall, the Board concluded that no area of significant weakness had been identified and that it and its committees operated effectively throughout the period under review. A number of points for improvement were identified and action plans established to address them. The actions identified from the 2020 performance evaluation included recommendations relating to Board composition and succession planning, executive succession planning, structure and content of Board papers and the appropriate time allocation between strategic priorities and other matters at Board meetings.\n\nProgress against recommendations from the previous evaluation were also considered and the Board is satisfied that improvements have been made which have enhanced the operation and effectiveness of both the Board and its Committees.\n\nThe Chairman, along with the Company Secretary, will ensure that areas for improvement identified from the 2020 evaluation report and areas for consideration arising from the Directors' appraisal, where identified, will be considered during 2021.",

The work performed by the Audit Committee is described in its report on pages 107-112.\n\nFull details of the risk management systems are described in the Risk Management Report on pages 71-74.\n\nThe principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group, including those that could threaten the business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity are described on pages 73-82. Emerging risks are also identified, analysed and managed as part of the same process as the Group's other principal risks as described on page 74. The Directors confirm that they have carried out a robust assessment of these risks and the actions that are in place to mitigate them.\n\nThe Directors confirm that they have also reviewed the effectiveness of the systems of risk management and internal control which operated during the period covered by these financial statements and up to the date of this report. Based on the review performed, the Directors concluded that for the year ended 31 December 2020, the Group's systems of risk management and internal control were effective. The procedures adopted comply with the guidance contained in Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and Business Reporting as published by the Financial Reporting Council in the UK.\n\n## Features of Internal Control in Relation to the Financial Reporting Process\n\nThe main features of the internal control and risk management systems of the Group in relation to the financial reporting process include:\n\n- -  the Board review and approve a detailed annual budget and monitor performance against the budget through periodic Board reporting;\n- -  adherence to the Group Code of Conduct and Group policies published on the Group's intranet ensures the key controls in the internal control system are complied with;\n- -  prior to submission to the Board with a recommendation to approve, the Audit Committee review the Interim Management Statements, the Interim and Annual Consolidated Financial Statements and all formal announcements relating to these statements;\n- -  monthly reporting and financial review meetings are held to review performance at business level ensuring that significant variances between the budget and detailed management accounts are investigated and that remedial action is taken as necessary;\n- -  the Group operates an internal control self-assessment process covering material finance, operational and compliance controls across the Group;\n- -  the Group has a Financial Compliance function to establish compliance policies and monitor compliance across the countries in which the Group operates;\n- -  a well-resourced and appropriately skilled Finance function is in place throughout the Group;\n- -  centralised Taxation and Treasury functions and regional Shared Service Centres established to facilitate appropriate segregation of duties;\n- -  completion of key account reconciliations at reporting unit and Group level;\n- -  the Group Finance Committee has responsibility for raising finance, reviewing foreign currency risk, making decisions on foreign currency and interest rate hedging and managing the Group's relationship with its finance providers;\n- -  appropriate ICT security environment; and\n- -  the Board, through the Audit Committee, completes an annual assessment of risks and controls;\n- -  the Internal Audit function continually reviews the internal controls and systems and makes recommendations for improvement which are reported to the Audit Committee.\n\n## Fair, Balanced and Understandable\n\nThe Directors have concluded that the Annual Report and Consolidated Financial Statements, taken as a whole, provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group's and Company's position and performance, business model and strategy and is fair, balanced and understandable. This assessment was completed by the Audit Committee and the activities undertaken in reaching this conclusion are outlined on page 109.",

During 2020 this work was conducted against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic and, whilst recognising the additional pressure and stress on the management and employees of the Group, our focus was on ensuring the ongoing robustness of the internal control and risk management systems and that the Group Internal Audit function continued to operate effectively. The work performed by the Committee in this regard, encompassing ongoing monitoring and the review of effectiveness is detailed on page 110.\n\nThe Committee is responsible for monitoring the integrity of the Group's Financial Statements and any formal announcements relating to the Group's financial performance. We reviewed the work completed by management in respect of the Going Concern and Viability Statements, including additional analysis to assess the impact, in the short to medium term, of the COVID-19 pandemic and concluded that there was no threat to the Group's prospects or viability. Further details are set out on page 83. The Committee also assisted the Board in determining that the Annual Report and Consolidated Financial Statements, when taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group's and the Company's position, performance, business model and strategy. The work completed in this regard is set out on page 109.\n\nThe Committee received a detailed briefing from management and the external auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), on preparations for completing the year end audit in light of the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe Committee was reassured by the actions management and PwC had taken, which ensured there was a minimal impact on the year end audit timetable. The Committee and the Board would like to thank the teams for responding to these challenges in such a positive manner.\n\nThe Committee oversees the relationship with the external auditor, including monitoring all matters associated with their appointment, remuneration, performance and independence and reviewing the scope and results of the audit and the effectiveness of the process. Further details with regard to the Committees work in this regard are set out on page 111.\n\nAs outlined on page 112, the Committee has considered the requirements of the Companies Act 2014 in relation to the Directors' Compliance Statement and is satisfied that appropriate steps have been undertaken by the Company to ensure that it is materially compliant with its relevant obligations.\n\nThe Committee's key priorities for the coming year include continued focus on ensuring recommendations from Group Internal Audit reviews are implemented and working with the Board and Group management on continuous improvement to risk and financial management controls across the Group, in particular taking account of the Group's continuing growth and expanding geographical footprint.\n\nI trust you will find this report useful in understanding the operation and activities of the Committee during the year and I welcome any comments from shareholders on my report.\n\nChristopher Rogers Chairman of the Audit Committee\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "The Committee has, with the support of PwC as external auditor, reviewed the suitability of the accounting policies which have been adopted and whether management have made appropriate judgements and disclosures. The table below sets out the significant matters considered by the Committee in relation to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2020.\n\n## Significant Financial Reporting Judgements\n\n| Impairment  of Goodwill  and Indefinite  Life Intangible  Assets   | Goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets, as disclosed in note 12 to the Consolidated Financial  Statements, represents the largest number on the Group balance sheet at \u20ac3.9 billion. The  Committee considered the process to complete the annual impairment review of the Group's  goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets and specifically the assumptions used for the future  cash flows, discount rates, terminal values and growth rates. This included consideration of the  impact of COVID-19 on such assessments and a consideration of the sensitivity analysis run  by management. Following discussions with senior management and the external auditor, the  Committee found that the methodology used for the above valuation and annual impairment  review are appropriate and no impairment was identified.                                                                                                                           |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Going Concern  and Viability  Statement                            | COVID-19 has impacted both the performance and cash flows of the Group and through the year  management have undertaken detailed financial modelling exercises which have considered  the impact on profit, growth, cash and working capital in a number of different scenarios. The  Committee reviewed and challenged management's assumptions and modelling of projected  cashflows and, in particular those related to the potential impact of COVID-19 on future trading  performance. The Committee also considered the Group's financing facilities and future funding  plans. Based on this, the Committee confirmed there were no material uncertainties that cast  a significant doubt on the Group or the Company's ability to continue as a going concern and  therefore the application of the going concern basis for the preparation of the financial statements  continued to be appropriate and recommended the approval of the viability statement. |\n| Business  Combinations                                             | The Group acquired three businesses during the financial year which were accounted for as  business combinations. The Committee reviewed the methodology and assumptions applied in  determining these provisionally estimated fair values and found the methodology and assumptions  to be appropriate following discussion with senior management and the external auditor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| Taxation                                                           | Significant judgement and a high degree of estimation is required when arriving at the Group's  tax charge and liability. The Committee, in conjunction with tax professionals, reviewed and  discussed the basis for the judgments in relation to uncertain tax positions and challenged  management on their assertions and also considered the outcome of the external auditors' review  of the tax charge and liability. As a result, the Committee believes the impact of uncertain tax  positions has been appropriately reflected in the tax charge and liability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n\n## Fair, Balanced and Understandable\n\nAt the request of the Board, the Audit Committee reviewed the content of the Annual Report and Consolidated Financial Statements to ensure that it is fair, balanced and understandable, and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group's and the Company's position, performance, business model and strategy.\n\nIn fulfilling this responsibility, the Committee considered the following:\n\n- -  the timetable for the co-ordination and preparation of the Annual Report and Consolidated Financial Statements, including key milestones as presented at the December Audit Committee meeting;\n- -  a detailed report from senior finance management outlining the process through which they assessed the narrative and financial sections of the 2020 Annual Report to ensure that the criteria of fair, balanced and understandable has been achieved.\n- -  the systematic approach to review and sign-off carried out by senior management with a focus on consistency and balance; and\n\nManagement ensured that the draft Annual Report and Consolidated Financial Statements were available to the Audit Committee in sufficient time for review in advance of the Committee meeting to facilitate adequate discussion at the meeting.\n\nHaving considered the above, in conjunction with the consistency of the various elements of the reports, the narrative reporting, the language used and disclosures in relation to COVID-19, the Committee confirmed to the Board that the Annual Report and Consolidated Financial Statements, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group's and the Company's position, performance, business model and strategy.\n\n## Internal Control and Risk Management\n\nThe Audit Committee supports the Board in its duties to review and monitor, on an ongoing basis, the effectiveness of the Group's risk management and internal control systems. A detailed overview of the Group's risk management framework is set out in the Risk Management Report on pages 71-74.",

Further details are set out in the Risk Management Report on pages 74-75;\n- -  reviewed and approved an enhanced framework for the definition of risk appetite for each of the Group's principal risks and recommended the risk appetites as outlined for approval by the Board;\n- -  reviewed quarterly reports from the Head of Internal Audit based on internal audits completed outlining non-compliances with Group controls and managements' action plans to address them;\n- -  received presentations on a selection of principal risks and discussed with senior management the material internal controls that exist to mitigate these to levels within the Group's risk appetite;\n- -  considered reports from the Head of Internal Audit on fraud investigations or other significant control matters which occurred during the year and approved plans to address and remediate the issues identified;\n- -  received updates from the Group Financial Controller on any control weaknesses identified through monthly financial review meetings;\n- -  received updates on the review of financial controls which concluded that except for a limited number of changes required as a result of remote working, primarily in relation to the form of physical evidencing of approval, the ongoing operation of our financial controls is substantially unaffected by COVID-19 restrictions;\n- -  considered the results of the Kerry Control Reporting System (the internal control self-assessment review of material finance, operational and compliance controls) and concluded that the controls are operating effectively;\n- -  reviewed the report from the external auditor in respect of significant financial accounting and reporting issues, together with significant internal control weakness observations.\n- -  assessed the Group's risk management and internal control framework in line with the FRC Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and Business Reporting; and\n\nThe Audit Committee, having assessed the above information, is satisfied that the internal control and risk management framework is operating effectively and has reported this opinion to the Board.\n\n## Internal Audit\n\nThe Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring and reviewing the operation and effectiveness of the Group Internal Audit function including its focus, plans, activities and resources. To fulfil these duties the Committee:\n\n- -  reviewed and approved the Group Internal Audit function's strategy and annual plan, which was constructed using a risk-based approach;\n- -  considered and were satisfied that the competencies,\n- -  approved revisions to the annual plan resulting from the impact of COVID-19 and the need to adapt to the changing business environment;\n- experience and level of resources within the Internal Audit team were adequate to achieve the proposed plan;\n- -  received quarterly updates from the Head of Internal Audit on progress against the agreed plan including the results of internal audit reports and management's actions to remediate issues identified;\n- -  considered the role and effectiveness of Internal Audit in the overall context of the Group's risk management framework and was satisfied that the function has appropriate standing within the Group;\n- -  received updates on the nature and extent of nonaudit activity performed by Internal Audit;\n- -  ensured that the Head of Internal Audit had regular meetings with the Chairman of the Audit Committee and had access to the Chairman of the Board if required; and\n- -  held a meeting with the Head of Internal Audit without the presence of management;\n- -  ensured co-ordination between Group Internal Audit and the external auditor to maximise the benefits from clear communication and co-ordinated activities.\n\nIn order to comply with the Chartered Institute of Internal Auditors (CIIA) requirements, an External Quality Assessment (EQA) by an independent body is conducted at least every five years to confirm conformance with the International Professional Practice Framework (IPPF) of the CIIA. The most recent EQA was completed in 2017 and the next review will be completed in 2022. On an annual basis, to ensure ongoing compliance with the IPPF, the Group Internal Audit function has an internal Quality Assurance and Improvement Program (QAIP) in place.\n\nOn the basis of the above, the Committee concluded that for 2020 the Group Internal Audit function operated effectively and is satisfied that the quality, experience and expertise of the function is appropriate for the Group.",

        "page_content": "## External Auditor\n\nOn behalf of the Board, the Audit Committee has primary responsibility for overseeing the relationship with, and performance of, the external auditor. This includes making recommendations to the Board on the appointment, re-appointment and removal of the external auditor, assessing their independence and effectiveness and approving the audit fee.\n\nDuring the year, the Committee met with the external auditor without management present to discuss any issues that may have arisen during the audit of the Group's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Independence and Provision of Non-Audit Services\n\nThe Committee is responsible for ensuring that the external auditor is independent and for implementing appropriate safeguards where the external auditor also provides non-audit services to the Group.\n\nPwC confirmed to the Audit Committee that they are independent from the Group under the requirements of the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority's Ethical Standards for Auditors. The audit lead engagement partner for the financial year ended 31 December 2020 is John McDonnell who was appointed in 2016. In order to ensure continued independence and objectivity he can only serve as lead engagement partner for a period of five years. He will therefore be replaced by Enda McDonagh for the financial year ended 31 December 2021 onwards.\n\nIn accordance with the Group's policy on the hiring of former employees of the current external auditor, the Committee reviews and approves any appointment of an individual, within three years of having previously been employed by the current external auditor, to a senior managerial position in the Group.\n\nA formal policy governing the provision of nonaudit services by the external auditor is in place and is reviewed and approved by the Audit Committee annually. This policy is in accordance with applicable laws and takes into account the relevant ethical guidance for auditors. This policy is designed to safeguard the objectivity and independence of the external auditor and to prevent the provision of services which could result in a potential conflict of auditor independence. The policy outlines the services which can be provided by the external auditor, the relevant approval process for these services, and those services which the external auditor is prohibited from providing.\n\nIn 2020, all non-audit services and fees were approved by the Audit Committee in line with policy. The Committee is satisfied that the non-audit fees paid to PwC, which were minimal, did not compromise their independence or objectivity. Full details of the fees paid to the external auditor during the year for nonaudit services are outlined in note 3 to the financial statements. Having considered all of the above, the Committee concluded that the Group's external auditor is independent.\n\n## Effectiveness\n\nPost completion of the 2019 audit, in conjunction with PwC, review meetings were held with senior finance management across all regions and it was confirmed by both parties that no issues had arisen during the audit process.\n\nAt the November Audit Committee meeting, PwC outlined to the Committee in detail the 2020 external audit plan including process and technology changes which were implemented to facilitate conducting the audit remotely. The Committee discussed the significant audit risks and key audit matters, audit scope and materiality amongst other matters. The Audit Committee agreed that the plan and the materiality at which any misstatements should be reported by PwC to the Committee was appropriate.\n\nPrior to the finalisation of the 2020 Consolidated Financial Statements, the Audit Committee received a detailed presentation and final report from PwC. The Committee also considered feedback from the lead partner and senior executives in concluding that PwC effectively delivered against the objectives of the agreed audit plan.\n\nIn assessing the effectiveness of the external auditor, the Audit Committee also considered the following:\n\n- -  the quality of presentations to the Board and Audit Committee;\n- -  key audit findings, including their robustness and perceptiveness in handling of key accounting and audit judgements; and\n- -  the technical insights provided relevant to the Group;\n- -  their demonstration of a clear understanding of the Group's business and key risks.\n\nOn the basis of the above the Committee is satisfied with the effectiveness of the external auditors.\n\n## Appointment\n\nPwC were appointed as external auditor in March 2016 following a comprehensive tender process which was overseen by the Audit Committee. On an annual basis, the Committee reviews the appointment of the external auditor, taking into account the auditor's effectiveness and independence. On that basis, the Committee recommended to the Board that PwC should continue in office as the auditor to the Group in respect of the year ending 31 December 2021.\n\nThe Audit Committee approved the remuneration of the external auditor, details of which are set out in note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.",

On the basis of this review, the Committee confirmed to the Board that in its opinion the Company is in material compliance with its relevant obligations.\n\n## Whistleblowing and Fraud Arrangements\n\nIn accordance with the Provisions of the Code, the responsibility for overseeing whistleblowing is within the remit of the Board. During 2020, at the request of the Board, the Committee considered the Group's whistleblowing arrangements and assisted the Board in its assessment of the adequacy of these arrangements. Details of the Group's whistleblowing arrangements are outlined in the Corporate Governance Report on page 102.\n\nThe Committee also considered the Group's procedures for fraud prevention and detection to ensure that these arrangements allow for the proportionate and independent investigation of such matters and appropriate follow up action. Following this review, the Audit Committee confirmed to the Board that it was satisfied that the Group's fraud prevention procedures were adequate.",

This report sets out the Committee's key activities in 2020 as well as the Committee's priorities for 2021.\n\nThe Governance, Nomination and Sustainability Committee is responsible for evaluating the structure, size, composition and successional needs of the Board and its Committees and making recommendations on same, with due regard for Board diversity. Additionally, the Committee is responsible for the review of the results of the annual Board evaluation process as it relates to the Board and Committee performance and composition. The role of the Committee was expanded during the year to provide guidance and oversight on the implementation of the Group's sustainability strategy. The Terms of Reference were reviewed and updated accordingly.\n\nDuring the year under review, the Committee continued to lead the Board refreshment process ensuring that the composition of the Board and its Committees has the correct balance of skills, knowledge, experience, diversity and independence. We engaged with executive recruitment consulting firms to conduct a search for new independent nonExecutive Directors. Potential non-Executive Directors were considered by the Committee and a shortlist was interviewed after assessing their qualifications against the above criteria and their other time commitments. This culminated in the appointment of Ms. Emer Gilvarry and Mr. Jinlong Wang to the Board. Ms. Emer Gilvarry was appointed to the Board and the Audit Committee on 1 November 2020. She is a highly experienced professional who brings legal, business and corporate governance expertise to the Board. On the recommendation of the Committee, the Board also approved the appointment of Mr. Jinlong Wang as a non-Executive Director effective on 5 January 2021. His extensive knowledge of the Food & Beverage industry coupled with his in-depth understanding of Asian markets, brings a key set of skills and experience to the Board. The Committee also recommended changes to the composition of the Board Committees as outlined on page 116. The Committee continues to engage with executive recruitment consulting firms to identify an appropriate pipeline of candidates to join the Board as independent non-Executive Directors in the future.\n\nMs. Joan Garahy will not seek reelection at the 2021 AGM and will retire from the Board as Senior Independent Director and as Chair of the Remuneration Committee on 29 April 2021 having served nine years on the Board. She will be succeeded as Senior Independent Director by Dr. Hugh Brady and as Chair of the Remuneration Committee by Mr. Tom Moran.\n\nI will have served nine years as a Director, including less than three years as Chairman, on 19 February 2021. The Committee is aware of the Provisions of the Code in respect of Chairman tenure and is undertaking a formal succession process which is being led by Ms. Joan Garahy as Senior Independent Director. The Committee and the Board have recommended that I continue as Chairman until the AGM in 2022, to allow appropriate time to identify a successor and to enable an orderly succession to the role.\n\nThe Committee also reviewed senior management development and succession plans having regard to business growth and geographic expansion and taking account of diversity goals below Board level.\n\nDuring 2020, the Committee reviewed the Company's corporate governance policy and processes and monitored developments in corporate governance best practice.\n\nAn internal review of the effectiveness of the Board and its Committees was conducted during 2020 and the outcome of this review is that the Board and its Committees consider that they are operating effectively. Further details are outlined on page 105.\n\nThe Committee's priorities for 2021 will focus on Board and Committee refreshment, taking account of all skill sets required, diversity (beyond gender) and planned retirements over the coming years. The Committee will ensure that senior management development and succession planning can support the delivery of Group strategy and will also continue to focus on diversity and inclusion in the wider workforce.\n\nPhilip Toomey Chairman of the Governance,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNomination and Sustainability Committee",

Mr. James C. Kenny retired from the Board and the Governance, Nomination and Sustainability Committee on 30 April 2020. Mr. Tom Moran joined the Governance, Nomination and Sustainability Committee on 1 November 2020. Biographical details for the members of the Committee are outlined on pages 85-87.\n\nThe quorum for Committee meetings is two and only Committee members are entitled to attend. The Governance, Nomination and Sustainability Committee may extend an invitation to other persons to attend meetings or to be present for particular agenda items as required. The Company Secretary acts as Secretary of the Committee.\n\nDuring 2020, the Committee continued to work with SpencerStuart and Korn Ferry, executive recruitment consulting firms, to assist with Board refreshment. SpencerStuart has no other connections to the Group and Korn Ferry has no other connections to the Group other than acting as the advisor to the Remuneration Committee.\n\n## Committee Meetings\n\nThe Committee met six times during the year and attendance at these meetings is outlined on page 103.\n\n## Board Refreshment Policy\n\nOn an ongoing basis, the Governance, Nomination and Sustainability Committee reviews and assesses the structure, size, composition, diversity and overall balance of the Board and makes recommendations to the Board with regard to refreshment.\n\nAppointments to the Board are for a three year period, subject to shareholder approval and annual re-election, after consideration of annual performance evaluation and statutory provisions relating to the removal of a Director. The Board may appoint such Directors for a further term not exceeding three years and may consider an additional term if deemed appropriate.\n\nDuring the year, the Chairman conducted a rigorous review of all other non-Executive Directors as part of the Board evaluation process, taking into account the need for progressive refreshment of the Board. The Board explains to shareholders, in the papers accompanying the resolutions to elect and re-elect the non-Executive Directors, why it believes the individual should be reelected based on the results of the formal performance evaluation. Details of Board refreshment activities during the year are outlined on pages 117-118.\n\n## Nomination Process\n\nThere is a formal, rigorous and transparent procedure in appointing new Directors to the Board. Details of this process are outlined in the Governance in Action table.\n\nThe Committee also makes recommendations to the Board concerning the re-appointment of any nonExecutive Director at the conclusion of their specified term and the re-election of all Directors who are the subject of annual rotation. The terms and conditions of appointment of non-Executive Directors are set out in formal letters of appointment, which are available for inspection at the Company's registered office during normal office hours and at the AGM of the Company.",

The Committee also considered the Board's commitment to increase the representation of members with diverse backgrounds.\n\nThe Committee instructed SpencerStuart to conduct a search for appropriate candidates for appointment to the Board based on the profile and skillset agreed by the Committee.\n\nThe Committee assessed the long list of candidates identified by SpencerStuart as having met the criteria.\n\nA shortlist of potential candidates was interviewed by the Chairman, Committee and the Chief Executive Officer.\n\nA formal recommendation was made by the Committee to the Board proposing the appointment of Mr. Jinlong Wang as a nonExecutive Director. The Board approved the appointment of Mr. Jinlong Wang noting that he had a balance of skills, knowledge, experience and diversity that matched the requirements set. Appointment terms were drafted and agreed with him.\n\n## Succession Planning\n\nThe Governance, Nomination and Sustainability Committee reviews the succession plans for the Board and its Committees on an ongoing basis to ensure an orderly refreshment of membership, taking into account Group strategy, the challenges and opportunities facing the Group and the skills, knowledge and experience required.\n\nThe Committee also reviews succession plans for senior management, which form part of the Group's overall annual approach to succession planning and agrees these with the Chief Executive Officer before being presented to the Board. The succession planning process includes defining success criteria for prioritised key roles, identifying and evaluating candidate pools and aligning successor development activities with individual and business needs to ensure leadership continuity and improve the depth of the leadership succession pipeline. This process is fully documented and monitored throughout the year in conjunction with the Committee. Details of succession planning activities during the year are outlined in Our People on page 18.\n\n## Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging Policy\n\nDiversity, Inclusion and Belonging is fully embraced at Kerry and the Group is committed to having a work environment that is respectful of everyone. We recognise the value that different perspectives and cultures bring to the organisation. Valuing differences creates a work environment which is positive and productive, where people can and want to do their best and where each individual can bring something unique to contribute to the overall success of Kerry.\n\nThe Group's Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging Policy is an integral part of the Group's Code of Conduct ensuring that diversity and inclusion are embedded in Kerry Group's core values. Within this, the Group seeks to recruit, hire and retain the best talent from a diverse mix of gender, background, nationality, ethnicity and other attributes with the skills and experiences to drive innovative thinking to enable a sustained competitive advantage.",

In accordance with the Board Diversity Policy, differences in background, gender, skills, experiences, nationality, ethnicity and other attributes are considered in determining the optimum composition of the Board with the aim to balance it appropriately. All Board appointments are made on merit, with due regard to diversity. The Board currently has a 31% female representation. In line with its diversity policy, and recommended best practice, the Board is committed to maintaining an appropriate gender balance and has an ambition to increase the representation of members with diverse backgrounds such as nationality, ethnicity and other attributes. In reviewing Board composition and agreeing a job specification for new non-Executive Director appointments, the Committee considers the benefits of all aspects of diversity including, but not limited to, those described above, in order to complement the range and balance of skills, knowledge and experience on the Board. As part of the identification process executive recruitment consultants are required to present a list of potential candidates, who meet the stated specification and requirements comprising candidates of diverse backgrounds, for consideration by the Committee. 0 20 40 60 80 100 0 5 Executive 24% 0 20 40 60\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\nIn 2019, diversity goals were agreed for senior management succession pools with the Executive Directors and approved by the Board to improve the diversity profile of senior leadership teams and ensure internal candidate pools better reflect the broader cultural mix of people within the Group.

Kerry's business has been resilient throughout the global COVID-19 pandemic due to the agility of our Executive Directors, our leadership teams and our people across the world in adapting to these changing conditions.\n\nFrom the outset of the pandemic, we have put the safety and wellbeing of our people at the core of our coordinated global response, ensuring we could safely fulfil our critical role in the global food supply chain. Through our globally coordinated investments and efforts in 2020, we have kept all 149 manufacturing and R&D facilities operational to meet our customers' and consumers' needs, and have supported and enabled our customers through insights and innovation to adapt their offerings to rapidly changing consumer needs and behaviours.\n\nThe safety and wellbeing of our people has been at the core of our coordinated global response, and we have invested significantly in COVID-19 specific health & safety measures across all our operations, ensuring our site-based operations and R&D teams can work safely and securely on-site throughout the pandemic. We have facilitated homeworking for all other employees. We responded swiftly in early 2020 to adapt our global people policies to the new realities presented by COVID-19. Changes we made include a global self-isolation pay policy, a global employee assistance programme, introduction of agile working principles as well as a number of wellbeing and learning initiatives.\n\nAgainst a challenging economic backdrop, we have worked to minimise the economic impact of COVID-19 on our people. We made a conscious decision in 2020 to retain basic pay for all salaried employees despite market movements, and where changing customer demand has impacted site manufacturing volumes, we have utilised all possible levers including reallocation, shift patterns and leave management to avoid COVID-19 related redundancies. These efforts have resulted in approximately 100 COVID-19 related redundancies globally and very limited use of temporary layoffs/furloughing. In achieving the above, Kerry chose not to benefit from COVID-19 related government support (including in respect of employees furloughed) in any of our key geographies.\n\nThe Group delivered for its shareholders through sustained dividend payments and share price performance throughout 2020 and there was no requirement to raise share capital.\n\nAs a solidarity gesture, in light of the COVID-19 crisis and those impacted, the Group's Executive Directors, Chairman and non-Executive Directors volunteered a 25% reduction in their 2020 basic salary/ fees for a three-month period.",

        "page_content": "## Remuneration Policy Review\n\nDuring 2020, consistent with our three-year review cycle, the Committee completed an extensive review of the Group's Directors' Remuneration Policy in conjunction with our external advisors Korn Ferry. Arising from this review a new policy will be put to an advisory vote at the 2021 AGM.\n\n## Proposed Remuneration Policy\n\nOur current policy was implemented in 2018 and received a high level of support from shareholders at the 2018 AGM, with a 97.7% vote in favour. Since then, in line with our growth strategy, the Group has increased substantially in size and complexity, consistently delivering significant and sustained value to shareholders. As at 31 December 2020 our market capitalisation was \u20ac20.9bn which for context, would have placed Kerry Group plc within the 30 largest companies included in the FTSE 100 Index.\n\n## Key Developments Since Last Policy Review 1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 2. Based on share price as at 31 December 2020\n\nThe executive team is well established, with the CEO in position since 2017, CFO since 2018 and CEO T&N since 2008, and has performed exceptionally well in leading the growth detailed above. In 2020 the executive team demonstrated exceptional leadership through a challenging and unprecedented global pandemic, delivered sustained shareholder return and robust recovery from the impact of COVID-19 through the second half of the year. During the year, we also made significant progress on our sustainability agenda, culminating in the launch of our 2030 sustainability strategy Beyond the Horizon .\n\nThis year's review provided the Committee with the opportunity to ensure our Directors' Remuneration Policy reflects the current size and scale of Kerry, and that it is appropriately aligned with our strategic objectives and sustainability ambitions. To inform the review, the Committee considered evolving shareholder expectations regarding executive pay, pay practices in comparable companies, and recent developments in corporate governance requirements (including the updates in the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code and the EU Shareholders' Rights Directive, which was transposed into Irish law during 2020).\n\n## Kerry's Remuneration Principles\n\n## Delivery of Group Purpose, Values and Strategy\n\nThe Group's Executive Director short and long-term remuneration philosophy is to ensure that executive remuneration is aligned to the Group's purpose and values, supports strategy and promotes the long-term success of the Company.\n\n## Creating Sustainable, Long-Term Performance\n\nRemuneration includes performance related elements designed to align Directors' interests with those of shareholders and to promote long-term sustainable growth and performance at the highest levels in line with the Group's strategy.\n\n## Attract, Motivate and Retain Talent\n\nMarket-competitive total remuneration is structured to attract, motivate and retain individuals of the highest quality on an international basis.\n\n## Shareholder Interests\n\nBy incorporating a high proportion of Executive Directors' potential remuneration to short-term and long-term performance metrics with robust share ownership requirements, the Remuneration Committee believes that the interest and risk appetite of the Executive Directors is properly aligned with the interests of the shareholders and other stakeholders.\n\n## Pay for Performance\n\nThe Committee ensures alignment with shareholders' longterm interests by aligning remuneration metrics with the Group's business model and strategic objectives.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nConsistent with our approach in previous policy reviews, the Committee's pay reference group comprised nineteen FTSE, seven US and five European peer companies with comparable market capitalisation, size, geographical spread and complexity of business.\n\nFollowing detailed review, the Committee concluded that the core substance of our existing policy continues to be aligned with our business strategy and priorities and this was endorsed by our shareholders during consultation. As such, whilst there are no substantive changes proposed to the pay model approved in 2018, we are proposing a number of policy adjustments with effect from 2021 that reflect Kerry's growth in size and complexity since the last policy review as well as the evolution of our strategy and shareholder expectations regarding executive pay.\n\nFull details of the proposed changes to our Remuneration Policy are provided on pages 126-128, with the key changes summarised as follows:\n\n- -  implementing a phased increase to remuneration quantum through our short-term incentive plan 'STIP' and long-term incentive plan 'LTIP' to take account of our growth in size and complexity;",

        "page_content": "- -  toughening the approach to target setting within the STIP through reducing the target bonus opportunity to 50% of the maximum (from 70%), with no softening of expected performance levels;\n- -  reflecting the launch of our 2030 sustainability strategy Beyond the Horizon goals, through incorporating medium-term sustainability targets in our LTIP;\n- -  increasing the proportion of the STIP subject to strategic objectives from 10% to 20%, to ensure focus on the achievement of long-term strategic priorities;\n- -  toughening the total shareholder return target setting in the LTIP through a reduction of the proportion of this part of the award that vests (from 30% to 25%) on meeting the threshold performance level;\n- -  enhancing the long-term focus in our policy through increased deferral of both STIP and LTIP awards;\n- -  simplification of the vesting schedules that apply to our LTIP EPS and ROACE performance metrics, with straight line vesting from threshold to maximum;\n- -  strengthening the recovery and withholding (malus and clawback) provisions in both the STIP and LTIP rules along with enhanced Committee discretion;\n- -  committing to a reduction of incumbent Executive Director pension contributions to align them with the contribution rate of Kerry's Irish general workforce (10%) with effect from the end of 2022.\n- -  implementing higher in-service shareholding requirements and introducing post-employment shareholding guidelines to further enhance the longterm focus in our revised policy; and\n\nThe Committee is conscious of the need to apply restraint in Executive Remuneration at all times but recognises the particular sensitivity at the current time. As a result, the Committee is phasing part of the increases to quantum over two years and has structured the policy changes detailed above such that all variable pay is subject to meeting or exceeding robust performance requirements consistent with our ambitious growth strategy.\n\nThe Committee is satisfied that the new Remuneration Policy rewards the Executive Directors for their significant contribution and growth in roles and results in a total remuneration level consistent with the median for the pay reference group.\n\n## New LTIP and All Employee Share Plan\n\nThe Group's existing LTIP is due to come to the end of its ten-year life in 2023. To align with the proposed Directors' Remuneration Policy, the Remuneration Committee has also decided to seek shareholder support at the 2021 AGM for a new LTIP which will enable the above policy to be implemented throughout the policy period.\n\nThe Committee will also seek shareholder approval for an All Employee Share Plan which at a later date will allow for the grant of various share-based awards to all employees across the Group once implemented. The Committee wishes to ensure that all Kerry employees have the ability (subject to local tax and securities laws) to become shareholders in the Company and benefit from the future success of the Group.\n\n## Shareholder Consultation\n\nOn behalf of the Remuneration Committee, I had the opportunity to consult during the year with our major shareholders, along with shareholder representative bodies and proxy voting agencies, as we considered our proposals for the latest Directors' Remuneration Policy. I would like to take this opportunity to thank all those who met with me and for the valuable comments, perspectives, and specific feedback provided which have been very helpful and constructive in shaping the final policy approved by the Committee. Shareholder feedback informed our decision to implement a phased approach to remuneration quantum increases within the context of the current environment driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. Shareholders' input and advice also helped us to finetune the sustainability metrics that will be included in our new LTIP.\n\nThe proposed Directors' Remuneration Policy will be put to an advisory vote at the 2021 AGM and I would be grateful for your support in ensuring we have a policy that supports achievement of our growth and sustainability ambitions over the next three years, whilst meeting the highest standards of corporate governance.\n\n## Remuneration Policy Implementation 2021\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Basic Salary\n\nFor 2021, no substantive increases are proposed, and the basic salaries of the Executive Directors will be increased as normal in line with increases applied to the general workforce (i.e. a range of 2.5%-3%) in Ireland and the US respectively.\n\n## Pension Alignment\n\nAs detailed on page 127 Executive Directors' pension contribution rates will be aligned to those of Kerry's general workforce in Ireland with effect from 31 December 2022. Existing arrangements will apply for 2021.",

        "page_content": "## 2021 Short-Term Incentive Plan\n\nA review of the STIP design and metrics was completed to ensure that they are aligned to strategy, consistent with best practice, and that the targets are appropriately stretching. The 2021 STIP will continue to operate on a similar basis to 2020 but will be updated to reflect an increased weighting on the strategic element (from 10% to 20%) with a proportionate reweighting of the other metrics which remain unchanged. A proposed increase to quantum will also be implemented in 2021 with the CEO's maximum STIP opportunity increasing to 200% of basic salary (from 150%) and the CFO's and CEO Taste & Nutrition's maximum STIP opportunity increasing to 175% of basic salary (from 125%). In consideration of the higher maximum opportunity, as well as wider market practice, target STIP opportunity for all three Executive Directors will be reduced from the current 70% of maximum opportunity to 50% of maximum opportunity (with no softening of expected performance levels). In addition, the portion of STIP deferred into shares/ options will be increased to 33% (from 25%).\n\nFull details of all proposed changes in the new STIP policy are outlined in the Remuneration Policy on page 127.\n\n## 2021 Long-Term Incentive Plan\n\nA review of the LTIP design and metrics was also completed in 2020. Consistent with the launch of our 2030 sustainability strategy Beyond the Horizon in October 2020, a new sustainability element, will be included in the LTIP, with a weighting of 20%. Other metrics will remain unchanged and will be proportionately reweighted. The maximum LTIP opportunity for 2021 will be increased to 250% of basic salary for the CEO (from 200%) and to 225% of basic salary for the CFO (from 180%) and CEO Taste & Nutrition (from 200%). In line with current best practice and the UK Corporate Governance Code requirements, the two-year holding period will apply to 100% (previously 50%) of future vested long-term incentive awards that are awarded from 2021 onwards.\n\nFull details of changes proposed in the new LTIP policy, are outlined in the Remuneration Policy on page 127.\n\n## Pay for Performance\n\nKerry has a strong track record of demonstrating appropriate rigour and discipline when setting stretching targets as illustrated by the following chart.\n\nThe Committee is satisfied that the targets set for the 2021 STIP and LTIP awards are appropriately stretching given the current challenging environment, overall market growth rates and the level of capital expenditure required to support future growth ambitions.\n\n|         | STIP                 | STIP              | LTIP              |\n|---------|----------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Year    | % of Target Achieved | % of Max Achieved | % of Max Achieved |\n| 2015    | 81%                  | 57%               | 62%               |\n| 2016    | 90%                  | 63%               | 29%               |\n| 2017    | 108%                 | 75%               | 62%               |\n| 2018    | 85%                  | 59%               | 64%               |\n| 2019    | 104%                 | 73%               | 63%               |\n| Average | 94%                  | 65%               | 56%               |\n\n## Non-Executive Director Fees for 2021\n\nNon-Executive Director fees were last reviewed in 2017 and increases were made effective from 1 January 2018. The fees have not been increased since then and have not been subject to increases for annual inflation.\n\nThe Chairman and non-Executive Directors' fees were reviewed as part of the overall policy review. Following the review, and having consulted with shareholders, the Chairman's fee is being increased by \u20ac27,500 to \u20ac385,000 and the basic non-Executive Directors' fee is being increased by \u20ac6,000 to \u20ac84,000. These increases represent the equivalent of an annual 2.5% increase since the last review, in line with the annual increase applied to the general workforce in Ireland over the same three-year period. Following the adjustment, the Chairman's fee and the non-Executive Director fees remain within the market median range. The allowance for non-Executive Directors based outside of Europe will also be increased to reflect the extra time commitment required to travel to our Board meetings. All proposed changes are outlined in the Remuneration Policy on page 128.\n\n## Remuneration Policy Outturn 2020\n\nIn determining the Executive Director's remuneration outturns for the financial year, the Committee maintained a clear and rigorous focus on aligning pay with performance in the context of a very challenging year.\n\nIn 2020, despite the impact of COVID-19, our market capitalisation and Total Shareholder Return increased. The Total Shareholder Return graph at the top of the next page shows that Kerry has generated a 60% return for shareholders (including reinvestment of dividends) over the last 5 years, outperforming its market indices.\n\n## 2020 Short-Term Incentive Plan Outturn\n\nAs a direct result of the COVID-19 related restrictions, and their impact on business performance in the first half of 2020 in particular, the threshold performance level for the financial metrics in the STIP were not achieved.",

This assessment determined that an above target performance was achieved by all three Executive Directors, as detailed on pages 138-140. However, in light of the overall performance, and following a request from the Executive Directors not to be considered for any element of their annual bonus in respect of 2020, the Committee agreed that no award should be granted under this element of the STIP.\n\nAs a result of the financial performance and downward discretion applied in respect of the Personal and Strategic objectives, there was no payout under the 2020 STIP to Executive Directors.\n\n## Long-Term Incentive Plan 2018-2020 Outturn\n\nThe three year performance period in respect of the 2018-2020 LTIP award ended on 31 December 2020. The 2018 LTIP award was subject to Adjusted Earnings per Share (EPS), Total Shareholder Return (TSR) and Return on Average Capital Employed (ROACE) performance metrics.\n\nGood performance was achieved against our TSR and ROACE performance metrics over the three year period. However, the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the EPS metric in 2020 (-9.4%), which effectively negated the strong EPS growth achieved in 2018 (+8.6%) and 2019 (+8.3%). As a result, the threshold level for this metric, weighted at 50% of the overall award, was not achieved.\n\nThe Committee, having considered the current environment, and following consultation with major shareholders and proxy voting agencies, decided not to amend the formulaic outcome. This is despite some compelling arguments in support of an inflight adjustment to recognise the anomalous conditions created by the global pandemic and the impact specifically of a negative EPS outturn in 2020 negating the growth already achieved in 2018 and 2019. While the decision was made not to exercise discretion for the 2018 LTIP, the Committee would like to emphasise its appreciation of the strong executive leadership over the three year performance period (and especially in 2020), as well as the resilience of the Kerry business and sustained shareholder return against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe final outcome of the 2018-2020 LTIP award was 32.5% of maximum opportunity as outlined in further detail on page 142.\n\n## Discretion\n\nThe Committee is satisfied, in reviewing the remuneration for 2020 against performance, that there has been an appropriate link between reward and performance. In assessing performance, the Committee also considered relevant environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters when reviewing the remuneration outturns.\n\n## Other Matters\n\n## EU Shareholders' Rights Directive\n\nDuring 2020, the Committee implemented the new requirements under the EU Shareholders' Rights Directive which came into law in Ireland during 2020. The required enhanced disclosures have been reflected in this report.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAs noted earlier the new Remuneration Policy for the period 2021 to 2023 and the implementation of the existing policy in 2020 will be put to shareholders as two separate advisory votes at this year's AGM. Last year almost 97% of our shareholders who voted, voted in favour of the Directors' Remuneration Report. I would like to express again my appreciation to those shareholders who engaged with us as part of the 2021 Remuneration Policy review. I believe what we have proposed, and refined based on shareholder feedback, reflects a continuation and improvement of the policy implemented in 2018 and will help drive Kerry's future growth and continued success.\n\nAs this is my last report as the Chairperson of the Remuneration Committee, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the members of the Remuneration Committee, the wider Board, and all our shareholders for their support during my years as Chairperson of the Committee, it has been a real pleasure to be part of the journey with Kerry Group plc.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Following James C. Kenny's retirement from the Board and the Committee in April, Christopher Rogers was appointed to the Committee. Details of the skills and experience of the Directors are contained in the Directors' biographies on pages 85-87.\n\n## Role and Responsibilities\n\nOn behalf of the Board, the Remuneration Committee is responsible for determining the Remuneration Policy for the CEO, other Executive Directors and senior management on an annual basis. The CEO is invited to attend Remuneration Committee meetings but does not attend Committee meetings when his own remuneration is discussed. The Committee also has access to internal and external professional advice as required. The Committee follows an annual and tri-annual calendar with matters scheduled and planned well in advance. Decisions are made within agreed reference terms, with additional meetings held as required. In considering the agenda, the Committee gives due regard to overall business strategy, the interests of shareholders, employees and the performance of the Group. The main responsibilities of the Committee, which were reviewed during 2020, are set out in written terms of reference which are available from the Group's website www.kerrygroup.com or upon request.\n\n## Primary Responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee\n\n- -  To determine the Remuneration Policy for, and set the remuneration of the CEO, Executive Directors and senior management;\n- -  To review the remuneration of the Chairman;\n- -  To receive the recommendations of the CEO and set the salaries and overall remuneration of senior management;\n- -  To review and approve incentive plan structures and targets;\n- -  To agree the design of all share incentive plans for approval by the shareholders;\n- -  To ensure alignment of incentives and rewards with strategy, values and culture;\n- -  To ensure the contractual terms of Executive Directors and senior management are deemed fair and reasonable;\n- -  To place before shareholders at each AGM, a Directors' Remuneration Report setting out the Group's policy and disclosures on remuneration;\n- -  To arrange where appropriate, external benchmarking of overall remuneration levels and the effectiveness of incentive schemes;\n- -  To review annually its own performance and terms of reference to ensure it is operating effectively;\n- -  To engage with the workforce to explain how executive remuneration aligns with the wider company pay policy;\n- -  To review workforce remuneration and related policies and the alignment of incentives and rewards with the Group's culture, and take these into account when setting the policy for executives; and\n- -  To consider appropriate application and use of clawback and malus provisions as well as discretion to adjust the formulaic outturns for performance related pay.\n\n## Remuneration Committee Meetings and Activities 2020\n\nThe Committee held four scheduled meetings and two additional meetings during 2020. The additional meetings were required due to the significant amount of work associated with the policy review that was completed during the year. Attendance at these meetings is outlined on page 103.\n\nThe key activities undertaken by the Committee in discharging its duties during 2020 are set out below:\n\n| Subject                                                                                                      | Remuneration Committee Activity                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Remuneration Report                                                                                          | A review of best practice remuneration reporting was completed during 2020 to ensure compliance  with relevant legislation and reporting requirements while also ensuring the delivery of a report  which is transparent and understandable for all shareholders.

Korn Ferry has also provided other human capital related services to the Group during the year through a separate part of the business. The Committee is comfortable that the controls in place at Korn Ferry do not result in the potential for any conflicts of interest to arise.\n\nThe fees incurred with Korn Ferry for advising the Committee in 2020 were \u20ac217,584 (2019: \u20ac45,400).",

        "page_content": "## Section C: Remuneration Policy\n\n## Remuneration Principles\n\nThe Group's Executive Director remuneration philosophy is to ensure that executive remuneration is aligned to the Group's purpose and values, supports strategy, promotes the long-term success of the company, properly reflects the duties and responsibilities of the Executives, and is structured to attract, retain and motivate individuals of the highest quality on an international basis. Remuneration includes performance related elements designed to align Directors' interests with those of shareholders and to promote long-term sustainable growth and performance at the highest levels in line with the Group's strategy.\n\nA high proportion of Executive Directors' potential remuneration is based on short-term and longterm performance related incentive programmes. By incorporating these elements, the Remuneration Committee believes that the interest and risk appetite of the Executive Directors is properly aligned with the interests of the shareholders and other stakeholders. When authorising remuneration outcomes, the Committee exercises independent judgement and discretion, taking account of Group and individual performance as well as the investor experience, environmental, governance and social matters and wider workforce pay conditions to ensure that it is fair and appropriate for the role, experience of the individual, responsibilities and performance delivered.\n\n## Remuneration Policy Review\n\nUnder the Shareholders' Rights Directive, which was transposed into Irish Law in March 2020, Kerry is not obliged to submit its Remuneration Policy to shareholders for a non-binding advisory vote until the 2022 Annual General Meeting. However consistent with the Group's commitment to comply with best corporate governance practice and our existing three year cycle, a new policy will be brought to shareholders at the 2021 AGM.\n\nAs an Irish incorporated company Kerry Group plc is not obliged to comply with the UK legislation which requires UK companies to submit their remuneration policies to a binding shareholder vote every three years or earlier if changes are required prior to this.\n\nSimilarly, Kerry Group plc is not required to comply with the remuneration reporting regulation contained in the UK Companies (Miscellaneous Reporting) Regulations 2018 but follows the requirements as a matter of best practice unless they conflict with Irish or other legal requirements or there are other reasons where it is considered not practicable to do so.\n\nIn designing the Remuneration Policy, the Committee considered the best practice features detailed in the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code as follows:\n\n| Matters               | Examples                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Clarity               | The policy is clear, uncomplicated and well understood by the Executive Directors. It has been clearly  communicated to shareholders and proxy agencies. Our Chief Human Resources Officer's (CHRO) role has  direct responsibility for engaging with our employees and collaborates closely with Mr. Tom Moran, our  designated workforce engagement Director. The Committee monitors the effectiveness of engagement with  the wider workforce through updates provided by the CHRO and the designated workforce engagement  Director. The Board is comfortable that our Remuneration Policy is clearly understandable by employees.                   |\n| Simplicity            | The Committee considers that the new Remuneration Policy is simple and easy to understand.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| Risk                  | The Remuneration Policy is designed to discourage inappropriate risk taking and to ensure that it is not  rewarded. This is achieved by (i) the balanced use of both short-term and long-term incentive plans which  employ a blend of financial, non-financial and shareholder return targets (ii) the significant role played by  equity in our incentive plans together with shareholding requirements and (iii) malus and clawback provisions  and (iv) the ability of the Committee to utilise discretion to adjust formulaic outcomes to ensure outcomes are  aligned to, and are reflective of, the underlying business performance of the Group. |\n| Predictability        | Executive Directors' remuneration is subject to individual participation caps, with our share-based plans  also subject to market standard dilution limits. The scenario charts on page 133 illustrate how the rewards  potentially receivable by our Executive Directors vary based on performance delivered and share price growth.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| Proportionality       | There is a clear link between individual rewards, delivery of strategy and long-term performance. In addition,  the significant role played by STIP and LTIP/'at risk' pay, together with the structure of the Executive Directors  service contracts, ensures that poor performance is not rewarded.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| Alignment to  Culture | Kerry has a relentless focus on delivering for our shareholders and other stakeholders and this is fully aligned  with our Remuneration Policy in that employee personal success is directly linked to the success of the Group  through the short-term and long-term incentive plans and targets we operate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |",

They align with the Group's strategic objectives while also ensuring the longterm operational and financial stability of the Group. Targets are set at appropriately stretching levels to achieve threshold, target and maximum payout levels. Performance targets are based predominately on the financial metrics of Volume Growth, Margin Expansion and Cash Conversion (amounting to 80% of maximum opportunity).\n\nVolume Growth and Margin Expansion are key performance metrics as they are the main drivers of Adjusted EPS Growth. Cash Conversion is key to ensuring there are sufficient funds available for reinvestment or for return to shareholders.\n\nStrategic objectives (amounting to 20% of maximum opportunity) are relevant to each Executive Director's specific area of responsibility and are key in ensuring focus on the strategic and functional priorities of the business.\n\nDue to their commercial sensitivity, the Committee is of the view that it would be detrimental to the Company to disclose the targets in advance of or during the relevant performance period. The Committee will disclose the targets and performance against them in next year's Remuneration Report.\n\n## LTIP\n\nThe performance targets under the LTIP are set to reflect the Group's longer-term growth objectives and at a level where maximum opportunity genuinely represents outperformance. The performance measures are currently based on Adjusted EPS Growth, TSR, ROACE and Sustainability metrics.\n\nAdjusted EPS Growth is a key performance metric encompassing all the components of growth important to the Group's stakeholders. EPS Growth is driven by the STIP metrics, Volume Growth and Margin Expansion. TSR is an important indicator of how successful the Group has been in terms of shareholder value creation. ROACE represents a good perspective on the Group's internal rate of return and financial added value for shareholders. ROACE supports the strategic focus on growth and margins through ensuring cash is reinvested to generate appropriate returns. Sustainability metrics are core to maintaining our strategy and long-term sustainable performance and are reviewed at the time of each award.",

The Committee further has the discretion to recover incentives paid within a period of two years from vesting (clawback).\n\nThe key trigger events for the use of malus and clawback provisions include material misstatement of the Company's audited financial results, serious wrongdoing, payment made on the basis of erroneous data, gross misconduct, serious reputational damage and corporate failure.\n\nAny recalculation of the award shall be effected in such manner and subject to such procedures as the Group determines to be measured and appropriate, including repayment of any excess incentive or offset against any amounts due or potentially due to the participant under any vested or unvested incentive awards.\n\nThe Company retains the right to apply the malus and clawback provisions to former directors STIP and LTIP awards. Other elements of remuneration are not subject to malus or clawback provisions.\n\n## Committee Discretion\n\nThe Committee has discretion to adjust the formulaic outcomes under STIP and LTIP to ensure outcomes are aligned to and are reflective of the underlying business performance of the Group.\n\nIn line with plan rules, the Committee may, at its discretion, amend or vary the performance metrics of the STIP and LTIP related incentives, the calculation methodology for those performance metrics and the composition of the TSR peer group when appropriate, in the interest of alignment and fairness.\n\n## Service Contracts\n\nThe CEO and Executive Directors have service contracts in place which can be terminated by either party giving 12 months notice. In addition, all service contracts include pay in lieu of notice, non-compete and non-solicitation provisions of up to 12 months post departure, in order to protect the Group's customer base, employees and intellectual property.\n\nNo ex-gratia severance payments are provided for in respect of the CEO or Executive Directors.\n\n## Remuneration Policy for Recruitment of New Executive Directors\n\nThe Remuneration Committee will determine the contractual terms for new Executive Directors, subject to appropriate professional advice to ensure that these reflect best practice and are subject to the limits specified in the Group's approved policy as set out in this report.\n\nSalary levels for new Executive Directors will take into account the experience and calibre of the individual and his/her remuneration expectations. Where it is appropriate to offer a lower salary initially, a series of increases to the desired salary positioning may be made over subsequent years, subject to individual performance and development in the role.\n\nPension and benefits will be provided in line with the approved policy, with relocation, travel or other expenses provided if necessary.",

        "page_content": "The structure of the variable pay element will be in accordance with and subject to the limits set out in the Group's approved policy detailed above. Different performance measures may be set initially for STIP in the year an Executive Director joins the Group taking into account the responsibilities of the individual and the point in the financial year that he/she joins the Board. Subject to the rules of the scheme, an LTIP award may be granted after joining the Group.\n\nIf it is necessary to buyout incentive pay or benefit arrangements (which would be forfeited on leaving the previous employer) in the case of an external appointment, this would be provided for taking into account the form (cash or shares), timing and expected value (i.e. likelihood of meeting any existing performance criteria) of the remuneration being forfeited. The general policy is that payment should be no more than the Committee considers is required to provide reasonable compensation for remuneration being forfeited. The Group's policy is that the period of notice for new Executive Directors should not exceed 12 months and should include pay in lieu of notice, non-compete and non-solicitation provisions to protect the Group.\n\nThe Committee will ensure that any arrangements agreed will be in the best interests of the Group and shareholders.\n\n## Payments for Loss of Office\n\nIn the event of a Director's departure, the Group's policy on termination is as follows:\n\n- -  the Group will pay any amounts it is required to make in accordance with or in settlement of a Director's statutory employment rights and in line with their employment agreement;\n- -  STIP and LTIP awards will be paid out in line with plan rules on exit (i.e. for good leavers as defined in the LTIP rules), with awards prorated to normal vesting date, subject to performance and a two year holding requirement and prorated to reflect the proportion of the performance period that has elapsed on the date of cessation; and\n- -  the Group will seek to ensure that no more is paid than is warranted in each individual case;\n- -  other payments, such as legal or other professional fees, repatriation or relocation costs and/or outplacement fees, may be paid if it is considered appropriate and at the discretion of the Committee.\n\nA Director's service contract may be terminated without notice and without any further payment or compensation, except for sums accrued up to the date of termination, on the occurrence of certain events such as gross misconduct.\n\n## Change of Control\n\nOutstanding STIP and LTIP awards/options would normally vest and become exercisable on a change of control, subject to plan rules, including the satisfaction of any performance conditions and pro-rating. The Committee may exercise its discretion to vary the level of vesting having regard to the circumstances and reasons for the events giving rise to the change of control.\n\n## Alignment with Workforce Pay and Policies\n\nThe Remuneration Policy provides an overview of the structure that operates for the Group's Executive Directors and senior management. Differences in quantum will depend on size of the role and responsibility, the location of the role and local market practice.\n\nWhen setting the Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors, the Committee considers the pay policies and procedures for the wider workforce. The key difference is that, overall, Remuneration Policy for the Executive Directors is more heavily weighted towards variable pay compared to other employees.\n\nBasic salaries are operated under the same policy as detailed in the Remuneration Policy table with comparator groups used as a reference point. The Committee considers the basic salary increase for the broader workforce when determining the annual salary review for the Executive Directors.\n\nSenior management are invited to participate in both the STIP and LTIP to incentivise performance through the achievement of short-term and long-term objectives and through the holding of shares in the Group.\n\nThe Committee will also seek shareholder approval at a later date for an All Employee Share Plan which will allow for the grant of various share-based awards to employees across the Kerry Group once implemented (subject to local tax and securities laws).\n\n## Consultation with Employees\n\nWhile the Committee currently does not consult directly with employees when setting remuneration for Executive Directors, it does take into account the remuneration structures, policies and practices in the Group as a whole, the feedback from employee engagement activities and the information provided by our external advisors. In addition, matters relating to remuneration which come to the attention of Mr. Tom Moran, in his capacity as the designated workforce engagement Director, are reported to the Committee. The Group has a number of different channels for engagement and the Committee will consider how it can engage more effectively with the wider workforce to explain broader pay policies and practices and the alignment to the Executive Directors' Remuneration Policy.",

        "page_content": "## Consultation with Shareholders\n\nThe Committee considers the guidelines issued by the major institutional shareholders and the bodies representing them and the feedback provided by such proxy agencies and shareholders, when completing its annual and triennial review of the Group's Executive Remuneration policies and practices. During 2020, the Committee Chairperson engaged with a number of major institutional shareholders and proxy agencies on the changes proposed under the 2021 Remuneration Policy Review and on the treatment of inflight LTIP awards impacted by COVID-19. Changes were made to Remuneration Policy proposals as a result of the feedback received, for example quantum increases will be phased over two years and the sustainability metrics to be included in the new LTIP were further finetuned based on shareholder input. Following consultation, the Committee also decided not to amend the formulaic outcome of the 2018 LTIP award. This is despite the strong executive leadership over the three year performance period (and especially in 2020) as well as the resilience of the Kerry business and sustained shareholder return against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe Committee is committed to continued consultation with shareholders regarding its Remuneration Policy.\n\n## Non-Executive Directors' Remuneration Policy\n\nNon-Executive Directors' fees, which are determined by the Executive Directors, fairly reflect the responsibilities and time spent by the non-Executive Directors on the Group's affairs. In determining the fees, which are set within the limits approved by shareholders, consideration is given to both the complexity of the Group and the level of fees paid to non-Executive Directors in comparable companies. Fees are reviewed on an annual basis, and a detailed benchmark review is carried out on a three year basis and any recommendations are presented to the Executive Directors for approval. Non-Executive Directors do not participate in the Group's incentive plans, pension arrangements or other elements of remuneration provided to the Executive Directors. Non-Executive Directors are reimbursed for travel and accommodation expenses (and any personal tax that may be due on those expenses). Non-Executive Directors are encouraged to build up a shareholding in the Company.\n\n## Illustration of Remuneration Policy\n\nThe following diagrams show the minimum, target, maximum and maximum +50% share appreciation, composition balance between the fixed and variable remuneration components for each Executive Director effective for 2021. For illustration purposes target performance for LTIP is reflected as 50% of maximum opportunity. The inner most circle represents the minimum potential scenario for remuneration, with the 2nd circle representing target, the 3rd circle representing maximum potential and the outer circle representing maximum potential plus 50% increase in the LTIP share value.\n\n## Edmond Scanlon\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Marguerite Larkin\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Gerry Behan\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe charts above exclude the effect of any Company share price appreciation except in the 'maximum +50%' scenario.",

Any travel arrangements or travel costs required for business purposes will also be met by the Group, on a net of tax basis.\n\n## Pensions\n\nThe Group CEO participates in the general employee Irish defined contribution scheme and the CFO receives a taxable cash allowance based on a percentage of basic salary, in lieu of pension. The CEO Taste & Nutrition participates in a US defined contribution scheme and a US defined benefit pension scheme.\n\nFollowing the Remuneration Policy review carried out in 2020 pension contribution rates will continue as is for 2021. The pension contribution rate for Executive Directors will be aligned to that of Kerry's general workforce in Ireland (currently a rate of 10%) with effect from 31 December 2022.\n\n## Short-Term Incentive Plan (STIP)\n\nAs part of the policy review, a review of the STIP design and metrics was completed in 2020 to ensure that they remain appropriate, are linked to strategy, consistent with best practice and that the targets are appropriately calibrated. The Committee concluded that while no changes are required to the performance metrics, a number of other changes are required to reflect the increase in the size and complexity of the Group and to ensure that the STIP continues to support the Group's long-term sustainable growth and forward looking strategy as well as attracting, motivating and retaining executives of the highest quality internationally.\n\nThe changes proposed to be implemented from 2021 onwards for STIP are outlined on page 127, with the main changes being:\n\n- -  the maximum STIP opportunity for 2021 will increase from 150% to 200% of basic salary for the CEO and from 125% to 175% of basic salary for the CFO and CEO Taste & Nutrition;\n- -  increase to the weighting on the strategic element (from 10% to 20%) with a proportionate reweighting of the other metrics which remain unchanged; and\n- -  toughening the approach to target setting within the STIP through reducing the target bonus opportunity to 50% of maximum (from 70%), with no softening of expected performance levels;\n- -  increase to 33% (from 25%) the proportion of STIP delivered in shares/options following a two year deferral period.",

The Committee will disclose the targets and performance against them in next year's Remuneration Report.\n\n## Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)\n\nA review of the LTIP metrics was completed in 2020 to ensure that they remain appropriate, linked to strategy and that targets are appropriately stretching. The changes included in the new policy are required to reflect the increase in the size and complexity of the Group and ensure that the LTIP continues to support the Group's longterm sustainable growth ambitions as well as attracting, motivating and retaining executives of the highest quality internationally.\n\nSubject to shareholder approval, the 2021 LTIP award will be granted under a new 2021 LTIP which replaces the current LTIP approved by shareholders in 2013. The changes proposed to be implemented from 2021 onwards for LTIP awards are outlined on page 127, with the main changes being;\n\n- -  the maximum LTIP opportunity will increase from 200% of basic salary for the CEO to 250% in 2021. For the CFO and CEO Taste & Nutrition, the maximum LTIP opportunity will increase from 180%/200% of basic salary to 225% in 2021;\n- -  in line with current best practice and the UK Corporate Governance Code requirements, for LTIP awards granted from 2021 onwards, the two-year deferral period will apply to 100% (previously 50%) of the award that vests;\n- -  consistent with the launch of our 2030 sustainability strategy Beyond the Horizon in October 2020, a new sustainability element will be included in the LTIP, with a weighting of 20% and a proportionate reweighting of the other metrics which remain unchanged;\n- -  the payout % at threshold vesting level is being reduced for TSR from 30% to 25%, while retaining the current stretching threshold and maximum levels; and\n- -  the vesting schedules that apply to the EPS and ROACE performance metrics have also been simplified, with straight line vesting from threshold to maximum.",

The fees have not been increased since then and have not been subject to increases for annual inflation.\n\nIn line with the three year review cycle the Chairman and non-Executive Directors fees were reviewed and benchmarked during 2020. Following the review, the following increases are being applied effective 1 January 2021.\n\n| Fee Type*                        | 2021 Fees \u20ac   | 2020 Fees \u20ac   |\n|----------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Chairman fee                     | 385,000       | 357,500       |\n| Non-Executive Director basic fee | 84,000        | 78,000        |\n| Non-European allowance           | 30,000        | 19,000        |\n\nThe increases represent the equivalent of an annual 2.5% increase since the last review, which is in line with the annual increase available to the general workforce in Ireland over the same three-year period. Following the adjustment, the Chairman's fee and the non-Executive Director fees remain within the market median range. The allowance for non-Executive Directors based outside of Europe has been increased to take account of the extra time commitment required to travel to Board meetings.",

However, in light of the overall performance, and following a request from the Executive Directors not to be considered for any element of their annual bonus in respect of 2020, the Committee agreed that there should be no award under this element of the STIP.\n\n## Final Outturn for 2020\n\nDespite the Executive Directors unrelenting commitment to the business and strong individual performances during the year, they will receive no annual bonus payments under the STIP for 2020.\n\n## Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) 2013 LTIP\n\nThe terms and conditions of the plan were approved by shareholders at the 2013 AGM. The Remuneration Committee approves the terms, conditions and allocation of conditional awards under the Group's LTIP to Executive Directors and senior management. Under this plan, Executive Directors and senior management are invited to participate in conditional awards over shares or share options in the Company.\n\nSubject to performance metrics being met over a three year performance period, the LTIP award will vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant. 50% of the award is delivered at the vesting date with the remaining 50% of the award being delivered following a two year deferral period. This provides for a combined performance period and deferral period of five years for half of the award that vests.\n\nThe first conditional awards under this scheme were made to Executive Directors in 2013. The maximum award that can be made to an individual Executive Director under the LTIP over a 12 month period is equivalent to 180%-200% of basic salary for that period.\n\nAn award may lapse if a participant ceases to be employed within the Group before the vesting date. The market price of the shares on the date of each award outlined above is disclosed in note 27 to the financial statements.\n\nThe proportion of each conditional award which vests will depend on the Adjusted EPS Growth, TSR and ROACE performance of the Group during the relevant three year performance period.",

This measurement is determined by reference to the growth in the Group's adjusted EPS calculated on a constant currency basis in each of the three financial years in the performance period in accordance with the vesting schedule outlined in the following table:\n\n|           | Average Adjusted EPS Growth   | Percentage of the Award Which Vests   |\n|-----------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| Threshold | 6%                            | 25%                                   |\n| Target    | 10%                           | 50%                                   |\n| Maximum   | 12%                           | 100%                                  |\n\nBelow 6% none of the award vests. Vesting between target points is on a straight line basis.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had a particular impact on the EPS metric in 2020 (-9.4%), which negated the strong EPS growth achieved in 2018 (+8.6%) and 2019 (+8.3%). As a result, the threshold level for this metric was not achieved resulting in an award outcome of 0% out of a possible maximum of 50%.\n\n## TSR Performance Test\n\n30% of the award vests according to the Group's TSR performance over the period measured against the TSR performance of a peer group of listed companies over the same three year performance period. The peer group consists of Kerry and the following companies:\n\n| Chr. Hansen     | Givaudan   | Kellogg's       | Sensient Technologies   |\n|-----------------|------------|-----------------|-------------------------|\n| Barry Callebaut | Glanbia    | McCormick & Co. | Symrise                 |\n| Corbion         | Greencore  | Nestl\u00e9          | Tate & Lyle             |\n| Aryzta*         | Danone     | Novozymes       | Unilever                |\n| General Mills   | IFF        | Premier Foods   |                         |\n\nWhen assessing whether the performance hurdle has been met, this measurement is determined by reference to the ranking of Kerry's TSR over the three-year performance period, in comparison with the TSR performance of the companies in the peer group. The awards vest in line with the following table:\n\n| Position of Kerry in the Peer Group   | Percentage of the Award Which Vests   |\n|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| Below median                          | 0%                                    |\n| Median                                | 30%                                   |\n| Between median and 75th percentile    | Straight line between 30% and 100%    |\n| Greater than 75th percentile          | 100%                                  |\n\nThe performance graph below shows Kerry's TSR compared to the peer companies over the three year performance period from 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2020 for the LTIP awards which issued in 2018.

ROACE represents a good perspective on the Group's internal rate of return and financial added value for shareholders. ROACE supports the strategic focus on growth and margins through ensuring cash is reinvested to generate appropriate returns.

In line with best practice guidelines, the Company ensures that the level of share awards granted under all share schemes does not exceed 10% of the Group's share capital over a rolling ten year period, with a further limitation of 5% in any ten year period in respect of discretionary schemes. The dilution resulting from all vested share awards/share options for the ten year period to 31 December 2020 is 0.9%. This level of dilution is well below the maximum dilution level recommended for executive share-based incentive plans.\n\nThe potential future dilution level from unvested share awards/share options as a result of these schemes is a further 0.7%.\n\nThe UK Companies (Miscellaneous Reporting) Regulations 2018 require certain UK incorporated companies to publish the ratio of CEO remuneration to UK staff pay. Although not a requirement for Irish incorporated companies, the ratio of the CEO's total remuneration to that of the median Irish employee is disclosed in the table below, in line with the Group's commitment to ensure that its remuneration policies, practices and reporting reflect best corporate governance practices.\n\nIn providing the CEO ratio we have used Method C as set out in the regulations but have applied the principles of Method A.\n\nTable 12: CEO Ratio\n\n|                                                                          | 2020       | 2019       |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Chief Executive Officer: Total remuneration                              | \u20ac2,323,000 | \u20ac3,991,000 |\n| Median Irish Employee: Total remuneration                                | \u20ac42,137    | \u20ac40,592    |\n| Median Irish Employee: Salary only                                       | \u20ac39,654    | \u20ac37,823    |\n| Median Pay Ratio - Total remuneration                                    | 55x        | 98x        |\n| Median Pay Ratio - Excluding all variable short and long-term incentives | 33x        | 34x        |\n\nThe Committee believes that our senior executives should have a significant proportion of their pay directly linked to Group performance in order to drive alignment with shareholders. A significant portion of the Chief Executive Officer's remuneration is therefore delivered through the Group's short-term and long-term incentive plans where awards are linked to Group performance and share price movements over time. This means that ratios will depend significantly on short-term and long-term incentive outturns and may fluctuate from year to year as a result.\n\nThe CEO pay ratio based on total remuneration has reduced year on year. Performance outturns in 2019 were strong under both the short-term and long-term incentive plans with both outturns exceeding target. In 2020, as reported in previous sections, there was no STIP payout and the LTIP award for the three-year period ended 31 December 2020 had a lower vesting outturn compared to prior years. As a result, the total remuneration for the Chief Executive Officer has reduced in 2020 as compared to 2019. In addition, the single figure amount for the CEO reflects a 25% voluntary reduction in basic salary for three months in 2020 in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn comparison the remuneration earned by the median Irish employee has increased year on year due to annual pay increases with basic pay levels maintained despite COVID-19. As the median Irish employee does not participate in the Group's short-term or long-term performance related incentive plans, the Committee has provided the median pay ratio excluding these variable pay elements again in 2020 and this ratio has also reduced year on year.",

In the prior year, materiality was based on approximately 5% of profit before taxation and non-trading items.\n- -  \u20ac34.5 million (2019: \u20ac38 million) - Consolidated financial statements.\n- - \u20ac8 million (2019: \u20ac8 million) - Company financial statements.\n- - Based on approximately 1% of Net Assets.\n\n## Audit scope\n\n- -  Taken together, the reporting components where an audit of the full financial information was performed accounted for in excess of 90% of Consolidated revenues and approximately 89% of Consolidated profit before taxation and non-trading items.\n- -  We conducted audit work in 43 reporting components. We selected these components due to their size or characteristics and to ensure appropriate audit coverage. An audit of the full financial information of 33 components was performed and specified procedures on selected account balances of a further 10 components were performed. We also performed audit work at each of the principal shared service centres.\n\n## Key audit matters\n\n- -  Business combinations.\n- -  Goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets impairment assessment.\n- -  Income taxes.\n\nAs part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. In particular, we looked at where the directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.\n\n## Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors' professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by the auditors, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures thereon, were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.",

Management judgement and estimation is required in the measurement of uncertain tax positions in the context of the recognition of current and deferred tax assets/liabilities.\n\nWe determined this to be a key audit matter due to its inherent complexity and the estimation and judgement involved in the measurement of uncertain tax positions in the context of the recognition of current and deferred tax assets/liabilities.\n\n## How we tailored the audit scope\n\nWe tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed sufficient work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the Group, the accounting processes and controls, including those performed at the Group's shared service centres and the industry in which the Group operates.\n\nWe obtained an understanding of the Group tax strategy through discussions with management and the Group's in-house tax specialists.\n\nThe team, assisted by PwC International and Irish taxation specialists, challenged judgements used and estimates made by management to measure uncertain tax positions in the context of the recognition of current and deferred tax assets/ liabilities. This included obtaining explanations regarding the tax treatment applied to material transactions and evidence to corroborate management's explanations. Such evidence included management's communications with local tax authorities and copies of the tax advice obtained by management from its external tax advisors including transfer pricing studies and the assessment of the impact of COVID-19 on these studies where appropriate.\n\nBased on the evidence obtained, while noting the inherent uncertainty with such tax matters, we determined the measurement of uncertain tax positions in the context of the recognition of current and deferred tax assets/liabilities as at 31 December 2020 to be within an acceptable range of reasonable estimates.\n\nThe Group team were responsible for the scope and direction of the audit. Where the work was performed by component auditors, we determined the level of involvement the Group team needed to have to be able to conclude whether sufficient appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the consolidated financial statements as a whole.\n\nThe Group is structured along two operating segments: Taste & Nutrition and Consumer Foods across 31 countries. The majority of the Group's components are supported by one of four principal shared service centres in Ireland, Malaysia, and the United States.\n\nWe determined that an audit of the full financial information should be performed at 33 components due to their size or risk characteristics and to ensure appropriate coverage. These 33 components span 10 countries and include components that control central Group functions such as Treasury and Employee Benefits. Specific audit procedures on certain balances and transactions were performed at 10 of the remaining reporting components primarily to ensure appropriate audit coverage. Taken collectively these components represent the principal business of the Group and account for in excess of 90% of Group revenue and approximately 89% of Group profit before taxation and non-trading items.\n\nThe Group team performed the audit of the central function components and component auditors within PwC ROI and from other PwC network firms, operating under our instruction, performed the audit on all other in scope components and the required supporting audit work at each of the four principal shared service centres.\n\nDue to the current restrictions on travel and social distancing measures, enacted as a response to the global pandemic, the Group engagement leader and senior members of the Group engagement team used video conferencing to facilitate our oversight of the component auditor work and had video meetings and discussions with management and component audit teams in Ireland, the USA, Brazil, Mexico and the Asia Pacific region.\n\nThe meetings with our component teams confirmed their audit approach. The meetings also involved discussing and understanding the significant audit risk areas, and obtaining updates on local laws and regulations and other relevant matters. In addition to the meetings noted above, the Group team interacted regularly with the component teams during all stages of the audit. We received a detailed memorandum of examination on work performed and relevant findings in addition to an audit report which supplemented our understanding of the individual components. In addition to this, the Group engagement team reviewed certain audit working papers of significant components. Post audit conference calls were held with all in scope audit teams to discuss their audit findings.\n\nThis, together with audit procedures performed by the Group team over IT systems, treasury, post-retirement benefits, the consolidation process and key audit matters including uncertain tax positions, impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets, and business combinations, gave us the evidence we needed for our opinion on the consolidated financial statements as a whole.",

These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole.\n\nBased on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:\n\n|                                   | Consolidated   financial   statements                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Company  financial  statements                                                                              |\n|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Overall  materiality              | \u20ac34.5 million   (2019: \u20ac38 million).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | \u20ac8 million   (2019: \u20ac8 million).                                                                            |\n| How we  determined it             | Approximately 5% of  three-year average profit  before taxation and  non-trading items. In the  prior year, materiality was  calculated using 5% of  profit before taxation and                                                                                                           | Approximately 1%  of Net Assets.                                                                            |\n| Rationale for  benchmark  applied | non-trading items. We applied this  benchmark because  in our view this is a  metric against which the  recurring performance of  the Group is commonly  measured by its  stakeholders and it results  in using a materiality level  that excludes the impact  of volatility in earnings. | The entity is a  holding Company  whose main  activity is the  management of  investments in  subsidiaries. |\n\nWe agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above \u20ac1.7 million (Group audit) (2019: \u20ac1.8 million) and \u20ac400,000 (Company audit) (2019: \u20ac400,000) as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.\n\n## Conclusions relating to going concern\n\nOur evaluation of the directors' assessment of the Group and Company's ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included:\n\n- -  we also considered whether the assumptions underlying the base case were consistent with related assumptions used in other areas of the entity's business activities, for example in testing for nonfinancial asset impairment;\n- -  evaluating management's base case and downside scenarios for the period of the going concern assessment (being the period of 12 months from the date on which the financial statements are authorised for issue), and challenging the key assumptions. In evaluating these forecasts we considered the Group's historic performance, its past record of achieving strategic objectives and management's assessment of the likely impact which COVID-19 may have on financial performance and liquidity for a period of 12 months from the date on which the financial statements are authorised for issue;\n- -  considering the Group's available financing and maturity profile to assess liquidity through the going concern assessment period;\n- -  performing our own independent sensitivity analysis to assess further appropriate downside scenarios.\n- -  testing the mathematical integrity of the forecasts and the models and reconciling these to board approved budgets; and\n\nBased on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group's or the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for the period of the going concern assessment.\n\nIn auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.\n\nHowever, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this conclusion is not a guarantee as to the Group's or the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.\n\nIn relation to the Company's reporting on how they have applied the UK Corporate Governance Code, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to the directors' statement in the financial statements about whether the directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nWe are required to report if the directors' statement relating to going concern in accordance with Rule 9.8.6 R (3) of the Listing Rules of the UK Financial Conduct Authority and Rule 6.1.82 (3) (a) of the Listing Rules for Euronext Dublin is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit. We have nothing to report in respect of this responsibility.\n\nOur responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report.",

        "page_content": "## Reporting on other information\n\nThe other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and our auditors' report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, any form of assurance thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, we are required to perform procedures to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report based on these responsibilities.\n\nWith respect to the Directors' Report, we also considered whether the disclosures required by the Companies Act 2014 (excluding the information included in the 'Non Financial Statement' as defined by that Act on which we are not required to report) have been included.\n\nBased on the responsibilities described above and our work undertaken in the course of the audit, ISAs (Ireland), the Companies Act 2014 (CA14) and the Listing Rules applicable to the Company (Listing Rules) require us to also report certain opinions and matters as described below (required by ISAs (Ireland) unless otherwise stated).\n\n## Directors' Report\n\n- -  In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Directors' Report (excluding the information included in the 'Non Financial Statement' on which we are not required to report) for the year ended 31 December 2020 is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with the applicable legal requirements. (CA14)\n- -  Based on our knowledge and understanding of the Group and Company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit, we did not identify any material misstatements in the Directors' Report (excluding the information included in the 'Non Financial Statement' on which we are not required to report). (CA14)\n\n## Corporate governance statement\n\n- -  In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit of the financial statements,\n- -  the information required by Section 1373(2)(d) of the Companies Act 2014 included in the Report of the Directors;\n- -  the description of the main features of the internal control and risk management systems in relation to the financial reporting process included in the Corporate Governance Report; and\n\nis consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with section 1373(2) of the Companies Act 2014. (CA14)\n\n- -  In our opinion, based on the work undertaken during the course of the audit of the financial statements, the information required by section 1373(2)(a),(b),(e) and (f) of the Companies Act 2014 and regulation 6 of the European Union (Disclosure of Non-Financial and Diversity Information by certain large undertakings and Groups) Regulations 2017 is contained in the Directors' Report. (CA14)\n- -  Based on our knowledge and understanding of the Company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit of the financial statements, we have not identified material misstatements in the description of the main features of the internal control and risk management systems in relation to the financial reporting process and the information required by section 1373(2)(d) of the Companies Act 2014 included in the Corporate Governance Report and the Report of the Directors. (CA14)\n\nThe directors' assessment of the prospects of the Group and of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency or liquidity of the Group\n\nWe have nothing material to add or to draw attention to regarding:\n\n- -   The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated.\n- -  The directors' confirmation on page 106 of the Annual Report that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.\n- -  The directors' explanation on page 83 of the Annual Report as to how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.\n\nWe have nothing to report having performed a review of the directors' statement that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group and the directors' statement in relation to the longer-term viability of the Group. Our review was substantially less in scope than an audit and only consisted of making inquiries and considering the directors' process supporting their statements; checking that the statements are in alignment with the relevant provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the 'Code'); and considering whether the statements are consistent with the knowledge and understanding of the Group and the Company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (Ireland) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nOur audit testing might include testing complete populations of certain transactions and balances, possibly using data auditing techniques. However, it typically involves selecting a limited number of items for testing, rather than testing complete populations. We will often seek to target particular items for testing based on their size or risk characteristics. In other cases, we will use audit sampling to enable us to draw a conclusion about the population from which the sample is selected.\n\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the IAASA website at:\n\nhttps://www.iaasa.ie/getmedia/b2389013-1cf6458b-9b8f-a98202dc9c3a/Description\\_of\\_auditors\\_ responsibilities\\_for\\_audit.pdf\n\nThis description forms part of our auditors' report.\n\n## Use of this report\n\nThis report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company's members as a body in accordance with section 391 of the Companies Act 2014 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.",

Statement of accounting policies\n\n## General information\n\nKerry Group plc is a public limited company incorporated in the Republic of Ireland. The registered number is 111471 and registered office address is Prince's Street, Tralee, Co. Kerry, V92 EH11, Ireland. The principal activities of the Company and its subsidiaries are described in the Business Reviews and note 35 'Group entities'.\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of Kerry Group plc have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards ('IFRS'), International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee ('IFRIC') interpretations and those parts of the Companies Act, 2014 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The financial statements comprise the Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Company Balance Sheet, the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, the Company Statement of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, the Company Statement of Cash Flows and the notes to the financial statements. The financial statements include the information in the remuneration report that is described as being an integral part of the financial statements. Both the Parent Company and Group financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRS adopted by the European Union ('EU') which comprise standards and interpretations approved by the International Accounting Standards Board ('IASB'). The Group financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation. IFRS adopted by the EU differs in certain respects from IFRS issued by the IASB. References to IFRS hereafter refer to IFRS adopted by the EU.\n\nThe Parent Company's financial statements are prepared using accounting policies consistent with the accounting policies applied to the consolidated financial statements by the Group.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of certain financial assets and liabilities (including derivative financial instruments) and financial asset investments which are held at fair value. Assets classified as held for sale are stated at the lower of carrying value and fair value less costs to sell. The investments in associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements contained herein are presented in euro, which is the functional currency of the Parent Company, Kerry Group plc. The functional currencies of the Group's main subsidiaries are euro, US dollar and sterling.\n\nIn the 2020 consolidated financial statements, the Group has re-presented corresponding 2019 balances to align with current year presentation in note 22 'Analysis of financial instruments by category', note 23 'Financial instruments' and note 28 'Cash flow components' to reflect the inclusion of lease liabilities in the Group's definition of total net debt.\n\nCertain income statement headings and other financial measures included in the consolidated financial statements are not defined by IFRS. The Group make this distinction to give a better understanding of the financial performance of the business.\n\nThe consolidated and company financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis of accounting. The Directors have considered the Group's business activities and how it generates value, together with the main trends and factors likely to affect future development, business performance including liquidity and access to financing as outlined in note 23, and position of the Group including the impact of the current COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the uncertainty of the ongoing duration and impact of the pandemic on mobility restrictions in different countries around the world, additional stressed scenarios, reflecting different levels and timing of the recovery, have been considered. This analysis indicated that, notwithstanding the current global pandemic, it does not affect the Group's ability to continue as a going concern.\n\nThere are no material uncertainties that cast a significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern over a period of at least 12 months.\n\n## Basis of consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and the entities controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries), all of which prepare financial statements up to 31 December. Accounting policies of subsidiaries are consistent with the policies adopted by the Group. Control is achieved where the Company has the power over the investee, has exposure or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to use its power to affect its returns.\n\nSubsidiaries\n\nThe results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the financial year are included in the Consolidated Income Statement from the date the Company gains control until the date the Company ceases to control the subsidiary. All inter-group transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation.\n\n## Associates\n\nAssociates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control, generally accompanying a shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies. Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and are initially recognised at cost. On acquisition of the investment in associate, any excess of the cost of the investment over the Group's share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the investee is recognised as goodwill, which is included within the carrying value of the investment.",

        "page_content": "## 1.   Statement of accounting policies (continued)\n\nBasis of consolidation (continued)\n\nThe Group's share of its associates' post-acquisition profits or losses is recognised in 'Share of associates and joint ventures (profit)/loss after taxation' within Trading Profit in the Consolidated Income Statement, and its share of post-acquisition movements in reserves is recognised in reserves. The cumulative post-acquisition movements are adjusted against the carrying amount of the investment, less any impairment in value. Where indicators of impairment arise, the carrying amount of the associate is tested for impairment by comparing its recoverable amount with its carrying amount.\n\nAssociates (continued)\n\nUnrealised gains arising from transactions with associates are eliminated to the extent of the Group's interest in the entity. Unrealised losses are eliminated to the extent that they do not provide evidence of impairment. The accounting policies of associates are amended where necessary to ensure consistency of accounting treatment at Group level.\n\n## Joint ventures\n\nJoint ventures are all entities over which the Group has joint control, whereby the Group has rights to the net assets of the arrangement, rather than rights to its assets and obligations for its liabilities. Investments in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and are initially recognised at cost. On acquisition of the investment in joint venture, any excess of the cost of the investment over the Group's share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the investee is recognised as goodwill, which is included within the carrying value of the investment.\n\nThe Group's share of its joint ventures post-acquisition profits or losses is recognised in 'Share of associates and joint ventures' (profit)/loss after taxation' within Trading Profit in the Consolidated Income Statement, and its share of post-acquisition movements in reserves is recognised in reserves until the date on which joint control ceases. The cumulative post-acquisition movements are adjusted against the carrying amount of the investment, less any impairment in value. Where indicators of impairment arise, the carrying amount of the joint venture is tested for impairment by comparing its recoverable amount with its carrying amount.\n\nUnrealised gains arising from transactions with joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Group's interest in the entity. Unrealised losses are eliminated to the extent that they do not provide evidence of impairment. The accounting policies of joint ventures are amended where necessary to ensure consistency of accounting treatment at Group level.\n\n## Revenue\n\nRevenue represents the value of the consideration received or receivable, for taste and nutrition applications and consumer foods chilled food products, from third party customers. Revenue is recorded at invoice value, net of discounts, allowances, volume and promotional rebates and excludes VAT. Revenue is recognised when control of the products has transferred, which is usually upon shipment, or in line with terms agreed with individual customers.\n\nRevenue is recorded when there is no unfulfilled obligation on the part of the Group. An estimate is made on the basis of historical sales returns and is recorded to allocate these returns to the same period as the original revenue is recorded. Rebates and discounts are provided for based on agreements or contracts with customers, agreed promotional arrangements and accumulated experience using the expected value method. Any unutilised accrual is released after assessment that the likelihood of such a claim being made is highly improbable.\n\nThe Group disaggregates revenue by End Use Market (EUM) and primary geographic market. An EUM is defined as the market in which the end consumer or customer of Kerry's product operates. The economic factors within the EUMs of Food, Beverage and Pharma which affect the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are similar.\n\n## Trading profit\n\nTrading profit refers to the operating profit generated by the businesses before intangible asset amortisation and gains or losses generated from non-trading items. Trading profit represents operating profit before specific items that are not reflective of underlying trading performance and therefore hinder comparison of the trading performance of the Group's businesses, either year-on-year or with other businesses.\n\n## Segmental analysis\n\nOperating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal management structure of the Group and the internal financial information provided to the Group's Chief Operating Decision Maker (the Executive Directors) who is responsible for making strategic decisions, allocating resources, monitoring and assessing the performance of each segment. Trading profit as reported internally by segment is the key measure utilised in assessing the performance of operating segments within the Group. Other Corporate activities, such as the cost of corporate stewardship and the cost of the KerryConnect programme, are reported along with the elimination of inter-group activities under the heading 'Group Eliminations and Unallocated'. Intangible asset amortisation, non-trading items, net finance costs and income taxes are managed on a centralised basis and therefore, these items are not allocated between operating segments and are not reported per segment in note 2.\n\nThe Group has determined it has two reportable segments: Taste & Nutrition and Consumer Foods. The Taste & Nutrition segment is the global leader in the development of taste and nutrition solutions for the food, beverage and pharmaceutical industries across Ireland, Europe, Americas and APMEA (Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa). Our broad technology foundation, customer-centric business model, and industry leading integrated solutions capability make Kerry the co-creation partner of choice. The Consumer Foods segment is an industry-leading manufacturer of chilled food products primarily in Ireland and UK markets.",

Increasing/ (decreasing) an asset's expected life or its residual value would result in a (decreased)/increased depreciation charge to the Consolidated Income Statement as well as an increase/(decrease) in the carrying value of the asset.\n\nThe useful lives of Group assets are determined by management at the time the assets are acquired and reviewed annually for appropriateness. These lives are based on historical experience with similar assets as well as anticipation of future events, which may impact their life, such as changes in technology. Historically, changes in useful lives or residual values have not resulted in material changes to the Group's depreciation charge.\n\nAssets in the course of construction for production or administrative purposes are carried at cost less any recognised impairment loss. Cost includes professional fees and other directly attributable costs. Depreciation of these assets commences when the assets are ready for their intended use, on the same basis as other property assets.\n\n## Leasing\n\nAt the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet. The right-of-use asset is measured at cost, which consists of the initial measurement of the lease liability, any initial direct costs incurred by the Group in setting up/entering into the lease, an estimate of any costs to dismantle and remove the asset at the end of the lease and any payments made in advance of the lease commencement date (net of any incentive received).\n\nThe Group depreciates right-of-use assets on a straightline basis from the lease commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life or the end of the lease term. The carrying amounts of right-of-use assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. An impairment loss is recognised when the carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount.\n\nThe Group measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments unpaid at that date, discounted using the applicable incremental borrowing rate. Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprises of fixed or variable payments (based on an index or rate), amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee and payments arising from options reasonably certain to be exercised.\n\nSubsequent to the initial measurement, the liability will be reduced for payments made and increased for the interest applied and it is remeasured to reflect any reassessment or contract modifications. When the lease liability is remeasured, the corresponding adjustment is reflected in the right-of-use asset or in the Consolidated Income Statement if the right-of-use asset is already reduced to zero.\n\nThe Group has elected to record short-term leases of less than 12 months and leases of low-value assets as defined in IFRS 16 as an operating expense in the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nThe Group has also elected not to separate non-lease components from lease components, and instead account for each lease component and any associated nonlease components as a single lease component further increasing the lease liability.\n\n## Assets classified as held for sale\n\nAssets are classified as held for sale if their carrying value will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met if, at the financial year end, the sale is highly probable, the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition, management is committed to the sale and the sale is expected to be completed within one year from the date of classification.\n\nAssets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying value and fair value less costs to sell.\n\n## Intangible assets\n\nGoodwill arises on business combinations and represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group's interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary entity at the date control is achieved.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous Irish/ UK GAAP amounts subject to impairment testing. Goodwill written off to reserves under Irish/UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.\n\nAt the date control is achieved, goodwill is allocated for the purpose of impairment testing to groups of cash generating units (CGUs) provided they represent the lowest level at which management monitor goodwill for impairment purposes. Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for indications of impairment at least annually and is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses, where identified. Impairment is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement and is not subsequently reversed. On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill (not previously written off to reserves) is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.",

Statement of accounting policies (continued)\n\n## Intangible assets (continued)\n\nBrand related intangibles acquired as part of a business combination are valued at their fair value at the date control is achieved. Intangible assets determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortised and are tested for impairment at least annually. Indefinite life intangible assets are those for which there is no foreseeable limit to their expected useful life. In arriving at the conclusion that these brand related intangibles have an indefinite life, management considers the nature and type of the intangible asset, the absence of any legal or other limits on the assets' use, the fact the business and products have a track record of stability, the high barriers to market entry and the Group's commitment to continue to invest for the long-term to extend the period over which the intangible asset is expected to continue to provide economic benefits. The classification of intangible assets as indefinite is reviewed annually.\n\nBrand related intangibles\n\nFinite life brand related intangible assets are amortised over the period of their expected useful lives, which predominantly range from 2 to 20 years, by charging equal annual instalments to the Consolidated Income Statement. The useful life used to amortise finite intangible assets relates to the future performance of the assets acquired and management's estimate of the period over which economic benefit will be derived from the asset. Historically, changes in useful lives have not resulted in material changes to the Group's amortisation charge.\n\n## Computer software\n\nComputer software separately acquired, including computer software which is not an integral part of an item of computer hardware, is stated at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. Cost comprises purchase price and other directly attributable costs.\n\nCosts relating to the development of computer software for internal use are capitalised once the recognition criteria outlined as follows are met:\n\n- -it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits;\n- -an asset can be separately identified;\n- -the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably;\n- -the cost of the asset can be measured reliably.\n- -it is probable that the expected future economic benefits that are attributable to the asset will flow to the entity; and\n\nComputer software is amortised over its expected useful life, which ranges from 3 to 7 years, by charging equal annual instalments to the Consolidated Income Statement. Amortisation commences when the assets are ready for use.\n\n## Impairment of non-financial assets\n\nGoodwill and other intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation. They are tested annually for impairment or when indications exist that the asset may be impaired. For the purpose of assessing impairment, these assets are allocated to groups of cash generating units (CGUs) using a reasonable and consistent basis.\n\nAn impairment loss is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement for the amount by which the asset's carrying value exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less costs to sell or its value in use. Value in use is determined as the discounted future cash flows of the CGU. The key assumptions during the financial year for the value in use calculations are discount rates, cash flows and growth rates.\n\nWhen an impairment loss (other than on goodwill) subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, not exceeding its carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Impairment is reviewed by assessing the asset's value in use when compared to its carrying value.\n\nThe carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. An impairment loss is recognised when the carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost includes raw materials, direct labour and all other expenditure incurred in the normal course of business in bringing the products to their present location and condition. Cost is calculated at the weighted average cost incurred in acquiring inventories. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price of inventory on hand less all further costs to completion and all costs expected to be incurred in distribution and selling. Write-downs of inventories are primarily recognised under 'Raw materials and consumables' in the Consolidated Income Statement.\n\n## Income taxes\n\nIncome taxes include both current and deferred taxes. Income taxes are charged or credited to the Consolidated Income Statement except when they relate to items charged or credited directly in other comprehensive income or shareholders' equity. In this instance the income taxes are also charged or credited to other comprehensive income or shareholders' equity.\n\nThe current tax charge is calculated as the amount payable based on taxable profit and the tax rates applying to those profits in the financial year together with adjustments relating to prior years. Deferred taxes are calculated using the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.",

        "page_content": "## 1.   Statement of accounting policies (continued)\n\n## Income taxes (continued)\n\nThe Group is subject to uncertainties, including tax audits, in any of the jurisdictions in which it operates. The Group accounts for uncertain tax positions in line with IFRIC 23 'Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments'. The Group considers each uncertain tax treatment separately or together with one or more uncertain tax treatments based on which approach better predicts the resolution of the uncertainty. If the Group concludes that it is not probable that a taxation authority will accept an uncertain tax treatment the Group reflects the effect of the uncertainty in determining the related taxable profit, tax bases, unused tax losses, unused tax credits or tax rate. The Group reflects the effect of uncertainty for each uncertain tax treatment using an expected value approach or a most likely approach depending on which method the Group expects to better predict the resolution of the uncertainty. The unit of account for recognition purposes is the income tax/deferred tax assets or liabilities and the Group does not provide separately for uncertain tax positions. When the final tax outcome for these items is different from amounts recorded, such differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax in the period in which such a determination is made, as well as the Group's cash position.\n\nDeferred taxes are calculated based on the temporary differences that arise between the tax base of the asset or liability and its carrying value in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Deferred taxes are recognised on all temporary differences in existence at the balance sheet date except for:\n\n- -temporary differences which arise on investments in subsidiaries where the timing of the reversal is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n- -temporary differences which arise from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction does not affect accounting or taxable profit or loss, or on the initial recognition of goodwill for which a tax deduction is not available; and\n\nThe recognition of a deferred tax asset is based upon whether it is probable that sufficient and suitable taxable profits will be available in the future, against which the reversal of temporary differences can be deducted. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date.\n\nCurrent income tax assets and current income tax liabilities are offset where there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and the Group intends to settle on a net basis. Deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are offset where there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts, the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle on a net basis.\n\n## Retirement benefits obligation\n\nPayments to defined contribution plans are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement as they fall due and any contributions outstanding at the financial year end are included as an accrual in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nActuarial valuations for accounting purposes are carried out at each balance sheet date in relation to defined benefit plans, using the projected unit credit method, to determine the schemes' liabilities and the related cost of providing benefits. Scheme assets are accounted for at fair value using bid prices.\n\nCurrent service cost and net interest cost are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement as they arise. Past service cost, which can be positive or negative, is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement. Gains or losses on the curtailment or settlement of a plan are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement when the curtailment or settlement occurs. Re-measurement on retirement benefits obligation, comprising actuarial gains and losses and the return on plan assets (excluding amounts included in net interest cost) are recognised in full in the period in which they occur in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.\n\nThe defined benefit liability recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation less the fair value of any plan assets. Defined benefit assets are also recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet but are limited to the present value of available refunds from, and reductions in future contributions to, the plan.\n\n## Provisions\n\n- -the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event;\n\nProvisions can be distinguished from other types of liability by considering the events that give rise to the obligation and the degree of uncertainty as to the amount or timing of the liability. These are recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet when:\n\n- -it is probable that the Group will be required to settle the obligation; and\n- -a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.\n\nThe amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the amount required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date, after taking account of the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation.\n\nThe outcome depends on future events which are by their nature uncertain. In assessing the likely outcome, management bases its assessment on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable in the circumstances. Provisions are disclosed in note 24 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Non-trading items\n\nCertain items, by virtue of their nature and amount, are disclosed separately in order for the user to obtain a proper understanding of the financial information. These items relate to events or circumstances that are not related to normal trading activities and are labelled collectively as 'non-trading items'.\n\nNon-trading items include gains or losses on the disposal of businesses, disposal of assets (non-current assets and assets classified as held for sale), costs in preparation of disposal of assets, material restructuring costs and material transaction, integration and restructuring costs associated with acquisitions. Non-trading items are disclosed in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.",

        "page_content": "## 1.   Statement of accounting policies (continued)\n\n## Research and development expenditure\n\nExpenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the financial year it is incurred.\n\nDevelopment expenditure is assessed and capitalised as an internally generated intangible asset only if it meets all of the following criteria:\n\n- -it is intended to complete the asset for use or sale;\n- -it is technically feasible to complete the asset for use or sale;\n- -the Group has the ability to use or sell the intangible asset;\n- -adequate resources are available to complete the asset for sale or use; and\n- -it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits;\n- -the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably.\n\nCapitalised development costs are amortised over their expected economic lives. Where no internally generated intangible asset can be recognised, product development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the financial year it is incurred. Accordingly, the Group has not capitalised product development expenditure to date.\n\n## Grants\n\nGrants of a capital nature are accounted for as deferred income in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and are released to the Consolidated Income Statement at the same rates as the related assets are depreciated. Grants of a revenue nature are credited to the Consolidated Income Statement to offset the matching expenditure.\n\n## Dividends\n\nDividends are accounted for when they are approved, through the retained earnings reserve. Dividends proposed do not meet the definition of a liability until such time as they have been approved. Dividends are disclosed in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Share-based payments\n\nThe Group has granted share-based payments to Executive Directors and senior executives under a long-term incentive plan and to Executive Directors under a shortterm incentive plan.\n\nThe equity-settled share-based awards granted under these plans are measured at the fair value of the equity instrument at the date of grant. The cost of the award is charged to the Consolidated Income Statement over the vesting period of the awards based on the probable number of awards that will eventually vest, with a corresponding credit to shareholders' equity.\n\nFor the purposes of the long-term incentive plan, the fair value of the award is measured using the Monte Carlo Pricing Model. For the short-term incentive plan, the fair value of the expense equates directly to the cash value of the portion of the short-term incentive plan that will be settled by way of shares/share options.\n\nAt the balance sheet date, the estimate of the level of vesting is reviewed and any adjustment necessary is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement and in the Statement of Changes in Equity. Share-based payments are disclosed in note 27 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Foreign currency\n\nForeign currency transactions are translated into functional currency at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Exchange differences arising from either the retranslation of the resulting monetary assets or liabilities at the exchange rate at the balance sheet date or from the settlement of the balance at a different rate are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement when they occur.\n\nOn consolidation, the income statements of foreign currency subsidiaries are translated into euro at the average exchange rate. If this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, a weighted average rate is used. The balance sheets of such subsidiaries are translated at the rate of exchange at the balance sheet date. Resulting exchange differences arising on the translation of foreign currency subsidiaries are taken directly to a separate component of shareholders' equity.\n\nGoodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of foreign subsidiaries are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign subsidiaries and are translated at the closing rate.\n\nOn disposal of a foreign currency subsidiary, the cumulative translation difference for that foreign subsidiary is recycled to the Consolidated Income Statement as part of the profit or loss on disposal.\n\n## Borrowing costs\n\nBorrowing costs incurred for qualifying assets, which take a substantial period of time to construct, are added to the cost of the asset during the period of time required to complete and prepare the asset for its intended use. Other borrowing costs are expensed to the Consolidated Income Statement in the period in which they are incurred.\n\n## Business combinations\n\nThe acquisition method of accounting is used for the acquisition of subsidiaries. The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate fair value of the consideration given. The acquiree's identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 'Business Combinations' are recognised at their fair value at the date the Group assumes control of the acquiree. Acquisition related costs are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement as incurred. If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date fair value of the Group's previously held investment in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date through profit or loss.\n\nCertain assets and liabilities are not recognised at their fair value at the date control was achieved as they are accounted for using other applicable IFRSs. These include deferred tax assets/liabilities and also any assets related to employee benefit arrangements.\n\nIf the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, the Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the valuation of the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired is still in progress. Those provisional amounts are adjusted during the measurement period of one year from the date control is achieved when additional information is obtained about facts and circumstances which would have affected the amounts recognised as of that date.",

Statement of accounting policies (continued)\n\n## Business combinations (continued)\n\nWhere applicable, the consideration for the acquisition includes any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement measured at fair value at the date control is achieved. Subsequent changes in such fair values are adjusted against the cost of acquisition where they qualify as measurement period adjustments. All other subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability are accounted for in accordance with relevant IFRSs.\n\nAny fair value adjustments in relation to acquisitions completed prior to 1 January 2010 have been accounted for under IFRS 3 'Business Combinations (2004)'.\n\n## Investments in subsidiaries\n\nInvestments in subsidiaries held by the Parent Company are carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.\n\n## Investments in associates and joint ventures\n\nInvestments in associates and joint ventures held by the Group are accounted for using the equity method, after initially being recognised at cost in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n## Financial instruments\n\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Consolidated Balance Sheet when the Group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are initially measured at fair value plus transaction costs, except for those classified as fair value through profit or loss, which are initially measured at fair value.\n\nAll financial assets are recognised and derecognised on a trade date basis, where the purchase or sale of a financial asset is under a contract whose terms require delivery of the financial asset within the timeframe of the market concerned.\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are offset and presented on a net basis in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, only if the Group holds an enforceable legal right of set off for such amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or to realise an asset and settle the liability simultaneously. In all other instances they are presented gross in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nThe Group classifies its financial assets in the following measurement categories:\n\n- (either through OCI or through profit or loss); and\n- -those to be measured subsequently at fair value\n- -those to be measured at amortised cost.\n\nThe classification depends on the Group's business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual terms of the cash flows. For assets measured at fair value, gains and losses will either be recorded in profit or loss or OCI. For investments in equity instruments that are not held for trading, this will depend on whether the Group has made an irrevocable election at the time of initial recognition to account for the equity investment at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI).\n\n## Debt instruments:\n\n- -Amortised cost: Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows, where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest, are measured at amortised cost. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition is recognised directly in the Consolidated Income Statement. Impairment losses are presented in the Consolidated Income Statement.\n\nSubsequent measurement of debt instruments depend on the Group's business model for managing the asset and the cash flow characteristics of the asset. There are three measurement categories into which the Group classifies its debt instruments:\n\n- -FVOCI: Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows and for selling the financial assets, where the assets' cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest, are measured at FVOCI. The Group have no debt instruments measured at FVOCI.\n- -FVPL: Assets that do not meet the criteria for amortised cost or FVOCI are measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL). In addition, assets that are irrevocably designated as FVPL at origination to eliminate or significantly reduce an accounting mismatch are also measured at FVPL. A gain or loss on a debt investment that is subsequently measured at FVPL is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.\n\n## Equity instruments:\n\nThe Group subsequently measures all equity investments at fair value. Where the Group's management has elected to present fair value gains and losses on equity investments in OCI, there is no subsequent reclassification of fair value gains and losses to the Consolidated Income Statement following the derecognition of the investment. Dividends from such investments continue to be recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement when the Group's right to receive payments is established.\n\nChanges in the fair value of financial assets measured at FVPL (Rabbi Trust assets) are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement. Impairment losses (and reversal of impairment losses) on equity investments measured at FVOCI are not reported separately from other changes in fair value.\n\n## Trade and other receivables:\n\nTrade receivables are amounts due from customers for goods sold or services performed in the ordinary course of business. Trade receivables are recognised initially at the amount of consideration that is unconditional unless they contain significant financing components, when they are recognised at fair value. The Group holds the trade receivables with the objective to collect the contractual cash flows and therefore measures them subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents:\n\nCash and cash equivalents carried at amortised cost consists of cash at bank and in hand, bank overdrafts held by the Group and short-term bank deposits with a maturity of three months or less from the date of placement. Cash at bank and in hand and short-term bank deposits are shown under current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Bank overdrafts are shown within 'Borrowings and overdrafts' in current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet but are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the Statement of Cash Flows. The carrying amount of these assets and liabilities approximates to their fair value.",

Statement of accounting policies (continued)\n\n## Financial instruments (continued)\n\nFinancial liabilities measured at amortised cost Other non-derivative financial liabilities consist primarily of trade and other payables and borrowings. Trade and other payables are stated at amortised cost, which approximates to their fair value given the short-term nature of these liabilities. Trade and other payables are non-interest bearing.\n\nDebt instruments are initially recorded at fair value, net of transaction costs. Subsequently they are reported at amortised cost, except for hedged debt. To the extent that debt instruments are hedged under qualifying fair value hedges, the carrying value of the debt instrument is adjusted for changes in the fair value of the hedged risk, with changes arising recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement. The fair value of the hedged item is primarily determined using the discounted cash flow basis.\n\nFinancial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL) Financial liabilities at FVPL arise when the financial liabilities are either derivative liabilities held for trading or they are designated upon initial recognition as FVPL.\n\nThe Group classifies as held for trading certain derivatives that are not designated and effective as a hedging instrument. The Group does not have any other financial liabilities classified as held for trading.\n\n## Impairment of financial assets\n\nThe Group assesses on a forward looking basis the expected credit losses associated with its debt instruments carried at amortised cost and FVOCI. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk.\n\nFor trade receivables, the Group applies the simplified approach permitted by IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments', which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised from initial recognition of the receivables. Further detail is provided in note 18.\n\n## Derecognition of financial liabilities\n\nThe Group derecognises financial liabilities only when the Group's obligations are discharged, cancelled or expired.\n\nDerivative financial instruments and hedge accounting Derivatives are carried at fair value. The Group's activities expose it to risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates in relation to international trading and long-term debt. The Group uses foreign exchange forward contracts, interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements to hedge these exposures. The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. When cross currency interest rate swaps are used to hedge interest rates and foreign exchange rates, the change in the foreign currency basis spreads element of the contract that relates to the hedged item is recognised within other reserves under the cost of hedging reserve.\n\nAt inception of the hedge relationship, the Group documents the economic relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items including whether changes in the cash flows of the hedging instruments are expected to offset changes in the cash flows of hedged items. The Group documents its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking its hedge transactions.\n\n## Fair value of financial instrument derivatives\n\n- -foreign exchange forward contracts are measured using quoted forward exchange rates to match the maturities of these contracts; and\n\nThe fair value of derivative instruments is calculated using quoted prices. Where such prices are not available a discounted cash flow analysis is used based on the applicable yield curve adjusted for counterparty risk for the duration and currency of the instrument, which are observable:\n\n- -interest rate swaps are measured at the present value of future cash flows estimated and discounted based on the applicable yield curves adjusted for counterparty credit risk.\n\n## Cash flow hedges\n\nWhere derivatives, including forward foreign exchange contracts and floating to fixed interest rate swaps or cross currency swaps are used, they are primarily treated as cash flow hedges. The gain or loss relating to the effective portion of the interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps is recognised in other comprehensive income and is reclassified to profit or loss in the period when the hedged item is recognised through profit or loss. All effective amounts are directly offset against movements in the underlying hedged item. Any ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement. The gain or loss relating to the effective portion of forward foreign exchange contracts is recognised in other comprehensive income and is reclassified to profit or loss in the period the hedged item is recognised through profit or loss. Any ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement. When the hedged firm commitment or forecasted transaction occurs and results in the recognition of an asset or liability, the amounts previously recognised in the hedge reserve, within other comprehensive income are reclassified through profit or loss in the periods when the hedged item is impacting the Consolidated Income Statement.\n\nWhen a hedging instrument expires, or is sold or terminated, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative deferred gain or loss and deferred cost of hedging in equity at that time remains in equity until the forecast transaction occurs, resulting in the recognition of a non-financial asset, such as inventory. When the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss and deferred cost of hedging that were reported in equity are immediately reclassified to profit or loss.\n\nCash flow hedge accounting is applied to foreign exchange forward contracts which are expected to offset the changes in fair value of expected future cash flows. In order to achieve and maintain cash flow hedge accounting, it is necessary for management to determine, at inception and on an ongoing basis, whether a forecast transaction is highly probable.\n\n## Fair value hedges\n\nWhere fixed to floating interest rate swaps are used, they are treated as fair value hedges when the qualifying conditions are met. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated as fair value hedges are recognised directly in the Consolidated Income Statement, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk.",

Changes in accounting estimates may be necessary if there are changes in the circumstances on which the estimate was based or as a result of new information or more experience. Such changes are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised.\n\nIn particular, information about significant areas of estimation that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements are described below and in the respective notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nWe have considered the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and the key impacts up to 31 December 2020 include:\n\n- -The Group considered the impact of the global pandemic on its impairment risk around the carrying value of the goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets. The long-term outlook for the Group remains positive and supports our valuations and given there was significant headroom, no impairment was identified.\n- -All plants remained open except for a limited number of those that were mandated to close temporarily in specific jurisdictions. While there were changes to shift patterns and ways of working to ensure the safety of employees through additional segregation and cleaning routines, there were no indicators of impairment to property, plant and equipment.\n- -While supporting our customers during this crisis through the carrying of increased inventory and receivable balances, the Group has assessed the risks and to date, does not believe there are additional risks around the recovery of these assets.\n- -The impact of the mobility restrictions globally has impacted the Group's revenue and profitability, most significantly in the foodservice part of the Group's business. Third party revenue in our Taste & Nutrition segment from the foodservice business was \u20ac1,390.5m (2019: \u20ac1,767.6m).\n\nThe impact of COVID-19 on the critical accounting estimates and judgements as outlined below has also been assessed and is not considered material in the context of the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets\n\nDetermining whether goodwill and intangible assets are impaired or whether a reversal of an impairment of intangible assets (other than on goodwill) should be recorded requires comparison of the value in use for the relevant groups of cash generating units (CGUs) to the net assets attributable to those CGUs. The value in use calculation is based on an estimate of future cash flows expected to arise from the CGUs and these are discounted to net present value using an appropriate discount rate. The tests are dependent on management's estimates, in particular in relation to the forecasting of future cash flows, the discount rates applied to those cash flows, the expected long-term growth rate of the applicable businesses and terminal values. Such estimates are subject to change as a result of changing economic conditions. As forecasting future cash flows is dependent upon the Group successfully leveraging its base of intangible assets over the long-term, estimates are required in relation to future cash flows which will support the asset value. These estimates may depend upon the outcome of future events and may need to be revised as circumstances change. The impact of COVID-19 on the Group was considered and has been reflected in the cash flow forecasts employed in the value in use calculations. Details of the assumptions used and key sources of estimation involved are outlined in note 12 to these consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe Group continues to monitor its assessment of the economic environment particularly due to the pace and extent of recovery in some markets as a result of COVID-19. The long-term outlook for our businesses currently remains positive, supports our CGU valuations and no impairment was identified as a result of the impairment testing review carried out. There is significant headroom in the recoverable amount of the related CGUs as compared to their carrying value.\n\n## Business combinations\n\nWhen acquiring a business, the Group is required to bring acquired assets and liabilities on to the Consolidated Balance Sheet at their fair value, the determination of which requires a significant degree of estimation.\n\nAcquisitions may also result in intangible benefits being brought into the Group, some of which qualify for recognition as intangible assets while other such benefits do not meet the recognition requirements of IFRS and therefore form part of goodwill. Estimation is required in the assessment and valuation of these intangible assets. For intangible assets acquired, the Group bases valuations on expected future cash flows taking into consideration the impact of COVID-19 where applicable. This method employs a discounted cash flow analysis using the present value of the estimated after-tax cash flows expected to be generated from the purchased intangible asset using risk adjusted discount rates, revenue forecasts and estimated customer attrition as appropriate. The period of expected cash flows is based on the expected useful life of the intangible asset acquired.",

Statement of accounting policies (continued)\n\n## Critical accounting estimates and judgements (continued)\n\nDepending on the nature of the assets and liabilities acquired, determined provisional fair values may possibly be adjusted within the measurement period as allowed by IFRS 3 'Business Combinations'.\n\n## Business combinations (continued)\n\nBusiness combinations are disclosed in note 29 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Income tax charge and income/deferred tax assets and liabilities\n\nSignificant judgement and a high degree of estimation is required in determining the income tax charge as the Group operates in many jurisdictions and the tax treatment of many items is uncertain with tax legislation being open to different interpretation. Furthermore, the Group can also be subject to uncertainties, including tax audits in any of the jurisdictions in which it operates, which by their nature, are often complex and can require several years to conclude. The Group considers these uncertain tax positions in the recognition of its income tax/deferred tax assets or liabilities. In line with its accounting policy, the Group bases its assessment on the probability of a tax authority accepting its general treatment having regard to all information available on the tax matter and when it is not probable reflects the uncertainty in income tax/deferred tax assets or liabilities. When applying its accounting policy at the year end the Group generally considered each uncertain tax treatment separately and reflected the effect of the uncertainty in the income tax/ deferred tax assets or liabilities using an expected value approach as this better predicts the resolution of the uncertainty. Such estimates are determined based on management judgement, interpretation of the relevant tax laws, correspondence with the relevant tax authorities and external tax advisors and past practices of the tax authorities. Where the final outcome of these tax matters is different from the amounts that were recorded, such differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax charge in the period in which such determination is made.\n\nIncome taxes and deferred tax assets and liabilities are disclosed in notes 7 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements, respectively.",

Non-trading items (continued)\n\n## (i) Taste & Nutrition acquisition related and other costs\n\nAcquisition integration and restructuring costs of \u20ac13.1m (2019: \u20ac80.7m) primarily related to costs of integrating recent acquisitions into the Group's operations. These costs reflect the relocation of resources, the restructuring of operations in order to integrate the acquired businesses into the existing Kerry operating model and external costs associated with deal preparation, integration planning and due diligence. The Group has commenced a programme to evolve and restructure our global business services model to better enable the business and support further growth, costs incurred to date are \u20ac4.4m (2019: \u20acnil).\n\nA tax credit of \u20ac3.5m (2019: \u20ac14.9m) arose due to tax deductions available on acquisition integration and other costs.\n\n## (ii) Consumer Foods Realignment Programme\n\nDuring 2019, the Consumer Foods business completed a programme to simplify its business model in terms of footprint and resources in response to the challenging marketplace. The charge relating to this in 2019 was \u20ac26.7m, which reflects redundancies, relocation of resources and the streamlining of operations. The associated tax credit was \u20ac4.5m.\n\n## (iii) Loss on disposal of businesses and assets\n\nDuring the year, the Group disposed of property, plant and equipment in North America, Europe and APMEA for a consideration of \u20ac2.4m resulting in a loss of \u20ac1.9m for the year ended 31 December 2020. In 2019, the Group disposed of property, plant and equipment primarily in the UK, US and Australia for a consideration of \u20ac32.8m resulting in a loss of \u20ac3.5m. Please see note 28 for a reconciliation of the loss and cash impact on disposal of businesses and assets.\n\nA tax credit of \u20ac0.4m (2019: a tax charge of \u20ac0.2m) arose on the disposal of assets and businesses.\n\nThere were no impairments of assets held for sale recorded in the financial year.\n\n## 6.

This could result in differing amortisation charges based on the allocation to finite life and indefinite life intangible assets.\n\nIncluded in the cost of brand related intangibles are intangibles of \u20ac1,262.4m (2019: \u20ac1,307.2m) which have indefinite lives.\n\nApproximately \u20ac17.5m (2019: \u20ac16.5m) of computer software additions during the year were internally generated, included in this are payroll costs of \u20ac13.1m (2019: \u20ac11.2m). The Group has not capitalised product development expenditure in 2020 (2019: \u20acnil).\n\nThe Group has no separate individual intangible asset that is material, as all intangibles acquired are integrated and developed within the existing business.",

Intangible assets (continued)\n\n## Impairment testing\n\nGoodwill and indefinite life intangibles are subject to impairment testing on an annual basis, or more frequently if there are indicators of impairment. These assets are allocated to groups of cash generating units (CGUs). The recoverable amount of each of the four CGUs is determined on value in use calculations. Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are allocated to CGUs that are expected to benefit from the business acquisition, rather than where the assets are owned.\n\nCash flow forecasts employed for the value in use calculations are for a five year period approved by management and a terminal value which is applied to the year five cash flows. The terminal value reflects the discounted value of the cash flows beyond year five which is based on the weighted average long-term growth rates for each CGU. Management also considered the impact of COVID-19 on the Group which has been reflected in the cash flow forecasts used in the value in use calculations.\n\nNo impairment was recognised in 2020 or 2019 as a result of the impairment testing which identified significant headroom in the recoverable amount of the related CGUs as compared to their carrying value. In 2020, there was no specific impairment charge (2019: \u20acnil) in relation to goodwill recorded in non-trading items in the Consolidated Income Statement due to the classification of a business as held for sale.\n\nA summary of the allocation of the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets by CGU, is as follows:\n\n|                   | Goodwill 2020 \u20ac'm   | Goodwill 2019 \u20ac'm   | Indefinite Life  Intangibles 2020 \u20ac'm   | Indefinite Life  Intangibles 2019 \u20ac'm   |\n|-------------------|---------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| Taste & Nutrition |                     |                     |                                         |                                         |\n| Europe            | 496.5               | 507.4               | 77.0                                    | 102.3                                   |\n| Americas          | 1,507.3             | 1,492.1             | 1,088.1                                 | 1,106.0                                 |\n| APMEA             | 243.5               | 182.7               | 51.4                                    | 51.6                                    |\n| Consumer Foods    |                     |                     |                                         |                                         |\n| Europe            | 402.7               | 421.4               | 45.9                                    | 47.3                                    |\n|                   | 2,650.0             | 2,603.6             | 1,262.4                                 | 1,307.2                                 |\n\n## Key assumptions\n\nForecasts are generally derived from a combination of internal and external factors based on historical experience and take account of expected growth in the relevant region. The key assumptions for calculating value in use calculations are those relating to the discount rate, growth rate and cash flows. The table below outlines the weighted average discount rates and weighted average long-term growth rates used in the terminal value for each CGU:\n\nGrowth\n\n|                   | Discount   Rates   2020   | Discount   Rates   2019   | Growth   Rates   2020   | Rates   2019   |\n|-------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|----------------|\n| Taste & Nutrition |                           |                           |                         |                |\n| Europe            | 6.7%                      | 6.5%                      | 1.4%                    | 1.9%           |\n| Americas          | 7.1%                      | 6.9%                      | 1.1%                    | 2.4%           |\n| APMEA             | 9.5%                      | 8.8%                      | 3.5%                    | 4.9%           |\n| Consumer Foods    |                           |                           |                         |                |\n| Europe            | 6.6%                      | 6.4%                      | 1.5%                    | 1.9%           |\n\nManagement estimate discount rates using pre-tax rates consistent with the Group's weighted average cost of capital and the risks specific to the CGUs. A higher discount rate is applied to higher risk markets, while a lower rate is applied to more stable markets.\n\nLong-term growth rates are based on external market data, are broadly in line with long-term industry growth rates and are conservative in nature. Generally, lower growth rates are used in mature markets while higher growth rates are used in emerging markets.",

Intangible assets (continued)\n\n## Impairment testing (continued)\n\nThe assumptions used by management in estimating cash flows for each CGU include future profitability, capital expenditure requirements and working capital investment. The cash flows included in the value in use calculations are generally determined based on historical performance, management's past experience, management's expectation of future trends affecting the industry and other developments and initiatives in the business. Management also considered the impact of COVID-19 on the Group which has been reflected in the cash flow forecasts employed in the value in use calculations. Capital expenditure requirements to maintain the CGUs performance and profitability are based on the Group's strategic plans, excluding future development activity, and broadly assume that historic investment patterns will be maintained. Working capital requirements are forecast to move in line with activity.\n\n## Sensitivity analysis\n\nSensitivity analysis has been performed across the four CGUs. If the discount rate was 1% higher than management's estimates, there would have been no requirement for the Group to recognise any impairment charge in 2020 or 2019. Further, a 5% increase would not have resulted in an impairment charge in 2020 or 2019 as there is headroom in the discounted cash flows. If the estimated growth rate was 1% lower than management's estimates, there would have been no requirement for the Group to recognise any impairment charge in 2020 or 2019. If the estimated cash flows were 5% lower than management's estimates, again there would have been no requirement for the Group to recognise any impairment charge in 2020 or 2019. Management believes that no reasonable change, in normal circumstances, in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of any CGU to exceed its recoverable amount.\n\n## 13.

These investments have no fixed maturity or coupon rate. A fair value assessment was performed at 30 June 2020 which resulted in a decrease to the carrying value of these assets of \u20ac1.3m (2019: \u20ac1.0m) through other comprehensive income. In October 2020, the Group disposed of these equity securities for a consideration of \u20ac5.3m.\n\n## Other investments\n\nThe Group maintains a Rabbi Trust in respect of a non-qualified deferred compensation plan in the USA. The assets of the trust primarily consist of equities, bonds and cash which are restricted for use. These assets are fair valued through profit or loss at each financial year end using quoted market prices. The corresponding liability is recognised within other non-current liabilities (note 21).",

In the above table, NOLs refers to Net Operating Losses.\n\nThe following is an analysis of the deferred tax balances (after offset) for balance sheet purposes:\n\n2019\n\n|                          | 2020   \u20ac'm   | \u20ac'm    |\n|--------------------------|--------------|--------|\n| Deferred tax assets      | (33.8)       | (38.9) |\n| Deferred tax liabilities | 330.2        | 338.9  |\n|                          | 296.4        | 300.0  |\n\nThe total deductible temporary differences for which deferred tax assets have not been recognised is \u20ac21.8m (2019: \u20ac27.4m). The Group does not have any unrecognised losses which have an expiry date.\n\nDeferred tax has not been recognised in respect of withholding taxes and other taxes that would be payable on the unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries, as the Group is in a position to control the timing of reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. The deferred tax liabilities which have not been recognised in respect of these temporary differences are not material as the Group can rely on the availability of participation exemptions and tax credits in the context of the Group's investments in subsidiaries.\n\nAn increase of 1% in the tax rates at which deferred tax is calculated would increase the net deferred tax balance of the Group by \u20ac15.0m (2019: \u20ac14.5m).",

The fair value of these receivables approximates their carrying value as these are short-term in nature; hence, the maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of receivable.\n\nThe Group applies the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses which uses a lifetime expected loss allowance for all trade receivables. To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables have been grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due. The expected loss rates are based on the payment profiles of sales and the corresponding historical credit loss experience. The historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect current and forward looking information on macroeconomic factors, including the GDP of the countries in which the Group sells its goods and services, that affect the ability of customers to settle receivables.\n\nBefore accepting any new customer, the Group uses a credit scoring system to assess the potential customer's credit quality and defines credit limits by customer. These credit limits are reviewed regularly throughout the financial year. The Group does not typically require collateral in respect of trade receivables.\n\nThere is no significant concentration of credit risk or transaction currency risk with respect to trade receivables, as the Group has a large number of internationally dispersed customers. Further disclosures on currency risk are provided in note 23 to the financial statements.",

No assets of the Group have been pledged to secure these items.\n\nPart of the Group's debt portfolio includes US$750m of senior notes issued in 2013, maturing in 2023 (the 2023 senior notes) and US$200m (2019: US$408m) of senior notes issued in 2010 (private placement notes). At the time of issuance, US$250m of the 2023 senior notes and US$500m of the 2010 US$600m senior notes were swapped, using cross currency swaps, to euro. US$192m and US$208m of the private placement notes were repaid in January 2017 and January 2020 respectively and the related swaps matured at those dates. In addition, the Group holds \u20ac750m of senior notes issued in 2015 (the 2025 senior notes), of which \u20ac175m were swapped, using cross currency swaps, to US dollar. No interest rate derivatives were entered into for the September 2019 \u20ac750m senior notes issuance (the 2029 senior notes) or for the \u20ac200m of senior notes issued in 2020 as a tap onto the 2025 senior notes.\n\nThe adjustment to senior notes classified under liabilities at fair value through profit or loss of \u20ac33.7m (2019: \u20ac24.9m) represents the part adjustment to the carrying value of debt from applying fair value hedge accounting for interest rate risk. This amount is primarily offset by the fair value adjustment on the corresponding hedge items being the underlying cross currency interest rate swaps.\n\n|                                          | Notes      | Financial   Assets/  (Liabilities) at  Amortised Cost  2019   \u20ac'm   | Assets/  (Liabilities)   at Fair Value  through   Profit   or Loss   2019   \u20ac'm   | Derivatives  Designated  as Hedging  Instruments   2019   \u20ac'm   | Assets/  (Liabilities) at  FVOCI   2019   \u20ac'm   | Total   2019   \u20ac'm   |\n|------------------------------------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------|\n| Group:                                   |            |                                                                     |                                                                                   |                                                                 |                                                 |                      |\n| Financial asset investments              | 13         | -

Financial instruments\n\n## Capital management\n\nThe financing structure of the Group is managed in order to optimise shareholder value while allowing the Group to take advantage of opportunities that might arise to grow the business. The Group targets acquisition and investment opportunities that are value enhancing and the Group's policy is to fund these transactions from cash flow or borrowings while maintaining its investment grade debt status.\n\nThe capital structure of the Group consists of debt related financial liabilities, cash and cash equivalents, deferred payments on acquisitions of businesses and equity attributable to owners of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings are disclosed in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, as represented in the table below:\n\n|                                                                  | Notes   | 2020   \u20ac'm   | 2019   \u20ac'm   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------|--------------|\n| Issued capital and reserves attributable to owners of the parent |         | 4,655.5      | 4,562.2      |\n| Net debt - pre lease liabilities                                 | 22      | 1,863.6      | 1,862.8      |\n| Lease liabilities*                                               | 19/21   | 81.5         | 109.4        |\n| Deferred payments on acquisition of businesses                   | 19/21   | 22.2         | 21.7         |\n|                                                                  |         | 6,622.8      | 6,556.1      |\n\nIn June 2019, the Group completed a five year \u20ac1.1bn revolving credit facility which matures in June 2024 and replaced the existing facility that was due to mature in April 2022. The facility contains two extension options exercisable on the first and second anniversaries of the facility. During 2020 the Group exercised the first of these extension options which extended maturity until June 2025. The second option, if exercised, will extend the maturity date of the facility to June 2026. In keeping with the Group's commitment to ESG, the facility incorporates a price adjustment mechanism which is linked to the Group meeting or exceeding its carbon, water and waste efficiency metrics.\n\nIn April 2020, the Group completed a \u20ac200m tap issuance onto our 2025 Senior Notes. These notes are rated by S&P and Moody's and are listed on Euronext Dublin. The proceeds of the issuance were retained for general corporate purposes. In September 2019, the Group issued \u20ac750m senior notes carrying an annual coupon of 0.625%. The proceeds of the issuance were used primarily to repay existing debt and for general corporate purposes.\n\nAll senior notes issued by the Group are rated by S&P and Moody's.\n\nCapital is managed by setting net debt to earnings before finance income and costs, income taxes, depreciation (net), intangible asset amortisation and non-trading items (EBITDA) targets while allowing flexibility to accommodate significant acquisition opportunities. Any expected variation from these targets should be reversible within 18 to 24 months; otherwise consideration would be given to issuing additional equity in the Group.\n\nNet debt is subject to seasonal fluctuations that can be up to 25% above year end debt levels.\n\nThe private placement notes issued in 2010 have $200m outstanding and this series of notes carry financial covenants calculated in accordance with the Note Purchase Agreement. The principal financial covenants are:\n\n- -EBITDA to Net interest charge of a minimum of 4.0 times.\n- -the ratio of Net debt to EBITDA of a maximum of 3.5 times; and\n\nAt 31 December these ratios were as follows:\n\n|                       |   2020   Times |   2019   Times |\n|-----------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Net debt: EBITDA*     |            1.9 |            1.8 |\n| EBITDA: Net interest* |           13.8 |           13.2 |\n\nNo other financial arrangements carry financial covenants.",

Financial instruments (continued)\n\n## Financial risk management objectives\n\nThe Group has a clearly defined Financial Risk Management Programme, which is approved by the Board of Directors and is subject to regular monitoring by the Finance Committee and Group Internal Audit. The Group operates a centralised treasury function, which manages the principal financial risks of the Group and Company.\n\nThe principal objectives of the Group's Financial Risk Management Programme are:\n\n- -to manage the Group's exposure to interest rate risk;\n- -to manage the Group's exposure to foreign exchange rate risk;\n- -to ensure that the Group has sufficient credit facilities available to manage liquidity risk; and\n- -to ensure that counterparty credit risk is monitored and managed.\n\nResidual exposures not managed commercially are hedged using approved financial instruments. The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group's policies and procedures. The Group does not engage in speculative trading.\n\nThe principal objectives of the Group's Financial Risk Management Programme are further discussed across the following categories:\n\n- (ii) Interest rate risk management - key interest rate exposures of the Group and the disclosures on interest rate derivatives.\n- (i) Foreign exchange rate risk management - key foreign exchange exposure of the Group and the disclosures on forward foreign exchange contracts.\n- (iii)   Liquidity risk management - key banking facilities available to the Group and the maturity profile of the Group's debt.\n- (v) Price risk management - key price risk exposures of the Group.\n- (iv)   Credit risk management - details in relation to the management of credit risk within the Group.\n\n- (vii)  Offsetting financial instruments - disclosures in relation to the potential offsetting values in financial instruments.\n\n## (i) Foreign exchange rate risk management\n\nThe Group is exposed to transactional foreign currency risk on trading activities conducted by subsidiaries in currencies other than their functional currency. Group policy is to manage foreign currency exposures commercially and through netting of exposures wherever possible. Any residual exposures arising on foreign exchange transactions are hedged in accordance with Group policy using approved financial instruments, which consist primarily of spot and forward exchange contracts and currency swaps.\n\nAs at 31 December, the Group had an exposure to a US dollar asset of \u20ac29.4m (2019: \u20ac26.4m liability) and a sterling asset of \u20ac8.4m (2019: \u20ac11.7m). Based on these net positions, as at 31 December 2020, a weakening of 5% of the US dollar and sterling against all other key operational currencies, and holding all other items constant, would have impacted the profit after taxation of the Group for the financial year by a decrease of \u20ac1.6m (2019: increase of \u20ac0.7m).\n\nThe Group's gain or loss on the retranslation of the net assets of foreign currency subsidiaries is taken directly to the translation reserve.

The Group enters into hedge relationships when there is an economic relationship between the identified notional amount of the underlying debt instrument (hedged item) and the interest rate swap contract (hedged instrument).\n\n## Interest rate swap\n\nAs the critical terms match for the prospective assessment of effectiveness, a qualitative assessment is performed. The Group has established a 1:1 hedge ratio as the underlying risks in the interest rate swap contracts are identical to the hedged risk components. Hedge effectiveness is determined at the origination of the hedging relationship. In instances where changes occur to the hedged item which result in the critical terms no longer matching, the Group uses the hypothetical derivative method to assess effectiveness. Hedge ineffectiveness may occur due to the credit/debit value adjustment on the interest rate swaps which is not matched by the loan.\n\n## Cross currency interest rate swap\n\nThe Group uses the hypothetical derivative method to assess effectiveness for such swaps as while the critical terms match, both qualitative and quantitative assessments are required to be performed as there remains characteristics in cross currency interest rate swap contracts that are not present in the hedged item, being basis risks. The Group has established a 1:1 hedge ratio as the underlying risks in the cross currency interest rate swap contracts are identical to the hedged risk components. Hedge effectiveness is determined at the origination of the hedging relationship and at each reporting date.\n\nThe full fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability if the remaining maturity of the hedged item is more than twelve months and as a current asset or liability if the maturity of the hedged item is less than twelve months. The classification of the maturity profile of the interest rate derivative contracts are set out in the following tables (a) and (b).",

Financial instruments (continued)\n\n## Financial risk management objectives (continued)\n\n(ii.ii) Interest rate swap contracts (continued)\n\n(ii) Interest rate risk management (continued)\n\nCross currency interest rate swap (continued)\n\nThe tables as set out reflect the hedging relationships affected by interest rate benchmark reform (IBOR reform) as financial instruments transition to risk free rates. Group treasury are managing the IBOR transition process. The principal change is expected to be for the contractual terms of IBOR-referenced interest rate swaps and debt instruments and the related impact on hedge designation, systems and processes. While general communication with swap and debt counterparties has commenced, no specific changes have been agreed to date. In assessing the potential impact the Group has assumed that the uncertainty in relation to the IBOR reform will remain until the Group has completed specific changes with the swap and debt counterparties and the Group will continue to apply the amendments to IFRS 9 until this date.\n\n## (a) Interest rate swap contracts -

Financial instruments (continued)\n\n## Financial risk management objectives (continued)\n\nLiquidity risk considers the risk that the Group could encounter difficulties in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. There is no significant concentration of liquidity risk.\n\n## (iii) Liquidity risk management\n\nFollowing the renewal of the revolving credit facility in June 2019 and the issuance of the \u20ac750m 2029 senior notes in September 2019, the Group entered 2020 with significant available liquidity. During 2020, this position was further strengthened by (a) completing a \u20ac200m tap issuance onto our 2025 senior notes and (b) the exercise of the first of the two 'plus one year' extension options on our June 2019 revolving credit facility.\n\nGroup funding and liquidity is managed by ensuring that sufficient facilities are available from diverse funding sources with an appropriate spread of debt maturities to match the underlying assets. The Group uses cash flow forecasts to constantly monitor the funding requirements of the Group.\n\nGroup businesses are funded from cash generated from operations, borrowings from banks and senior notes from capital markets. It is Group policy to ensure that:\n\n- -at least 75% of total facilities available are committed.\n- -sufficient facilities are available to cover its gross forecast debt by at least 1.25 times; and\n\nBoth targets were met at 31 December 2020 and 2019.\n\nFunding is sourced from banks via syndicated and bilateral arrangements and from institutional investors.\n\nAll Group credit facilities are arranged and managed by Group Treasury and approved by the Board of Directors. Where possible, facilities have common security and terms and conditions. The private placement notes for which US$200m remains outstanding have financial covenants attached - no other debt issued has financial covenants. Other than the pre existing contractual exercise of the 'plus one year' extension option on the revolving credit facility agreement, the Group did not undertake any liability modifications to contracts for existing debt during 2020.\n\nAt 31 December 2020, the Group had undrawn committed bank facilities of \u20ac1,100m (2019: \u20ac1,100m), and a portfolio of undrawn standby facilities amounting to \u20ac320m (2019: \u20ac330m). The undrawn committed facilities comprise primarily of a revolving credit facility maturing between 4 - 5 years (2019: between 4 - 5 years). As set out above during the year the Group exercised the first of its two 'plus one year' extension options on the revolving credit facility. As a result of the extension option the Group now holds a committed facility until June 2024 for \u20ac1,100m at which time it reduces to a committed facility of \u20ac1,022m from June 2024 to June 2025.\n\n## (iii.i) Contractual maturity profile of non-derivative financial instruments\n\nThe following table details the Group's remaining contractual maturity of its non-derivative financial instruments, including lease liabilities and deferred payments on acquisitions of businesses, excluding the remaining trade and other payables (note 19) and other non-current liabilities (note 21), of which \u20ac1,499.2m (2019: \u20ac1,595.1m) is payable within 1 year, \u20ac85.3m (2019: \u20ac84.7m) between 2 and 5 years. This information has been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities to the earliest date on which the Group can be required to repay. The analysis includes both interest commitments and principal cash flows. To the extent that interest rates are floating, the rate used is derived from interest rate yield curves at the end of the reporting date and as such, are subject to change based on market movements.",

Financial instruments (continued)\n\n## Financial risk management objectives (continued)\n\n(iii.iii) Summary of borrowing arrangements (continued)\n\n(iii) Liquidity risk management (continued)\n\n(e) 2010 Senior notes - private placement notes\n\n- -Tranche A of US$192m - matured and repaid on 20 January 2017\n\nThe Group placed US$600m of senior notes with USA institutional investors in four tranches with maturity as follows:\n\n- -Tranche B of US$208m - matured and repaid on 20 January 2020\n- -Tranche D of US$75m - maturing on 20 January 2025\n- -Tranche C of US$125m - maturing on 20 January 2022\n\nThe interest rates listed above are before the effects of related interest rate swaps.\n\nThe US$200m of private placement notes have financial covenants attached to them. The Group was in full compliance with these covenants for the financial years 2020 and 2019.\n\n## (f) Lease liabilities\n\nThe Group's lease liabilities are set out in note 11 (iii).(iii).\n\n## (iv) Credit risk management\n\nCash deposits and other financial assets give rise to credit risk on the amounts due from counterparties.\n\nThe Group controls and monitors the distribution of this exposure by ensuring that all financial instruments are held with reputable and financially secure institutions and that exposure to credit risk is distributed across a number of institutions. At 31 December 2020 and 2019 all cash, short-term deposits and other liquid investments had a maturity of less than 3 months.\n\nCredit risk exposure to financial institutions is actively managed across the portfolio of institutions by setting appropriate credit exposure limits based on a value at risk calculation that takes EBITDA of the Group and calculates approved tolerance levels based on credit default swap rates for the financial institutions. These levels are applied in controlling the level of material surplus funds that are placed with counterparties and for controlling the institutions with which the Group enters into derivative contracts. Credit default swaps for those financial institutions are as published by independent credit rating agencies and are updated and reviewed on an ongoing basis.\n\nThe Group's exposure to its counterparties is continuously monitored and the aggregate value of transactions entered into is spread amongst approved counterparties.\n\nTrade receivables consist of a large number of customers, spread across diverse geographical areas. Ongoing credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable at operating unit level at least on a monthly basis.\n\nThe Group's maximum exposure to credit risk consists of gross trade receivables (note 18), cash deposits (note 22) and other financial assets (note 22), which are primarily interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts.\n\nIn relation to credit risk on derivative financial instruments, where appropriate, the Group credit risk is actively managed across the portfolio of institutions through monitoring the credit default swaps (CDS) and setting appropriate credit exposure limits based on CDS levels. These levels are applied in controlling the level of material surplus funds that are placed with counterparties and for controlling institutions with which the Group enters into derivative contracts.\n\n## (v) Price risk management\n\nThe Group's exposure to equity securities price risk, due to financial asset investments held, is considered to be low as the level of securities held versus the Group's net assets is not material.\n\n## (vi) Fair value of financial instruments\n\nFinancial instruments recognised at fair value are analysed between those based on:\n\n## (a) Fair value of financial instruments carried at fair value\n\n- -quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1);\n- -those involving inputs for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs) (Level 3).\n- -those involving inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liabilities, either directly (as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices) (Level 2); and\n\n<!-- image -->",

This includes interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts which are determined by discounting the estimated future cash flows;\n- -derivative financial instruments are calculated using quoted prices. Where such prices are not available, a discounted cash flow analysis is performed using the applicable yield curve for the duration of the instruments. Forward foreign exchange contracts are measured using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates adjusted for counterparty credit risk, which is calculated based on credit default swaps of the respective counterparties. Interest rate swaps are measured at the present value of future cash flows estimated and discounted based on the applicable yield curves derived from quoted interest rates adjusted for counterparty credit risk, which is calculated based on credit default swaps of the respective counterparties.\n- -the fair values of financial instruments that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs) requires entity specific valuation techniques; and",

Under these arrangements, the Group retains certain exposures up to predetermined self-insurance levels. The amount of self-insurance is reviewed on a regular basis to ensure it remains appropriate. The provision for these exposures represents amounts provided based on advice from insurance consultants, industry information, actuarial valuation and historical data in respect of claims that are classified as incurred but not reported and outstanding loss reserves. The methodology of estimating the provision is periodically reviewed to ensure that the assumptions made continue to be appropriate. The utilisation of the provision is dependent on the timing of settlement of the outstanding claims. Historically, the average time for settlement of outstanding claims ranges from 2 to 4 years from claim date.\n\n## Non-trading items\n\nNon-trading items relate to restructuring and acquisition integration provisions incurred in 2020 and 2019; these costs are expected to be paid within 24 months.\n\n## 25. Retirement benefits obligation\n\nThe Group operates post-retirement benefit plans in a number of its businesses throughout the world. These plans are structured to accord with local conditions and practices in each country they operate in and can include both defined contribution and defined benefit plans. The assets of the schemes are held, where relevant, in separate trustee administered funds.\n\nDefined benefit post-retirement schemes exist in a number of countries in which the Group operates, primarily in Ireland and the Netherlands (Eurozone), the UK and the USA (included in Rest of World). These defined benefit plans, most of which are closed to future accrual, comprise final salary pension plans, career average salary pension plans and post-retirement medical plans. The post-retirement medical plans operated by the Group relate primarily to a number of USA employees. Defined benefit schemes in Ireland, the UK, and the USA are administered by Boards of Trustees. The Boards of Trustees generally comprise of representatives of the employees, the employer and independent trustees. These Boards are responsible for the management and governance of the plans including compliance with all relevant laws and regulations.",

Retirement benefits obligation (continued)\n\nThe values used in the Group's consolidated financial statements are based on the most recent actuarial valuations and have been updated by the individual schemes' independent and professionally qualified actuaries to incorporate the requirements of IAS 19 'Employee Benefits' in order to assess the liabilities of the various schemes as at 31 December 2020 using the projected unit credit method. All assets in the schemes have been measured at their fair value at the balance sheet date. Full actuarial valuations for funding purposes are carried out for the Group's pension plans in line with local requirements. The actuarial reports are not available for public inspection.\n\nThe Group continues to harmonise, standardise and integrate the benefit offering to employees across the countries in which it operates. As a result, a number of deferred members transferred their past service benefits out of the Irish defined benefit plans during 2019 and 2020.\n\nThe defined benefit plans expose the Group to risks such as interest rate risk, investment risk, inflation risk and mortality risk.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nThe calculation of the present value of the defined benefit obligation is sensitive to the discount rate which is derived from the interest yield on high quality corporate bonds at the balance sheet date. Market conditions in recent years have resulted in volatility in discount rates which has significantly impacted the present value of the defined benefit obligation. Such changes lead to volatility in the Group's Consolidated Balance Sheet, Consolidated Income Statement and Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. Interest rates also impact on the funding requirements for the plans.\n\n## Investment risk\n\nThe net deficit recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation less the fair value of the plan assets. When assets generate a rate of return less than the discount rate this results in an increase in the net deficit. Currently the plans have a diversified portfolio of investments in equities, bonds and other types of asset classes. External investment consultants periodically conduct an investment review and advise on the most appropriate asset allocation taking account of asset valuations, funding requirements, liability duration and the achievement of an appropriate return on assets.\n\n## Inflation risk\n\nA significant proportion of the defined benefit obligation is linked to inflation, therefore an increase in inflation rates will increase the defined benefit obligation. However, a portion of the plan assets are inflation-linked debt securities which mitigates some of the effects of inflation movements.\n\n## Mortality risk\n\nThe present value of the defined benefit obligation is calculated by reference to the best estimate of the mortality of plan participants both during and after their employment. An increase in the life expectancy of the plan participants will increase the defined benefit obligation.\n\n## (i) Recognition in the Consolidated Income Statement and Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income\n\nThe following amounts have been recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement and the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income in relation to defined contribution and defined benefit post-retirement plans:\n\n|                                                                           | 2020   \u20ac'm   | \u20ac'm     |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|---------|\n| Service cost:                                                             |              |         |\n| - Costs relating to defined contribution schemes                          | 63.9         | 64.0    |\n| - Current service cost relating to defined benefit schemes                | 3.2          | 2.7     |\n| - Past service and settlements                                            | (12.8)       | (9.9)   |\n| Net interest cost                                                         | -            | 0.8     |\n| Recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement                           | 54.3         | 57.6    |\n| Re-measurements of the net defined benefit liability:                     |              |         |\n| - Return on plan assets (excluding amounts included in net interest cost) | (95.0)       | (198.5) |\n| - Experience (gains)/losses on schemes' liabilities                       | (5.5)        | 3.3     |\n| - Actuarial gains arising from changes in demographic assumptions         | (3.0)        | (8.9)   |\n| - Actuarial losses arising from changes in financial assumptions          | 170.5        | 190.1   |\n| Recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income          | 67.0         | (14.0)  |\n| Total                                                                     | 121.3        | 43.6    |\n\n2019\n\nThe total service cost is included in total staff numbers and costs (note 4) and the net interest cost is included in finance income and costs (note 6).",

The mortality assumptions used are based on advice from the pension schemes' actuaries and reflect each scheme's population. The life expectancy of a member retiring at 31 December at age 65, now and in 20 years' time, some of which have been shown in range format to reflect the differing assumptions in each scheme, is as follows:\n\n|                                     | 2020            | 2020      | 2020                   | 2019            | 2019      | 2019                   |\n|-------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------|------------------------|-----------------|-----------|------------------------|\n|                                     | Eurozone  Years | UK  Years | Rest of   World  Years | Eurozone  Years | UK  Years | Rest of   World  Years |\n| Male - retiring now                 | 22              | 20        | 21 - 22                | 22              | 20        | 21 - 22                |\n| Female - retiring now               | 24              | 23        | 22 - 23                | 24 - 25         | 23        | 23 - 24                |\n| Male - retiring in 20 years' time   | 24              | 22        | 22 - 23                | 24              | 21        | 22 - 24                |\n| Female - retiring in 20 years' time | 25 - 26         | 24        | 24                     | 25 - 27         | 24        | 24 - 25                |\n\nThere are inherent uncertainties surrounding the financial and demographic assumptions adopted by the Group. The assumptions may differ from the actual data as a result of changes in economic and market conditions as well as the actual experience within each scheme. The present value of post-retirement benefit schemes' liabilities is heavily dependent on the discount rate. As the discount rate is based on a market driven measure, which is the interest yield on high quality corporate bonds at the balance sheet date, the present value of post-retirement benefit schemes' liabilities can fluctuate significantly from valuation to valuation. The expected rate of inflation impacts the schemes' liabilities in that inflation is the basis for the calculation of the assumed future salary and revaluation increases in each scheme where applicable. In relation to demographic assumptions, differing expectations regarding current and future changes in mortality rates can have a significant impact on the schemes' liabilities.\n\nThe following table gives an approximate indication of the impact of a change in the principal financial actuarial assumptions (discount rate, inflation rate, salary increases and pensions in payment and deferred pension increases) and the principal demographic actuarial assumption (mortality) on the schemes' liabilities. The present value of the defined benefit obligation has been calculated using the projected unit credit method. The impact on the defined benefit obligation at 31 December 2020 is calculated on the basis that only one assumption is changed with all other assumptions remaining unchanged. The assessment of the sensitivity analysis below could therefore be limited as a change in one assumption may not occur in isolation as assumptions may be correlated. There have been no changes from the previous year in the methods and assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis.",

The schemes' assets are invested with professional investment managers. Investments in the Group's own financial instruments, if any, are solely at the discretion of the investment managers concerned. The actual amount of the Group's own financial instruments held by the pension schemes during 2020 and 2019 were not material. No property held by the pension schemes was occupied by the Group nor were any other pension schemes' assets used by the Group during 2020 or 2019.\n\nBoth the UK and Irish Schemes have invested in pooled Liability Driven Investment (LDI) strategies. The primary goal of this asset class is to mitigate volatility and enable better matching of investment returns with the cash outflows required to pay benefits. The pooled LDI solutions invest in various levered and unlevered bonds and the value of the LDI assets at 31 December 2020 across UK and Irish schemes was \u20ac355.8m (2019: \u20ac337.0m) which is based on the latest market bid price for the underlying investments, which are traded daily on liquid markets.\n\n## (v) Funding for defined benefit plans\n\nThe Group operates a number of defined benefit plans in a number of countries and each plan is required to be operated in line with local legislation, conditions, practices and the regulatory framework in place for the specific country. As a result, there are a number of different funding arrangements in place that accord with the specific local legislative, regulatory and actuarial requirements.\n\nFunding for each plan is carried out by cash contributions from the Group's subsidiaries. These funding arrangements have been advised by the pension schemes' actuaries and agreed between the Group and the relevant Trustees. It is the aim of the Group to eliminate actuarial deficits, on average over seven to eight years. Actuarial valuations, which are not available for public inspection, are carried out every three years in Ireland and the UK; and every year in the USA. During the financial year ending 31 December 2021, the Group expects to make contributions of approximately \u20ac14.4m to its defined benefit plans.\n\n## 26.

Share capital (continued)\n\n## Shares issued\n\nDuring 2020 a total of 185,094 (2019: 216,526) A ordinary shares, each with a nominal value of 12.50 cent, were issued at nominal value per share under the Long-Term and Short-Term Incentive Plans.\n\nThe total number of shares in issue at 31 December 2020 was 176,700,036 (2019: 176,514,942).\n\n## Share buy back programme\n\nAt the 2020 Annual General Meeting, shareholders passed a resolution authorising the Company to purchase up to 5% of its own issued share capital. In 2020 and 2019, no shares were purchased under this programme.\n\n## 27. Share-based payments\n\nThe Group operates two equity-settled share-based payment plans. The first plan is the Group's Long-Term Incentive Plan and the second is the element of the Group's Short-Term Incentive Plan that is settled in shares/share options after a 2 year deferral period. Details on each of these plans are outlined below.\n\nThe Group recognised an expense of \u20ac12.5m (2019: \u20ac14.4m) related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions in the Consolidated Income Statement during the financial year. The expectation of meeting performance criteria was taken into account when calculating this expense.\n\n## (i) Long-Term Incentive Plan\n\nThe Group operates an equity-settled Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) under which an invitation to participate was made to Executive Directors and senior executives. The proportion of each invitation which vests will depend on the Adjusted Earnings Per Share (EPS) performance, Total Shareholder Return (TSR) and Return on Average Capital Employed (ROACE) of the Group during a three year period ('the performance period'). The invitations made in 2018, 2019 and 2020 will potentially vest in 2021, 2022 and 2023 respectively. 50% of the award will be issued at the date of vesting, with 50% being issued after a 2 year deferral period.\n\nUp to 50% of the shares/share options subject to an invitation will vest according to the Group's Adjusted EPS growth calculated on a constant currency basis compared with target during the performance period. Up to 30% of the shares/share options subject to an invitation will vest according to the Group's TSR performance during the performance period measured against the TSR performance of a peer group of listed companies. The remaining 20% of the shares/share options will vest according to the Group's ROACE versus predetermined targets. An invitation may lapse if a participant ceases to be employed within the Group before the vesting date.\n\nUnder the LTIP, the Group introduced career shares awards, under which an invitation to participate was made to a limited number of senior executives. The proportion of each invitation which vests will depend on personal objectives during a three year period ('the performance period') and the senior executives remaining within the Group for a four year period ('the retention period'). The invitations made in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 will potentially vest in 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025 and 2026 respectively. An invitation may lapse if a participant ceases to be employed within the Group before the vesting date.",

Share-based payments (continued)\n\n## (i) Long-Term Incentive Plan (continued)\n\nExpected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group's share price over the previous three years. Market based vesting conditions, such as the TSR condition, have been taken into account in establishing the fair value of equity instruments granted. The TSR performance over the period is measured against the TSR performance of a peer group of listed companies. Non-market based performance conditions, such as the EPS and ROACE conditions, were not taken into account in establishing the fair value of equity instruments granted, however the number of equity instruments included in the measurement of the transaction is adjusted so that the amount recognised is based on the number of equity instruments that eventually vest.\n\n## (ii) Short-Term Incentive Plan\n\nIn 2013 the Group's Short-Term Incentive Plan (STIP) for Executive Directors was amended to incorporate a share-based payment element with 25% of the total bonus to be settled in shares/share options. The shares/share options awarded as part of this scheme will be issued 2 years after the vesting date once a deferral period has elapsed. There are no further performance conditions relating to the shares/share options during the deferral period.\n\nThere are 1,114 share options (2019: 4,829 share options) outstanding and exercisable in relation to the STIP.\n\nA share-based payment expense is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement for the scheme to reflect the cash value of the bonus to be paid by way of shares/share options. The issuance of shares/share options under the STIP which related to the 2019 and 2020 financial years will be released from deferral in 2021 and 2022 respectively.\n\n## 28.

Given that the valuation of the fair value of assets and liabilities recently acquired is still in progress, some of the above values are determined provisionally. The valuation of the fair value of assets and liabilities will be completed within the measurement period. For the acquisitions completed in 2019, there have been no material revisions of the provisional fair value adjustments since the initial values were established. The Group performs quantitative and qualitative assessments of each acquisition in order to determine whether it is material for the purposes of separate disclosure under IFRS 3 'Business Combinations'. None of the acquisitions completed during the period were considered material to warrant separate disclosure.\n\nThe goodwill is attributable to the expected profitability, revenue growth, future market development and assembled workforce of the acquired businesses and the synergies expected to arise within the Group after the acquisition. \u20ac30.9m of goodwill recognised is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.\n\nTransaction expenses related to these acquisitions of \u20ac1.4m were charged in the Group's Consolidated Income Statement during the financial year. The fair value of the financial assets includes trade and other receivables with a fair value of \u20ac16.8m and a gross contractual value of \u20ac16.8m .\n\nIn relation to the \u20ac18.7m prepayments made in 2019 relating to future acquisitions, \u20ac18.0m is attributable to 2020 acquisitions with the \u20ac0.7m remaining prepayment for acquisitions yet to be completed.",

During 2020, dividends of \u20ac18.0m (2019: \u20ac17.3m) were paid to Kerry Co-operative Creameries Limited based on its shareholding. A subsidiary of Kerry Group plc traded product to the value of \u20ac0.1m (2019: \u20ac0.1m) on behalf of Kerry Co-operative Creameries Limited.\n\n## (v) Transactions with key management personnel\n\nThe Board of Directors are deemed to be key management personnel of Kerry Group plc as they are responsible for planning, directing and controlling the activities of the Group.\n\nIn addition to their salaries and short-term benefits, the Group also contributes to post-retirement defined benefit, defined contribution and saving plans on behalf of the Executive Directors (note 25). The Directors also participate in the Group's LongTerm Incentive Plan (LTIP) (note 27).\n\nRemuneration cost of key management personnel is as follows:\n\n2019\n\n|                                                                    | 2020   \u20ac'm   | \u20ac'm   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|-------|\n| Short-term benefits (salaries, fees and other short-term benefits) | 3.9          | 6.7   |\n| Post-retirement benefits                                           | 0.6          | 0.5   |\n| LTIP accounting charge                                             | 1.0          | 2.3   |\n| Other long-term benefits                                           | -            | -     |\n| Termination benefits                                               | -            | -     |\n| Total                                                              | 5.5          | 9.5   |\n\nRetirement benefit charges of \u20ac0.2m (2019: \u20ac0.2m) arise under a defined benefit scheme relating to 1 Director (2019: 1 Director) and charges of \u20ac0.3m (2019: \u20ac0.3m) arise under a defined contribution scheme relating to 2 Directors (2019: 2 Directors). The LTIP accounting charge above is determined in accordance with the Group's accounting policy for share-based payments.\n\nPost-retirement benefits in the above table and the statutory and listing rules disclosure in respect of pension contributions in the Executive Directors' remuneration table in the remuneration report are determined on a current service cost basis.\n\nThe aggregate amount of gains accruing to Executive Directors on the exercise of share options is \u20acnil (2019: \u20acnil). Dividends totalling \u20ac0.1m (2019: \u20ac0.1m) were also received by key management personnel during the financial year, based on their personal interests in the shares of the company.",

        "page_content": "## 33. Events after the balance sheet date\n\nSince the financial year end, the Group has proposed a final dividend of 60.60 cent per A ordinary share (note 10).\n\nThere have been no other significant events, outside the ordinary course of business, affecting the Group since 31 December 2020.\n\n## 34. Reserves\n\n## Fair value through other comprehensive income reserve (FVOCI)\n\nThe fair value through other comprehensive income reserve represents the unrealised gains and losses on the financial assets held at fair value through other comprehensive income by the Group.\n\n## Capital redemption reserve\n\nCapital redemption reserve represents the nominal cost of the cancelled shares in 2007.\n\n## Other undenominated capital\n\nOther undenominated capital represents the amount transferred to reserves as a result of renominalising the share capital of the Parent Company due to the euro conversion in 2002.\n\n## Share-based payment reserve\n\nThe share-based payment reserve relates to invitations made to employees to participate in the Group's Long-Term Incentive Plan and the element of the Group's Short-Term Incentive Plan that is settled in shares/share options. Further information in relation to this share-based payment is set out in note 27.\n\n## Translation reserve\n\nExchange differences relating to the translation of the balance sheets of the Group's foreign currency operations from their functional currencies to the Group's presentation currency (euro) are recognised directly in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the translation reserve.\n\n## Hedging reserve\n\nThe hedging reserve represents the effective portion of gains and losses on hedging instruments from the application of cash flow hedge accounting for which the underlying hedged transaction is not impacting profit or loss. The cumulative deferred gain or loss on the hedging instrument is reclassified to profit or loss only when the hedged transaction affects the profit or loss.\n\n## Cost of hedging reserve\n\nThe cost of hedging reserve arises from where the Group has entered into cross currency interest rate swaps. Such cross currency interest rate swaps have basis risk as there are characteristics in the cross currency interest rate swap contracts that are not present in the hedged item, being currency basis spreads.\n\n## Retained earnings\n\nRetained earnings refers to the portion of net income, which is retained by the Group rather than distributed to shareholders as dividends.",

Revenue\n\n## Volume performance\n\nThis represents the sales performance year-on-year, excluding pass-through pricing on raw material costs, currency impacts, acquisitions (net of disposals) and rationalisation volumes.\n\nVolume performance is an important metric as it is seen as the key driver of top-line business improvement. This is used as the key revenue metric, as Kerry operates a pass-through pricing model with its customers to cater for raw material price fluctuations. Pricing therefore impacts like-for-like revenue performance positively or negatively depending on whether raw material prices move up or down.

Adjusted Earnings Per Share and Performance in Adjusted Earnings Per Share on a Constant Currency Basis\n\nThe performance in adjusted earnings per share on a constant currency basis is provided as it is considered more reflective of the Group's underlying trading performance. Adjusted earnings is profit after taxation attributable to owners of the parent before brand related intangible asset amortisation and non-trading items (net of related tax). These items are excluded in order to assist in the understanding of underlying earnings. A full reconciliation of adjusted earnings per share to basic earnings is provided below. Constant currency eliminates the translational effect that arises from changes in foreign currency year-on-year. The performance in adjusted earnings per share on a constant currency basis is calculated by comparing current year adjusted earnings per share to the prior year adjusted earnings per share retranslated at current year average exchange rates.\n\n2019\n\n|                                                                                                       | 2020   EPS   cent   | EPS   cent   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|--------------|\n| Basic earnings per share                                                                              | 313.0               | 320.4        |\n| Brand related intangible asset amortisation                                                           | 23.6                | 21.4         |\n| Non-trading items (net of related tax)                                                                | 8.8                 | 51.9         |\n| Adjusted earnings per share                                                                           | 345.4               | 393.7        |\n| Impact of retranslating prior year adjusted earnings per share at current year average exchange rates | -                   | (12.3)       |\n| Adjusted earnings per share on a constant currency basis                                              | 345.4               | 381.4        |\n| Performance in adjusted earnings per share on a constant currency basis                               | (9.4%)              | 8.3%         |",

Free Cash Flow\n\nFree cash flow is trading profit plus depreciation, movement in average working capital, capital expenditure, payment of lease liabilities, pensions costs less pension expense, finance costs paid (net) and income taxes paid.\n\nFree cash flow is seen as an important indicator of the strength and quality of the business and of the availability to the Group of funds for reinvestment or for return to shareholders. Movement in average working capital is used when calculating free cash flow as management believes this provides a more accurate measure of the increase or decrease in working capital needed to support the business over the course of the year rather than at two distinct points in time and more accurately reflects fluctuations caused by seasonality and other timing factors. Average working capital is the sum of each month's working capital over 12 months. Below is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the nearest IFRS measure, which is 'Net cash from operating activities'.\n\n2019\n\n|                                                                                                                        | 2020   \u20ac'm   | \u20ac'm     |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|---------|\n| Net cash from operating activities                                                                                     | 672.2        | 763.9   |\n| Difference between movement in monthly average working capital and movement in the  financial year end working capital | 6.2          | (25.6)  |\n| Expenditure on acquisition integration and restructuring costs                                                         | 39.7         | 89.1    |\n| Purchase of assets                                                                                                     | (276.2)      | (315.6) |\n| Payment of lease liabilities                                                                                           | (37.0)       | (35.5)  |\n| Proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment                                                                | 2.4          | 32.8    |\n| Capital grants received                                                                                                | 0.1          | 3.0     |\n| Exchange translation adjustment                                                                                        | 4.6          | 2.5     |\n| Free cash flow                                                                                                         | 412.0        | 514.6   |\n\n## 8.
