Working with management, your Board's overarching priority was and is the health and safety of our employees, whilst protecting the business and successfully steering CRH through, and emerging strongly from, this global crisis.\n\n## Health & Safety an Overarching Priority During 2020\n\nCRH operates in accordance with the pandemic management policies of national and local governments where our businesses are based. In doing so, we leverage CRH's safety culture, robust policies and 'Safety First' practices, to ensure that employees and contractors who work in our plants, sites or of/fices can do so in a safe environment. Your Board has oversight of company-wide and business unit-level initiatives and communication programmes to support the physical and mental health of employees, which are informed by the close monitoring of COVID-19 related metrics and comparing CRH's experiences and actions against those of the wider population and best practice.\n\nRegrettably CRH employees and their families are being impacted by COVID-19, with a number suffering adverse health outcomes including, tragically, bereavement. The Board offers its deepest sympathy to employees and the families of CRH employees who have lost loved ones.\n\nOther aspects of the physical safety of our employees, contractors and third parties working in and from CRH's many businesses, continues to receive the Board's ongoing input and attention. This includes close scrutiny, through the Board's Safety, Environment and Social Responsibility (SESR) Committee, of accidents and 'near\n\nUnderpinned by CRH's clear, focused strategy, its robust business model and the calibre of its people, CRH's business performance proved to be extremely resilient in 2020.'\n\n## Richie Boucher Chairman\n\nmisses'. Very sadly there were three workplace related fatalities during 2020 involving one employee and two contractors. The Board offers its sympathy to the families of the deceased. The background to each accident was carefully examined by the Committee, with its /findings being reported to the Board. Any applicable lessons from accidents and \"near misses\" are appropriately shared across the organisation.\n\nFurther detail on CRH's response to the health issues associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and on the management and oversight of safety throughout CRH are set out on pages 70 to 73.\n\n## CRH's Business Model and Business Performance\n\nUnderpinned by CRH's clear, focused strategy, strong business model and the calibre of its people, CRH's business performance proved to be extremely resilient in 2020, notwithstanding the unprecedented challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe key components of the Group's robust operational and business performance are set out on pages 10 and 11 in the Chief Executive's Review and on pages 32 to 34 of the Business Performance section. This performance follows the implementation over many years of strategic decisions to simplify and re-focus the Group on developed markets with attractive fundamentals and sustainable growth prospects. It also re/flects",

        "page_content": "initiatives to increase cost /flexibility within the business model, combined with decisive actions taken during 2020 by CRH's highly experienced, committed management team under the oversight of the Board. CRH's strategy and business model are described in detail on pages 14 to 17.\n\nDuring 2020, there was also further progress on business improvement initiatives, combined with ongoing active portfolio management including the announced agreement to divest our business in Brazil. While acquisition activity was muted, there is a strong pipeline of development opportunities within the Group's strategic footprint. In the process of portfolio assessment and portfolio management the Board has re/flected the longer-term changing business landscape with a non-cash impairment charge of $0.8 billion (2019: $8 million), which pre-dominantly relates to our assets in the United Kingdom (UK) and our associate investment in China.\n\nAmongst the core elements of CRH's strategy are /financial discipline and the sustainable generation of cash from our activities. A particular feature of the business performance during a challenging 2020 was the quality and quantum of cash generation, supporting investment in the business, a further strengthening of the balance sheet and continued signi/ficant distributions to CRH's shareholders.\n\n## A Continued Focus on Returns for Shareholders\n\nSince 1970, compound annual Total Shareholder Return (TSR) 1 has been 15.1% (2019: 15.6%). CRH's long-standing record of increased or maintaining dividends continued in 2020 with dividends paid to shareholders in respect of the 2019 /financial year of 92.0c per share, representing an increase of 12% from 2018 (2018: 82.0c).\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has not yet abated, and the pace and nature of economic recovery is uncertain, making it dif/ficult at this stage to provide forward-looking guidance on CRH's /financial performance over the short term. Nonetheless, re/flecting your Board's con/fidence in CRH's strategy, business model, /financial strength and cash generation capacity, along with its resilience and ability to sustainably grow over the medium term, the Board is recommending a /final dividend of 93.0c per share, resulting in a total of dividend of 115.0c per share for 2020 (2019: 92.0c) which represents an increase of 25% on 2019. The Board also intends to recommence the Group's share buyback programme following a pause in response to high levels of market volatility in 2020, with a further tranche of $0.3 billion to be completed by the end of June 2021.\n\n## Challenging Targets for Safety, the Environment and Inclusion & Diversity\n\nAs outlined in CRH's 2020 Sustainability Report, the Board has approved challenging targets in the areas of safety, the environment, our people and products for our customers. The attainment of these objectives, which include a focus on zero fatalities, carbon reduction, sustainable products and on Inclusion and Diversity (I&D) as set out in further detail on page 70 to 73, are underpinned by a comprehensive range of plans and initiatives. Supported by the SESR Committee, the Board actively inputs into the development of these plans and initiatives and carefully monitors their progress.\n\n## Continued Planned Board Renewal\n\nIn last year's report, I set out my priorities in relation to the ongoing Board renewal process. These were informed by valuable feedback from shareholders. In line with these priorities, we are very pleased that Mr. Rick Fearon and Mr. Lamar McKay have joined your Board. Their backgrounds, experiences and capabilities are set out in the Governance section on pages 54 to 57. They will retire at the 2021 Annual General Meeting (AGM) and, along with all eligible Directors, are seeking to be re-elected by shareholders.\n\nFurther information on CRH's approach to Board renewal, including with respect to diversity, is set out in the Nomination & Corporate Governance Committee Report to shareholders on page 64.\n\nMs. Heather Ann McSharry and Ms. Lucinda Riches, who joined the Board in 2012 and 2015 respectively, are not seeking re-election at the AGM. Heather Ann and Lucinda have shown exceptional commitment and have made very positive contributions to the Board and CRH. We are grateful to each of them for their tremendous service and stewardship throughout their tenure.\n\nCRH's Finance Director, Senan Murphy, advised the Board in September 2020 that he would retire from the Board during 2021. Consequently, he is not seeking re-election to the Board at the AGM. He will remain as full time Finance Director pending the appointment and transition to the role of his successor, the process for which is well advanced. Senan has been CRH's Finance Director since 2016 and has played a pivotal role in the evolution of CRH in that time. He has been an exemplary colleague and we wish him well for his future.\n\n## Shareholder Engagement and Priorities for 2021\n\nI have had the bene/fit of signi/ficant engagement with shareholders since the announcement of my appointment as Chairman, which has been invaluable to me in understanding shareholders' views and discussing progress against the priorities for 2020 which I set out in the 2019 Annual Report. Amongst the priorities for 2021 will be:\n\n- \u00b7 a continuing focus on safety, I&D, succession planning for the Board and the senior management team\n- \u00b7 continuing to assess our strategy, business model and ongoing business performance to make sure that they are driving sustainable growth and value creation\n- \u00b7 monitoring the progress of our environmental initiatives\n- \u00b7 ensuring that shareholders' capital and the cash that CRH generates from its activities is appropriately allocated to maximise long-term sustainable value for our stakeholders, thereby providing good capital growth and cash returns for our shareholders.\n\nAs your Chairman I will continue this proactive engagement, so as to ensure that the Board understands shareholders' views on CRH's strategy and strategy implementation. In addition, the Board's SESR Committee, which I chair, will also continue to actively work to understand the views of other stakeholders, including CRH's employees, in order that the Board can take them into account in its decision making.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis has been and remains a challenging period for CRH. However, under the dedicated, determined, highly professional and supportive leadership of CRH's Chief Executive, Albert Manifold, his colleagues throughout CRH have ably risen to this challenge and are successfully navigating through it. Your Board and I very much appreciate the effort and achievements in 2020 of our people throughout CRH and are very encouraged for the future by this emphatic demonstration of their qualities and character.\n\n## Richie Boucher\n\nChairman\n\n3 March 2021\n\n5",

We have consistently grown and improved our business, maintained our focus on value creation, and endured through challenge and change whenever we faced it.\n\nThe unprecedented, challenging backdrop of 2020 brought out the best in CRH as we worked together to keep our people safe, deliver for our customers, create value and maintain performance excellence.\n\n## COVID-19\n\nAs Chief Executive I am grateful for and proud of the extraordinary dedication and resilience of our employees who worked diligently throughout the pandemic to observe public health protocols and keep each other safe while going about their work. Where permitted to do so we were able to keep our operations open and maintain essential supply needed to keep important parts of society functioning.\n\nWe also played our part in the communities in which we operate by donating much needed personal protective equipment (PPE) and other essential supplies to local hospitals and health services.\n\n## Evolving our Business\n\nCRH has been signi/ficantly re-shaped and repositioned in recent years. We have become a narrower, deeper and more integrated business, leveraging our scale in the attractive and growing markets of Europe and North America.\n\nWe have continued to evolve, adapting our business model to address the changing needs of our customers and the growing demand for integrated building solutions to reduce the impact of construction on our world.\n\nWe have also structurally improved our business; through our relentless focus on continuous business improvement, we have delivered signi/ficantly higher levels of pro/fitability, cash generation and returns.\n\n## Performance Highlights\n\nWe acted swiftly in response to the COVID-19 crisis, taking decisive action to control costs, improve operational ef/ficiencies and conserve cash amid lower activity levels.\n\nThe unprecedented, challenging backdrop of 2020 brought out the best in CRH, as we worked together to keep our people safe, deliver for our customers, create value and maintain performance excellence.'\n\n## Albert Manifold Chief Executive\n\nIn doing so we maintained our strategic focus on improving performance, growing our business and creating value. This has enabled CRH to emerge from the crisis stronger and more resilient than ever before.\n\nAgainst this backdrop we saw sales decrease by 2% to $27.6 billion (2019: $28.1 billion) re/flecting lower volumes in our materials businesses in certain European and North American markets as public health restrictions resulted in reduced construction activity. This was partially offset by increased sales in our Building Products Division driven by a strong residential sector in the United States (US), particularly in Repair, Maintenance and Improvement (RMI) activity.\n\nOur ability to /flex our cost base and deliver improved organic 2 pro/fitability, EBITDA (as de/fined)* margins and cash generation in a rapidly evolving environment demonstrates the strength and resilience of our business. With a strong focus on cost rationalisation to mitigate the /financial impacts of the pandemic, EBITDA (as de/fined)* of $4.6 billion (2019: $4.5 billion) was ahead despite $122 million of one-off costs primarily due to COVID-19 related restructuring items.\n\nOn a like-for-like 2 basis Group EBITDA (as de/fined)* was 5% ahead of 2019, while EBITDA (as de/fined)* margin of 16.8% (2019: 15.9%) increased by 90 basis points.\n\n- 1.

The drawdowns were fully repaid in the second half of the year and the revolving credit facility remains available for re-use.\n\nPro/fit after tax was $1.2 billion (2019: $1.6 billion) primarily re/flecting the impact of non-cash impairment charges of $0.8 billion (2019: $8 million) and the related tax impact. Excluding these charges pro/fit after tax of $2.0 billion was 18% ahead of 2019 (2019: $1.7 billion).\n\nOur ongoing focus on continuous business improvement resulted in a further increase in returns. Return on Net Assets (RONA) 2 for the year was 10.1% (2019: 10.0%).\n\nEarnings per share (EPS) for the year was 142.9c (2019: 203.0c). Excluding the non-cash impairment charges and the related tax impact, EPS was 243.3c, 19% higher than prior year (2019: 203.8c).\n\n## Operational Highlights\n\nIn Americas Materials solid price progression, good cost control and lower energy costs resulted in EBITDA (as de/fined)* of $2.4 billion (2019: $2.2 billion) up 10% on a like-for-like basis, despite lower sales of $11.3 billion (2019: $11.6 billion).\n\nIn Europe Materials, EBITDA (as de/fined)* of $1.1 billion (2019: $1.2 billion) on sales of $9.1 billion (2019: $9.5 billion) was 7% behind on a like-for-like basis primarily re/flecting the signi/ficant impact of COVID-19 restrictions across our Western European markets.\n\nStrong operating leverage on increased sales in Building Products, re/flected good commercial discipline, cost rationalisation and ongoing pro/fit improvement initiatives. The Division reported sales of $7.2 billion (2019: $7.0 billion) with EBITDA (as de/fined)* of $1.2 billion (2019: $1.1 billion) 8% ahead of 2019 on a like-for-like basis.\n\n## Portfolio Management and Capital Allocation\n\nDespite the disruption of the COVID-19 pandemic the Group invested $0.4 billion (2019: $0.7 billion) on 17 bolt-on acquisitions in 2020. These\n\nbusinesses will be integrated with existing operations to further expand our ability to deliver for customers in key construction markets.\n\nTotal proceeds from business divestments and asset disposals was $0.3 billion (2019: $2.3 billion). In October CRH reached an agreement to divest its cement business in Brazil for a total consideration of $0.2 billion.\n\n## Sustainability\n\nSustainability is a strategic imperative for our business. As global efforts to address the challenge of climate change increase, we are evolving our business to take advantage of the many opportunities presented by a rise in demand for more sustainable forms of construction. CRH is already a global leader in sustainable building materials and a signi/ficant contributor to the circular economy. We have set ambitious targets for the Group to 2030 (see page 21) as we aim to ensure a long-term sustainable future for our business and a positive impact on the world around us. We are also leading our industry's response to the challenge of climate change through the Global Cement and Concrete Association's (GCCA) '2050 Climate Ambition' which aspires to deliver society with carbon neutral concrete by 2050.\n\nIn 2020, CRH became a supporter of the Financial Stability Board's 'Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures' (TCFD), underlining our commitment to transparency on the /financial aspects of climate change risks and opportunities. I am also particularly pleased with the appointment of our /first Chief Innovation and Sustainability Of/ficer, an executive leadership role that will help CRH to drive value creation through the development of sustainable products, processes and building solutions.\n\n## Safety Focus\n\nThroughout 2020 we continued our relentless focus on safety and ensuring that despite the pandemic, where safe and lawful to do so, our employees could continue to come to work, perform their duties in a safe environment and return home safely to their families each day.\n\nThe new reality of COVID-19 presented signi/ficant additional challenges for our health and safety teams, requiring additional procedures, protocols and training to be put in place to help keep our employees, contractors and customers safe.\n\nWhile doing so we continued our focus on ensuring our sites remained free from accidents\n\nand I am pleased to report that in 2020, 94% of our locations were accident-free. Regrettably and despite our best efforts there were three fatalities on our sites during the year. We will continue our determined approach to ensuring we achieve our target of zero harm at all of our operations.\n\n## Inclusion & Diversity\n\nAs Chief Executive of a global business with operations in 30 countries around the world it is important for me that our businesses re/flect and represent the communities we operate in. Companies which embrace diversity as a positive force in their business do better. They are more creative, innovative and attract more top talent. I want to ensure that CRH is doing everything it can to become a truly inclusive and diverse place to work and for that reason in 2020 I took on the role of Chair of our Inclusion & Diversity (I&D) Council, setting our strategic approach and overseeing our work programme in the areas of communication, education, people practices, data and measures. CRH has a strong track record in meeting ambitious targets. We have already improved gender diversity at Board level in recent years and I am con/fident that we will make signi/ficant progress in both Inclusion and Diversity over the coming decade to 2030.\n\n## Outlook\n\nAlthough the near-term outlook for economic and construction activity across our markets remains uncertain, market recovery is expected to continue across North America and Europe as the health situation improves. Our Americas Materials Division bene/fits from strong market positions and a positive demand backdrop for the infrastructure and residential sectors. Although the outlook for non-residential activity remains mixed our Building Products Division is expected to bene/fit from positive residential demand. In our Europe Materials Division, we have signi/ficant exposure to growing economies in Eastern Europe and strong, stable markets in Western Europe. Overall, with the strength of our balance sheet and our unique portfolio of businesses, we are well positioned to capitalise on the growth opportunities that lie ahead. We remain committed to the execution of our long-term growth strategy and the delivery of further margin expansion, superior cash generation and enhanced returns for shareholders.\n\n## Albert Manifold\n\nChief Executive 3 March 2021\n\n11",

By 2050 68% of the world's population will live in urban environments, an increase of 12% on todays numbers.\n\nOur materials and products play in an important role in shaping the built environment around the world. This means there is a natural market for our products wherever there is growth in population and the associated construction demand can be expected to drive day-to-day organic growth for our businesses.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ninfrastructure to commercial buildings and residential structures.\n\nBalancing our portfolio on the basis of geography, sector and end-use exposure helps to insulate our business from the impact of cyclical /fluctuations in any one of our markets.\n\nDemand for CRH's products and solutions is typically underpinned by three primary demand fundamentals: population growth, economic development and the need to continually repair and maintain the built environment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Economic Development\n\nConstruction-related spending currently accounts for c.13% of global GDP. Economic development and growth drives investment in residential, infrastructure and commercial projects from the houses, roads, bridges, ports and airports that serve our growing cities to of/fice blocks, retail centres and industrial and leisure complexes.\n\n## Ongoing Repair & Maintenance\n\nThere is a recurring need to continually repair and maintain the existing built environment as structures age over time. At CRH we aim to have a portfolio which is appropriately exposed to each of these primary demand fundamentals, thereby ensuring we bene/fit from growth and value-creation opportunities associated with each.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Market Development\n\nCRH focuses on markets where these fundamental demand drivers are present and can be expected to persist in the medium to long-term. Where appropriate, CRH operates a vertically integrated business model. This in turn broadens our ability to complement organic growth by identifying suitable businesses which can be acquired and integrated into CRH through bolt-on acquisitions. We acquire established businesses with a proven track record of performance and a capacity to hold strong leadership positions in local markets.\n\nThe extensive footprint of our materials businesses in Europe and North America sees us well positioned to capitalise on value creating opportunities for market consolidation and expansion of existing operations.\n\n## North America\n\nIn North America, which includes the world's largest economy, the US, CRH is the largest building materials business. Growth in North America is underpinned by a population that grows by 25 million people every decade, driving associated construction growth. The market for materials remains largely unconsolidated. For example the top ten aggregates businesses account for less than one third of production.\n\nIn recent years we have reshaped and redirected our businesses in the US to increase CRH's exposure to positive demand fundamentals in the southern and western areas of the country.\n\n## Europe\n\nCRH is a leading building materials business in Europe where the European Union (EU) is the largest economic bloc in the world.\n\nIn Europe, there is an attractive mix of stable developed markets which continue to deliver along with less developed higher growth markets which offer opportunities for organic growth and acquisition activity.\n\n## Other Markets\n\nOur Building Products Division produces high-value added, highly engineered products some of which can be economically transported longer-distances, opening up important export markets for CRH beyond our core geographic footprint.\n\nOngoing innovation and product development ensures that we meet the needs of customers today and also address the longer-term opportunities presented by economic development, changing demographics and investments in a sustainable future.\n\n## Future Trends: Growth in Sustainable Products\n\nAn asphalt plant at Alvarado, Texas. CRH is the largest producer of asphalt in North America. As a 100% recyclable product it helps to make CRH a signi/ficant contributor to the circular economy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs the leading global building materials business CRH closely monitors the trends shaping the nature of construction in the future. These include increasing urbanisation and the growth of cities, demand for more sustainable forms of construction and the in/fluence of technology and digitisation.\n\nGrowing demand for more sustainable forms of construction is an area of particular focus for CRH. Our businesses have a long history of producing high-performing, climate-friendly materials and products which play an important role in shaping a more sustainable built environment.\n\nToday our businesses are at the forefront of a changing construction market globally where demand for sustainable products and solutions continues to grow and evolve. This evolving demand environment is driven by trends including climate change, urbanisation, demographic and environmental consciousness and underpinned by policy commitments made by countries under international agreements and targets including the EU's European Green Deal, the Paris Climate Agreement and the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\nThese factors are helping to shape the future of our market and our business. CRH is acutely aware of the potential presented by these developments and the associated\n\nopportunities to grow our business and capitalise on potential new value creation opportunities for our shareholders.\n\nIn response to this CRH is working closely with its customers to better understand existing, evolving and emerging demand for sustainable solutions. This includes an ongoing focus on product innovation and development, working with specialist end-users to develop environmentally superior design-solutions and practices.\n\nIn 2020, products with enhanced sustainability attributes accounted for 46% of product revenue. These are products which incorporate recycled materials, use alternative fuel or energy sources in production, have sustainability end-uses, or a lower-carbon footprint. We have set a target of generating 50% of all product revenue from products with enhanced sustainability attributes by 2025.\n\nClosely aligning product development and speci/fications with evolving policy and environmental standards helps to create points of differentiation for CRH. An increasing number of our products are also helping customers achieve higher scores in green building rating schemes such as BREEAM \u00ae , DGNB, and LEED \u00ae . In 2020 25% of our relevant product revenue is from products that can be used in certi/fied sustainable building schemes.",

In driving continuous improvement across all areas of sustainability, we aim to create /financial and non-/financial value for all stakeholders and to have a positive impact on the world around us.\n\n## Focusing on Long-Term Sustainability\n\nAt CRH, we strive to use our leadership position as the world's leading building materials business to help advance the global sustainability agenda. By developing value-added products and services for sustainable building solutions, we contribute positively to society, address potentially negative impacts and achieve the greatest value for our stakeholders.\n\n## Driving our Sustainability Agenda\n\nOperating in a sustainable manner is fundamental to our business and sustainability principles are fully embedded in our business strategy. We leverage our global knowledge and scale to establish best practices and common processes worldwide, in order to operate more effectively and create sustainable value.\n\nWe continue to develop our products and components to improve the life-cycle performance of buildings, provide innovative solutions for our customers and drive more sustainable outcomes in the built environment. We are a global leader in concrete, the world's most sustainable building material when evaluated on a lifecycle basis. In addition to being essential for modern living, concrete offers opportunities for permanent storage of carbon and we are working to further develop the ability of concrete to become a solution to the climate challenge.\n\nOur actions are intended to contribute to the delivery of key initiatives, such as the UN SDGs and the Paris Agreement. We are a member of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) and GCCA. Many of our operating companies have achieved awards for excellence in sustainability. CRH is a leader in our sector, as determined by the major Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) rating agencies. We are a constituent member of indices including the MSCI Leaders ESG Indexes, FTSE4Good Index, the STOXX \u00ae Global ESG Leaders Index and the Dow Jones Sustainability Index as well as a long-term participant in CDP (formerly Carbon Disclosure Project).\n\n## Managing our Sustainability Performance\n\nSustainability is a matter of high importance for our Board and management. We regularly review our non-/financial policies and take a collaborative and strategic approach in responding to global trends in ESG areas including climate change, resource scarcity, biodiversity impacts, demographic changes and technological advancements. Risks related to sustainability are recognised in our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Framework, described on pages 26 and 27, and details of sustainability risks are included on pages 108 and 109. Our non-/financial due diligence processes are well established and we made no material changes to these in 2020.\n\nWe continually advance our commitment to sustainability through a range of internal and external processes to identify the ESG issues that are most relevant to our business, society and key stakeholders. These include annual sustainability reporting by our businesses to Group, review of issues raised through ERM processes and regular formal materiality assessment reviews, the outcomes of which inform our strategy and reporting.\n\n## Ensuring Transparency\n\nWe are committed to reporting on the breadth of our sustainability performance in key sustainability areas. We publish an annual independently assured Sustainability Report, which is prepared in line with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards. In addition, the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) Standards will be used in the preparation of the independently-assured CRH 2020 Sustainability Report. This includes additional information on social and employee matters. The 2020 Sustainability Report will be published in March 2021 on www.crh.com.\n\nWe are a supporter of the Financial Stability Board's 'Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures' (TCFD). This means that we are committed to being transparent on the /financial\n\naspects of climate change risks and opportunities from the transition to a low-carbon economy. Further information on risks relating to climate change and our approach to TCFD is included on page 27. As best practice evolves, we will continue to develop our own disclosure practices.\n\n## Our Six Sustainability Priority Areas:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe have assessed the detailed targets behind each of the 17 SDGs and identi/fied the four that most closely align to where we, as a building materials business, can have the most impact and in/fluence.",

Our Enterprise Risk Management framework enables us to proactively respond to stresses and uncertainty, which are often complex and interlinked, and provides us a foundation on which to build a performance and growth-oriented culture across the Group. Understanding the complexities of our risks also allows us to pursue the upside of risks and capture change opportunities, as they arise.\n\n## In/fluencing Decision-Making\n\nERM in CRH is a forward-looking, strategy centric approach to managing the risks inherent in decision-making. It is a tool readily employed by the Board and the wider business leadership, /firstly, when considering and setting strategic objectives, and secondly, during strategic execution to ensure we are dynamic and responsive to threats and opportunities for the Group.\n\nRisk informed strategic planning is fundamentally important to successfully address the variety of challenges we face in our relentless focus on value creation. Our framework facilitates a collective understanding of our risks, which is integrated into strategic planning processes to ensure resilient delivery. Despite ongoing challenges, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, our performance continues to highlight the resilience of our people, our business model and our proven record of delivery through uncertainty.\n\nAs the leading building materials business in the world we hold ourselves to stringent standards, governed by our robust ERM framework. Our framework allows us to add new depth to our understanding of our customers and markets, so we can buy better, run our assets better and sell better. It also gives us insight to strengthen our existing platforms and con/fidence to undertake investments and step into new markets.\n\nOur ERM Framework acts as a Bedrock of Resilience, helping the Group to mitigate uncertainties in strategy execution.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## ERM Framework\n\nOur framework, embedded across the Group, ensures a standardised, global system of identi/fication, management and reporting of risks and sets out a structured and consistent approach to threats and opportunities throughout all our operations.\n\nWe employ the Three Lines of Defence governance model to support the Board in its responsibilities for risk management. Clarity of ownership and responsibility is pervasive throughout the Group, supported by a robust governance structure.\n\nOur risk framework is reinforced by integrated processes which harness the collective risk intelligence of the Group. The maturity of our risk structures has enabled us to integrate our bottom, middle and top line perspectives, ensuring transparency of threats, opportunities and controls in the context of individually and collectively held strategic objectives.\n\nWe leverage tools and technologies to ensure we are a risk intelligent organisation, enabling quicker and better decision-making within the Group.\n\n## Integrated Risk Process\n\nEmbedding ERM into our business processes, at all levels of the Group, creates an environment where leaders take a disciplined and focused view on risks. Integration with strategy and performance agendas, in addition to ongoing management processes, ensures a robust and effective risk environment assisting in maximising the performance of our businesses.\n\nRisk workshops, facilitated by Group Risk, bring together leaders from across the Group to identify risks and opportunities, and de/fine mitigation. Uncertainties that present themselves as downside risks are assessed in line with the Group's risk appetite and those which present themselves as opportunities are suf/ficiently explored and captured, where possible. Our risk appetite framework is a critical tool to integrate our view of risk and maximise our risk governance structure, de/fining the key risk parameters within which strategic decision-making takes place and assisting with our objectives of disciplined and focused growth. The Board approves the framework on an annual basis in line with good corporate governance practice.",

This process includes regular budget reviews as part of the internal reporting cycle, /financial forecasting and performance reviews, a comprehensive enterprise risk management assessment and scenario planning involving our principal risks and uncertainties. Our business strategy is to deliver sustainable value for our stakeholders by maintaining /financial and operational discipline for the long term.\n\n## Viability Assessment: Period\n\nIn accordance with Provision 31 of the UK Corporate Governance Code 2018, the Board has reviewed the length of time to be covered by the Viability Statement, particularly given its primary purpose of providing investors with a view of /financial viability that goes beyond the period of the Going Concern Statement.\n\nUsing the Group Strategic Plan (the 'Plan'), which is prepared annually on a bottom up basis and is approved by the Board, the viability of the Group has been assessed over a three-year period from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2023 inclusive.\n\nThe Board believes that a three-year viability statement is appropriate for the following reasons:\n\n- \u00b7 It aligns with our normal strategic planning time horizon and associated principal risks and uncertainties;\n\nAppropriate stress testing of certain key performance, solvency and liquidity assumptions, such as EBITDA (as de/fined)* margins, Net Debt/ EBITDA (as de/fined)*, and EBITDA (as de/fined)* Net Interest Cover, underlying the Plan has been conducted taking account of the principal risks and uncertainties faced and possible severe but plausible combinations of those risks and uncertainties.\n\nFormal and systematic analysis of risk scenarios is a core focus of the Risk Committee and is supplemented by sensitivity analysis focused on the three core scenarios modelled above. The sensitivity analysis presumed the availability and effectiveness of various mitigating actions, such as the reduction of capital expenditure and cost rationalisation, which could realistically be implemented to avoid or reduce the impact or occurrence of those risks and uncertainties. In evaluating the likely effectiveness of such actions, the conclusions of the Board's regular monitoring and review of risk management and internal control systems were taken into account.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWhile the Board acknowledges that the potential severity, complexity and velocity of the risks assessed may change, based on their assessment of viability as described, the Board has a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the aforementioned three-year period to 31 December 2023.\n\n## Scenario Modelled\n\n## Scenario 1: COVID-19 Shutdowns & Recessionary Environment\n\nDeterioration in COVID-19 situation and a depressed economic environment\n\n## Scenario 2: One-Off Expense\n\nImpact of a potential large event, /fine and/or penalty\n\n## Scenario 3: Combination (1 and 2)\n\n## Relevant Principal Risks\n\n- -  COVID-19 Pandemic\n- - Laws and Regulations\n- - Industry Cyclicality and Economic Conditions\n- - Portfolio Management\n- - Public Policy and Geopolitics\n- - Brexit\n- - Laws and Regulations\n- - Public Policy and Geopolitics\n- - Information Technology and/or Cyber Security\n- - Combination of relevant risks from prior scenarios\n\nCombination of prior scenarios overlapping or occurring simultaneously\n\n- \u00b7 Construction activity, and therefore demand for the Group's products, is inherently cyclical as it is in/fluenced by global and national economies;\n- \u00b7 It aligns with our long-term management incentives, such as the deferred element of the Annual Performance-related Incentive Plan; and\n- \u00b7 Uncertainty increases inherently with expanding time horizons potentially impacting the large number of external variables that need to be factored.\n\nOverall, a three-year period is deemed to achieve a suitable balance between long and short-term in/fluence.\n\n## Viability Assessment: Approach\n\nThe viability of the Group is assessed against the Plan and projections consider the Group's cash /flows, committed funding and liquidity positions, forecast future funding requirements and other key /financial ratios, including those relevant to maintaining the Group's investment grade credit ratings.\n\nIn conducting the viability assessment, the Board has considered our strong balance sheet and cash /flow generation, our dynamic capital allocation model underpinned by comprehensive portfolio reviews and capital appraisals, and our philosophy of continuous improvement.\n\n29",

Like-for-like sales in Americas Materials declined by 3% compared to 2019, mainly impacted by COVID-19 restrictions, project delays in some of our key states and unfavourable weather in the /first half of the year.\n\nIn Europe Materials, volume recovery in the second half of the year along with good price discipline did not fully mitigate the negative impact of COVID-19 related shutdowns earlier in the year and like-for-like sales /finished 5% behind 2019.\n\nBuilding Products bene/fited from strong residential RMI activity in North America, offsetting lower activity levels in non-residential markets. Together with price progress across most platforms, the Division delivered like-for-like sales 4% ahead of 2019.\n\n2020 was a challenging year for CRH due to signi/ficant COVID-19 related disruption in the economies and construction markets of North America and Europe.\n\nNotwithstanding the dif/ficult backdrop, CRH delivered overall sales of $27.6 billion (2019: $28.1 billion) 2% behind 2019. Year-end net debt of $5.9 billion (2019: $7.5 billion) was re/flective of our focus on operating cash generation, lower spend on property plant and equipment and a pause in the Group's share buyback programme. This was partly offset by the non-recurrence of signi/ficant disposal proceeds in 2020 with net acquisition spend after disposal proceeds of $0.1 billion (2019 in/flow: $1.5 billion) and total distributions to shareholders of $0.9 billion (2019: $1.6 billion). Net Debt/EBITDA (as de/fined)* was 1.3x (2019: 1.7x).\n\n## Change in Reporting Currency to US Dollar\n\nAs announced on 28 February 2020, the Group has changed the currency in which it presents its /financial results from euro to US Dollar, in consideration of the current portfolio and business mix which has now signi/ficantly higher US Dollar exposure.\n\n2020 marked a year of further business improvement with advances in margin and cash generation despite a particularly challenging market backdrop.'\n\n## Senan Murphy\n\nFinance Director\n\n*\n\nEBITDA is de/fined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortisation, asset impairment charges, pro/fit on disposals and the Group's share of equity accounted investments' pro/fit after tax.\n\n- 1.

EBITDA (as de/fined)* was 5% ahead on a like-for-like basis, before one-off costs of $122 million primarily due to COVID-19 related restructuring.\n\nAs previously announced, arising from the Group's impairment testing process and as a result of the combined economic impacts of COVID-19 and Brexit, non-cash impairment charges of $0.8 billion were recognised in 2020 (2019: $8 million); $0.7 billion was reported in operating pro/fit, primarily related to our UK business, and a further $0.15 billion recognised on the Group's associate investment in China which is re/flected in the Group's share of losses from equity accounted investments.\n\nPro/fit after tax of $1.2 billion was behind prior year (2019: $1.6 billion). Excluding the non-cash impairment charges of $0.8 billion (2019: $8 million) and the related tax impact, pro/fit after tax of $2.0 billion was 18% ahead of 2019 (2019: $1.7 billion).\n\nThe US Dollar weakened against most major currencies during 2020 resulting in the average US Dollar/euro rate strengthening from 0.8933 in 2019 to 0.8771 in 2020 and the Pound Sterling strengthening from an average 0.7841 in 2019 to 0.7798 in 2020. Overall currency movements\n\nresulted in a favourable net foreign currency translation impact on our results as shown on the table above. The average and year-end 2020 exchange rates of the major currencies impacting on the Group are set out on page 146.\n\n## Liquidity and Capital Resources - 2020 compared with 2019\n\nThe comments that follow refer to the major components of the Group's cash /flows for 2020 and 2019 as shown in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows on page 136.\n\nThroughout 2020, the Group remained focused on cash management, improving working capital out/flows and reducing investment in property, plant and equipment. Management delivered a net working capital in/flow of $196 million (2019: $71 million out/flow) and operating cash /flow of $3.9 billion (2019: $3.9 billion).\n\nWorking capital was $2.4 billion at year end (2019: $2.4 billion) representing 8.7% of sales (2019: 8.5%). CRH believes that its current working capital is suf/ficient for the Group's present requirements.\n\nDisciplined investment in property, plant and equipment in response to lower activity levels, resulted in lower cash out/flows of $1.0 billion (2019: $1.4 billion), with spend in 2020 representing 74% of depreciation on owned assets (2019: 102%).\n\nRe/flective of the ongoing strategy of active portfolio management, the Group invested $0.4 billion on 17 transactions (2019: $0.8 billion) which was partly /financed by divestment and disposal cash proceeds of $0.3 billion (net of cash disposed and including deferred consideration proceeds in respect of prior year divestments) (2019: $2.3 billion).\n\nDuring 2020, the Group returned a further $0.2 billion (2019: $0.9 billion) of cash to shareholders under its share buyback programme but due to high levels of market volatility, the Board paused the programme in March 2020. However, given the Group's strong /financial position and its continued commitment to returning excess cash to shareholders, the Group intends to recommence the programme and complete a further $0.3 billion tranche by the end of June 2021. Cash dividend payments of $0.7 billion (2019: $0.7 billion), further re/flect the Group's continued commitment to returning excess cash to shareholders.\n\nYear-end interest-bearing loans and borrowings were $12.2 billion. At year end, the weaker US Dollar against most other currencies had a negative translation impact on net debt.",

The Group is in a good /financial position. It is well funded and Net Interest Cover (EBITDA (as de/fined)*/net debt related interest costs) is 11.9x (2019: 12.3x).\n\nThe Group ended 2020 with total liquidity of $12.1 billion, comprising $7.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents on hand and $4.4 billion of undrawn committed facilities which are available until 2025. At year end, the Group had suf/ficient cash balances to meet all maturing debt obligations (including leases) for the next 6.4 years and the weighted average maturity of the remaining term debt was 12.9 years.\n\nIn April 2020, the Group successfully issued a total of \u20ac2.0 billion in euro denominated bonds at a weighted average maturity of seven years and with a weighted average interest rate of 1.35%. A \u20ac0.75 billion euro denominated bond due to mature in October was repaid early using a 3 month par-call option.\n\nThe Group also has a US$2.0 billion US Dollar Commercial Paper Programme and a \u20ac1.5 billion Euro Commercial Paper Programme of which there were no outstanding issued notes at year end. The purpose of these programmes is to provide short-term liquidity at attractive terms.\n\nContractual obligations and Off-Balance Sheet arrangements are disclosed on page 219 of this Annual Report and Form 20-F.\n\n## Development Review\n\n## 2020\n\nThe Group spent $405 million on 17 acquisitions in 2020 (including deferred and contingent consideration in respect of prior year acquisitions).\n\nThe most signi/ficant acquisition in 2020 was the December acquisition of Barriere Construction, a vertically integrated asphalt and paving operation in southern Louisiana. In addition, the Americas Materials Division completed a further six bolt-on acquisitions across the US and Canada for a total spend of $163 million.\n\nThe Building Products Division completed six bolt-on acquisitions amounting to a total spend of c. $180 million including the acquisition of Martin Enterprises. This acquisition strengthens CRH's exposure to the communications enclosures market across the US.\n\nEurope Materials completed four acquisitions, with a total spend of c. $8 million for the Division. The Group also paid $54 million of deferred and contingent consideration related to prior year acquisitions.\n\nOn the divestment front, the Group completed 12 transactions and realised total business and asset disposal cash proceeds of $307 million, inclusive of $123 million relating to the receipt of deferred proceeds from prior year divestments.\n\nThe sale of precast concrete production assets located in Spokane, Washington represented the largest divestment in 2020 and was completed by our Building Products Division. The divestment of the building materials business in La R\u00e9union was the second largest divestment, completed by our Europe Materials Division, with 10 other divestments completed across the Divisions.\n\nIn addition to these business divestments, the Group realised proceeds of $128 million from the disposal of surplus property, plant and equipment and other non-current assets. Cash proceeds of $123 million were received relating to prior year divestments, of which $95 million related to the divestment of the Group's equity interest in My Home Industries (MHIL) in India.\n\nThe agreement to sell our Brazil operations for consideration of $0.2 billion is currently subject to competition authority review and the divestment is expected to close in the /first half of 2021.",

        "page_content": "## Finance Director's Review 2019\n\n2019 was another year of growth for CRH, supported by a positive demand backdrop in the Americas and in key regions in Europe. With good contributions from acquisitions sales of $28.1 billion for 2019 were 2% ahead of 2018.\n\nYear-end 2019 net debt of $7.5 billion (2018: $8.0 billion) was re/flective of our strong operating cash generation and continued portfolio re/finement with net disposal proceeds after acquisition spend of $1.5 billion (2018 out/flow: $0.5 billion) offset by total distributions to shareholders of $1.6 billion (2018: $1.5 billion). Net Debt/EBITDA (as de/fined)* was 1.7x (2018: 2.0x) 1 .\n\n## Key Components of 2019 Performance\n\nEconomic growth continued in the US in 2019, with improvements in the infrastructure sector and solid fundamentals in key residential and non-residential markets. Headwinds driven by /flooding and wet weather in the /first half of 2019 were offset by a stronger second half and like-for-like sales in Americas Materials for 2019 increased 4% over 2018.\n\nIn Europe Materials, organic sales were 5% ahead due to good activity in key markets and pricing progress across all product lines. Performance was positive for our businesses\n\nin Eastern and Western Europe, which offset challenging trading conditions in the UK as construction activity declined amidst Brexit-related uncertainty.\n\nBuilding Products saw continued improvements in 2019 re/flecting a positive demand and pricing backdrop and like-for- like sales were 2% ahead of 2018. Underlying trends in residential and non-residential activity were positive in the West Coast and Southern regions of the US and our main markets in Europe also experienced good demand.\n\nOur Europe Distribution business was divested at the end of October 2019 and was classi/fied as discontinued operations for reporting purposes. The business experienced continued demand in mainland Europe aided by milder weather conditions, partly offset by challenges in Switzerland.\n\nEBITDA (as de/fined)* of $4.5 billion was 18% ahead of 2018 (2018: $3.8 billion) with the bene/fit of solid underlying growth, continued focus on operational and commercial performance, margin-enhancing acquisition activity and the impact of IFRS 16 Leases . Reported pro/fit after tax was $1.2 billion behind 2018 at $1.7 billion (2018: $2.9 billion), as 2018's pro/fit after tax was augmented by the $1.3 billion after tax pro/fit on disposal on the sale of our Americas Distribution business.\n\nThe US Dollar strengthened against most major currencies during 2019 resulting in the average US Dollar/euro rate weakening from 0.8467 in 2018 to 0.8933 in 2019 and the Pound Sterling weakening from an average 0.7491 in 2018 to 0.7841 in 2019. Overall currency movements resulted in an unfavourable net foreign currency translation impact on our results as shown on the table below. The average and year-end 2019 exchange rates of the major currencies impacting on the Group are set out on page 146.\n\n## Liquidity and Capital Resources - 2019 compared with 2018\n\nThe comments that follow refer to the major components of the Group's cash /flows for 2019 and 2018 as shown in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows on page 136.\n\nThroughout 2019, the Group remained focused on cash management, targeting working capital in particular. Management delivered a net working capital out/flow of $71 million in 2019 (2018: $547 million), and together with 2019's improved pro/fitability and the positive impact of the non-reoccurrence of cash out/flows related to the Americas Distribution discontinued operation (primarily the tax paid on the pro/fit on disposal) the Group's operating cash /flow increased to $3.9 billion (2018: $2.2 billion).\n\n## Key Components of 2019 Performance\n\n| $ million                      | Sales  revenue   | EBITDA  (as de/fined)*   | Operating  pro/fit   | Loss on  disposals   | Finance  costs (net)   | Assoc. and  JV PAT (i)   | Pre-tax  pro/fit   |\n|--------------------------------|------------------|--------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------|\n| 2018                           | 27,449           | 3,799                    | 2,446                | (121)                | (414)                  | 57                       | 1,968              |\n| Exchange effects               | (574)            | (57)                     | (26)                 | (1)                  | 9                      | (1)                      | (19)               |\n| 2018 at 2019 rates             | 26,875           | 3,742                    | 2,420                | (122)                | (405)                  | 56                       | 1,949              |\n| Incremental impact in 2019 of: |                  |                          |                      |                      |                        |                          |                    |\n| - 2018/2019 acquisitions       | 1,034            | 183                      | 78                   | -                    | (49)                   | -                        | 29                 |\n| - 2018/2019 divestments        | (704)            | (59)                     | (20)                 | (56)                 | 2                      | -                        | (74)               |\n| - Leases                       | -                | 349                      | 45                   | -                    | (69)                   | -                        | (24)               |\n| - Organic                      | 927              | 263                      | 270                  | (11)                 | 31                     | 11                       | 301                |\n| 2019                           | 28,132           | 4,478                    | 2,793                | (189)                | (490)                  | 67                       | 2,181              |\n| % Total change                 | 2%               | 18%                      | 14%                  |                      |                        |                          | 11%                |\n| % Organic change               | 3%               | 7%                       | 11%                  |                      |                        |                          | 15%                |\n\n- (i) CRH's share of after-tax pro/fits of joint ventures and associated undertakings.\n\n35",

This was /financed by divestment and disposal proceeds of $2.3 billion (net of cash disposed and deferred proceeds) (2018: $3.6 billion).\n\nThe Group continued its share buyback programme and, in 2019, 27.4 million (2018: 27.9 million) ordinary shares were repurchased on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) and Euronext Dublin for a total consideration of $0.9 billion (2018: $0.9 billion), at an average price of $32.31 (2018: $32.80) per share. These buybacks, together with cash dividend payments of $0.7 billion (2018: $0.6 billion), re/flected the Group's continued commitment to returning excess cash to shareholders.\n\nYear-end 2019 interest-bearing loans and borrowings were $15.8 billion. At year end 2019, the weaker euro against the US Dollar had a favourable translation impact on net debt.\n\n## Development Review\n\n## 2019\n\nThe Building Products Division completed a total of 16 bolt-on acquisitions at a cost of c. $514 million. Four of these acquisitions were completed in Europe and one in Australia at a cost of $75 million, while the remaining 11 were completed in North America for consideration of c. $439 million. One of the largest acquisitions in 2019 was the November acquisition of Torrent Resources, Inc. for c. $84 million. This acquisition strengthens CRH's storm water and water management presence in Western US and offers signi/ficant commercial and operational synergy potential to our Infrastructure Products business.\n\nThe Americas Materials Division completed 27 bolt-on acquisitions and two investments at a cost of c. $235 million, the majority of which were designed to bolster our operational footprint through the addition of c. 260 million tonnes of mineral reserves. The most signi/ficant acquisition in Americas Materials was that of Windsor Rock products for c. $36 million. The Europe Materials Division completed 15 bolt-on acquisitions and two investments at a cost of c. $64 million.\n\nOn the divestment front, the Group completed 11 transactions and realised business and asset disposal proceeds of $2.3 billion. The majority of divestment proceeds related to the divestment of the Europe Distribution business in October 2019 for a /final agreed consideration of $1.7 billion. Other transactions in 2019 included the divestment of the European Shutters & Awnings business for a total consideration of $0.3 billion in June 2019, the divestment of the Perimeter Protection business in Europe in September 2019 for $0.1 billion together with seven smaller business divestments completed in the US and UK.\n\nOn 31 December 2019, the Group divested of its share of the Indian joint venture, MHIL, for a total deferred consideration of $0.3 billion. In addition to these business divestments, the Group realised proceeds of $0.2 billion from the disposal of surplus property, plant and equipment.\n\n## 2018\n\nIn 2018, the Group spent a total of c. $4.1 billion (including deferred and contingent consideration in respect of prior year acquisitions) on 46 acquisition/ investment transactions. On the divestment front, the Group realised business and asset disposal proceeds of c. $3.6 billion.\n\nThe most signi/ficant acquisition in 2018 was the June acquisition of Ash Grove, which gave CRH a market leadership position in the North America cement market, allowing for greater vertical integration with our existing aggregates, asphalt and readymixed concrete businesses. In addition to the acquisition of Ash Grove, our Americas Materials Division completed 23 bolt-on acquisitions and one investment throughout the US and Canada for consideration of c. $435 million.\n\nOur Europe Materials Division completed ten acquisitions across the UK, Ireland and France, and one investment in Poland for a total spend of c. $73 million. Our Building Products Division completed an acquisition in the UK, Germany, Belgium and Australia, in addition to six bolt-on acquisitions in the US at a total cost of c. $259 million. The acquisitions of Coral Industries and SIGCO extended Building Envelope's geographic footprint and product offerings in the Southeast and Northeast US, respectively. Similarly, the Concrete Specialties acquisition and the Ash Grove packaging division added geographic exposure to Central US markets.\n\nThe majority of divestment proceeds related to the divestment of our Americas Distribution business in January 2018 for a /final agreed consideration of c. $2.8 billion. In July 2018, the Group completed the divestment of our DIY business in the Netherlands and Belgium, together with certain related property assets, for total consideration of c. $0.5 billion. A further 18 smaller business divestments were completed across all segments demonstrating our continued focus on portfolio management. In addition to these business divestments, the Group realised proceeds of c. $0.1 billion from the disposal of surplus property, plant and equipment.",

It is the leading supplier of products for road construction and repair and maintenance demand in the US with 50% of our business related to infrastructure, a signi/ficant proportion of which is awarded by public tender for federal, provincial, state and local government authority road and infrastructure projects.\n\nIn addition, CRH is a leading producer of cement, with a footprint spanning Canada, Florida, Texas, the Midwest and Western US. In 2020, CRH adopted the Ash Grove name for all its North American cement businesses, unifying its 12 cement plants and 42 cement terminals under one recognised brand.\n\n## How We Create Value\n\nCRH combines the /flexibility, speed, close customer relationships and in-depth market knowledge of local businesses with the strength, shared expertise and operational excellence of a national network.\n\nThis focus on operational excellence and local knowledge is supported by a strong strategic centre which enables CRH to leverage talent, procurement synergies and ef/ficiencies across the Division.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Americas Materials\n\n|                         | $ million   | % of Group   |\n|-------------------------|-------------|--------------|\n| Sales                   | 11,273      | 51% 41%      |\n| EBITDA   (as de/fined)* | 2,405       | 52%          |\n| Operating  Pro/fit      | 1,631       | 51% 72%      |\n| Net   Assets 2          | 13,620      | 48%          |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Annualised Sales Volumes 3\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAggregates: 189.1m tonnes\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCement: 15.3m tonnes\n\nReadymixed Concrete: 12.8m m 3\n\nAsphalt: 44.0m tonnes\n\n- * EBITDA is de/fined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortisation, asset impairment charges, pro/fit on disposals and the Group's share of equity accounted investments' pro/fit after tax.\n- 1.

By identifying businesses that can be integrated ef/ficiently into our existing network, we create further opportunities for value creation and growth in what is a largely unconsolidated US building materials market.\n\nIn recent years we have grown our presence in higher growth southern states in the US to increase CRH's exposure to the positive demand fundamentals in the southern and western areas of the country where there is higher population growth and good demand for our materials.\n\nThroughout our business there is a constant focus on making our business more resilient and sustainable. This includes reducing emissions, increasing the use of alternative materials, accelerating sustainable product innovation and anticipating the evolving needs of our customers in response to the changing climate and weather patterns.\n\n## How We Structure our Operations\n\nOur materials businesses are organised geographically by region (North, South and West) and our cement platform across North America and Brazil. The North division comprises operations in 13 states and two Canadian provinces, the South division operates across 14 states, while the West division has operations in 19 states. The cement platform operates across 20 states, six Canadian provinces and three Brazilian states. In October 2020, the Group entered into a sales agreement to divest of its 100% holding in CRH Brazil. The transaction is expected to close in the /first half of 2021.\n\nIn total, the Division has a network of 1,475 operating locations and employs approximately 27,400 people across 46 US states, six Canadian provinces and three Brazilian states.\n\n## Our Vertically Integrated Business\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n41",

Headwinds driven by wet weather and increased raw materials costs in the /first half of the year were offset by a stronger second-half performance re/flecting increased volumes, positive pricing and reduced operating expenses. Organic sales were 4% ahead of 2018, while organic operating pro/fit grew 13%.\n\nEconomic activity in the US remained favourable during 2019 with the infrastructure sector supported by the FAST Act as well as a signi/ficant number of local and state funded transportation projects. The Canadian market experienced growth during the year and economic expansion is expected to continue at a moderate pace.\n\nAmericas Materials completed 29 acquisitions/ investments in 2019 at a cost of c. $235 million, strengthening its operational footprint through the addition of c. 260 million tonnes of mineral reserves.\n\n## Building Materials\n\nTotal aggregates volumes bene/fited from acquisitions and /finished 5% ahead of prior year, while like-for-like volumes were 1% ahead as a strong performance in the West division was partly offset by a focused reduction in lower margin contracts in the South division. Average prices increased 5% on a like-for-like basis and 4% overall compared with 2018 and margins were maintained against a backdrop of increased input costs.\n\nLike-for-like and total asphalt volumes were 1% behind 2018 as /flooding and tropical storms negatively impacted our West and South divisions, partly offset by strong demand in the North. Like-for-like prices improved 5%, more than offsetting higher input costs and resulted in strong margin expansion.\n\nTotal readymixed concrete volumes were 9% ahead of 2018 and prices improved 4%. Like-for-like volumes were 2% ahead as poor weather in the /first half of the year for the West division was offset by strong volumes in the South division. Readymixed concrete margins were impacted by increased input costs.\n\nTotal paving and construction services revenues were 3% ahead, 2% on a like-for-like basis, as overall margins improved driven by favourable regional mix and increased higher margin work in the South and West divisions, partly offset by challenging /first-half weather in Canada.\n\n## Regional Performance\n\nTotal sales in the North division increased 5% primarily due to favourable volumes and prices across our product range, as well as greater construction revenue. This improved revenue coupled with strong cost control resulted in a good operating pro/fit performance.\n\nTotal sales in the South division increased 7% with improved volumes and pricing in all products. Strong pricing together with focused management of operating expenses resulted in a solid operating pro/fit performance.\n\nStrong pricing across all products, volumes growth in aggregates and readymixed concrete combined with contributions from acquisitions supported the West division's total sales increase of 8%, 1% on a like-for-like basis. Despite challenges from weather, with /flooding and record levels of rainfall in the /first half of the year, and higher input costs, mainly bitumen and labour, favourable pricing across all products and tight cost control resulted in operating pro/fit ahead of 2018.\n\n## Cement\n\nLike-for-like sales volumes in our US operations were ahead in 2019. Despite adverse weather, strong price realisation across major markets and good synergy delivery supported robust operating pro/fits. The integration of Ash Grove is now complete and the business is performing well.\n\nDespite poor weather conditions in the /first half of the year, cement volumes and prices in Canada were ahead of 2018, driven by solid market conditions.\n\nCement consumption in Southeast Brazil improved in 2019 enabling CRH to achieve volumes growth supported by a consistent focus on key customer segments. A strong emphasis on logistics optimisation and price realisation drove improved performance.",

        "page_content": "Americas Materials generated EBITDA (as de/fined)* of $2.4 billion, 10% ahead of prior year and operating pro/fit of $1.6 billion, 15% ahead of prior year despite lower sales which were 3% behind. COVID-19 restrictions negatively impacted sales volumes in the second quarter, particularly in the North division, with sales in the South division impacted by project delays in key states. Solid price progression, operational ef/ficiencies, focused cost containment and lower energy costs drove margin expansion across all regions and product lines. Strong demand in the central and western parts of the US resulted in like-for-like sales growth across all lines of business in the West region.\n\nOverall economic and construction activity across our markets was impacted by the global pandemic; however, government stimulus to help support the US economy was implemented, while infrastructure investment was underpinned by a one-year extension of the US FAST Act.\n\nDuring 2020 Americas Materials completed seven acquisitions in the US and Canada including aggregates, asphalt, readymixed concrete, paving and construction operations at a total cost of $163 million. These acquisitions in addition to several mineral reserve purchases in the US will continue to support future growth in key markets.\n\n## Building Materials\n\nOn a like-for-like basis, aggregates volumes were 2% lower but margins improved as prices were 4% higher compared to 2019. Volumes in the North division were predominantly impacted by COVID-19 restrictions in the second quarter of the year while the South division experienced lower demand primarily due to unfavourable weather in the /first half of the year. Solid underlying business activity in the West division generated sales growth during the year. Prices were favourable across all divisions with the strongest contributions from the North and South divisions.\n\nAsphalt volumes were 6% lower on a like-for-like basis due to the impact of COVID-19 restrictions on the North division and slower project bidding in key states in the South. Volumes in the West division were ahead of prior year with a strong order book of business supported by more favourable weather compared to 2019. Asphalt margins improved, bene/fiting from good commercial management, lower input costs, operational ef/ficiencies and strong cost control.\n\nReadymixed concrete volumes were 4% behind prior year on both a total and like-for-like basis as higher volumes in the South division during the second half of the year did not fully offset lower volumes in the North and West. Strong commercial discipline delivered total and like-for-like prices up 6%, more than offsetting lower sales volumes, resulting in improved margins.\n\nPaving and construction revenues were 6% behind prior year on a total and like-for-like basis. COVID-19 impacted the North division through government mandated restrictions, while the South experienced delayed bidding on projects in key markets due to uncertainty in state and local funding sources. The West division experienced signi/ficant growth in revenues driven by strong demand in the Central West and Mountain West regions. Overall construction margins /finished ahead of prior year.\n\n## Regional Performance\n\nLike-for-like sales for the North division were 6% lower than 2019 as COVID-19 restrictions impacted volumes across the business. Favourable prices and lower input costs offset lower volumes and delivered operating pro/fit improvements for the North division across the product range.\n\nThe South division's total sales were 7% behind prior year driven by lower asphalt and construction volumes in key states as projects were delayed. Like-for-like readymixed concrete volumes were higher than the prior\n\n## Current Year 2020\n\n| Results                     |        | Analysis of change   | Analysis of change   | Analysis of change   | Analysis of change     | Analysis of change   | Analysis of change   | Analysis of change   |\n|-----------------------------|--------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| $ million                   | 2019   | Exchange             | Acquisitions         | Divestments          | Impairment/ One-offs 1 | Organic              | 2020                 | % change             |\n| Sales revenue               | 11,626 | -37                  | +43                  | -39                  | -                      | -320                 | 11,273               | -3%                  |\n| EBITDA (as de/fined)*       | 2,194  | -2                   | +8                   | +2                   | -24                    | +227                 | 2,405                | 10%                  |\n| Operating pro/fit           | 1,423  | +1                   | +5                   | +5                   | -25                    | +222                 | 1,631                | 15%                  |\n| EBITDA (as de/fined)*/sales | 18.9%  |                      |                      |                      |                        |                      | 21.3%                |                      |\n| Operating pro/fit/sales     | 12.2%  |                      |                      |                      |                        |                      | 14.5%                |                      |\n\n1 One-offs primarily due to COVID-19 related restructuring costs\n\nyear as growth in our core Florida and Texas markets continued.

Good incremental volumes coupled with strong price discipline and cost control resulted in operating pro/fit improvements.\n\n## Cement\n\nOur cement business delivered operating pro/fit growth in 2020, driven primarily by strong price realisation, performance improvement initiatives and cost saving measures. Sales volumes in the US operations were 2% ahead of prior year on a total and like-for-like basis as strong demand in the west more than offset COVID-19 related impacts in other regions. Volumes in Canada were behind 2019 due to the impact of COVID-19 restrictions, particularly during the /first half of the year.\n\nCement consumption in Southeast Brazil increased in 2020 enabling CRH to achieve volume growth combined with increased prices which resulted in operating pro/fit improvements.",

        "page_content": "## How We Create Value\n\nOur Europe Materials businesses are differentiated in local markets by deep market knowledge which drives performance, and a proven track record of serving the unique needs of local customers. Value creation is a continuous focus for the Division.\n\nWith a strong and stable core market in Western Europe and an increasingly important growth market in Eastern Europe, we are constantly focused on identifying opportunities to extend and strengthen our positions in regional markets. We do this through identifying bolt-on and new acquisition opportunities which can be ef/ficiently integrated with existing operations and which enable us to capitalise on growth opportunities and further expand our offering to local customers.\n\nOur vertically integrated business model means that we can maximise the use of our assets through a combination of self-supply to our downstream operations as well as sales to our external customers.\n\nOur strong track record in acquiring businesses that provide vertical integration opportunities helps ensure that we are competitive in all product lines and well positioned to deliver a strong return on our assets.\n\nWe place a great emphasis on commercial and operational excellence across our extensive network leveraging talent, synergies for procurement, cost and logistics management.\n\nWe recognise the ef/ficiencies that can be realised in our materials businesses through improving the environmental performance of our operations. We are continually extending our use of alternative fuels, alternative raw materials and other technologies to produce and deliver more sustainable building materials for our customers.\n\n## How We Structure Our Operations\n\nOur Europe Materials Division operates in 19 countries in Europe and two in Asia and is organised across /five operational clusters (Tarmac (UK), Europe North, Europe West, Europe East and Asia).\n\nThe Division employs approximately 26,800 people at over 1,155 locations. A further 5,820 people are employed in our equity accounted investment in China.\n\n## Where Our Products Are Used\n\n## Aggregates\n\nOur businesses extract, process and supply a range of aggregates products including sand, gravel, and crushed granite. Typically aggregates are used in building foundations, underpinning road and rail infrastructure and in the production of products including concrete and asphalt.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Cement\n\nCement is a binding agent produced from limestone reserves and used in concrete products including readymixed concrete, precast concrete and mortars which are used extensively throughout the built environment. Cement is produced for both sale in local markets or can be shipped by road, rail and water to other markets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Readymixed Concrete\n\nConcrete is the most used man-made material on earth. It forms the foundations of buildings and homes, roads, tunnels and bridges, clean water systems and clean energy structures. Readymixed concrete is the most commonly used form of concrete.\n\n## Lime\n\nCRH's Lime businesses in Germany, Poland, Russia, Czech Republic, UK and Ireland produce lime for use by multiple industries including iron and steel, building materials, sugar, agriculture and forestry. Lime can be found in a variety of everyday products and materials including toothpaste, drinking water, windows and garden soil.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Asphalt\n\nAsphalt, which consists of aggregates bound together with bitumen is widely used as a surface material in transport infrastructure including, roads, bridges, runways, footpaths along with amenities such as racetracks, tennis courts and playgrounds. In recent years, the use of recycled material in asphalt has increased considerably.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Infrastructural Concrete\n\nWhile readymixed concrete is supplied to customers for on-site casting, our infrastructural concrete businesses produce and supply precast and pre-stressed concrete products such as /floor and wall elements, beams and vaults, pipes and manholes. These products are delivered to and assembled at construction sites. They are used widely throughout the modern built environment.\n\n## Paving & Construction Services\n\nIn addition to the supply of asphalt and other materials to road construction and maintenance projects, in certain markets we also provide installation services including crews, equipment and specialist expertise needed for preparation, paving and maintenance of traf/fic /flows on projects including roads, roundabouts and interchanges, car parks and airport runways.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n45",

Operating pro/fit was ahead of 2018 as price increases and a good contribution from performance improvement initiatives offset higher input costs and the impact of more challenging trading conditions in the UK.\n\n## Tarmac (UK)\n\nOngoing political and economic uncertainty as a result of Brexit negatively impacted Tarmac's trading environment as volumes in our aggregates and asphalt businesses /finished lower than 2018. Operating pro/fit declined as progress from performance improvement initiatives was offset by challenging market conditions and input cost in/flation.\n\n## Europe North\n\nSales and operating pro/fit in our UK cement and lime business were behind 2018 as Brexit uncertainty impacted activity levels. In Ireland, sales and operating pro/fit were well ahead of 2018 as the business bene/fited from continued market growth, underpinned by strong demand and some large projects in the Dublin region. Good volumes and price growth for all key products was achieved.\n\nSales and operating pro/fit in Finland were behind 2018 impacted by reduced demand in the residential and infrastructure sectors. Lower cement and readymixed concrete volumes were partly offset by project-related aggregates sales growth.\n\n## Europe West\n\nSales and operating pro/fit in France bene/fited from favourable trading conditions as good underlying demand in the non-residential and civil engineering sectors resulted in volumes growth and a positive pricing environment for key\n\nproducts. Ongoing performance improvement initiatives and cost savings also positively impacted pro/fitability. Sales in the Benelux were ahead of 2018, with a positive contribution from our Dutch precast businesses re/flecting good demand in the residential sector, while improved readymixed concrete pricing was partly offset by weaker volumes in the Belgian precast business. Excluding the impact of one-off income in 2018, operating pro/fit /finished ahead of 2018.\n\nIn Denmark, sales were ahead of 2018, as the business bene/fited from good demand aided by additional production capacity together with progress in pricing. Operating pro/fit /finished broadly in line with 2018 impacted by the non-recurrence of one-off income in 2018. In Spain, increased demand resulted in improved readymixed concrete volumes and prices and despite lower cement volumes, sales and operating pro/fit /finished ahead of 2018.\n\nLower cement and readymixed concrete volumes resulted in lower sales for Switzerland; however, operating pro/fit bene/fited from cost savings and good delivery of performance initiatives. In Germany, sales were marginally ahead of 2018 while operating pro/fit was behind as cement pricing progress was offset by lower volumes in our lime business.\n\n## Europe East\n\nTrading in Poland was strong with a good overall performance for 2019. Robust cement volumes and positive pricing supported by cost savings initiatives resulted in operating pro/fit ahead of 2018. In Ukraine, continued growth in cement volumes re/flected good market demand. Strong price progression was partly offset by slightly higher input costs and sales and operating pro/fit /finished ahead of 2018.\n\nStable economic and construction growth in 2019 contributed to improved sales in Hungary and Slovakia. Operating pro/fit was ahead of 2018, mainly as a result of advances in pricing, cost optimisation and savings initiatives across\n\nthe businesses. In Serbia, sales and operating pro/fit were ahead of 2018 with higher cement volumes driven by continued strong construction activity, pricing progress and cost bene/fits of enhanced production facilities. In Romania, results were ahead of 2018 due to improved pricing combined with stronger volumes in cement and readymixed concrete.\n\n## Asia\n\nDomestic demand for cement in the Philippines remained strong; however, delays in government infrastructure spending impacted cement volumes. While overall sales were in line with 2018, advances in pricing, performance improvement initiatives and cost savings resulted in operating pro/fit well ahead of 2018.\n\nIn Yatai Building Materials, strong volumes growth was only partly offset by lower prices, driven by intense local competition and lower margins on exports, resulting in higher operating pro/fit than 2018.\n\nOn 31 December 2019, the Group divested of its share of the Indian joint venture, MHIL, for a total deferred consideration of $0.3 billion. During the year, reduced demand in housing negatively impacted cement demand in MHIL's key markets in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana; despite this, operating pro/fit was ahead of 2018 as pricing improved.",

        "page_content": "Europe Materials experienced a challenging year as the recovery in the second half of the year could not fully mitigate the signi/ficant impact of COVID-19 related restrictions in the second quarter. Overall sales, EBITDA (as de/fined)* and operating performance /finished below 2019 levels as strong performances in our Eastern European businesses were offset by a more challenging backdrop in a number of countries across Western Europe. A combination of volume growth, progress in pricing, good cost control and performance improvement initiatives drove some recovery in the second half of the year.\n\nArising from the Group's impairment testing process and as a result of the combined economic impacts of COVID-19 and Brexit, total non-cash impairment charges of $0.8 billion were recognised in 2020. Europe Materials recorded impairment charges of $0.7 billion in its operating pro/fit, primarily related to its UK business. A further $0.15 billion impairment charge was recorded on the Group's associate investment in China.\n\n## Tarmac (UK)\n\nStrict COVID-19 restrictions resulted in widespread plant shutdowns during the second quarter which signi/ficantly impacted volumes during this period. Trading recovered as the year progressed, with increased paving activity in the second half of the year supporting improved aggregates and asphalt volumes; however, readymixed concrete volumes were slower to recover due to market uncertainty. Operating pro/fit, impacted by the lower volumes, impairment charges and restructuring costs, /finished below 2019 levels.\n\n## Europe North\n\nIn our UK cement and lime business, sales and operating pro/fit were behind 2019 despite positive pricing as COVID-19 restrictions impacted activity levels. Ireland also experienced signi/ficant COVID-19 related restrictions in the second quarter of 2020; however, strong cement volumes in the second half of the year, cost savings initiatives and robust pricing across all product lines saw operating pro/fit outperform 2019. Sales in Finland were ahead of prior year, but operating pro/fit was impacted by less favourable product mix.\n\n## Europe West\n\nIn France, cement volumes recovered in the second half of the year and good pricing was maintained across all products; however, overall volumes were signi/ficantly impacted by COVID-19 restrictions in the /first half of the year. Sales and operating pro/fit in France were below 2019 levels despite ongoing performance improvement and cost savings initiatives. Like-for-like operating pro/fit in the Benelux /finished ahead of 2019, with a positive contribution from our Dutch structural businesses partly offset by lower cement and structural concrete volumes in Belgium.\n\nIn Denmark, sales and operating pro/fit /finished\n\nbehind 2019, due to weaker new residential construction partially offset by strong cost control. Sales volumes and operating pro/fit in Spain were affected by COVID-19 restrictions despite focused cost control actions. Challenging cement and readymixed concrete volumes in Switzerland were partially offset by cement price increases, good aggregates volumes and cost savings initiatives but operating pro/fit /finished behind 2019 levels. In Germany, sales were broadly in line with 2019 levels, as increases in cement pricing offset slightly lower lime volumes. Operating pro/fit /finished behind 2019 due to the impact of higher input costs.\n\n## Current Year 2020\n\n| Results                        |       | Analysis of change   | Analysis of change   | Analysis of change   | Analysis of change   | Analysis of change   | Analysis of change   | Analysis of change   | Analysis of change   |\n|--------------------------------|-------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| $ million                      | 2019  | Exchange             | Acquisitions         | Divestments          | Impairment           | One-offs 1           | Organic              | 2020                 | % change             |\n| Sales revenue                  | 9,509 | +105                 | +63                  | -27                  | -                    | -                    | -509                 | 9,141                | -4%                  |\n| EBITDA (as de/fined)*          | 1,208 | +14                  | +7                   | -3                   | -                    | -83                  | -88                  | 1,055                | -13%                 |\n| Operating pro/fit/(loss)       | 622   | +5                   | +1                   | -2                   | -660                 | -83                  | -73                  | -190                 | -131%                |\n| EBITDA (as de/fined)*/sales    | 12.7% |                      |                      |                      |                      |                      |                      | 11.5%                |                      |\n| Operating pro/fit/(loss)/sales | 6.5%  |                      |                      |                      |                      |                      |                      | -2.1%                |                      |\n\n1 One-offs primarily due to COVID-19 related restructuring costs\n\n## Europe East\n\nCement sales in Poland were slightly ahead of 2019 as positive cement pricing more than offset lower volumes, and overall operating pro/fit was ahead due to good cost control and lower fuel costs. Operating pro/fit was also ahead of 2019 in Ukraine despite a challenging pricing environment as cost savings initiatives and lower fuel and logistics costs resulted in improved performance. In Romania, sales and operating pro/fit both strongly exceeded prior year, as a continuation of infrastructure projects, the positive impact of local and national elections and increased residential repair works contributed to growing cement demand with pricing above 2019 levels.\n\nPositive pricing in both Slovakia and Hungary coupled with good cost control contributed to operating pro/fit ahead of 2019 despite both economies being impacted by COVID-19 and an overall decline in construction output. In Serbia, sales and operating pro/fit were ahead of 2019 with higher cement volumes, positive pricing and business improvement initiatives.\n\n## Asia\n\nDomestic demand for cement in the Philippines was severely impacted between mid-March and May as COVID-19 restrictions resulted in plant shutdowns. Despite this challenging backdrop and lower pricing, operating pro/fit /finished well ahead of 2019 due to cost savings, performance improvement initiatives and improved volumes in the second half of the year.\n\nCRH's operations include a 26% stake in Yatai Building Materials in China where, despite a severe COVID-19 impact in the /first quarter, full year cement volumes ended ahead of 2019. Pricing remained challenging in the region which, in addition to the non-cash impairment charge resulted in operating pro/fit below 2019 levels.",

Initiatives, which included production ef/ficiencies, commercial excellence, procurement savings and overhead cost control also helped to deliver improved margins.\n\nSolid macroeconomic conditions in the US continued to provide a positive backdrop for construction demand. Volumes growth, especially new residential construction activity, was limited by higher interest rates entering 2019, as well as continued supply-side factors such as labour availability and construction cost in/flation. Similar to prior years, growth primarily occurred along the West Coast, Southeast and South Central US due to good non-residential construction activity and positive residential RMI demand.\n\nIn Europe, markets in the Netherlands and Poland continued to bene/fit from good demand. Despite Brexit uncertainties, our businesses in the UK showed resilience with solid performances in the residential and telecoms sectors. Results in Germany were impacted by slower markets and increased competition.\n\n2019 saw further re/finement of the portfolio, including the divestment of Europe Distribution, the Shutters & Awnings and Perimeter Protection businesses in Europe, together with 16 bolt-on acquisitions, primarily at our Infrastructure and Architectural Products businesses.\n\n## Architectural Products\n\nArchitectural Products in North America experienced good sales growth, capitalising on solid residential RMI demand and favourable weather in most markets, especially in Eastern US. Product mix optimisation and targeted selling prices helped to recover input cost in/flation in most markets, but trading was partly offset by challenging market conditions in\n\nCanada. Overall, the business delivered strong operating pro/fit growth, bolstered by operating ef/ficiencies, contributions from acquisitions and cost reduction initiatives.\n\nThe European businesses recorded strong sales and pro/fits in the /first half of 2019, supported by good weather, operational improvements and selling price advancement. Demand slowed during the second-half in Western Europe, with wet weather being a contributory factor. Overall sales and pro/fits for the year were mixed, with a strong performance in Poland partly offset by some softness in Western Europe.\n\nThe Shutters & Awnings business, which was divested in June, recorded results similar to the comparable period in 2018, with the positive impact of more benign weather conditions in the /first half of the year offset by increased competition in Germany.\n\n## Building Envelope\n\nBuilding Envelope saw like-for-like sales growth driven by good demand and increased selling prices in our C.R. Laurence and aluminium glazing businesses. Sales growth was limited by competitive markets in the fabricated glass business. In addition to revenue growth, higher operating pro/fits were achieved due to more stable aluminium input costs, a strategic shift away from larger lower margin projects and focus on self-help initiatives.\n\n## Infrastructure Products\n\nOur Infrastructure Products business in North America recorded healthy sales growth in 2019 due to good demand for both private construction and public infrastructure, particularly in the Southeast and West regions of the US. Building on progress in 2018, Infrastructure Products was successful at delivering price increases in excess of input cost in/flation.\n\nThe business recorded signi/ficantly increased operating pro/fit due to improved operational ef/ficiencies, commercial initiatives and overhead cost control. The business also experienced another year of backlog growth in 2019.\n\nOur European and Australian business (formerly Network Access Products) delivered a year of solid growth. Performance in Europe was well ahead of 2018 due to increased sales to the telecom and rail sectors. However, Australian sales were below 2018 due to challenging market conditions in the telecom sector. Overall operating pro/fit /finished ahead of 2018.\n\nThe Perimeter Protection business was divested in September. Compared with the same period in 2018, the business recorded lower sales while operating pro/fits advanced due to cost improvements.\n\n## Construction Accessories\n\nThe US business achieved strong organic\n\nsales and operating pro/fit growth due to increased volumes and prices against the backdrop of a solid US non-residential market. The Construction Accessories business in Europe recorded a 4% increase in like-for-like sales compared with 2018, along with higher operating pro/fit, driven by commercial excellence initiatives and positive market trends in certain geographies. Revenue growth was driven by the UK, France, the Netherlands and Switzerland. Our German business was impacted by increased competition and market uncertainty during the second half of the year.",

        "page_content": "In 2020, Building Products recorded like-for-like sales growth of 4% due to strong residential RMI demand, especially in North America, which more than offset the effect of a more subdued non-residential sector. Ongoing business improvement initiatives and COVID-19 mitigating actions delivered higher margins through production ef/ficiencies, commercial excellence, procurement savings and overhead cost control. On a like-for-like basis EBITDA (as de/fined)* increased by 8% and operating pro/fit by 11%, as a result of the improved sales growth and continued progress with cost reductions.\n\nFollowing a strong start to the year, economic conditions in North America and Europe were signi/ficantly impacted by COVID-19. The pandemic particularly affected non-residential construction activity while the residential sector was bolstered by increased home improvement activity.\n\nActivity levels in North America were impacted by COVID-19 restrictions from the /first quarter of 2020, mostly affecting the West Coast, Northeastern US, and Canada. In Europe, construction markets showed resilience in Central and Eastern European countries, while much of Western Europe, notably the UK, France, and Belgium, saw more severe volume impacts from lockdown restrictions, particularly in the /first half of the year.\n\nTwo divestments and six bolt-on acquisitions were completed in 2020. Building Products' largest acquisitions were two manufacturers of underground enclosures in Tennessee and Texas, both within Infrastructure Products.\n\n## Architectural Products\n\nArchitectural Products in North America delivered strong sales growth in 2020, re/flecting positive market demand across all product groups and regions. With North America seeing heightened residential RMI demand, sales through both our retail and professional channels increased. The businesses delivered signi/ficant\n\nmargin expansion from the continued focus on operational excellence, as well as modest price growth and tight overhead cost control. Sales in our European businesses were ahead mainly due to volume growth in Germany and Poland.\n\n## Building Envelope\n\nBuilding Envelope's sales were lower than 2019, with COVID-19 restrictions unfavourably impacting volumes across key products and geographies, particularly at C.R. Laurence. Volumes were impacted by the softening of non-residential markets, with a number of projects being delayed or cancelled, while the selling price environment remained competitive. As restrictions eased, the rate of sales decline lessened over the course of the second half. Operating pro/fit was behind 2019 as a result of lower volumes, partly offset by cost management initiatives.\n\n## Infrastructure Products\n\nLike-for-like sales were lower than 2019 because of reduced demand as a number of non-residential and public infrastructure projects were delayed or cancelled due to COVID-19. However, sales of key products to the communications sector and electric utilities proved to be resilient as demand for IT infrastructure was strong. The business recorded increased like-for-like operating pro/fit due to continued performance improvement measures and focused cost control. Europe recorded lower like-for-like sales in 2020 because of COVID-19 restrictions in key markets, particularly the UK. In Australia, like-for-like sales were below prior year due to continued challenges in the telecom sector in the country.\n\n## Current Year 2020\n\n| Results                     |       | Analysis of change   | Analysis of change   | Analysis of change   | Analysis of change     | Analysis of change   |       |          |\n|-----------------------------|-------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|------------------------|----------------------|-------|----------|\n| $ million                   | 2019  | Exchange             | Acquisitions         | Divestments          | Impairment/ One-offs 1 | Organic              | 2020  | % change |\n| Sales revenue               | 6,997 | +14                  | +262                 | -347                 | -                      | +247                 | 7,173 | 3%       |\n| EBITDA (as de/fined)*       | 1,076 | -                    | +50                  | -32                  | -15                    | +91                  | 1,170 | 9%       |\n| Operating pro/fit           | 748   | -1                   | +26                  | -17                  | -19                    | +85                  | 822   | 10%      |\n| EBITDA (as de/fined)*/sales | 15.4% |                      |                      |                      |                        |                      | 16.3% |          |\n| Operating pro/fit/sales     | 10.7% |                      |                      |                      |                        |                      | 11.5% |          |\n\n- 1 One-offs primarily due to COVID-19 related restructuring costs\n\n## Construction Accessories\n\nLike-for-like sales were lower than 2019 because of COVID-19 shutdowns affecting project activity particularly in the /first half. In Europe, sales were worst affected in Western Europe, with Central and Eastern European markets experiencing more resilient demand. Sales in Australia bene/fited from several large infrastructure projects, while North America recorded lower like-for-like sales due to increased competition, further compounded by COVID-19. Operating pro/fit was lower in 2020, as the unfavourable volume impact was only partly offset by overhead cost savings and bene/fits from ongoing procurement, commercial and operational initiatives.",

In keeping with prior years, details of CRH's general governance practices are available in the governance appendix on CRH's website, www.crh.com (the 'Governance Appendix') 1 . CRH implemented the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code (the '2018 Code') and this Report explains how the principles of the 2018 Code have been applied.\n\n## Operation of the Board in the context of COVID-19\n\nSince the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Board has met remotely through the use of video technology. Whilst the lack of in-person interaction, both in formal and informal settings, presents challenges I am pleased to report that the cohesiveness of the Board was not adversely impacted. In addition, we were able to support the management team in navigating through an unprecedented crisis and focus on the objectives the Board had set itself for the year.\n\nAs outlined in other sections of this Annual Report, the safety and well-being of our people was our main priority in the last 12 months. The Board received regular reports on the impact of COVID-19 on our employees and provided oversight in relation to the many initiatives to support and communicate with them. In addition, we reviewed and considered the impact of CRH's payment policies on our customers and suppliers. We also spent a signi/ficant amount of time on the Company's strategy, with an in-depth focus on areas such as vertical integration, the assessment of our portfolio of businesses and the way they are organised, and government infrastructure funding.\n\nThe safety and wellbeing of our people was our main priority in the last 12 months.'\n\n## Richie Boucher\n\nChairman\n\nDespite the challenges of COVID-19 restrictions, our ongoing process of Board renewal is continuing. Our work in this area since last year's report is outlined in detail in the Nomination & Corporate Governance Committee's report to shareholders on pages 64 to 66.\n\n## Stakeholder Engagement\n\nPrior to the 2020 Annual General Meeting (AGM), we actively engaged with CRH's major shareholders on the AGM agenda and general governance matters. This process, which has been in place for many years, was especially valuable in understanding investor perspectives and priorities in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAs mentioned in my introduction to this Annual Report on page 5, I have also engaged extensively with shareholders on progress in relation to my priorities as Chairman and we have actively engaged with investor groups on various important matters, including sustainability.\n\nIn addition, the Board receives recommendations from the Safety, Environmental and Social Responsibility (SESR) Committee in relation to the areas within its remit, which includes overall responsibility for employee engagement.

        "page_content": "of the SESR Committee is described in detail on pages 70 to 73.\n\nThe full range of ways in which we engage with our stakeholders are set out on page 25, which also includes a summary of each stakeholder's main areas of interest and the outcomes of the various engagement processes in 2020.\n\nFeedback from all engagement activities is regularly considered by the Board as part of its decision-making processes.\n\n## Organisation Structure and Senior Executive Succession\n\nThe Board approved a revised organisational structure for management, which took effect in January 2021. The new structure will bolster the leadership team, further drive performance, enhance strategic insights and implementation, provide increased exposure of the wider executive team to the Board and support succession planning for our senior leaders.\n\nThe Board has also appointed an external /firm to work with it in the area of long-term succession planning, which includes assessing internal and external executives against the speci/fications for senior roles, designing individual development plans and supporting transition processes.\n\nAs detailed further in the Nomination & Corporate Governance Committee report on page 64, the process for the appointment of Senan Murphy's successor as Finance Director is well advanced.\n\n## External Board Appointments\n\nDuring 2020, I was invited to join the Board of Clonbio Group Limited as a non-executive Director. The CRH Board, chaired by the Senior Independent Director for this purpose, approved my taking up this role. In doing so, they were satis/fied that there would be no adverse impact on my time commitment to CRH or on my ability to ful/fil the responsibilities of my role as Chairman.\n\nLamar McKay, Heather Ann McSharry and Mary Rhinehart also sought and received approval to take up additional Board roles. The Board was also satis/fied in each case that their new commitments will not impinge on their non-executive duties on the CRH Board.\n\nThe external directorships of each Director are detailed in their biographies on pages 54 to 57.\n\n## Board Performance Evaluation\n\nAnnually the Senior Independent Director conducts a Board Performance Evaluation (BPE) and reports the outcome to the Board. Actions taken in respect of recommendations are actively monitored.\n\n## 2018 Code - Compliance Statement\n\nThe principles set out in the 2018 Code emphasise the value of good corporate governance to the long-term sustainable success of listed companies. These principles, and the supporting provisions, cover /five broad themes:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1. Board Leadership and Corporate Purpose\n- 2. Division of Responsibilities\n- 3. Composition, Succession and Evaluation\n- 4. Audit, Risk and Internal Controls\n- 5. Remuneration\n\nAs demonstrated by this Report, CRH applied the principles and complied with the provisions of the 2018 Code in 2020, save that for the reasons outlined on page 72 the Board has delegated responsibility to the SESR Committee for workforce engagement. A copy of the 2018 Code can be obtained from the Financial Reporting Council's website, www.frc.org.uk .\n\nThe 2020 BPE involved one to one meetings, held by video call, with feedback being provided on strategy, the operation of the Board and its Committees, the management of the Board in the context of COVID-19, talent management, succession planning for the Board and senior management and the process for my transition into the role of Chairman. The report contained a small number of recommendations to further enhance the performance of the Board, including suggested future areas of focus in relation to strategy, Committee refreshment and the ongoing long-term senior executive succession process referred to above. In relation to the Board's renewal priorities, the report also reinforced the focus on diversity, including gender and ethnicity.\n\nAn external /firm will be engaged to conduct an externally facilitated review of the Board's effectiveness during 2021.\n\n## Migration of CRH Shares to Euroclear Bank\n\nIn February 2021, an Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) of shareholders was held, at which Ordinary and Preference shareholders approved resolutions to authorise the migration of CRH's Ordinary and Preference shares held electronically in the UK-based CREST settlement system to Euroclear Bank (the 'Migration'), the simpli/fication of CRH's share capital by the surrender and cancellation of the Income Shares and various changes to the Articles of Association. Class meetings of the Company's Preference shareholders were also held, at which changes in preference share rights resulting from the Migration were approved.\n\nIn order to facilitate shareholder engagement at the EGM in the context of COVID-19 related restrictions, shareholders were able to participate and ask questions on a real-time basis via a live audio-cast.\n\nThe Board has since con/firmed CRH's implementation of the Migration. Accordingly, settlement of share trades in Euroclear Bank will commence on 15 March 2021.\n\n## Litigation and Compliance\n\nThe Group General Counsel regularly updates the Board and Committees on relevant legal and compliance matters and provides reports on any material matters that arise requiring Board decisions or detailed consideration.\n\n## Re-election of Directors\n\nTable 7 on page 65 provides a summary of competencies, important to the long-term success of the Group, that each Director seeking re-election at the 2021 AGM brings to the Board.\n\nI have evaluated the performance of each Director and am satis/fied that each Director is committed to their role, provides constructive challenge and devotes suf/ficient time and energy to contribute effectively to the performance of the Board.\n\nI strongly recommend that shareholders vote in favour of the re-appointment of each Director going forward for re-election at the 2021 AGM.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn a challenging year, I am satis/fied that the CRH Board continued to perform effectively and that its corporate governance processes are robust. The Board continues to actively review strategy and oversees the achievement of, and progress towards meeting, agreed strategic targets and objectives. The importance of our people, our values and our culture to achieving our strategic aims was evident in the strong performance of the Group in the most challenging of circumstances in 2020. Diversity, including gender and ethnicity, are an important focus for Board renewal, senior management succession and generally throughout the Company and I look forward to updating you on progress in this area.\n\n## Richie Boucher\n\nChairman\n\n3 March 2021\n\n59",

This included consideration of the impact, if any, on the Group's Going Concern and Viability Statements, the Group's internal controls and risk management systems and on the operation and effectiveness of the Group's Internal Audit function.\n\nWe also engaged extensively with Deloitte on the delivery of the 2020 external audit plan in a predominantly remote working environment.\n\n## What did we do?\n\nFollowing a formal and competitive external audit tender process, details of which were set out in the 2018 Annual Report and Form 20-F, Deloitte replaced EY as the Group's external auditor with effect from the /financial year commencing 1 January 2020. A key area of focus for the Committee during 2020 was, therefore, monitoring the audit transition process and Deloitte's delivery of the 2020 external audit plan. Richard Muschamp is the Group's lead audit engagement partner. Following an assessment of Deloitte's continued independence, objectivity and performance, and having received con/firmation of their willingness to continue in of/fice, the Committee has recommended to the Board Deloitte's continuance in of/fice for the /financial year commencing 1 January 2021. Their continuance in of/fice will be subject to a non-binding advisory vote at the 2021 AGM.\n\n## What did we do?\n\nWe reviewed the 2020 Annual Report and Form 20-F and the appropriateness of the Group's accounting principles, practices and policies and prior year restatement, together with the annual and half-year /financial statements and the Going Concern and Viability Statements, and recommended them to Board for approval.\n\nIn July 2020, we met with Deloitte to agree the 2020 external audit plan. This included robust discussion and challenge with both Deloitte and management on the scope, materiality thresholds and structure of the 2020 external audit plan. Table 2 on page 62 outlines the key areas identi/fied as being potentially signi/ficant and how we addressed these during the year.\n\n## What did we do?\n\nThrough discussions with both management and Deloitte, we reviewed management's impairment testing methodology and processes, including key judgement areas and assumptions as well as the relevant accounting and disclosure requirements. We found the methodology to be robust and the results of the testing process appropriate. Further details in relation to the impairment outcome for 2020 are outlined in table 2 on page 62.\n\n## What did we do?\n\nWe reviewed the impact of the change in the Group's reporting currency from euro to US Dollar with effect from 1 January 2020, including the release of re-translated /financial information for 2018 and 2019 in US Dollar in April 2020 in order to provide analysts and investors with comparable US Dollar historical information and the audited US Dollar /financial statements for 2018 and 2019 included in this 2020 Annual Report and Form 20-F.\n\n## What did we do?\n\nWe continued to monitor and assess the Group's Enterprise Risk Management framework, the principal and emerging risks and uncertainties facing the Group and the methodology and processes underlying the Viability Statement included on page 29 of our Risk and Resilience section, including the impact of COVID-19 and the impact of material climate-related and other emerging risks. We also considered an assessment of the Group's risk management and internal control systems. This had regard to risk management strategies and all material controls, including /financial, operational and compliance controls that could affect the Group's business.\n\n## What did we do?\n\nWe continued to monitor the Group's IT governance and information security programme and ability to address cyber security threats, including the potential increased risks arising from predominantly remote working arrangements in the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n61",

The annual goodwill impairment testing was conducted by management, and papers outlining the methodology and assumptions used in, and the results of, that assessment were presented to the Committee. This included review of key judgement areas and assumptions such as CGU determination, discount rates and growth rates. Following its deliberations, the Committee was satis/fied that the methodology used by management (which was consistent with prior years) and the results of the assessment, together with the disclosures in note 16, were appropriate.\n\nAs noted elsewhere in this report, an impairment charge of $0.8 billion, of which $0.4 billion relates to goodwill, has been recognised in the 2020 Consolidated Financial Statements. The charge in respect of impairment of goodwill relates to our UK business.\n\n## What did we do?\n\nIn addition to the goodwill impairment testing process discussed above, the Group also undertook its assessment of the potential for impairment of other non-current assets (property, plant & equipment and /financial assets) as and when indicators of impairment arise. Papers outlining the methodology and assumptions used in, and the results of, that assessment were presented to the Committee. This included review of key judgement areas and assumptions such as CGU determination, discount rates and growth rates. Following its deliberations, the Committee was satis/fied that the methodology used by management (which was consistent with prior years) and the results of the assessment, together with the disclosures in notes 11 and 15, were appropriate. As noted elsewhere in this report, an impairment charge of $0.8 billion has been recognised in the 2020 Consolidated Financial Statements, of which $0.4 billion related to property, plant and equipment and /financial assets. The charge in respect of impairment of property, plant and equipment relates primarily to our European business, while the impairment in respect of /financial assets relates to our associate investment in China.\n\n## What did we do?\n\nIFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers requires revenue and expenses to be recognised on uncompleted contracts, with the underlying principle that, once the outcome of a long-term construction contract can be reliably estimated, revenue and expenses associated with that contract should be recognised by reference to the percentage of completion. If it is anticipated that the contract will be onerous (i.e. its unavoidable cost exceeds the economic bene/fit of the contract), a provision is created. Following discussion with management and Deloitte, recognising that the majority of contracts were completed within the /financial year, the Committee was satis/fied that the recognition of contract revenue (including the associated disclosures) was appropriate for the Group in 2020.\n\n## Percentage of Audit and Non-audit Fees (i)\n\nTable 3\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- (i) Following a formal and extensive audit tender process, Deloitte replaced EY as the Group's external auditor with effect from the /financial year commencing 1 January 2020.",

        "page_content": "## External Auditor\n\n## Effectiveness\n\nThe Committee, on behalf of the Board, is responsible for the relationship with the external auditor and for monitoring the effectiveness and quality of the external audit process and the independence of the auditor. Following a formal and extensive audit tender process, Deloitte was appointed as the Group's external auditor with effect from 1 January 2020. The Committee's primary means of assessing the effectiveness of the external audit process is by monitoring performance against the agreed audit plan.\n\nThe Committee also considers the experience and knowledge of the external audit team and the results of post-audit interviews with management and the Audit Committee Chairman. These annual procedures are supplemented by periodic formal reviews of the performance of the external auditor.\n\nIn advance of the commencement of the 2020 external audit, the Committee reviewed and approved Deloitte's letter of engagement, which set out con/firmation of Deloitte's independence within the meaning of the applicable regulations and professional standards. In July, the Committee met with Deloitte to agree the 2020 external audit plan. Table 2 on page 62 outlines the key areas identi/fied as being potentially signi/ficant and how these were addressed during the year. The Committee met regularly with Deloitte during 2020 to monitor progress in relation to the 2020 plan, which included meetings in the absence of management to discuss any issues that Deloitte wished to raise directly with the Committee. In February 2021, the Committee received and considered a report from Deloitte on its key audit /findings, including the key risks and signi/ficant areas of judgements, prior to making a recommendation to the Board in relation to the approval of this 2020 Annual Report and Form 20-F.\n\nFurther details in relation to the external auditor, including information on how auditor objectivity and independence are maintained, are included in Section 2 of the Governance Appendix.\n\nAll of the above procedures indicated a high-level of satisfaction with the services provided by Deloitte to CRH during 2020.\n\n## Non-audit Fees\n\nIn order to ensure auditor independence and objectivity, the Committee has a policy governing the provision of audit and non-audit services by the external auditor.\n\nIn 2020, Deloitte provided a number of audit services, including Sarbanes-Oxley Section 404 attestation 1 , and a limited number of non-audit services, including the provision of help with local tax compliance, advice on taxation laws and other related matters; assignments which typically involve relatively low fees. The Committee is satis/fied that the external auditors' knowledge of the Group was an important factor in choosing them to provide these services. The Committee is also satis/fied that the fees paid to Deloitte for non-audit work in 2020, which amounted to $0.1 million and represented less than 1% of the total fees for the year, did not compromise their independence or objectivity. Details of the amounts paid to the external auditor during the year for audit and other services are set out in note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 153 (see also table 3 on page 62). Further details in relation to the Group's policy regarding non-audit fees are set out in Section 2 of the Governance Appendix.\n\n## Internal Audit Effectiveness\n\nIn December 2019, the Committee received and approved the Internal Audit Charter and audit plan for 2020. During the year, the Committee received regular updates from the Head of Internal Audit on the impact of COVID-19 on the delivery of the 2020 plan and on the principal /findings from the work of Internal Audit and management's responses thereto.\n\nExternal Quality Assessments of Internal Audit are conducted periodically to ensure that the Internal Audit function continues to work ef/ficiently and effectively and in compliance with good practice standards.\n\nThe Head of Internal Audit has direct access to me as Chairman of the Audit Committee and the Committee meets with the Head of Internal Audit on a regular basis without the presence of management.\n\n## Audit Committee Effectiveness and Priorities for 2021\n\nDuring 2020, the Committee and the Board reviewed the operation, performance and effectiveness of the Committee and I am pleased to con/firm that the Committee continues to operate effectively. I would like to thank my fellow Committee members for their commitment and input to the work of the Committee during 2020.\n\nLooking ahead to 2021, the Committee will continue to focus on the key ongoing areas outlined in table 1 page 61, and will also continue to monitor and assess the potential impact of the principal and emerging risks and uncertainties on the Group's consolidated /financial statements.\n\n## Shaun Kelly\n\nChairman of Audit Committee 3 March 2021\n\n63",

The purpose of this report is to outline the workings of, and principal matters considered by, the Committee in the last 12 months. General details in relation to the roles and responsibilities of the Committee, its operation and the policies applied by it, can be found in the Governance Appendix, available on our website, www.crh.com.\n\n## Committee Membership\n\nThe Committee currently consists of four non-executive Directors, considered by the Board to be independent. The biographical details of each member are set out on pages 54 to 57. The Chief Executive normally attends meetings of the Committee.\n\n## Board Renewal\n\nIn last year's report I highlighted that one of my priorities is enhancing the Board's expertise by having additional colleagues, from diverse backgrounds, join the Board who have extensive experience of capital-intensive businesses with similar activities in North America or Europe. Following an extensive search, supported by Egon Zehnder 1 , the Committee recommended to the Board that Rick Fearon and Lamar McKay join the Board as non-executive Directors with effect from 3 December 2020. Rick and Lamar bring deep /financial and operational expertise from their senior executive roles in capital intensive, global industrial businesses. Their intimate knowledge of the markets in which CRH operates, including North America, together with\n\nDiversity is a core criteria of the Board's renewal policy and work in overseeing senior management succession.'\n\n## Richie Boucher\n\nChairman\n\nexperience in risk management and sustainable business practices, will be a valuable resource for our Board as we continue to execute on our strategy and to drive shareholder value. Their detailed biographies are set out on pages 55 and 56 respectively.\n\nFollowing nine and six years on the Board respectively, Heather Ann McSharry and Lucinda Riches are not seeking re-election at the 2021 AGM and, therefore, will retire as Directors at the conclusion of that meeting. I would like to thank each of them for their exceptional service and commitment to CRH.\n\n## Finance Director\n\nIn September 2020, Senan Murphy advised the Board of his intention to retire from the Board and as an executive during 2021. He is not seeking re-election as a Director and consequently will retire from the Board following the conclusion of the 2021 AGM. He will, however, continue to act as Group Finance Director in a full-time capacity for a period of time to support the transition to his successor. The succession process, which is being conducted with the support of Spencer Stuart, is well-advanced.",

As such, the priorities for renewal and succession evolve over time. Diversity is a core criteria of the Board's renewal policy, which is set out on page 68, and work in overseeing senior management succession. Accordingly, diversity, including but not limited to gender and ethnicity, is an integral part of developing short lists of internal and external candidates and is part of the search speci/fication agreed with external agents. In addition, the Board has set a target of a minimum of 33% of senior leaders being women by 2030.\n\nThe Committee and the SESR Committee collectively work with management on the inclusion and diversity agenda at below Board level across CRH and monitor progress against agreed Group objectives and targets.\n\n## Board Committee Structure and Composition\n\nDuring 2020, following a review of the Board's Committees we recommended to the Board that the Acquisitions Committee and the Finance Committee be merged into a new combined Acquisitions, Divestments and Finance (ADF) Committee. The terms of reference of the new ADF Committee are available on the CRH website, www.crh.com.\n\nThe Committee also recommended some updates to its own terms of reference in relation to the Committee's duties and responsibilities, including emphasising the importance of the development of diverse pipeline candidates in succession processes. The updated terms of reference are also available on the CRH website, www.crh.com.\n\nOn the Committee's recommendation, the Board has appointed Rick Fearon to the ADF Committee and the Audit Committee and Lamar McKay to the ADF Committee, Audit Committee and SESR Committee. Further changes to the Board's\n\nCommittees will be implemented following the conclusion of the 2021 AGM.\n\n## Corporate Governance\n\nThe Committee is responsible for reviewing the independence of Board members and has recommended to the Board that all of the non-executive Directors be deemed to be independent. The Committee also monitors developments in best practice in relation to corporate governance and makes recommendations to the Board in relation to changes and enhancements to current procedures. As in prior years, there was extensive engagement with shareholders during 2020 on governance matters.\n\n## Richie Boucher\n\nChairman of the Nomination\n\n- & Corporate Governance Committee\n- 3 March 2021\n\nStaker Parson Materials & Construction, part of CRH's Americas Materials Division is a leading provider of paving, concrete, construction services and landscaping in Utah.

The spread of nationalities of the Directors re/flects the geographical reach of the Group and we consider that the Board as a whole has the appropriate blend of skills, knowledge and experience, from a wide range of industries, regions and backgrounds, necessary to lead the Group. Section 1 of the Governance Appendix on the CRH website (www.crh.com) contains further details on the Board's structures and the Board's policies with regard to the appointment and retirement of Directors.\n\n## Role and Responsibilities\n\nThe Board is responsible for the leadership, oversight, control, development and long-term success of the Group. It is also responsible for instilling the appropriate culture, values and behaviour throughout the organisation. There is a formal schedule of matters reserved to the Board for consideration and decision. This includes the matters set out in table 8.\n\nThe Group's strategy, which is regularly reviewed by the Board, and business model are summarised on pages 14 to 17. The Board has delegated some of its responsibilities to Committees of the Board. While responsibility for monitoring the effectiveness of the Group's risk management and internal control systems has been delegated to the Audit Committee 1 , the Board retains ultimate responsibility for determining the Group's risk appetite and tolerance, and annually considers a report in relation to the monitoring, controlling and reporting of identi/fied risks and uncertainties. In addition, the Board receives regular reports from the Chairman of the Audit Committee in relation to the work of that Committee in the area of risk management. Individual Directors may seek independent professional advice, at the expense of the Company, in the furtherance of their duties as a Director. The Group has a Directors' and Of/ficers' liability insurance policy in place. Directors are provided with access to all Board and Committee papers in advance of each meeting. If any Director cannot attend a meeting, they can communicate their opinions and comments on the matters to be considered via the Chairman or the relevant Committee Chairman prior to the relevant meeting.\n\n## Attendance at Meetings during the year ended 31 December 2020\n\n## Matters Reserved to the Board\n\nTable 9\n\n|                                                                     | Table 8   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| Appointment of Directors                                            |           |\n| Strategic plans for the Group                                       |           |\n| Annual budget                                                       |           |\n| Major acquisitions and disposals                                    |           |\n| Signi/ficant capital expenditure                                    |           |\n| Approval of full-year results and   the Annual Report and Form 20-F |           |\n| Approval of the interim results                                     |           |\n\n## Independence of Directors\n\nThe Board has determined that each non-executive Director remains independent.\n\n## Chairman\n\nRichie Boucher was appointed Chairman of the Group with effect from 1 January 2020. On his appointment as Chairman, he met the independence criteria set out in the 2018 Code. Although he holds other directorships, the Board has satis/fied itself that these do not adversely impact on his role as Chairman.\n\n| Name                   | Board   | Board    | ADF (i)   | ADF (i)   | Audit   | Audit    | Nomination (ii)   | Nomination (ii)   | Remuneration   | Remuneration   | SESR (iii)   | SESR (iii)   |\n|------------------------|---------|----------|-----------|-----------|---------|----------|-------------------|-------------------|----------------|----------------|--------------|--------------|\n|                        | Total   | Attended | Total     | Attended  | Total   | Attended | Total             | Attended          | Total          | Attended       | Total        | Attended     |\n| R.

In its work in the area of Board renewal and succession planning, the Nomination & Corporate Governance Committee looks at the following four criteria when considering non-executive Director roles:\n\n- \u00b7 international business experience, particularly in the regions in which the Group operates or into which it intends to expand;\n- \u00b7 skills, knowledge and expertise (including education or professional background) in areas relevant to the operation of the Board;\n- \u00b7 diversity in all aspects, including nationality, gender, social and ethnic backgrounds, cognitive and personal strengths; and\n- \u00b7 the need for an appropriately sized Board\n\nDuring the ongoing process of Board renewal, each, or a combination, of these factors can take priority. To date, the Board has not set any policy regarding age. The ages of the Directors range from 52 to 67, which the Nomination & Corporate Governance Committee believes is appropriate at the current time.\n\n## Committees\n\nThe Board has established /five permanent Committees to assist in the execution of its responsibilities. The current permanent Committees are:\n\n- \u00b7 Acquisitions, Divestments & Finance;\n- \u00b7 Audit;\n- \u00b7 Nomination & Corporate Governance;\n- \u00b7 Remuneration; and\n- \u00b7 Safety, Environment & Social Responsibility\n\nAd-hoc Committees are formed from time to time to deal with speci/fic matters.\n\n## Substantial Holdings\n\ncompliance training and communications, providing legal advice on compliance and business issues, monitoring and investigating Hotline calls, competition/antitrust law, and ensuring the Group is informed of any changes to regulation and/or reporting requirements.\n\n## Code of Business Conduct\n\nOur culture as a company is built on our commitment to upholding the CRH Values and in particular, doing what we say and leading with integrity. This means we do the right things in the right way, comply with the law and work responsibly. The foundation of the Legal and Compliance programme is the Code of Business Conduct (CoBC) and supporting policies, which set out our standards of legal, honest and ethical behaviour. The CoBC complies with the applicable code of ethics regulations of the SEC arising from the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The CoBC is applicable to all employees of the CRH Group, including the Chief Executive, our Global Leadership Team and senior /financial of/ficers. During the year, the CoBC was refreshed and will be launched in 2021.\n\nCRH's Internal Audit function works side-by-side with Legal and Compliance in monitoring compliance with the CoBC and supporting policies, and in providing an integrated approach to assurance. This cross-functional collaboration supports CRH's goal: to ensure CRH leads with integrity.\n\n## Awareness and Training\n\nIn line with our commitment to maintain high ethical business conduct standards, we continue to update and improve awareness and training efforts.

The biographical details of each member of the Committee are set out on pages 54 to 57.\n\n## Safety\n\nSafety is a priority for the Board and the SESR Committee. In 2020, there was a particular focus on the impact of COVID-19 on the health and well-being of our employees. We worked closely with management in relation to the initiatives and supports put in place for employees affected by the pandemic and monitored closely our experience compared to industry best practice and trends in society generally.\n\nWe deeply regret that there was one employee fatality and two contractor work place fatalities during 2020 and we extend our sincere sympathies to their families. The background to each accident was carefully examined by the Committee, discussed with the senior leaders responsible for the businesses concerned and reported to the Board. Learnings from accidents and 'near misses' are appropriately shared across the organisation. We also regularly monitor important safety indicators to establish if there are any trends that require investigation and receive updates on the /findings from internal and external\n\nThe SESR Committee is a key forum for engagement with management and the provision of support for, and oversight of, non-/financial initiatives which are vital to the success of CRH.'\n\nRichie Boucher Chairman\n\nsafety audits. In addition to the existing indicators which track safety performance, new leading indicators in each Division have been identi/fied and these will be reported on to the Committee on a regular basis going forward.\n\nThe Group Global Safety Council continued to provide oversight and coordination of group safety initiatives and best practice sharing. Together with management, we are resolutely focused on doing all that we can to achieve our ongoing target of zero harm and reinforcing the Group's strong safety culture across all of our operations. To that end, our Frontline Leadership program is a signi/ficant people development initiative covering c.10,000 operational frontline staff. The initiative represents a strong investment in leadership and culture to enable the human performance element of a robust safety and operational management framework. It will support the development of high performing, effective Frontline Leaders who continuously create value in our businesses. Development and rollout continued to progress safely in 2020 despite the challenges presented by COVID-19.\n\n## Climate Change and Sustainability\n\nThe CRH Board is strongly of the view that while there are undeniable challenges arising from the transition to a low carbon economy there are signi/ficant opportunities in addressing those",

We also reviewed and considered the proposed structure and format of the 2020 Sustainability Report, which will be published later this month.\n\nDuring 2020, underlying our commitment to transparent and leading practice reporting, we were delighted to become a supporter of the Financial Stability Board's 'Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures' (TCFD), which requires transparency on the /financial aspects of climate change risks and opportunities from the transition to the low-carbon economy.\n\nchallenges. Our products, including concrete, building envelope solutions and architectural products for example are essential for sustainable construction and in creating a carbon neutral built environment.\n\nFollowing the early achievement of our 2020 emissions reduction target, in 2020 the Committee and the Board approved an updated science-based carbon emission reduction roadmap, targeting an ambitious <520kg of CO2 per tonne of cementitious material by 2030. In addition, we have set a target of having 50% of revenue from products with enhanced sustainability attributes by 2025. Further details in relation to these targets are set out on page 21.\n\nThe Committee has considered with management the plans and initiatives to achieve these targets and is satis/fied, in particular, that the related capital expenditure requirements are integrated into the processes for developing the Group's capital investment programme. Progress towards the achievement of the targets is monitored regularly.\n\nThe Committee has also reviewed in detail the Group's energy usage requirements and the challenges, risks and opportunities in increasing the amount of alternative energy sources in the production of building products.\n\nIn addition to the 2030 targets referred to above, CRH has set out its ambition to achieve carbon neutrality along the cement and concrete value chain by 2050. Work to research, develop and apply new technologies in areas including carbon capture, storage and use (CCUS), re-carbonation, alternative materials and process changes that will be required to achieve this ambition is ongoing. Through the Global Cement and Concrete Association (GCCA), which has set out a similar goal of carbon neutrality, we are working closely with other companies with a global footprint and the wider community on a detailed roadmap to set out a clear plan for linking the technologies, strategies, policies and levers to achieve that vision, as well as actions and measurable milestones.\n\nIn line with CRH's best practice approach to transparent and leading practice disclosure, we support the Financial Stability Board's Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) initiative. Further information on our sustainability performance and how we support the TCFD recommendations can be found in the annual CRH Sustainability Report available on www.crh.com. The Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) Standards will be used in the preparation of the independently-assured CRH Sustainability Report 2020, which, as in previous years, will also be in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards.\n\nResponsible corporate lobbying is a key principle underpinning our interactions with policy makers directly, and indirectly through industry associations, in relation to all aspects of CRH's business, including climate change. As part of the Committee's programme of work for 2021, we will be reviewing our climate lobbying practices and related disclosures to ensure there is an alignment between those practices and the expectations of the Board and our stakeholders. Our intention is to publish the outcome of this review in due course.\n\n71",

This is supported by a speci/fic target of having a minimum of 33% of senior leaders being women by 2030. Key activities during 2020 as part of our strategy to achieve our inclusion and diversity objectives are highlighted in table 16. The SESR Committee receives an update on these activities and progress generally at each meeting.\n\n## Workforce Engagement\n\nThe Board has designated the Committee with responsibility for workforce engagement. Given the footprint of CRH with c. 77,100 employees in 30 countries, we believe this is the best and most effective way of ensuring that the views of employees are understood and are taken into consideration in the Board's decision-making processes.\n\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic impacted the roll-out of some of our planned initiatives for 2020, such as employee engagement sessions during Board site visits. Similarly, there was very limited opportunity for members of the SESR Committee to attend employee development programmes, forums, conferences and other events in their local regions. However, we did have the opportunity to join some virtual sessions and I was delighted to attend the Group's management conference which was held early last year.\n\nWhile our planned programme of work was disrupted, workforce engagement has nevertheless remained a key priority and we have received regular reports on the initiatives put in place to support and communicate with the Group's employees (see table 17). The Committee also continued to review and consider reports arising from the Group's 'Hotline' facility, with a particular focus on any COVID-19 related issues.\n\nDuring 2021, we will be undertaking an organisational health survey. The survey, which will target over half of the workforce, will seek insights on local businesses and CRH as a whole.\n\n## Examples of Sustainability Initiatives\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThrough our Americas Materials Division, we have worked with the Wildlife Habitat Council since 2004. This non-pro/fit group combines conservation and business to develop sites as wildlife habitats. The areas for wildlife habitats may be large depleted quarries, or small buffer zones between an operating plant and a highway.\n\nOur CRH Innovation Centre for Sustainable Construction (ICSC), located in the Netherlands, has recently opened a state-of-the-art laboratory for testing materials and technologies relating to CO 2 usage. This specialised R&D laboratory highlights our commitment to developing sustainable, circular solutions as we work towards our 2050 ambition for carbon neutrality along the cement and concrete value chain.\n\nWe are the largest recycler of building materials in North America. The roads we pave contain over 20% recycled materials, allowing us to reduce our carbon emissions, preserve natural resources, avoid waste and support the circular economy.\n\nOur products help create structures that embody environmentally sustainable solutions and enhance the overall sustainability performance of buildings. This includes concrete sustainable urban drainage solutions, energy-ef/ficient building envelope products and precast concrete building elements.\n\n## Inclusion & Diversity\n\nWe're committed to building an inclusive and diverse organisation where:\n\nTalented people of all backgrounds are welcome -\n\nDifferences are embraced\n\n## Key I&D Activities in 2020\n\n## Communication:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 Shared stories of inclusion and resources and best practices\n- \u00b7 Celebrated I&D events internally, including International Women's Day, Pride and World Mental Health Day\n\n## Education & Awareness:\n\n- \u00b7 Trained leaders across the Group on the importance and value of Inclusion & Diversity in the workplace\n\n## People & Practices:\n\n- \u00b7 Updated key 'People Practice' guides\n\n## Data & Measures:\n\n- \u00b7 Continued to build dashboards to share data and build awareness\n\nEveryone has a fair and equal opportunity -\n\nTo develop and progress\n\nOur working environment supports people -\n\nIn being themselves, performing at their best\n\nTable 16",

The SESR Committee therefore initiated a project and is working with management to more fully articulate CRH's purpose. A purpose which captures our aspirations beyond /financial returns, inspires our people and guides our day-to-day operations, our culture, and our strategy.\n\nThis work on corporate purpose, together with CRH's approach to I&D and employee engagement, will continue to support the Board's assessment of the alignment of CRH's purpose, values and strategy with our culture.\n\n## Code of Business Conduct\n\nThe Committee has worked with management on the refreshment of the Group's Code of Business Conduct. The updated Code, which will be launched in 2021, is intended as a practical guide to upholding CRH's values and acting ethically in our workplace, in our business practices and in our communities. A core theme in the Code is 'It begins with me', which conveys that living up to our values as a Group is only possible when each of us plays our part. This includes keeping everyone safe, following the law, doing the right thing and showing respect to others.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe SESR Committee is a key forum for engagement with management and the provision of support for, and oversight of, non-/financial initiatives which are vital to the success of CRH. I am very pleased to report that the Committee operated very effectively despite the challenges of the past year and I look forward to updating shareholders on the outcome of the ongoing project to articulate our corporate purpose and the feedback from the upcoming organisational health survey, and how these will assist the Board in assessing and ensuring the alignment of our purpose, values and strategy with our culture.\n\n## Richie Boucher\n\n## Workforce Engagement - 2020 Examples\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTable 17\n\nTable 18\n\n| Share newsletters and health & safety guides                                                                                                                                                       |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Multiple communications from management about Health & Safety, factsheets,  travel guidance ... covered health and science, economic and /financial matters  as well as changing work environments |\n| Personal messages to support, motivate and thank our people ...stories  celebrating the resolve and resilience of our people                                                                       |\n| Provision of a series of tips and guides to support managers in managing  through a crisis                                                                                                         |\n| Regular video messages from Divisional Presidents and Senior Vice Presidents  ...FAQs, talking points, action plans, site toolkits and state-speci/fic response plans                              |\n\n## Our Values\n\nAt CRH, our values unite us in the way we work, every day, all over the world.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPut safety first\n\nContinuously create value\n\nDo what we say and lead with integrity\n\nOperate locally, but act as one company\n\nBuild enduring relationships\n\n73",

This contains details of CRH's remuneration arrangements and outcomes for 2020, and also sets out the way in which we intend to implement our Policy in 2021.\n\n## Context and Performance in 2020\n\nI would like to begin this Overview by echoing the recognition and thanks expressed by Board colleagues elsewhere in this Annual Report for the exceptional contribution by all our colleagues across the organisation in responding to the unprecedented challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic for our business.\n\nCRH's /financial and business performance was robust in 2020 notwithstanding the challenges faced. The key elements of that performance are summarised in table 19 on page 75.\n\nThis is a tribute to all of our people, the strength and resilience of our business model and the leadership of our senior management team, whose decision making was decisive and who continued to focus on commercial and operational excellence. As the uncertainty at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic began to be resolved during the year we returned all funds received from government furlough schemes to the relevant agencies.\n\nThe health and well-being of our employees is a priority for the Board, and the SESR Committee report on page 70 to 73. describes our work in relation to the initiatives put in place to support our employees during the pandemic. The impact of COVID-19 on our stakeholders (including our workforce) and how the management have responded to this, including initiatives such as supporting the salaries of employees who were unable to work due to COVID-19 restrictions and the work of our businesses in supporting the communities in which we operate, provided an important context for the Committee in its decision making regarding executive remuneration in 2020 (which is summarised in the 2020 Remuneration section below).\n\nThe strong performance, in the face of the unprecedented challenges of 2020, is a tribute to all our people across the wider organisation, and the leadership of our senior management team.'\n\n## Heather Ann McSharry\n\n## Chair of the Remuneration Committee\n\nThe Board's continued con/fidence in CRH's /financial position, business performance and future prospects is re/flected in a proposed increase, subject to shareholder approval at the 2021 AGM, of 25% in the dividend for full year of 2020. This follows an increase of 12% in the dividend in respect of 2019.\n\n## 2020 Remuneration\n\nThe Committee's approach to remuneration, and how the metrics selected by the Committee to incentivise management are aligned with CRH's strategy and support the long-term performance of the Group, are summarised in table 23 on page 78. A summary of 2020 remuneration is set out in table 21 on page 76.\n\n## Fixed Pay\n\nAs reported in the 2019 Directors' Remuneration Report, salary increases were awarded to the executive Directors in January 2020, in line with the average increase awarded to the general workforce. However, following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Board and c.200 of the most senior executives in the Group voluntarily waived 25% of their salaries for a period of three months in recognition of the prevailing uncertainty at the time.",

We also reviewed and approved the 2021 Annual Bonus Plan structure, which is similar to the structure of the 2020 Annual Bonus Plan save that the Committee has determined that, given the uncertainty that remains in relation to the ongoing impact of COVID-19 related restrictions on the economies and construction markets in which CRH operates, the performance ranges for the EPS and operating cash/flow components should be re-calibrated to increase the level of outperformance of target required for maximum payout (see page 77 for more details).\n\n## What did we do?\n\nWe reviewed the performance of the PSP award granted in 2018 against the applicable performance conditions and approved the vesting outcome of 86.8% of maximum (see table 33 on page 90 for more details).\n\nWe also reviewed and approved the metrics and targets for the PSP awards granted in 2020 and to be granted in 2021, including the addition of Martin Marietta and Vulcan Materials in the TSR Peer Group with effect from the 2021 PSP awards to re/flect the extent of CRH's businesses in the US (see tables 36 and 39 on pages 91 and 94 respectively).\n\n## What did we do?\n\nWe considered the impact of the implementation into Irish law of the EU (Shareholders' Rights) Regulations 2020 (SRD II) on our remuneration policies and procedures and incorporated the required additional disclosures in this Report. We also reviewed and considered workforce remuneration across the Group and the alignment with the remuneration for executive Directors (see page 96 for more details).\n\n## What did we do?\n\nWe considered the feedback from shareholders on the Group's remuneration policies and practices (see page 77 for further details on the Group's shareholder engagement activities).\n\nWe also considered and approved this 2020 Directors' Remuneration Report.\n\n- * EBITDA is de/fined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortisation, asset impairment charges, pro/fit on disposals and the Group's share of equity accounted investments' pro/fit after tax.\n- **  Pre-impairment Earnings per Share is a non-GAAP measure as calculated on page 216.

This will be reduced further (by 10%) in 2021 and will be below 25% of his salary by January 2022, reducing to zero in August 2022. As previously announced, the Finance Director will be retiring from the Board at the 2021 AGM and as an executive during the year - see Board Changes on page 77. For the reasons set out in last year's report, his annual pension contribution was capped permanently at \u20ac204,000 (equivalent to 25% of his 2020 base salary).\n\n## Incentives\n\nThe /financial targets for the 2020 annual bonus plan, which represent 80% of the potential bonus opportunity, were set in early 2020. Performance has been measured against those original /financial targets and was assessed on a pre-impairment basis. The non-cash impairment of $0.8 billion, which has been examined in detail by both the Audit and Remuneration Committees, re/flects the longer-term changing business landscape and pre-dominantly relates to our assets in the\n\nUK and our associate investment in China. The Remuneration Committee was satis/fied that it should not, therefore, impact on remuneration outcomes. The Audit Committee Chairman's report to shareholders on page 62 contains further information on this matter. Strategic and personal objectives make up the remaining 20% of the opportunity. The Committee deferred slightly the setting of those objectives (until April 2020) so that priorities for the whole of the management team from the evolving COVID-19 situation could be captured. The Committee has assessed performance against theses /financial targets and strategic/personal priorities and has determined that payouts of 86% of the maximum opportunity for the Chief Executive and 84.3% of maximum opportunity for the Finance Director were warranted. Details of the targets for the 2020 bonus plan are set out in detail on pages 88 to 89. In line with CRH's remuneration policy, 33% of the earned bonus payments will be deferred into shares for a period of three years.\n\nThe vesting of the 2018 PSP award, which covered the three /financial years from 2018 to 2020 inclusive, has been assessed by the Committee against the cash/flow and TSR targets\n\nset in 2018. CRH's strong performance against these measures resulted in the vesting of 86.8% of these awards. The vesting level for each metric is summarised in table 33 on page 90.\n\nThe Committee reviewed the outcomes of the 2020 bonus plan and the 2018 PSP award, in the wider performance context for the Group and other strategic objectives including progress in relation to environmental targets, and concluded that there was no requirement to use its discretion to adjust these outcomes. In reaching that conclusion, the Committee, supported by the work of other Board Committees, took into account a number of factors, including, the strong alignment between pay outcomes and the performance of the Group and our executives and whether any extraneous factors, outside the control of management (and plan participants more generally), had unduly in/fluenced the outcome. The Committee also conducted its annual assessment of the approach to implementing the Remuneration Policy for the relevant /financial year and concluded that there were no derogations or deviations required to the Policy in 2020.\n\n## Executive Directors' Remuneration Summary\n\n## 2020 Remuneration Snapshot (full details of 2020 remuneration are set out in table 24 on page 79)\n\nTable 21\n\n|                 | Fixed (i) (ii)   |                          | Performance Related Variable Remuneration   |\n|-----------------|------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| Director        | Salary           | Annual Bonus  (% of Max) | 2018 PSP Award (iii) (% of Max)             |\n| Albert Manifold | \u20ac1,469,125       | 86.0%                    | 86.8%                                       |\n| Senan Murphy    | \u20ac767,828         | 84.3%                    | 86.8%                                       |\n\n## 2021 Remuneration Snapshot\n\nTable 22\n\n| Director         | Salary              | Max.

However, he will continue as an executive for a period of time to support the transition process for his successor as Finance Director. The process to appoint his successor is well advanced.\n\n## Implementation of Remuneration Policy in 2021\n\n## Fixed Pay\n\nThe Committee has reviewed the executive Directors' base salaries and, taking into account the budgeted salary increases for employees across the Group of an average of c. 3%, concluded that salary increases of 2.75% should also be awarded to the executive Directors in 2021.\n\n## Incentives\n\nThe 2021 bonus plan will continue to be based on the structure, weightings and metrics used in prior years: EPS, operating cash/flow, RONA and personal/strategic objectives. However, given the uncertainty that remains in relation to the ongoing impact of COVID-19 related restrictions on the economies and construction markets in which CRH operates, the Committee has recalibrated the performance ranges for EPS and operating cash/flow, increasing the level of outperformance of target required for maximum payouts to be achieved under these elements. The targets attaching to the 2021 bonus will be disclosed in the 2021 Annual Report and Form 20-F.\n\nThe metrics for PSP awards in 2021 will also be unchanged from 2020, comprising cash/flow, TSR and RONA. The targets are set out in table 39 on page 94. Similar to the 2020 bonus plan, the cash/flow and RONA targets for the PSP awards have been reviewed and set in the context of a backdrop of unprecedented and ongoing uncertainty. In relation to the TSR component, the Committee has decided to expand the peer group used to assess performance by including two US companies - Martin Marietta and Vulcan Materials - to re/flect the extent of CRH's business in the US, and taking into account recent feedback from some shareholders on this aspect of the peer group's composition. The peer group will continue to be weighted by market capitalisation.\n\nIn setting the targets for the 2021 PSP awards, the Committee considered the views of some shareholders in relation to the inclusion of sustainability targets, with a particular emphasis on carbon reduction measures. The Board announced in 2020 an ambition for CRH to be carbon neutral by 2050 in line with the Paris Agreement on climate change and also con/firmed new interim targets for carbon reduction by 2030. Given the importance of this issue to CRH, our stakeholders and wider society, and the long term nature of these targets, we will review the inclusion of an appropriate environmental measure (and targets) as part of our consultation during the formulation of our new remuneration policy for consideration by shareholders at the 2022 AGM.\n\nAs mentioned above, the targets for the 2021 Bonus Plan and the 2021 PSP awards have been set in the context of unprecedented and ongoing uncertainty currently presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. Given this uncertainty and the possibility that the targets may ultimately transpire to be inappropriate in the context of the global economic outturn in 2021, the Committee has discretion to override formulaic outcomes (and, for the 2021 PSP cycle, revise the targets) in the event that certain assumptions underlying the process of setting the targets at the start of 2021 do not transpire and, therefore, using these targets would be inappropriate in assessing the underlying performance of the Group. Any use of the discretionary mechanism would be fully explained to shareholders in the relevant annual report.\n\n## Stakeholder Engagement\n\nThe Committee places continued importance on engaging with stakeholders on executive remuneration. The Committee welcomed the strong level of shareholder support received at the 2020 AGM on the 2019 Annual Report on Remuneration (voting results are summarised in table 50 on page 99). During 2020, we also received feedback and correspondence from investors holding more than one third of the shares in issue on a range of topics, including the Group's executive remuneration arrangements. I appreciate the time taken by shareholders to engage on this important subject and we remain available to discuss these matters during the course of the coming year. Your feedback is important to us and will continue to be taken into consideration by the Committee in its decision-making.\n\nAs noted in the SESR Committee report on page 72, during 2021 an organisational health survey will be conducted which will cover over half of the workforce. This survey will include a section seeking workforce views on remuneration matters. The Committee will consider the outputs from this survey during the coming year.\n\n## Savings-related Share Option Scheme\n\nIn 2020, the Group's 2010 Savings-related Share Option Scheme expired. Following a review, and feedback that it was valued by employees as an important means of acquiring shares in CRH through a savings plan, the Committee recommended to the Board that shareholder approval be sought for a new Scheme. A resolution for the adoption of the new Scheme will be included on the agenda of the 2021 AGM.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAs mentioned above, CRH's /financial and business performance was robust in 2020 in spite of the unprecedented challenges that were faced during the year, and which persist into 2021. Taking this performance into account, as well as the experience of our stakeholders and the value delivered for shareholders, the Committee believes that the remuneration paid to the executive Directors in respect of 2020 is appropriate. We look forward to receiving your support for the resolution considering the Annual Report on Remuneration at the 2021 AGM.\n\n## Heather Ann McSharry\n\nChair of the Remuneration Committee 3 March 2021\n\n77",

Further details in relation to workforce engagement on remuneration matters are set out on page 96.\n\nThe Committee also has oversight of remuneration policy across the Group and endeavours to keep the principles and structure of remuneration consistent in so far as is possible given CRH's international footprint.\n\nGenerally speaking, total remuneration is more variable (and, in particular, weighted towards long-term performance) for roles with greater levels of responsibility and scope.\n\nIn setting the remuneration policy and practices for executive Directors, the Committee also takes into consideration the six pillars outlined in the 2018 Code; clarity, simplicity, risk, predictability, proportionality and alignment to culture, and is satis/fied that the Policy addresses each of these areas.\n\n## Alignment of Executive Remuneration with Strategy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTable 23\n\n| Performance Measure (i)        | Annual Bonus   | PSP   | Reason for Selection                                                                                                                                                                    |\n|--------------------------------|----------------|-------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| EPS                            |                |       | EPS is a key measure of the underlying pro/fitability                                                                                                                                   |\n| Cash Flow                      |                |       | Operating cash/flow is a key measure of CRH's ability to generate cash to fund organic and acquisitive  growth and provide returns to our shareholders via dividends and share buybacks |\n| RONA                           |                |       | RONA is a key measure of CRH's ability to create value through excellence in operational performance                                                                                    |\n| TSR                            |                |       | TSR is a key measure of CRH's returns to shareholders through the cycle                                                                                                                 |\n| Personal/Strategic  Objectives |                |       | Personal/strategic objectives enable a focus on speci/fic factors aligned with CRH's short   and medium-term strategic objectives that promote long-term performance                    |\n\n- (i) Please see the footnotes to tables 31 and 33 on pages 89 and 90 respectively for further information on the operation of the /financial metrics for the purposes of the Group's incentive schemes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

As the Company is not seeking shareholder approval for any revision of the Policy in 2021, the full text of the Policy has not been reproduced in this report. The following paragraphs and tables 25 to 30 on pages 81 to 86 provide a summary of key elements of the Policy. The Policy is consistent with that shown last year, save the changes to the performance scenario charts.\n\nThe Group's remuneration structures are designed to drive performance and link reward to the responsibilities and individual contribution of executives, while at the same time re/flecting the risk policies of the Group. It is our policy to grant participation in the Group's performance-related plans to key management to encourage alignment with shareholders' interests and to create a community of common interest among different regions and nationalities.\n\nIn setting remuneration levels, the Remuneration Committee takes into consideration the remuneration practices of other international companies of similar size and scope and trends in executive remuneration generally, in each of the regions in which the Company operates.\n\n## CRH's Approach to Remuneration\n\nThe purpose of the Policy is to:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAttract and retain executives of the highest calibre\n\nMotivate and reward executives to perform in the long-term interests of the shareholders\n\nProvide an appropriate blend of fixed and variable remuneration and short and long-term incentives\n\nFoster entrepreneurship in regional companies by rewarding the creation of shareholder value through organic and acquisitive growth\n\nReflect the spread of the Group's operations so that remuneration packages in each geographical area are appropriate and competitive for that area\n\nRe/flect the risk policies and appetite of the Group\n\n## Regulatory Backdrop\n\nCRH is not subject to UK executive remuneration requirements as set out in the Large and Medium-Sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013. Nonetheless, in order to ensure transparency to all of our stakeholders, we have sought to comply with these requirements on a voluntary basis, to the extent possible under Irish law.\n\nIn March 2020, the Shareholder Rights Directive 2017/828 was transposed into Irish law by the EU (Shareholders' Rights) Regulations 2020 ('SRD II'). The provisions of SRD II amend and supplement the Companies Act 2014 and apply to the Company. Under SRD II, public limited companies must submit a remuneration policy to an advisory shareholder vote at least every four years or earlier if there is a proposed material change to the approved policy.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Currently 80% of the bonus is based on /financial performance measures\n- \u00b7  The Committee may vary the weightings of measures but no less than 50% shall be based on /financial performance measures\n- \u00b7  A portion of the bonus metrics for any Director may be linked to his/ her speci/fic area of responsibility\n- \u00b7  Up to 50% of the maximum bonus will be paid for achieving target levels of performance\n\n## Performance-related pay Annual Bonus\n\n## Performance-related pay Performance Share Plan\n\n- \u00b7  The Annual Performance-related Incentive Plan (the 'Plan') is designed to reward the creation of shareholder value through operational excellence and organic and acquisitive growth. The Plan incentivises executive Directors to deliver Group and individual goals that support long-term value creation\n- \u00b7  A deferred element of the Plan links the value of executive Directors' reward with the long-term performance of the CRH share price and aligns the interests of executive Directors with shareholders' interest\n- \u00b7  'Malus' and clawback provisions enable the Company to mitigate risk\n- \u00b7  The Plan rewards executive Directors for meeting Company performance goals over a /financial year of the Company. Targets are set annually by the Committee\n- \u00b7  The annual bonus is paid in a mix of cash and shares (structured as a deferred share award)\n- \u00b7  For 2021:\n- -66.7% of the bonus will be paid in cash; and\n- -33.3% will be paid in shares\n- \u00b7  In future years, the Committee may determine that a different balance between cash and shares is appropriate and adjust the relevant payments accordingly\n- \u00b7  When assessing performance and determining bonus payouts the Committee also considers the underlying /financial performance of the business to ensure it is consistent with the overall award level\n- \u00b7  The deferred element of the bonus will be structured as a conditional share award or nil-cost option and will normally vest after three years from grant (or a different period determined by the Committee). Deferred share awards may be settled in cash\n- \u00b7  Dividend equivalents may be paid on deferred share awards in respect of dividends paid during the vesting period. These payments may be made in cash or shares and may assume the reinvestment of dividends on a cumulative basis\n- \u00b7  For deferred awards, 'malus' provisions apply. Cash bonus payments are subject to clawback of the net amount paid for a period of three years from payment\n- \u00b7  The purpose of the 2014 Plan is to align the interest of key management across different regions and nationalities with those of shareholders through an interest in CRH shares and by incentivising the achievement of long-term performance goals\n- \u00b7  'Malus' and clawback provisions enable the Company to mitigate risk\n- \u00b7  Awards (in the form of conditional share awards or nil-cost options) normally vest based on performance over a period of not less than three years. Awards may also be settled in cash\n- \u00b7  Awards are normally subject to an additional holding period ending on the /fifth anniversary of the grant date (or another date determined by the Committee)\n- \u00b7  Dividend equivalents may be paid on PSP awards that vest in respect of dividends paid during the vesting period until the end of the holding period. These payments may be made in cash or shares and may assume reinvestment on a cumulative basis\n- \u00b7  'Malus' and clawback provisions (as set out in the rules of the 2014 Plan) will apply to awards\n- \u00b7  Maximum annual opportunity of up to 365% of base salary\n- \u00b7  For 2021, the intended award levels are:\n- -365% of base salary for the Chief Executive; and\n- -225% of base salary for the Finance Director\n- \u00b7  Awards to be granted in 2021 will vest based on cumulative cash /flow (50%), a relative TSR test compared to a tailored group of key peers (25%) and RONA (25%)\n- \u00b7  For threshold levels of performance, 25% of the award vests\n- \u00b7  Where applicable, when determining vesting under the PSP the Committee reviews whether the TSR performance has been impacted by unusual events and whether it therefore, re/flects the underlying performance of the business\n- \u00b7  The Committee may adjust the weightings of the measures at the start of each cycle, with no measure's weighting falling below 25%\n- \u00b7  The Committee may amend the performance conditions if an event occurs that causes it to consider that an amended performance condition would be more appropriate and would not be materially less dif/ficult to satisfy\n\n## Table 25 continued\n\n83",

Remuneration arrangements throughout the organisation, therefore, differ depending on the speci/fic role being undertaken, the level of seniority and responsibilities, the location of the role and local market practice. However, remuneration arrangements are designed based on a common set of principles: that reward should be set at a level which is appropriate to retain and motivate individuals of the necessary calibre to ful/fil the roles without paying more than is considered necessary. The reward framework is designed to incentivise employees to deliver the requirements of their roles and add value for shareholders.\n\nThe Group operates share participation plans and savings-related share option schemes for eligible employees, including executive Directors, in all regions where the regulations permit the operation of such plans.\n\n## Shareholding Guideline for Executive Directors\n\nExecutive Directors are required to build up (and maintain) a minimum holding in CRH shares. The shareholding guidelines for the Chief Executive and Finance Director are 3.5x basic salary and 2x basic salary respectively, with the guidelines to be achieved by 31 December 2023 and 31 December 2022, respectively. As outlined elsewhere in this Annual Report, the Finance Director will retire from the Board at the 2021 AGM and as executive during 2021.\n\nFor the purposes of determining the number of shares held by the executive Directors, the relevant calculation will include shares bene/ficially owned by the executive Directors, annual bonus awards which are deferred into shares for three years and PSP awards that have met the performance criteria but are subject to a two-year holding period prior to release. The deferred share awards and PSP awards subject to a two-year hold period are not subject to any further performance criteria other than continued employment with the Group.\n\n## Executive Director Shareholdings as a % of 2021 Base Salary (i)\n\nIn the event that the shareholding guidelines are not met by the applicable deadlines, the Remuneration Committee will consider what action to take at that time.\n\n## Post-employment Holding Requirements\n\nThe Chief Executive is required to hold shares equivalent to two times salary for a period of two years post-employment. Until the two times limit is achieved, any Deferred Share or PSP awards which vest will be transferred on a net of tax basis to a third party to be held in trust for the Chief Executive's bene/fit. The shares will be held in Trust on a rolling basis, until his employment ceases and a subsequent two year period has elapsed. A similar structure applies to the Finance Director, except that the requirement in his case is one times salary.\n\nTable 29\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- (i) For the purposes of this table, the interests have been valued using the three-month average share price to 31 December 2020 (\u20ac33.01).\n\n85",

        "page_content": "88\n\n## Annual Report on Remuneration\n\n## The Remuneration Committee\n\nThe Remuneration Committee consists of four non-executive Directors considered by the Board to be independent. They bring the range of experience of large organisations and public companies, including experience in the area of senior executive remuneration, to enable the Committee to ful/fil its role. Their biographical details are set out on pages 54 to 57. A schedule of attendance at Committee meetings is set out in table 9 on page 67.\n\nThe main focus of the Committee is to:\n\n- \u00b7 determine and agree with the Board the Group's policy on executive remuneration;\n- \u00b7 seek shareholder approval for the Directors' Remuneration Policy at least every three years;\n- \u00b7 ensure that CRH's remuneration structures are fair and responsible; and\n- \u00b7 consider and approve salaries and other terms of the remuneration packages for the executive Directors and the fee for the Chairman.\n\nIn addition, the Committee:\n\n- \u00b7 recommends and monitors the level and structure of remuneration for senior management; and\n- \u00b7 oversees the preparation of this Directors' Remuneration Report.\n\nIn considering remuneration levels for executive Directors particularly, the Committee takes into account remuneration trends across the CRH Group, which has a diverse range of operations in 30 countries, in geographic regions which are often at different stages in the economic cycle.\n\n## Remuneration Received by Executive Directors in Respect of 2020\n\nDetails of individual remuneration for executive Directors for the year ended 31 December 2020, including explanatory notes, are given in table 24 on page 79. Details of Directors' remuneration charged against pro/fit in the year are given in table 49 on page 99.\n\nAs announced in February 2020, the Group changed its reporting currency from euro to US Dollar with effect from 1 January 2020. Notwithstanding this, as the executive Directors are paid in euro, the Committee considers it appropriate that the remuneration /figures disclosed in this Report continue to be presented in euro.\n\n## 2020 Annual Bonus Plan\n\nCRH's Annual Bonus Plan for 2020 was based on a combination of /financial targets and personal/ strategic goals. The metrics for target payout, which is up to a maximum of 50% of the total annual bonus opportunity, are based on achieving the budget set by the Board in respect of each metric. The threshold level for bonus payouts in 2020 was for the achievement of 92% of budget, whereas maximum payout is achieved for stretch performance of between 105% of budget for EPS and Cash Flow and 108% of budget for RONA. The relative weighting of the components of the 2020 plan, together with details of the applicable targets and performance for each measure is given in table 31 on page 89.\n\nWhen setting the targets for the annual bonus plan, the Committee makes assumptions regarding exchange rates and development activity. The Committee also compares the proposed targets to the outturn for the previous year to ensure that the targets are suf/ficiently stretching. In this regard, it is important to note that the metrics in the plan are in/fluenced by the economic cycle and other factors, such as\n\nongoing portfolio management, government infrastructure spending programmes and items which may not continue into the next /financial year.\n\nWhen reviewing performance against the bonus plan, the Committee typically makes a number of routine adjustments to the /financial targets, for example, to re/flect, signi/ficant development activity and actual share buyback activity during the year. The /financial targets for the 2020 annual bonus plan, which represent 80% of the potential bonus opportunity, were set in early 2020. Performance was measured against those original /financial targets and was assessed on a pre-impairment basis. The non-cash impairment of $0.8 billion, which has been examined in detail by both the Audit and Remuneration Committees, re/flects the longer-term changing business landscape and pre-dominantly relates to our assets in the UK and our associate investment in China. The Remuneration Committee was satis/fied that it should not, therefore, impact on remuneration outcomes.\n\nDetails of each executive Director's personal and strategic objectives and their achievement against these objectives are set out in table 32 on page 89. Overall, the combination of the performance of the Group in 2020 and the achievement against personal/strategic objectives translated to annual bonus payouts of 86% and 84.3% of the maximum opportunity for Albert Manifold and Senan Murphy respectively, with total bonus payments of 193.5% of base salary and 126.5% of base salary respectively. In accordance with the Policy, 33% of the bonus amounts for Albert Manifold and Senan Murphy will be deferred into shares for a period of three years. Deferred Share awards are not subject to any additional performance conditions during the deferral period and are adjusted for dividend equivalents based on dividends paid by CRH. Annual bonus awards are subject to recovery provisions for three years from the date of payment (cash awards) or grant (deferred awards).",

For cash /flow the /figure differs from the net cash in/flow from operating activities reported in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, primarily because it is calculated after deducting cash out/flows on the purchase of property, plant and equipment (PP&E), net proceeds from the disposal of PP&E, and before deducting interest and tax payments. Similarly, RONA as reported internally differs from the RONA reported in the Non-GAAP Performance Measures in this report as it re/flects seasonality and the timing impact of development activity.\n\n## 2020 Plan - Personal/Strategic Achievement\n\nThe priority areas and achievements in 2020 were as follows:\n\n| Priority                         | Achievements                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| COVID-19 Leadership and Response | In close consultation with the Board, both the Chief Executive and the Finance Director worked very decisively and  effectively, in conjunction with the senior management team, to formulate and implement appropriate plans to  evaluate and respond to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on CRH' s businesses, its employees and  stakeholders. Their leadership in this area was a key element underpinning the Group's robust commercial,  operational and /financial performance in 2020 as well as supporting our employees during 2020.                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| Safety                           | The Chief Executive led the launch and roll-out of enhanced safety protocols, training and well-being programmes  to ensure a safe working environment for all CRH employees, contractors and customers in the context of the  COVID-19 pandemic and continued to be a sponsor of key safety initiatives such as our Frontline Leadership  program covering c. 10,000 employees focussed on achieving our ongoing target of zero harm and reinforcing the  Group's strong safety culture across all of our operations. The Finance Director strongly supported these initiatives  across the Group, with a particular focus on implementing the initiatives for, and sponsoring the roll out to, the  /finance function across the Group. |\n| Strategy                         | In spite of a challenging dynamic environment the executive directors, together with the senior management team,  continued to successfully deliver against a range of comprehensive strategic objectives, including, those related to  capital allocation, the environment, inclusion & diversity, portfolio management and talent management; proactively  engaging with the Board in monitoring progress against these objectives and assessing the appropriateness of  CRH's strategy against an evolving external environment and CRH's long term purpose and goals.                                                                                                                                                                 |\n\nThese achievements resulted in 18% and 16.3% of the maximum opportunity of 20% being award to Albert Manifold and Senan Murphy respectively.\n\n89",

The awards were based on TSR (50% of the award) - 25% against a tailored group of key peers (see table 35 below) and 25% against the FTSE All-World Construction & Materials Index - and Cumulative Cash Flow (50% of the award), and performance was measured over the three-year period 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2020. In respect of the TSR element, CRH's TSR over the period of 17.8% is ranked in the upper quartile as compared with the tailored peer group, and\n\nc.1.5% above the TSR of the FTSE All-World Construction & Materials Index. Accordingly, 36.8% out of 50% will vest for the TSR element. In respect of the cumulative cash /flow element, actual outturn over the period was $6.7 billion, which exceeded the stretch target of $5.2 billion, resulting in 100% vesting for the cash /flow element.\n\nWhen reviewing performance against the metrics, the Committee considered a number of adjustments, for example, to re/flect signi/ficant acquisitions and divestments and actual share buyback activity during the period. In respect of the 2018 awards, the targets were also adjusted to re/flect the Group's change in reporting\n\n## Long-term Incentives - Performance Share Plan Awards\n\n## 2018 Award Metrics\n\ncurrency from euro to US Dollar with effect from 1 January 2020 and the impact of the implementation of IFRS 16 Leases .\n\nThe Committee considers that the vesting outcome is re/flective of the Company's underlying performance over the performance period. In particular, the Committee considered RONA performance since 2020 as an underpin to the TSR component and determined that the TSR vesting outcome was appropriate and did not need to be adjusted. In accordance with the Policy, the 2018 awards to executive Directors will vest in 2023 on completion of an additional two-year holding period. Vested awards will be adjusted for dividend equivalents based on\n\nTable 33\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- (i) For the purposes of the PSP, operating cash /flow is de/fined as reported internally. The /figure differs from the net cash in/flow from operating activities reported in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, primarily because it is calculated after deducting cash out/flows on the purchase of property, plant and equipment (PP&E), net proceeds from the disposal of PP&E, and before deducting interest and tax payments. The cash /flow targets were prepared in euro and translated to US Dollar following the Group's change in reporting currency from euro to US Dollar with effect from 1 January 2020.\n- (ii) The methodology for calculating TSR assumes all dividends are reinvested on the ex-dividend date at the closing share price on that day; the open and close price is based on the three-month average closing price on the last day before the start of the performance period and the /final day of the performance period respectively.\n- (iii)     For the purposes of the 2018 Award, TSR performance was in the upper quartile against the tailored peer group (see table 35 below) and c. 1.5% above the FTSE All-World Construction & Materials Index. TSR performance was subject to a RONA underpin (see above).

Albert Manifold has opted for an arrangement whereby his pension is capped in line with the provisions of the Finance Act 2006 and receives a supplementary taxable non-pensionable cash supplement in lieu of pension bene/fits foregone. There was, therefore, no additional accrual in 2020. The cash pension supplement for 2020 is detailed in table 24 on page 79. This supplement is similar in value to the reduction in the Company's liability represented by the pension bene/fits foregone.

The Committee has reviewed the executive Directors' base salaries and, taking into account the budgeted salary increases for employees across the Group of an average of c. 3%, concluded that salary increases of 2.75% should also be awarded to the executive Directors in 2021.\n\nExecutive Directors will receive bene/fits in line with the 2019 Policy in 2021. The level of bene/fits provided will depend on the cost of providing individual items and the individual circumstances.\n\n## Retirement Bene/fit Expense\n\nAs outlined in the Chair's overview on page 76, the monetary value of the pension contribution/allowance for Albert Manifold will be reduced by a further 10% in 2021. For the reasons set out in last year's Directors' Remuneration Report, the annual pension contribution / allowance for Senan Murphy (who will be retiring in 2021) has been set at \u20ac204,000 (equivalent to 25% of his 2020 base salary).\n\n## 2021 Annual Bonus Plan\n\nThe Remuneration Committee has determined that the 2021 Annual Bonus Plan will be operated broadly in line with the 2020 Annual Bonus Plan.\n\n80% of the bonus will be based on /financial targets and the remaining 20% on individual objectives aligned to key strategic areas for each executive Director.\n\nHowever, as outlined in the Chair's overview on page 77, given the uncertainty that remains in relation to the ongoing impact of COVID-19 related restrictions on the economies and construction markets in which CRH operates, the Committee has recalibrated the performance ranges for the EPS and operating cash/flow metrics, increasing the level of out performance of target required for maximum payouts to be achieved under these elements. The targets attaching to the 2021 bonus will be disclosed in the 2021 Annual Report and Form 20-F.\n\n## 2021 Performance Share Plan Awards\n\nFor the 2021 PSP awards, awards will be assessed over the three-year period to 31 December 2023. The metrics, weightings and opportunity for the 2021 PSP awards are summarised in table 39 below.\n\nSimilar to the 2021 Annual Bonus Plan, the cash/flow and RONA targets for the PSP awards have been reviewed and set in the context of a backdrop of unprecedented and ongoing uncertainty. In relation to the TSR component, the Committee has decided to expand the peer group used to assess performance by including\n\n## Performance Share Plan Metrics - 2021 Awards\n\ntwo US companies-Martin Marietta and Vulcan Materials-to re/flect the extent of CRH's business in the US, and taking into account recent feedback from some shareholders on this aspect of the peer group's composition. The peer group will continue to be weighted by market capitalisation.\n\n## Committee Discretion\n\nAs mentioned above, the targets for the 2021 Bonus Plan and the 2021 PSP awards have been set in the context of unprecedented and ongoing uncertainty currently presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. Given this uncertainty and the possibility that the targets may ultimately transpire to be inappropriate in the context of the global economic outturn in 2021, the Committee has discretion to override formulaic outcomes (and, for the 2021 PSP cycle, revise the targets) in the event that certain assumptions underlying the process of setting the targets at the start of 2021 do not transpire and, therefore, using these targets would be inappropriate in assessing the underlying performance of the Group. Any use of the discretionary mechanism would be fully explained to shareholders in the relevant annual report.\n\n## Fees Paid to Former Directors\n\nThe 2013 Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment\n\nTable 39\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(i) and (ii) see table 33 on page 90 (iii) see table 36 on page 91\n\n## Pension Entitlements - De/fined Bene/fit (Audited)\n\nTable 40\n\n| Executive Director   | Increase in accrued personal pension  during 2020 (i)  \u20ac000   |   Transfer value of increase in dependants  pension (i)  \u20ac000 |   Total accrued  personal pension at year end (ii)  \u20ac000 |\n|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| Albert Manifold      | -                                                             |                                                           139 |                                                      273 |",

No payments have been made to individual former Directors in those circumstances which exceed the de minimis threshold of \u20ac20,000 per annum set by the Remuneration Committee. For the purposes of Section 1110N of the Companies Act 2014, details of the payments made to former Directors are included in table 49 on page 99.\n\n## Executives' External Appointments\n\nThe executive Directors may accept external appointments with the prior approval of the Board provided that such appointments do not prejudice the individual's ability to ful/fil their duties at the Group. Whether any related fees are retained by the individual or remitted to the Group is considered on a case-by-case basis.\n\n## Non-executive Directors\n\nThe remuneration of non-executive Directors is determined by the Board of Directors.

The Committee, therefore, considers that they offer a reasonable comparison for performance. Compound annual TSR since the formation of the Group in 1970 (assuming the reinvestment of dividends) is 15.1%.\n\n## Workforce Engagement\n\nEngagement of our workforce is at the heart of what we do at CRH. The proximity of our senior leaders to daily operations across CRH is a key reason for the Company's continued success and growth. The Company operates an annual talent and performance review process, where colleagues and their managers work together to review performance and set annual goals. The outcome of the review process is closely aligned to remuneration, both in terms of any increase in base salary for the next year, and any variable remuneration component.\n\nIn order to guide our leaders' discussions with employees across the group on remuneration\n\n## TSR Performance (2010-2020)\n\n## Remuneration Paid to Chief Executive 2011 - 2020\n\nTable 44 shows the total remuneration paid to the Chief Executive in the period 2011 to 2020 inclusive and shows bonuses and vested long-term incentive awards as a percentage of the maximum bonus and award that could have been received in respect of each year. Albert Manifold succeeded Myles Lee as Chief Executive in January 2014.\n\n## Chief Executive Pay Ratio compared to UK-based employees\n\nAs required by the reporting regulations with which CRH complies, Table 46 on page 97 summarises the ratio of the Chief Executive's remuneration compared with the UK workforce (which represents only 13% of the Group's c.77,100 employees). In last year's Report, the Committee noted an expectation for year-on-year variations in the reported pay ratio to be driven by performance-based pay outcomes which, in line with our remuneration policy, comprise a signi/ficant proportion of the total remuneration for the Chief Executive. While the majority of employees across CRH also participate in performance-related incentives, these typically comprise a lower proportion of the package (in line with competitive market practices for these roles and levels). Consistent with our philosophy across the Group that incentives should be linked\n\nTable 43\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Remuneration paid to Chief Executive (2011-2020)\n\nTable 44\n\nTable 45 on page 97 shows the percentage change in the executive and non-executive Directors' salary/fees, bene/fits and bonus between 2019 and 2020 compared to the change in total average employment costs in respect of employees in the Group as a whole between 2019 and 2020. On a like-for-like basis, assuming full year tenure, there was a 6% reduction in the salary/fees received by non-executives in 2020. This was the result of the non-executive Directors voluntarily waiving 25% of their salary/fees for a three-month period in 2020 in response to the then uncertainty regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Group.\n\n|                                                | 2011   | 2012   | 2013               | 2014                  | 2015                   | 2016   | 2017   | 2018   | 2019   | 2020   |\n|------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Single /figure Remuneration (\u20acm) (i)           | \u20ac2.9m  | \u20ac2.5m  | \u20ac4.2m              | \u20ac4.3m                 | \u20ac5.4m                  | \u20ac9.9m  | \u20ac8.7m  | \u20ac8.2m  | \u20ac9.3m  | \u20ac11.2m |\n| Annual Bonus (% of max)                        | 39%    | 28%    | 30%                | 100%                  | 100%                   | 98%    | 96%    | 81%    | 86%    | 86%    |\n| Long-term incentive   award vesting (% of max) | 17%    | 0%     | PSP: 49% LTIP: 34% | PSP: 0% Options:  75% | PSP: 78% Options:  37% | 100%   | 79%    | 59%    | 71%    | 87%    |\n\n- (i) Single /figure remuneration comprises the total /fixed pay, annual bonus and the value of long-term incentives vesting in respect of each year.\n\nstructures, there is a reward policy section, which is based on the principles of remuneration applied by the Remuneration Committee and remuneration policy approved by shareholders, in policy documents issued to the managing directors of our operating companies.\n\nThe SESR Committee has taken formal responsibility for workforce engagement.

In 2021, this will include feedback from an organisational health survey being issued to more than half of the workforce.\n\n## Changes in the remuneration of the Directors",

The Committee reviewed the drivers of the pay ratio, and concluded that the resulting pay ratio (and increase compared to 2019) re/flects the Group's continued strong and sustained /financial performance. The annual bonus for the Chief Executive paid out at 86% of maximum in 2020 (2019: 86%) and the 2018 PSP vested at 86.8% of maximum (2017 PSP: 70.1%). One-third of the bonus is deferred in shares and the vested PSP shares are subject to an additional retention period on vesting, further aligning the remuneration of Chief Executive with the interests of shareholders over the longer-term.\n\nNoting that the total remuneration pay ratio will be volatile over time, the Committee has elected to disclose the pay ratio for base salary.

Salary and total remuneration /figures have been rounded to the nearest 100.\n- 2.   Employee remuneration data converted into Euros at the average quarter four EUR:GBP exchange rate (source: Central Bank of Ireland). For 2020 this rate was 0.9:1(2019: 0.86:1).\n- 3.   Total remuneration for the lower quartile, median and upper quartile employees are determined using the 'single /figure' methodology. This methodology was chosen as it provides a like-for-like comparison between the CEO and other employees. For practical reasons (primarily relating to the number of employing entities and employees covered by this analysis), the ranking of employees to identify the three individuals representing P25, P50 and P75 is conducted in November each year. Given the timing, for the purpose of the ranking exercise, total remuneration is de/fined as the sum of base salary, employer pension contributions and other taxable bene/fits for the period 1 January to 31 October, and the incentive paid in the period in respect of the prior year. All elements of remuneration are calculated on a full-time and full-year equivalent basis. In the following January, total remuneration is updated for the three employees representing P25, P50 and P75 using the same single /figure methodology used to report CEO remuneration.\n- 4.   The Committee reviewed the underlying rationale for the year-on-year change in the quartile /figures for the identi/fied UK employees. This was due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the UK Tarmac business, which employs the majority of our UK workforce. This year-on-year change re/flects a variety of factors including restricted working and reduced overtime of some UK employees during 2020, as well as the linkage of bonus outcomes for these employees to the performance of the UK-based businesses in which they work (rather than CRH as a whole). Year-on-year /fluctuations in the exchange rate used to convert employee remuneration data into euro can also drive short term /fluctuations in the reported ratio.\n\n## Changes in the remuneration of the Directors\n\n| Table 45                    | Table 45                    | Table 45                    | Table 45                    |\n|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|\n|                             | Percentage change from 2019 | Percentage change from 2019 | Percentage change from 2019 |\n|                             | Salary / Fees               | Bene/fits                   | Bonus                       |\n| Executive Directors         |                             |                             |                             |\n| A.

We manufacture and supply a diverse range of superior building materials and products for use in the construction and maintenance of infrastructure, housing and commercial projects. Our materials and products are used extensively, in construction projects of all sizes, all across the world. The Group has c.1,000 subsidiary, joint venture and associate undertakings; the principal ones as at 31 December 2020 are listed on pages 250 to 254.\n\nThe Group's strategy, business model and development activity are summarised on pages 6 to 51 and are deemed to be incorporated in this part of the Directors' Report. As set out in the Consolidated Income Statement on page 132, the Group reported a pro/fit before tax for the year of $1.7 billion from continuing operations. Comprehensive reviews of the /financial and operating performance of the Group during 2020 are set out in the Business Performance section on pages 30 to 51; key /financial performance indicators are set out on pages 18 to 19.\n\nThe treasury policy and objectives of the Group are set out in detail in note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nDuring the year ended 31 December 2020, 5,951,146 million ordinary shares were repurchased on the Euronext Dublin for a total\n\n## 2021 Outlook\n\nThe 2021 outlook set out in the Chief Executive's Review on page 11 is deemed to be incorporated in this part of the Directors' Report.\n\n## Principal Risks and Uncertainties\n\nPursuant to Section 327(1)(b) of the Companies Act 2014, Regulation 5(4)(c)(ii) of the Transparency (Directive 2004/109/EC) Regulations 2007 (the 'Transparency Regulations') and the Central Bank (Investment Market Conduct) Rules 2019, the principal risks and uncertainties that could affect the Group's business are set out on pages 106 to 111 and are deemed to be incorporated in this part of the Directors' Report. These risks and uncertainties re/flect the international scope of the Group's operations and its decentralised structure. If any of these risks occur, the Group's business, /financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and/or prospects could be materially adversely affected.\n\n## Non-Financial Reporting\n\nThe European Union (Disclosure of Non-Financial and Diversity Information by certain large undertakings and groups) Regulations 2017 (the 'Non-Financial Regulations') requires CRH to provide certain non-/financial information to investors and other stakeholders necessary to provide them with an understanding of the Company's development, performance, position and impact of its activity.

Further details in relation to the buyback programme and the Company's pro/fits available for distribution are set on pages 103 and 209 respectively.\n\n## Dividend\n\nCRH's capital allocation policy re/flects the Group's strategy of generating industry leading returns through value-accretive allocation of capital while delivering long-term dividend growth for shareholders. The Board continues to believe that a progressive dividend policy is appropriate for the Group and further to the 12% dividend increase in 2019, an interim dividend of 22.0c (2019: 22.0c) per share was paid in September 2020. The Board is recommending a /final dividend of 93.0c per share. This would give a total dividend of 115.0c for the year (2019: 92.0c), an increase of 25% over last year. The earnings per share for the year were 142.9c, representing a cover of 1.2x the proposed dividend for the year while pre-impairment earnings per share for the year were 243.3c, representing a cover of 2.1x the proposed dividend for 2020. It is proposed to pay the /final dividend on 5 May 2021 to shareholders registered at the close of business on 19 March 2021. In connection with the share buyback programme, CRH announced the suspension of the scrip dividend scheme on 2 May 2018. Therefore, the /final dividend will be paid wholly in cash. Re/flecting the resilience of our business model and continued strong cash generation the Board believes that a through-the-cycle dividend cover of 2.0 to 2.5 times is appropriate for the Group going forward.",

The /financial position of the Group, its cash /flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the Business Performance Review on pages 30 to 51. In addition, notes 23 to 27 to the Consolidated Financial Statements include the Group's objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital; its /financial risk management objectives; details of its /financial instruments and hedging activities; and its exposures to credit, currency and liquidity risks. The Group has considerable /financial resources and a large number of customers and suppliers across different geographic areas and industries. In addition, the local nature of building materials means that the Group's products are not usually shipped cross-border. The increase in cash and liquidity available to the Group including our ongoing ability to access the debt markets, the quantum of our liquidity facilities, the absence of /financial covenants associated with our debt obligations and the continuing maintenance of strong investment grade credit ratings demonstrate the signi/ficant /financial strength and resilience of the Group. No concerns or material uncertainties have been identi/fied as part of our assessment, which also considered the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHaving assessed the relevant business risks, the Directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage these risks successfully and they have a reasonable expectation that CRH plc, and the Group as a whole, has adequate /financial and other resources to continue in operational existence for the period of assessment with no material uncertainties. For this reason, the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Viability Statement\n\nThe viability statement set out on page 29 is deemed to be incorporated in this section of the Directors' Report.\n\n## Changes to the Board of Directors\n\n- \u00b7 Mr. P.J Kennedy and Mr. H.Th. Rottinghuis retired from the Board with effect from 23 April 2020;\n- \u00b7 Mr. R. Fearon and Mr. L. McKay were appointed to the Board with effect from 3 December 2020; and\n- \u00b7 Ms. H.A. McSharry, Mr. S. Murphy and Ms. L.J. Riches will retire from the Board at the conclusion of the AGM to be held on 29 April 2021\n\nUnder the Company's Articles of Association, co-opted Directors are required to submit themselves to shareholders for election at the AGM following their appointment and all Directors are required to submit themselves for re-election at intervals of not more than three years. However, in accordance with the provisions contained in the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Board has decided that all Directors eligible for re-election should retire at each AGM and offer themselves for re-election.\n\n## Auditor\n\nAs required under Section 381(1)(b) of the Companies Act 2014, the AGM agenda includes a resolution authorising the Directors to /fix the remuneration of the auditor.\n\nSection 383 of the Companies Act 2014 provides for the automatic re-appointment of the auditor of an Irish company at a company's AGM, unless the auditor has given notice in writing of his unwillingness to be re-appointed or a resolution has been passed at that meeting appointing someone else or providing expressly that the incumbent auditor shall not be re-appointed. The auditor, Deloitte Ireland LLP, is willing to continue in of/fice.\n\nNotwithstanding the provisions of Irish company law, the Board has decided to provide shareholders with an opportunity to have a say on the continuance in of/fice of Deloitte Ireland LLP and a non-binding resolution has been included on the agenda for the 2021 AGM for this purpose.\n\n## Authority to Allot Shares\n\nThe Directors require the authority of the shareholders to allot any unissued Ordinary Share capital of the Company. Accordingly, an ordinary resolution will be proposed at the 2021 AGM to renew the annual authority for that purpose. The authority will be for an amount which represents\n\n## Risk Management and Internal Control 1\n\nThe Directors con/firm that, in addition to the monitoring carried out by the Audit Committee under its Terms of Reference, they have reviewed the effectiveness of the Group's risk management and internal control systems up to and including the date of approval of the /financial statements. This review had regard to all material controls, including /financial, operational and compliance controls that could affect the Group's business.\n\n## Directors' Compliance Statement\n\nIt is the policy of the Company to comply with its relevant obligations (as de/fined in the Companies Act 2014). The Directors have drawn up a compliance policy statement (as de/fined in section 225(3)(a) of the Companies Act 2014) and arrangements and structures are in place that are, in the Directors' opinion, designed to secure material compliance with the Company's relevant obligations. The Directors con/firm that these arrangements and structures were reviewed during the /financial year. As required by Section 225(2) of the Companies Act 2014, the Directors acknowledge that they are responsible for the Company's compliance with the relevant obligations. In discharging their responsibilities under Section 225, the Directors relied on the advice both of persons employed by the Company and of persons retained by the Company under contract, who they believe have the requisite knowledge and experience to advise the Company on compliance with its relevant obligations.\n\n## Directors' Remuneration Report\n\nIn accordance with Section 1110N(6), the 2020 Directors' Remuneration Report (excluding the Remuneration Policy Report) on pages 74 to 79 with be subject to a non-binding advisory vote at the 2021 AGM.",

Any allotment exceeding 33% of the issued Ordinary Share capital will only be made pursuant to a pre-emptive issue and no issue of shares will be made which could effectively alter control of the Company without prior approval of the Company in General Meeting.\n\nThe Directors have no present intention of making any issue of shares, other than in connection with the Group's share incentive plans and, if applicable, scrip dividend scheme.\n\nIf approved, this authority will expire on the earlier of the date of the AGM in 2022 or 28 July 2022.\n\n## Disapplication of Pre-emption Rights\n\nTwo special resolutions will be proposed at the 2021 AGM to renew the annual authorities of the Directors to disapply statutory pre-emption rights in relation to allotments of Ordinary Shares for cash in certain circumstances.\n\nThe /first resolution will, if approved, authorise the Directors to allot Ordinary Shares on a non-pre-emptive basis and for cash (otherwise than in connection with a rights issue or similar pre-emptive issue) up to a maximum nominal value of \u20ac12,722,000. This amount represents approximately 5% of the issued Ordinary Share capital as at 3 March 2021, being the latest practicable date prior to publication of this document. This resolution will also allow the Directors to disapply pre-emption rights in order to accommodate any regulatory restrictions in certain jurisdictions where the Company might otherwise wish to undertake a pre-emptive issue.\n\nThe authority under the second disapplication resolution will, if approved, afford the Directors with an additional power to allot Ordinary Shares on a non-pre-emptive basis and for cash up to a further 5% of the issued share capital as at 3 March 2021. The power conferred by this resolution can be used only in connection with an acquisition or a speci/fied capital investment which is announced contemporaneously with the issue, or which has taken place in the preceding six-month period and is disclosed in the announcement of the issue.\n\nThe 5% limits in the disapplication resolutions include any Treasury Shares reissued by the Company during the same period.\n\nThe Directors con/firm that in respect of these resolutions, they intend to follow the Statement of Principles updated by the Pre-Emption Group in that allotments of shares for cash and the reissue of Treasury Shares on a non-pre-emptive basis (other than for an open offer or rights issue\n\nto Ordinary Shareholders, the operation of CRH's employee share schemes or in connection with an acquisition or speci/fied capital investment) will not exceed 7.5% of the issued Ordinary Share capital within a rolling three-year period without prior consultation with shareholders.\n\n## Transactions in Own Shares\n\nUnder the share buyback programme, a total of 5,951,146 Ordinary/Income Shares, equivalent to 0.75% of the Company's issued share capital were repurchased during 2020, at an average price of $36.96 per share. 4,500,000 Ordinary/ Income Shares, equivalent to 0.57% of the Company's issued share capital were cancelled on 18 December 2020 as part of the Group's management of its Treasury Share requirements. As at 3 March 2021, 10,073,153 shares were held as Treasury Shares, equivalent to 1.28% of the Ordinary Shares in issue (excluding Treasury Shares). The Treasury Share balance at 31 December 2020 was 10,087,161, equivalent to 1.28% of the Ordinary Shares in issue (2019: 10,011,353 (1.27%).\n\nDuring 2020, 1,375,338 (2019: 1,147,149) Treasury Shares were reissued under the Group's employees' share schemes.\n\nA special resolution will be proposed at the 2021 AGM to renew the authority of the Company, or any of its subsidiaries, to purchase up to 10% of the Company's Ordinary Shares in issue at the date of the AGM.\n\nIf approved, the minimum price which may be paid for shares purchased by the Company shall not be less than the nominal value of the shares and the maximum price will be 105% of the higher of the last independent trade in the Company's shares (or current independent bid, if higher) and the average market price of such shares over the preceding /five days. A special resolution will also be proposed for the purpose of renewing the authority to set the maximum and minimum prices at which Treasury Shares (effectively shares purchased and not cancelled) may be reissued off-market by the Company. If granted, both of these authorities will expire on the earlier of the date of the AGM in 2022 or 28 July 2022. As at 3 March 2021, options to subscribe for a total of 1,356,752 Ordinary Shares are outstanding, representing 0.17% of the issued Ordinary Share capital (excluding Treasury Shares). If the authority to purchase Ordinary Shares was used in full, the options would represent 0.19% of the remaining shares in issue.\n\nAs outlined on page 33, during 2020 the Group returned a further $220 million of cash to shareholders under its share buyback programme but, due to high levels of market volatility, the Board paused the programme in March 2020. However, as outlined on page 5, the Board has announced its intention to recommence the programme and complete a further $0.3 billion tranche during the second quarter of 2021.\n\nWhile no decision has been made to extend the programme beyond this, the Board believes that the Company should retain the ability to buyback its own shares so that it can be used in the best interests of shareholders generally.\n\n## Authority to Offer Scrip Dividends\n\nThe scrip dividend scheme was suspended during 2018 with the commencement of the buyback programme. No decision has yet been taken on whether the scrip dividend scheme will be re-introduced. However, to provide /flexibility should a decision be made to re-introduce the scheme, an ordinary resolution is being proposed to renew the Directors' authority to make scrip dividend offers. Unless renewed at the AGM in 2022, this authority shall expire at the close of business on 28 July 2022.\n\n## New Savings-related Share Option Scheme\n\nAt the 2010 Annual General Meeting shareholders adopted Savings-relation Share Option Schemes (the '2010 Schemes'), which were subsequently approved by the Irish Revenue Commissioners and HMRC in the United Kingdom. The 2010 Schemes were valid for a period of 10 years and expired during 2020. Such schemes are an important means by which share ownership by the wider workforce in these jurisdictions can be made facilitated. Accordingly, it is proposed to seek approval from shareholders at the 2021 Annual General Meeting to establish new savings-related share option schemes in Ireland and the United Kingdom, in accordance with the legislation currently in place in those jurisdictions and, where applicable, to establish schemes similar in substance in other jurisdictions (the '2021 Schemes'). There are no material differences between the 2010 Schemes and 2021 Schemes.\n\n## Annual General Meeting\n\nThe Notice of Meeting for the 2021 AGM will be published in March on the CRH website (www.crh.com) and is expected to be posted to shareholders on 31 March 2021.",

Of these, 5 were full-scope audits, covering 80% of Group revenue, 23 were subject to specific procedures on certain account balances by component audit teams or the Group audit team, and the remaining 20 were subject to substantive analytical procedures performed centrally by the Group audit team.\n- \u00b7 This is the first year we have been appointed as auditors to the Group. We undertook a number of transitional procedures to prepare for the audit. Before we commenced our audit, we had to establish our independence of the Group, which involved ceasing a number of services.\n- \u00b7 We became independent of the Group and commenced our audit planning on 1 July 2019. From this date, we attended all Audit Committee meetings, initially in an observer capacity. We shadowed the former auditor in certain key audit meetings with management and reviewed their working papers to gain an understanding of the Group's processes, their audit risk assessment, the controls on which they relied for the purposes of issuing their audit opinion, as well as understanding the evidence they obtained on the key complex or significant judgements which they made. We undertook site visits to gain a deeper understanding of the Group's business.\n- \u00b7 We followed an intentionally phased approach to the audit, starting with our work on Information Technology systems, then US operations, European operations and finally Group operations to maximise group team involvement at each stage and so that learnings could be shared from one phase to the next. In June 2020, we held various meetings of audit partners and senior staff who would be responsible for undertaking the audits in the most significant locations in the Group. The main purpose of these meetings was to outline the centralised aspects of our audit approach including the use of our data analytics tools, discuss possible significant audit risks and brief our teams on the Group's key processes, systems and structure.\n- \u00b7 During these meetings, we also heard directly from Group management on the changes impacting the business to inform our audit planning and risk assessment and the Audit Committee Chair briefed the group and component teams on his focus areas.\n- \u00b7 Subsequent strategic meetings were also held as necessary throughout the audit process, with the same participants to take into account any current period updates (including planning for the implications of COVID-19) that impacted our audit approach outlined on pages 61 to 62.\n- \u00b7 Key audit matters considered by the Group's auditor in the prior year were broadly aligned with the items identified above.\n\n2020 Annual Report and Form 20-F",

The Group used the value-in-use approach, which deploys a discounted cash flow model to estimate the recoverable amount. This requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to discount rates, short-term forecasts of future revenues and margins, and long-term growth rates which drive net cash flows. Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the recoverable amount, the amount of any goodwill impairment charge, or both.\n\nWe identified goodwill for certain CGUs as a key audit matter because of the significant judgements made by management to estimate the recoverable value of certain CGUs and the difference between their recoverable amounts and carrying values. We focused on CGUs where impairments were recognised in the current year, CGUs identified as sensitive by management as disclosed in note 16 and CGUs with a significant change in cash flow forecasts in the current year (collectively the 'selected CGUs'). This required a high degree of auditor judgement and increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our valuation specialists, when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management's estimates and assumptions as described above.\n\nThe Audit Committee discussion of this key audit matter is set out on page 62.\n\nOur audit procedures related to the assumptions, as described above, used by management to estimate the recoverable amounts of the selected CGUs included the following, among others:\n\n- \u00b7 We tested the operating effectiveness of controls over management's selection of the discount rates, short-term forecasts of future revenues and margins, and long-term growth rates used to determine the recoverable amount of each selected CGU.\n- \u00b7 We agreed the underlying cash flow forecasts to the Board approved projections and we evaluated management's ability to accurately forecast future revenues and margins by:\n- \u00b7 performing a look-back analysis and comparing actual results to management's historical forecasts;\n- \u00b7 assessing the reasonableness of the impact of COVID-19 and other macroeconomic activity on short-term cash flows;\n- \u00b7 benchmarking management's forecasts against independent third-party economic and industry projections; and\n- \u00b7 comparing internal Group communications to management and the Board against the cash flow forecasts to evaluate for consistency.\n- \u00b7 With the assistance of our valuation specialists, we evaluated the appropriateness of the valuation methodology and discount rates used for each selected CGU by:\n- \u00b7 assessing the reasonableness of the valuation model used by the Group compared to generally accepted valuation practices and accounting standards;\n- \u00b7 testing the source information underlying the determination of the discount rates through use of observable inputs from independent external sources; and\n- \u00b7 developing a range of independent estimates and comparing those to the discount rates selected by management.\n- \u00b7 We compared the long-term growth rates, used by management to grow cash flows from year 5 to year 10 in order to calculate a terminal value at that point, to independent external sources and developed our own range to assess the reasonableness of these rates.\n- \u00b7 We compared the actual results for the year ended 31 December 2020 to management's forecasts at the date of the annual impairment test to determine if any additional indicators of impairment existed.\n- \u00b7 In conjunction with our climate change specialists we assessed how climate related risks had been incorporated into the valuation models and assessed whether assumptions used in the valuation models were consistent with achieving the Group's 2030 carbon reduction targets.\n\nBased on the procedures performed, we have determined management's assumptions used in the assessment of the carrying value of goodwill associated with selected CGUs to be reasonable.\n\nWe concluded that the related disclosures provided in the Consolidated Financial Statements are appropriate.",

The Group uses a value-in-use model to estimate the recoverable amount, which requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to discount rates, short-term forecasts of future revenues and margins, and long-term growth rates which drive net cash flows. Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the recoverable amount, the amount of any impairment charge, or both.\n\nWe identified PP&E CGUs with impairment indicators (the 'identified CGUs') as a key audit matter because of the significant judgements made by management to estimate the recoverable value of the identified CGUs and the difference between their recoverable amounts and carrying values.

The percentage-of-completion method is used to recognise revenue and is calculated based on the proportion of the contract costs incurred at the date relative to the total estimated costs of the contract. The accounting for these contracts involves judgement, particularly as it relates to the process of estimating total costs.\n\nWe identified revenue recognition on long-term contracts as a key audit matter because of the judgements necessary for management to estimate total costs for the performance obligations used to recognise revenue for certain long-term contracts. This required extensive audit effort due to the complexity of long-term contracts and required a high degree of auditor judgement when performing audit procedures to audit management's estimates of total costs and evaluating the results of those procedures.\n\nThe Audit Committee discussion of this key audit matter is set out on page 62.\n\nOur audit procedures related to management's estimates of total costs for the performance obligations used to recognise revenue for certain long-term contracts included the following, among others:\n\n- \u00b7 We tested the operating effectiveness of controls over long-term contract revenue, including management's controls over the estimates of total costs for performance obligations.\n- \u00b7 We selected a sample of long-term contracts and:\n- \u00b7 evaluated whether the contracts were properly included in management's calculation of long-term contract revenue based on the terms and conditions of each contract, including whether continuous transfer of control to the customer occurred as progress was made toward fulfilling the performance obligation;\n- \u00b7 tested the accuracy and completeness of the costs incurred to date for the performance obligation to supporting documentation;\n- \u00b7 evaluated the estimates of total cost for the performance obligation by:\n- \u00b7 comparing costs incurred to date to the costs management estimated, at either the inception of the contract or the start of the reporting period, to be incurred to date;\n- \u00b7 evaluating management's ability to achieve the estimates of total cost by performing corroborating inquiries with the Company's project managers and engineers, and comparing the estimates to management's work plans, engineering specifications, and supplier contracts; and\n- \u00b7 comparing management's estimates for the selected contracts to costs of similar performance obligations, when applicable.\n- \u00b7 tested the mathematical accuracy of management's calculation of revenue for the performance obligation.\n- \u00b7 We evaluated management's ability to estimate total costs accurately by comparing actual costs to management's historical estimates for performance obligations that have been fulfilled.\n\nWe are satisfied that management's estimated percentage-of-completion at the balance sheet date is appropriate and reasonable when assessed against our own independent expectations and our assessment of the accuracy of historical estimates against actual costs.\n\nOur audit procedures relating to these matters were designed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and not to express an opinion on individual accounts or disclosures. Our opinion on the financial statements is not modified with respect to any of the risks described above, and we do not express an opinion on these individual matters.\n\n119",

This is largely due to users and analysts assessing the investment prospects based on the earnings per share metric. In the current year this was not considered an appropriate benchmark because it was uncertain and could not be reliably estimated during the year due to the impact of COVID-19. In addition, there is a greater emphasis on revenue in the current year as an indicator of demand going forward. Group materiality represents: Metric | The Company holds the Group's investments and is not in itself profit- oriented. The strength of the balance sheet is the key measure of financial health that is important to shareholders since the primary concern for the Company is the payment of dividends. Using a benchmark of equity/net assets is therefore the appropriate metric.                                                                                                                |\n|                                     | %                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| PBT                                 | 6.61%                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| EBITDA (as defined*)                | 2.38%                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| Revenue                             | 0.40%                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n\nThe materiality used by the former auditor in the audit of the prior year's Group financial statements was $112 million ( \u20ac 100 million as reported and translated at an average exchange rate of 0.8933 USD/EURO).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- * EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortisation, asset impairment charges, profit on disposals and the Group's share of equity accounted investments' profit after tax.",

Performance materiality was set at 75% of each of Group and Company materiality for the 2020 audit. In determining performance materiality, we considered the following factors:\n\n- a. Our risk assessment, including our assessment of the Group's overall control environment and that we consider it appropriate to rely on controls over a number of business processes;\n- b. The fact that this is the first year of our audit tenure; and\n- c. The effects of the global COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n## Error reporting threshold\n\nWe agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them any audit differences in excess of $5.5 million, as well as differences below that threshold which, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.\n\n## An overview of the scope of our audit\n\n## Identification and scoping of components\n\n- \u00b7 The Group consists of three operating and reporting segments and is highly decentralised in nature, with a presence across 30 countries and over 3,100 operating entities. As a result a significant portion of audit planning time was spent to ensure that the scope of our work is appropriate to address the Group's identified risks of material misstatement.\n- \u00b7 In-scope locations were identified based on their contribution to the applicable benchmarks i.e. revenue, total assets and profit before tax.\n- \u00b7 We focused our Group audit scope primarily on the audit of 5 components which were subject to a full audit and 43 components which were subject to specified audit procedures where the extent of our testing was based on our assessment of the associated risks of material misstatement and of the materiality of the components operations to the Group. 23 components were subject to specific procedures on certain account balances by component audit teams or the Group audit team, and the remaining 20 were subject to substantive analytical procedures performed centrally by the Group audit team.\n- \u00b7 Data analytics were performed centrally and used extensively in selecting the components and addressing the residual entities which were not in-scope based on the considerations listed. In addition, we analysed disaggregated financial data related to residual entities not subject to full or specified scope audit procedures in order to identify any unusual movements or relationships.\n- \u00b7 Our audit work for all components were executed at levels of materiality applicable to each individual component which were lower than Group materiality and ranged from $28 million to $74 million.\n- \u00b7 The Group audit team performed certain audit work centrally including the impairment relating to goodwill and the impairment relating to PP&E for a number of specific components.\n\n121",

Oversight and guidance is provided to the component auditors through a combination of:\n\n- \u00b7 issuance of Group referral instructions;\n- \u00b7 upfront team briefings to all component teams;\n- \u00b7 site visits (physically, where possible and if not virtually due to COVID-19 pandemic restrictions in 2020); and\n- \u00b7 risk assessment discussions and detailed workpaper reviews.\n\nThese are designed so that the Lead Audit Partner or a senior member of the Group audit team visits all key locations across the Group. In addition we assess the competence of our component auditors.\n\nPhysical site visits were performed at all key locations except Republic Cement in the Philippines where a virtual site visit was performed. Follow up visits for other locations were carried out virtually due to COVID-19 restrictions.\n\nWe held regular meetings with management at a regional and Group level in order to update our understanding of the Group and its environment on an ongoing basis.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe classify components according to the following scoping categories:\n\n- \u00b7 Scope A - Full scope integrated audit procedures have been performed by local audit teams to a component materiality. These are financially significant to the Group and includes risks relevant to the Group audit.\n- \u00b7 Scope B - Specified integrated audit procedures on prescribed balances and specific controls have been performed by component teams, or the Group audit team to component materiality. Scope B also contains Risks of Material Misstatements and associated procedures performed at Group level.\n- \u00b7 Scope C - Defined audit procedures consisting of focused risk assessments and analytical reviews have been performed by the Group audit team. Not individually financially significant to the Group.\n- \u00b7 Residual - As Risks of Material Misstatements have been determined to be remote for components and balances included in the residual, the Group engagement team performs analytical procedures, which are not substantive in nature, to determine whether the audit risk has been reduced to an acceptable level.\n\n## Other information\n\nThe other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report and Form 20-F, other than the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information contained within the annual report.\n\nOur opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nOur responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.\n\nWe have nothing to report in this regard.",

        "page_content": "2020 Annual Report and Form 20-F\n\n## Responsibilities of directors\n\nAs explained more fully in the Statement of Directors' Responsibilities, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view and otherwise comply with the Companies Act 2014, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group and Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group and Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (Ireland) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with ISAs (Ireland), we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group and Company's internal control.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the directors.\n- \u00b7 Conclude on the appropriateness of the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group and Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of the auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the entity (or where relevant, the Group) to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- \u00b7 Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. The Group auditor is responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit. The Group auditor remains solely responsible for the audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that the auditor identifies during the audit.\n\nFor listed entities and public interest entities, the auditor also provides those charged with governance with a statement that the auditor has complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, including the Ethical Standard for Auditors (Ireland) 2016, and communicates with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on the auditor's independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nWhere the auditor is required to report on key audit matters, from the matters communicated with those charged with governance, the auditor determines those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. The auditor describes these matters in the auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, the auditor determines that a matter should not be communicated in the auditor's report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\n123",

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as of 31 December 2020, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended 31 December 2020, in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of 31 December 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated 3 March 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgements. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.",

The Company used the value-in-use approach, which deploys a discounted cash flow model to estimate the recoverable amount. This requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to discount rates, short-term forecasts of future revenues and margins, and long-term growth rates which drive net cash flows. Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the recoverable amount, the amount of any goodwill impairment charge, or both.\n\nWe identified goodwill for certain CGUs as a critical audit matter because of the significant judgements made by management to estimate the recoverable value of certain CGUs and the difference between their recoverable amounts and carrying values. We focused on CGUs where impairments were recognised in the current year, CGUs identified as sensitive by management as disclosed in note 16 and CGUs with a significant change in cash flow forecasts in the current year (collectively the 'selected CGUs'). This required a high degree of auditor judgement and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our valuation specialists, when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management's estimates and assumptions as described above.\n\n## How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures related to the assumptions, as described above, used by management to estimate the recoverable amounts of the selected CGUs included the following, among others:\n\n- \u00b7 We tested the operating effectiveness of controls over management's selection of the discount rates, short-term forecasts of future revenues and margins, and long-term growth rates used to determine the recoverable amount of each selected CGU.\n- \u00b7 We agreed the underlying cash flow forecasts to the Board approved projections and we evaluated management's ability to accurately forecast future revenues and margins by:\n- \u00b7 performing a look-back analysis and comparing actual results to management's historical forecasts;\n- \u00b7 assessing the reasonableness of the impact of COVID-19 and other macroeconomic activity on short-term cash flows;\n- \u00b7 benchmarking management's forecasts against independent third-party economic and industry projections; and\n- \u00b7 comparing internal Company communications to management and the Board against the cash flow forecasts to evaluate for consistency.\n- \u00b7 With the assistance of our valuation specialists, we evaluated the appropriateness of the valuation methodology and discount rates used for each selected CGU by:\n- \u00b7 assessing the reasonableness of the valuation model used by the Company compared to generally accepted valuation practices and accounting standards;\n- \u00b7 testing the source information underlying the determination of the discount rates through use of observable inputs from independent external sources; and\n- \u00b7 developing a range of independent estimates and comparing those to the discount rates selected by management.\n- \u00b7 We compared the long-term growth rates, used by management to grow cash flows from year 5 to year 10 in order to calculate a terminal value at that point, to independent external sources and developed our own range to assess the reasonableness of these rates.\n- \u00b7 We compared the actual results for the year ended 31 December 2020 to management's forecasts at the date of the annual impairment test to determine if any additional indicators of impairment existed.\n- \u00b7 In conjunction with our climate change specialists we assessed how climate related risks had been incorporated into the valuation models and assessed whether assumptions used in the valuation models were consistent with achieving the Company's 2030 carbon reduction targets.\n\n127",

The Company recorded an impairment charge for the year ended 31 December 2020 of $0.3 billion.\n\nThe Company's evaluation of PP&E for indicators of impairment is performed annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable. The Company uses a value-in-use model to estimate the recoverable amount, which requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to discount rates, short-term forecasts of future revenues and margins, and long-term growth rates which drive net cash flows. Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the recoverable amount, the amount of any impairment charge, or both.\n\nWe identified PP&E CGUs with impairment indicators (the 'identified CGUs') as a critical audit matter because of the significant judgements made by management to estimate the recoverable value of the identified CGUs and the difference between their recoverable amounts and carrying values.

The percentage-of-completion method is used to recognise revenue and is calculated based on the proportion of the contract costs incurred at the balance sheet date relative to the total estimated costs of the contract. The accounting for these contracts involves judgement, particularly as it relates to the process of estimating total costs.\n\nWe identified revenue recognition on long-term contracts as a critical audit matter because of the judgements necessary for management to estimate total costs for the performance obligations used to recognise revenue for certain long-term contracts. This required extensive audit effort due to the complexity of long-term contracts and required a high degree of auditor judgement when performing audit procedures to audit management's estimates of total costs and evaluating the results of those procedures.\n\n## How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures related to management's estimates of total costs for the performance obligations used to recognise revenue for certain long-term contracts included the following, among others:\n\n- \u00b7 We tested the operating effectiveness of controls over long-term contract revenue, including management's controls over the estimates of total costs for performance obligations.\n- \u00b7 We selected a sample of long-term contracts and:\n- \u00b7 evaluated whether the contracts were properly included in management's calculation of long-term contract revenue based on the terms and conditions of each contract, including whether continuous transfer of control to the customer occurred as progress was made toward fulfilling the performance obligation;\n- \u00b7 tested the accuracy and completeness of the costs incurred to date for the performance obligation to supporting documentation;\n- \u00b7 evaluated the estimates of total cost for the performance obligation by:\n- \u00b7 comparing costs incurred to date to the costs management estimated, at either the inception of the contract or the start of the reporting period, to be incurred to date;\n- \u00b7 evaluating management's ability to achieve the estimates of total cost by performing corroborating inquiries with the Company's project managers and engineers, and comparing the estimates to management's work plans, engineering specifications, and supplier contracts; and\n- \u00b7 comparing management's estimates for the selected contracts to costs of similar performance obligations, when applicable.\n- \u00b7 tested the mathematical accuracy of management's calculation of revenue for the performance obligation.\n- \u00b7 We evaluated management's ability to estimate total costs accurately by comparing actual costs to management's historical estimates for performance obligations that have been fulfilled.\n\n## /s/ Deloitte Ireland LLP\n\nDublin, Ireland\n\n3 March 2021\n\nThe first accounting period we audited was 31 December 2020.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of 31 December 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheet of CRH plc as at 31 December 2020, the related consolidated income statement and consolidated statements of comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for the year ended 31 December 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the 'financial statements') of the Company and our report dated 3 March 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\n\nAs described in Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting of business combinations during the year ended 31 December 2020, which are listed in note 32 of the financial statements of the Company, and whose financial statements constitute 1.0% and 0.5% of net and total assets, respectively, 0.4% of revenues, and 0.6% of Group profit of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended 31 December 2020. Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting of business combinations completed during the year ended 31 December 2020.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThe Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying management's report on internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n## /s/ Deloitte Ireland LLP\n\nDublin, Ireland\n\n3 March 2021",

        "page_content": "## REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\n\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of CRH public limited company (CRH plc):\n\n## Opinion on the Financial Statements\n\nWe have audited the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets of CRH plc ('the Company') as of 31 December 2019 and 2018, the related Consolidated Income Statements and Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, Changes in Equity and Cash Flows for each of the two years in the period ended 31 December 2019, and related notes (collectively referred to as the 'financial statements'). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material aspects, the consolidated financial position of the Company at 31 December 2019 and 2018, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended 31 December 2019, in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.\n\n## Change in Presentation Currency\n\nAs discussed in the Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has elected to change its presentation currency from euro to US Dollar as of 1 January 2020.\n\n## Restatement of the Financial Statements\n\nAs discussed in the Accounting Policies and note 25 to the consolidated financial statements, the 2019 and 2018 consolidated financial statements have been restated to correct a misstatement in respect of the presentation of notional cash pooling arrangements on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n## Adoption of New Accounting Standard\n\nAs discussed in the Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for leases in 2019 due to the adoption of IFRS 16 Leases .\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the US federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## /s/ Ernst & Young Chartered Accountants\n\nWe served as the Company's auditor from 1988 to 2019.\n\nDublin, Ireland\n\n27 February 2020, except for the effects of the change in presentation currency and the restatement discussed in the Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements, as to which the date is 3 March 2021\n\n131",

IFRS as adopted by the European Union differ in certain respects from IFRS as issued by the IASB. However, the differences have no impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements for the financial years presented. The Consolidated Financial Statements are also prepared in compliance with the Companies Act 2014 and Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.\n\nCRH plc, the Parent Company, is a publicly traded limited company incorporated and domiciled in the Republic of Ireland.\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements, which are presented in US Dollar millions, have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the measurement at fair value of share-based payments, retirement benefit obligations and certain financial assets and liabilities including derivative financial instruments.\n\nThe accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently by all of the Group's subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates to all periods presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nIn accordance with Section 304 of the Companies Act 2014, the Company is availing of the exemption from presenting its individual profit and loss account to the Annual General Meeting and from filing it with the Registrar of Companies.\n\n## Change in presentation currency\n\nOn 28 February 2020, the Group announced that with effect from 1 January 2020 it would be changing the currency in which it presents its financial results from euro to US Dollar. Within our current portfolio of businesses, our euro denominated earnings, while sizeable, are a relatively lower proportion of overall earnings. To reduce the potential for foreign exchange volatility in our future reported earnings, the Board determined that, with effect from 1 January 2020, CRH will present its results in US Dollar. Given the current composition of the Group's activities, this change is expected to reduce the impact of currency movements on reported results.\n\nAccordingly, to satisfy the requirements of IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates , the reported results for the years ended\n\n31 December 2019 and 31 December 2018 have been translated from euro to US Dollar using the following procedures:\n\n- \u00b7 Assets and liabilities denominated in non-US Dollar currencies were translated into US Dollar at the relevant closing rates of exchange;\n- \u00b7 The trading results of subsidiaries whose functional currency was other than US Dollar were translated into US Dollar at the relevant average rates of exchange;\n- \u00b7 Movements in other reserves were translated into US Dollar at the relevant average rates of exchange;\n- \u00b7 Significant business divestments were translated at the spot rates prevailing on the date of divestment;\n- \u00b7 Share capital, share premium, Treasury Shares/ own shares and dividends were translated at the historic rates prevailing on the date of each transaction; and\n- \u00b7 The cumulative translation reserve was set to nil at 1 January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, and has been restated on the basis that the Group has reported in US Dollar since that date\n\nA change in presentation currency represents a change in accounting policy under IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors which is accounted for retrospectively. An opening balance sheet has been presented showing the impact of the change in presentation currency on 31 December 2018. The average and closing rates used for this exercise are provided on page 146.\n\n## Prior year restatement\n\nThe Group has changed the prior years' net presentation of cash and cash equivalents and current interest-bearing loans and borrowings for the Group's notional cash pooling arrangements. While the Group had the legal right to offset under the arrangements in these periods, it was determined that the presentation of cash and cash equivalents and interest-bearing loans and borrowings on a gross basis was appropriate in line with the requirements of IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation and therefore prior year comparatives have been restated accordingly to correct for this misstatement. The impact of this change is to increase both cash and cash equivalents and current interest-bearing loans and borrowings as at 31 December 2019 by $5.7 billion (2018: $6.5 billion) on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. This has no impact on net assets, net debt or the Group's profit for the year ended 31 December 2019.\n\nAt 31 December 2020, the Group's notional cash pool balances were net settled and accordingly net presentation of the balances at 31 December 2020 is appropriate.\n\n## Adoption of IFRS and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) interpretations\n\nThe following new standards, interpretations and standard amendments became effective for the Group as of 1 January 2020 and did not result in a material impact on the Group's results:\n\n- \u00b7 IFRS 3 Business Combinations - Definition of a business\n- \u00b7 Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements and IAS 8 - Definition of material\n- \u00b7 Amendments to References to the Conceptual Framework in IFRS Standards\n- \u00b7 Amendments to IFRS 9 Financial Instruments , IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures - Interest Rate Benchmark Reform\n\nThe following standard amendment was issued in May 2020 effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 June 2020 with earlier application permitted:\n\n- \u00b7 Amendments to IFRS 16 Leases -COVID-19-Related Rent Concessions. The amendment was adopted effective 1 January 2020 and did not result in a material impact on the Group's results.\n\n## IFRS and IFRIC interpretations being adopted in subsequent years\n\n## IFRS 17 InsuranceContracts\n\nIn May 2017, the IASB issued IFRS 17 which will be effective for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023, with presentation of comparative figures required. The Group is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on future periods.\n\nThere are no other IFRS or IFRIC interpretations that are effective subsequent to the CRH 2020 financial year-end that are expected to have a material impact on the results or financial position of the Group.\n\n## Key Accounting Policies which involve Estimates, Assumptions and Judgements\n\nThe preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with IFRS requires\n\n137",

        "page_content": "138\n\n## Accounting Policies - continued\n\nmanagement to make certain estimates,\n\nassumptions and judgements that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Management believes that the estimates, assumptions and judgements upon which it relies are reasonable based on the information available to it at the time that those estimates, assumptions and judgements are made. In some cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by IFRS and does not require management's judgement in its application.\n\nManagement considers that their use of estimates, assumptions and judgements in the application of the Group's accounting policies are inter-related and therefore discuss them together below with the major sources of estimation uncertainty and significant judgements separately identified.\n\nEstimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Changes in accounting estimates may be necessary if there are changes in the circumstances or experiences on which the estimate was based or as a result of new information.\n\nThe critical accounting policies which involve significant estimates, assumptions or judgements, the actual outcome of which could have a material impact on the Group's results and financial position outlined below, are as follows:\n\n## Impairment of goodwill and property, plant and equipment Notes 15 and 16\n\n## Goodwill\n\nIn the year in which a business combination is effected and where some or all of the goodwill allocated to a particular cash-generating unit (CGU) arose in respect of that combination, the CGU is tested for impairment prior to the end of the relevant annual period.\n\nGoodwill is subject to impairment testing on an annual basis and at any time during the year if an indicator of impairment is considered to exist.\n\nWhere the carrying value exceeds the estimated recoverable amount (being the greater of fair value less costs of disposal and value-in-use), an impairment loss is recognised by writing down goodwill to its recoverable amount.\n\n## Major sources of estimation uncertainty: Projected EBITDA margin, net cash flows, pre-tax discount rate\n\nThe impairment testing process requires management to make significant judgements and estimates regarding the future cash flows expected to be generated by CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated. In assessing value-in-use, the\n\nestimated future cash flows (considering projected EBITDA margin and net cash flows ) are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the future cash flow estimates have not been adjusted. The estimates of future cash flows exclude cash inflows or outflows attributable to financing activities and income tax. Future cash flows relating to the eventual disposal of these CGUs and other factors may also be relevant to determine the recoverable amount of goodwill. Management periodically evaluates and updates the estimates based on the conditions which influence these variables.\n\nThe assumptions and conditions for determining impairments of goodwill reflect management's best assumptions and estimates, but these items involve inherent uncertainties described above, many of which are not under management's control. These inherent uncertainties include assumptions around future developments arising due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the expected pace and extent of recovery in certain markets. As a result, the accounting for such items could result in different estimates or amounts if management used different assumptions or if different conditions occur in future accounting periods.\n\nA detailed discussion of the impairment methodology applied, key assumptions used and related sensitivity analyses by the Group in the context of goodwill is provided in note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe recoverable amount of goodwill is determined by reference to the CGU to which the goodwill has been allocated. Impairment losses arising in respect of goodwill are not reversed once recognised.\n\nGoodwill relating to associates and joint ventures is included in the carrying amount of the investment and is neither amortised nor individually tested for impairment. Where indicators of impairment of an investment arise in accordance with the requirements of IAS 36 Impairment of Assets , the carrying amount is tested for impairment by comparing its recoverable amount with its carrying amount. Details of the impairment charge recorded in our equity accounted investments are provided in note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Property, plant and equipment\n\nThe carrying values of items of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for indicators of impairment at each reporting date and are subject to impairment testing when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment assets are reviewed for potential impairment by applying a series of external and internal indicators specific to the assets\n\nunder consideration. These indicators encompass macroeconomic issues including the inherent cyclicality of the building materials sector, actual obsolescence or physical damage, a deterioration in forecast performance in the internal reporting cycle and restructuring and rationalisation programmes.\n\nWhere the carrying value exceeds the estimated recoverable amount (being the greater of fair value less costs of disposal and value-in-use), an impairment loss is recognised by writing down the assets to their recoverable amount. For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined by reference to the CGU to which the asset belongs.\n\nIn assessing value-in-use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGU for which the future cash flow estimates have not been adjusted. The estimates of future cash flows exclude cash inflows or outflows attributable to financing activities and income tax. Details of the impairment charge recorded in our property, plant and equipment assets are provided in note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Retirement benefit obligations Note 30\n\nCosts arising in respect of the Group's defined contribution pension schemes are charged to the Consolidated Income Statement in the period in which they are incurred. The Group has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions in the event that the fund does not hold sufficient assets to meet its benefit commitments.\n\nThe liabilities and costs associated with the Group's defined benefit pension schemes (both funded and unfunded) are assessed either on the basis of the attained age, the projected unit credit, the current unit credit or the aggregate cost methods by professionally qualified actuaries and are arrived at using actuarial assumptions based on market expectations at the balance sheet date.\n\n## Major sources of estimation uncertainty: Discount rates\n\nThe assumptions underlying the actuarial valuations (including discount rates , rates of increase in future compensation levels, mortality rates and healthcare cost trends), from which the amounts recognised in the Consolidated Financial Statements are determined, are updated annually based on current economic conditions and for any relevant changes to the terms and conditions of the pension and post-retirement plans. These assumptions can be affected by (i) for the discount rate , changes in the rates of return on",

        "page_content": "high-quality corporate bonds; (ii) for future compensation levels, future labour market conditions and (iii) for healthcare cost trend rates, the rate of medical cost inflation in the relevant regions. The weighted average actuarial assumptions used and sensitivity analysis in relation to the significant assumptions employed in the determination of pension and other post-retirement liabilities are contained in note 30 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe assumptions that are the most significant to the measurement of retirement benefit obligations are the discount rates . The discount rates employed in determining the present value of the schemes' liabilities are determined by reference to market yields at the balance sheet date on highquality corporate bonds of a currency and term consistent with the currency and term of the associated post-employment benefit obligations.\n\nWhilst management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect the obligations and expenses recognised in future accounting periods. The assets and liabilities of defined benefit pension schemes may exhibit significant period-on-period volatility attributable primarily to changes in bond yields and longevity. In addition to future service contributions, significant cash contributions may be required to remediate past service deficits.\n\nThe net surplus or deficit arising on the Group's defined benefit pension schemes, together with the liabilities associated with the unfunded schemes, are shown either within non-current assets or non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The deferred tax impact of pension scheme surpluses and deficits is disclosed separately within deferred tax assets or liabilities as appropriate. Remeasurements, comprising actuarial gains and losses and the return on plan assets (excluding net interest), are recognised immediately in the Consolidated Balance Sheet with a corresponding debit or credit to retained earnings through other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. Remeasurements are not reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods.\n\nThe defined benefit pension asset or liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheet comprises the total for each plan of the present value of the defined benefit obligation less the fair value of plan assets out of which the obligations are to be settled directly. Plan assets are assets that are held by a long-term employee benefit fund or qualifying insurance policies. Fair value is based on market price information and, in the case of published quoted securities; it is the published bid price. The value of any defined benefit asset is limited to the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plan and reductions in the future contributions to the plan.\n\nThe Group's obligation in respect of postemployment healthcare and life assurance benefits represents the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for service in the current and prior periods. The obligation is computed on the basis of the projected unit credit method and is discounted to present value using a discount rate equating to the market yield at the balance sheet date on high-quality corporate bonds of a currency and term consistent with the currency and estimated term of the post-employment obligations.\n\n## Provisions for liabilities - Note 28\n\nA provision is recognised when the Group has a present obligation (either legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that a transfer of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.\n\n## Significant judgement:\n\nJudgement is required in determining whether the Group has a present obligation and whether it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle this obligation. This judgement is applied to information available at the time of determining the liability including but not limited to judgements around interpretations of legislation, regulations, case law and insurance contracts depending on the nature of the provision.\n\nWhere the Group anticipates that a provision will be reimbursed, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset only when it is virtually certain that the reimbursement will arise. Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation. The increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as an interest expense. Contingent liabilities arising on business combinations are recognised as provisions if the contingent liability can be reliably measured at its acquisition date fair value. Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses. Management is not aware of any potential changes to key assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying value of provisions within the next financial year; however due to the nature of some of our provisions, estimates may depend on the outcome of future events and need to be revised as circumstances change in future accounting periods. Refer to note 28 for the expected timing of outflows by provisions category.\n\n## Environmental and remediation provisions\n\nThe measurement of environmental and remediation provisions is based on an evaluation of\n\ncurrently available facts with respect to each individual site and considers factors such as existing technology, currently enacted laws and regulations and prior experience in remediation of sites. Inherent uncertainties exist in such evaluations primarily due to unknown conditions, changing governmental regulations and legal standards regarding liability, the protracted length of the clean-up periods and evolving technologies. The environmental and remediation liabilities provided for in the Consolidated Financial Statements reflect the judgement applied by management in respect of information available at the time of determining the liability and are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress or as additional technical or legal information becomes available. Due to the inherent uncertainties described above, many of which are not under management's control, actual costs and cash outflows could differ if management used different assumptions or if different conditions occur in future accounting periods.\n\n## Legal contingencies\n\nThe status of each significant claim and legal proceeding in which the Group is involved is reviewed by management on a periodic basis and the Group's potential financial exposure is assessed. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable, and the amount can be reliably estimated, a liability is recognised for the estimated loss. Because of the uncertainties inherent in such matters, the related provisions are based on the best information available at the time; the issues taken into account by management and factored into the assessment of legal contingencies include, as applicable, the status of settlement negotiations, interpretations of contractual obligations, prior experience with similar contingencies/claims, and advice obtained from legal counsel and other third parties. As additional information becomes available on pending claims, the potential liability is reassessed and revisions are made to the amounts accrued where appropriate. Such revisions in the judgements and estimates of the potential liabilities could have an impact on the results of operations and financial position of the Group in future accounting periods.\n\n## Insurance provisions\n\nInsurance provisions are subject to actuarial valuation and are based on actuarial triangulations which are extrapolated from historical claims experience. These provisions include claims which are classified as 'incurred but not reported', the status of which are reviewed periodically by management, in conjunction with appropriately qualified advisors. Changes in actuarial methodologies and assumptions, along with the receipt of new information, could have an impact on the financial position of the Group through",

        "page_content": "140\n\n## Accounting Policies - continued\n\nrecognition of additional, or release of, provisions in future accounting periods.\n\n## Other Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Basis of consolidation\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the financial statements of the Parent Company and all subsidiaries drawn up to 31 December each year, and the Group's share of the results of joint ventures and associates which are accounted for using the equity method. The financial year-ends of the Group's subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are coterminous.\n\n## Subsidiaries\n\nSubsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases. A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary without a change in control is accounted for as an equity transaction.\n\nWhen the Group holds less than the majority of voting rights, other facts and circumstances including contractual arrangements that give the Group power over the investee may result in the Group controlling the investee. The Group reassesses whether it controls an investee if, and when, facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to the elements evidencing control.\n\nNon-controlling interests represent the portion of the equity of a subsidiary not attributable either directly or indirectly to the Parent Company and are presented separately in the Consolidated Income Statement and within equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, distinguished from Parent Company shareholders' equity. Acquisitions of non-controlling interests are accounted for as transactions with equity holders in their capacity as equity holders and therefore no goodwill is recognised as a result of such transactions. On an acquisition by acquisition basis, the Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest's proportionate share of the acquiree's net assets.\n\n## Investments in associates and joint ventures - Notes 11 and 17\n\nAn associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of an entity, but is not control or joint control over those policies.\n\nA joint venture is a type of joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the joint venture. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of the arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.\n\nThe Group's investments in its associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method from the date significant influence/joint control is deemed to arise until the date on which significant influence/joint control ceases to exist or when the interest becomes classified as an asset held for sale.\n\nThe Consolidated Income Statement reflects the Group's share of result after tax of the related associates and joint ventures. Investments in associates and joint ventures are carried in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at cost adjusted in respect of post-acquisition changes in the Group's share of net assets, less any impairment in value. Loans advanced to associates or joint ventures form part of the net investment in the associate or joint venture held on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Group applies IFRS 9, including the impairment requirements, to these loans as the equity method does not apply. If necessary, impairment losses on the carrying amount of an investment are reported within the Group's share of equity accounted investments' results in the Consolidated Income Statement. If the Group's share of losses exceeds the carrying amount of an associate or joint venture, the carrying amount is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has incurred obligations in respect of the associate or joint venture.\n\n## Joint operations\n\nA joint operation is a type of joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement.\n\nThe Group's investments in its joint operations are accounted for by recognising its assets and its liabilities, including its share of any assets or liabilities held jointly; its share of the revenue from the sale of the output by the joint operation; and its expenses, including its share of any expenses incurred jointly.\n\n## Revenue recognition - Note 1\n\nThe Group recognises revenue in the amount of the price expected to be received for goods and services supplied at a point in time or over time, as contractual performance obligations are fulfilled and control of goods and services passes to the customer. It excludes trade discounts and valueadded tax/sales tax.\n\n## Revenue derived from sale of goods (sources other than construction contracts)\n\nThe Group manufactures and distributes a diverse range of building materials and products. Whilst there are a number of different activities across the Group; recognition of revenue from the sale of goods is similar; being at the point in time when control is deemed to pass to the customer upon leaving a CRH premises or upon delivery to a customer depending on the terms of the sale. Contracts do not contain multiple performance obligations (as defined by IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers ).\n\nAcross the Group, goods are often sold with discounts or rebates based on cumulative sales over a period. This variable consideration is only recognised when it is highly probable that it will not be subsequently reversed and is recognised using the most likely amount or expected value methods, depending on the individual contract terms. In the application of appropriate revenue recognition, judgement is exercised by management in the determination of the likelihood and quantum of such items based on experience and historical trading patterns.\n\nThe Group is deemed to be a principal to an arrangement when it controls a promised good or service before transferring them to a customer and accordingly recognises revenue on a gross basis. Where the Group is determined to be an agent to a transaction, based on the principle of control; the net amount retained after the deduction of any costs to the principal is recognised as revenue.\n\nWithin the non-construction contract businesses no element of financing is deemed present as transactions are all made with average credit terms (usually 90 days), consistent with market practice.\n\n## Revenue derived from construction contracts\n\nThe Group enters into a number of construction contracts, to complete large construction projects. Contracts usually commence and complete within one financial period and are generally fixed price.\n\nThe Group typically recognises revenue within its construction contract businesses over time, as it performs its obligations. Management believe this best reflects the transfer of control to the customer by providing a faithful depiction of primarily the enhancement of a customer controlled asset or the construction of an asset with no alternative use. The percentage-of-completion method is used to recognise revenue when the outcome of a contract can be estimated reliably. The percentage-of-completion is calculated using an input method and based on the proportion of contract costs incurred at the balance sheet date relative to the total estimated costs of the contract. In all of our construction contract",

        "page_content": "arrangements the Group has an enforceable right to payment for work and performance obligations completed to date.\n\nSome of the Group's construction contracts may contain forms of variable consideration that can either increase or decrease the transaction price. Variable consideration is estimated based on the most likely amount or expected value methods (depending on the contract terms) and the transaction price is adjusted to the extent it is highly probable that a significant reversal of revenue recognised will not occur.\n\nIn some instances a customer can be billed and revenue recognised in the period subsequent to the contracted work being completed when items such as variable consideration are agreed with the customer.\n\n## Recognition of contract assets and liabilities\n\nIn our construction contract businesses, amounts are billed as work progresses in accordance with pre-agreed contractual terms. When a performance obligation is satisfied but a customer has not yet been billed this is recognised as a contract asset (unbilled revenue) and included within Trade and Other Receivables (note 19). Retentions (representing the percentage of consideration due which is retained by the customer until certain contractual activities are completed) are also a common feature of construction contracts and are recognised as a contract asset within Trade and Other Receivables when we have a right to consideration in exchange for the completion of the contract. Retentions are consistent with industry norms and the purpose of these is not to provide a form of financing. Apart from retentions, the Group does not have any construction contracts where the period between the transfer of the promised goods to the customer and payment by the customer exceeds one year. As a consequence, the Group applies the practical expedient in IFRS 15 and does not adjust any of its transaction prices for the time value of money.\n\nWhen consideration is received in advance of work being performed, or we have billed an amount to a customer that is in excess of revenue recognised on the contract; this is recognised as a contract liability within Trade and Other Payables (note 20); and the revenue is generally recognised in the subsequent period when the right to recognise revenue has been determined. As a result, advance payments received for construction contract arrangements are not considered a significant form of financing.\n\nCumulative costs incurred, net of amounts transferred to cost of sales, after deducting onerous provisions, provisions for contingencies and payments on account not matched with revenue, are included as construction contract balances in inventories (note 18). Cost includes all expenditure\n\ndirectly related to specific projects and an allocation of fixed and variable overheads incurred in the Group's contract activities based on normal operating capacity. The Group's contracts generally are for a duration of less than one year and therefore the Group does not capitalise incremental contract costs; instead expensing as incurred, as permitted by the practical expedient under IFRS 15.\n\n## Onerous contracts and warranties\n\nWhen a contract is identified as being onerous (i.e. its unavoidable cost exceeds the economic benefit of the contract), a provision is created; being the lower of costs to complete the contract and the cost of exiting the contract. The Group recognises a provision for assurance-type (standard) warranties offered across the Group under its terms and conditions in accordance with IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets . The Group provides assurance-type warranties for general repairs and does not typically provide service-type (extended) warranties.\n\n## Segment reporting - Note 2\n\nOperating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal organisational and management structure and the internal reporting information provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments.\n\n## Assets and liabilities held for sale - Note 3\n\nNon-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.\n\nNon-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such assets. Management must be committed to the sale, which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within 12 months from the date of classification as held for sale.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment and intangible assets are not depreciated or amortised once classified as held for sale. The Group ceases to use the equity method of accounting from the date on which an interest in a joint venture or associate becomes held for sale. Non-current assets classified as held for sale and liabilities directly associated with those assets are presented separately as current items in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n## Discontinued operations - Note 3\n\nDiscontinued operations are reported when a component of the Group, that represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operation, has been disposed of, or when a sale is highly probable; its operations and cash flows can be clearly distinguished, operationally and for financial reporting purposes, from the rest of the Group and is classified as held for sale or has been disposed of. The Group classifies a non-current asset or disposal group as held for sale if its carrying value will be recovered through a sales transaction or distribution to shareholders rather than continuing use.\n\nIn the Consolidated Income Statement, discontinued operations are excluded from the results of continuing operations and are presented as a single amount as profit or loss after tax from discontinued operations. Corresponding notes to the Consolidated Income Statement exclude amounts for discontinued operations, unless stated otherwise.\n\n## Share-based payments - Note 9\n\nThe Group operates a number of equity-settled share-based payment plans. Its policy in relation to the granting of share options and awards under these plans, together with the nature of the underlying market and non-market performance and other vesting conditions, are addressed in the Directors' Remuneration Report on page 74. The Group has no material exposure in respect of cashsettled share-based payment transactions and share-based payment transactions with cash alternatives.\n\n## Awards under Performance Share Plans\n\n25% of the awards under the 2014 Performance Share Plan are subject to a TSR (and hence market-based) vesting condition measured against a tailored sector peer group (2018: 50%; with 25% being measured against a tailored sector peer group and 25% against the FTSE All-World Construction & Materials Index). Accordingly, the fair value assigned to the related equity instruments at the grant date is derived using a Monte Carlo simulation technique to model the market-based performance conditions; and is adjusted to reflect the anticipated likelihood as at the grant date of achieving the vesting condition. Awards are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance and/or service conditions are satisfied.\n\nIn 2019 a new RONA metric of 25% was introduced for awards made in 2019 and 2020. The remaining 50% of awards granted under the 2014 Performance Share Plan are subject to a cumulative cash flow target (non-market-based) vesting condition. The fair value of the awards is calculated as the market price of the shares at the date of",

        "page_content": "142\n\n## Accounting Policies - continued\n\ngrant. No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest. At the balance sheet date the estimate of the level of vesting is reviewed and any adjustment necessary is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.\n\nIf awards which vest under the 2014 Performance Share Plan are allotted to an Employee Benefit Trust, an increase in nominal share capital and share premium are recognised accordingly on allotment.\n\n## Savings-related Share Option Scheme\n\nThe fair values assigned to options under the Savings-related Share Option Scheme are derived in accordance with the trinomial valuation methodology on the basis that the services to be rendered by employees as consideration for the granting of share options will be received over the vesting period, which is assessed as at the grant date.\n\nThe cost is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the performance and/or service conditions are fulfilled. The cumulative expense recognised at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Group's best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. The Consolidated Income Statement expense/credit for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised at the beginning and end of that period. The cumulative charge to the Consolidated Income Statement is reversed only where an employee in receipt of share options leaves service prior to completion of the expected vesting period and those options forfeit in consequence.\n\nWhere an award is cancelled, it is treated as if it is vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately. This includes any award where non-vesting conditions within the control of either the Company or the employee are not met. All cancellations of awards are treated equally.\n\nThe proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital (nominal value) and share premium when the options are exercised.\n\nThe dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the determination of diluted earnings per share.\n\n## Taxation - current and deferred Notes 12 and 29\n\nCurrent tax represents the expected tax payable (or recoverable) on the taxable profit for the year using tax rates enacted for the period. Where items are accounted for outside of profit or loss, the related\n\nincome tax is recognised either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity as appropriate.\n\nDeferred tax is recognised using the liability method on temporary differences arising at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements. However, deferred tax liabilities are not recognised if they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill. In addition, deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that, at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. For the most part, no provision has been made for temporary differences applicable to investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures as the Group is in a position to control the timing of reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. However, a temporary difference has been recognised to the extent that specific assets have been identified for sale or where there is a specific intention to unwind the temporary difference in the foreseeable future. Due to the absence of control in the context of associates (significant influence only), deferred tax liabilities are recognised where appropriate in respect of CRH's investments in these entities on the basis that the exercise of significant influence would not necessarily prevent earnings being remitted by other shareholders in the undertaking.\n\nDeferred tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not subject to discounting. Deferred tax assets are recognised in respect of all deductible temporary differences, carry-forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. The carrying amounts of deferred tax assets are subject to review at each balance sheet date and are reduced to the extent that future taxable profits are considered to be inadequate to allow all or part of any deferred tax asset to be utilised.\n\nThe Group's income tax charge is based on reported profit and enacted statutory tax rates, which reflect various allowances and reliefs available to the Group in the multiple tax jurisdictions in which it operates. The determination of the Group's provision for income tax requires certain judgements and estimates in relation to matters where the ultimate tax outcome may not be certain. The recognition or non-recognition of deferred tax assets as appropriate also requires judgement as it involves an assessment of the future recoverability of those assets. In addition, the Group is subject to tax audits\n\nwhich can involve complex issues that could require extended periods to conclude, the resolution of which is often not within the control of the Group. Although management believes that the estimates included in the Consolidated Financial Statements and its tax return positions are reasonable, there is no certainty that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in the Group's historical income tax provisions and accruals. Whilst it is possible, the Group does not currently anticipate that any such differences could have a material impact on the income tax provision and profit for the period in which such a determination is made nor does it expect any significant impact on its financial position within the next 12 months. This is based on the Group's knowledge and experience, as well as the profile of the individual components which have been reflected in the current tax liability, the status of the tax audits, enquiries and negotiations in progress at each year-end, previous claims and any factors specific to the relevant tax environments.\n\n## Property, plant and equipment Note 15\n\nThe carrying value of property, plant and equipment (excluding leased right-of-use assets) of $17,767 million at 31 December 2020 represents 40% of total assets at that date. Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairments except for certain items that had been revalued to fair value prior to the date of transition to IFRS (1 January 2004).\n\nRepair and maintenance expenditure is included in an asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repair and maintenance expenditure is charged to the Consolidated Income Statement during the financial period in which it is incurred.\n\nBorrowing costs incurred in the construction of major assets which take a substantial period of time to complete are capitalised in the financial period in which they are incurred.\n\nIn the application of the Group's accounting policy, judgement is exercised by management in the determination of residual values and useful lives. Depreciation and depletion is calculated to write off the book value of each item of property, plant and equipment over its useful economic life on a straight-line basis at the following rates:\n\n## Land and buildings\n\nThe book value of mineral-bearing land, less an estimate of its residual value, is depleted over the period of the mineral extraction in the proportion which production for the year bears to the latest",

        "page_content": "estimates of proven and probable mineral reserves. Land, other than mineral-bearing land, is not depreciated. In general, buildings are depreciated at 2.5% per annum (p.a.).\n\n## Plant and machinery\n\nThese are depreciated at rates ranging from 3.3% p.a. to 20% p.a. depending on the type of asset. Plant and machinery includes transport vehicles which are on average, depreciated at 20% p.a.\n\nDepreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each financial year-end. Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset are accounted for by changing the depreciation period or method as appropriate on a prospective basis.\n\n## Business combinations - Note 32\n\nThe Group applies the acquisition method in accounting for business combinations. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred (excluding amounts relating to the settlement of pre-existing relationships), the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and, in a business combination achieved in stages, the acquisitiondate fair value of the acquirer's previously-held equity interest in the acquiree. Transaction costs that the Group incurs in connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred.\n\nTo the extent that settlement of all or any part of consideration for a business combination is deferred, the fair value of the deferred component is determined through discounting the amounts payable to their present value at the date of exchange. The discount component is unwound as an interest charge in the Consolidated Income Statement over the life of the obligation. Any contingent consideration is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date and included in the cost of the acquisition. The fair value of contingent consideration at acquisition date is arrived at through discounting the expected payment to present value. In general, in order for contingent consideration to become payable, pre-defined profit and/or profit/net asset ratios must be exceeded. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration will be recognised in profit or loss unless the contingent consideration is classified as equity, in which case it is not remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity.\n\nThe assets and liabilities arising on business combination activity are measured at their acquisition-date fair values. Contingent liabilities assumed in business combination activity are recognised as of the acquisition date, where such contingent liabilities are present obligations arising\n\nfrom past events and their fair value can be measured reliably. In the case of a business combination achieved in stages, the acquisitiondate fair value of the acquirer's previously-held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value as at the acquisition date through profit or loss. When the initial accounting for a business combination is determined provisionally, any adjustments to the provisional values allocated to the consideration, identifiable assets or liabilities (and contingent liabilities, if relevant) are made within the measurement period, a period of no more than one year from the acquisition date.\n\n## Goodwill - Note 16\n\nGoodwill arising on a business combination is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net identifiable assets and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition and relates to the future economic benefits arising from assets which are not capable of being individually identified and separately recognised. Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. If the cost of the acquisition is lower than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the identification and measurement of the related assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities are revisited and the cost is reassessed with any remaining balance recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement.\n\nThe carrying amount of goodwill in respect of associates and joint ventures is included in investments accounted for using the equity method (i.e. within financial assets) in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nWhere a subsidiary is disposed of or terminated through closure, the carrying value of any goodwill of that subsidiary is included in the determination of the net profit or loss on disposal/termination.\n\n## Intangible assets (other than goodwill) arising on business combinations - Note 16\n\nAn intangible asset is capitalised separately from goodwill as part of a business combination at cost (fair value at date of acquisition).\n\nSubsequent to initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. The carrying values of definite-lived intangible assets (the Group does not currently have any indefinite-lived intangible assets other than goodwill) are reviewed for indicators of impairment at each reporting date and are subject to impairment testing when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable.\n\nIntangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis. In general, definite-lived intangible assets are amortised over periods ranging from one to ten years, depending on the nature of the intangible asset.\n\nAmortisation periods, useful lives, expected patterns of consumption and residual values are reviewed at each financial year-end. Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset are accounted for by changing the amortisation period or method as appropriate on a prospective basis.\n\n## Leases - Notes 15 and 22\n\nThe Group enters into leases for a range of assets, principally relating to property. These property leases have varying terms, renewal rights and escalation clauses, including periodic rent reviews linked with a consumer price index and/or other indices. The Group also leases plant and machinery, vehicles and equipment. The terms and conditions of these leases do not impose significant financial restrictions on the Group.\n\nA contract contains a lease if it is enforceable and conveys the right to control the use of a specified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration, which is assessed at inception. A right-of-use asset and lease liability are recognised at the commencement date for contracts containing a lease, with the exception of leases with a term of 12 months or less which do not contain a purchase option, leases where the underlying asset is of low value and leases with associated payments that vary directly in line with usage or sales. The commencement date is the date at which the asset is made available for use by the Group.\n\nThe lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the future lease payments, discounted using the incremental borrowing rate or the interest rate implicit in the lease, if this is readily determinable, over the remaining lease term. Lease payments include fixed payments less any lease incentives receivable, variable payments that are dependent on a rate or index known at the commencement date, amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees and any payments for an optional renewal period and purchase and termination option payments, if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise those options. The lease term is the non-cancellable period of the lease adjusted for any renewal or termination options which are reasonably certain to be exercised. Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate and rentals relating to low value or short-term leases are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred. Management applies judgement in determining whether it is reasonably certain that a renewal, termination or purchase option will be exercised.",

        "page_content": "144\n\n## Accounting Policies - continued\n\nIncremental borrowing rates are calculated using a portfolio approach, based on the risk profile of the entity holding the lease and the term and currency of the lease.\n\nAfter initial recognition, the lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments or when the Group changes its assessment of whether it is reasonably certain to exercise an option within the contract. A corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset.\n\nThe right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the lease liability adjusted for any payments made at or before the commencement date, initial direct costs incurred, lease incentives received and an estimate of the cost to dismantle or restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located at the end of the lease term. The right-of-use asset is depreciated over the lease term or, where a purchase option is reasonably certain to be exercised, over the useful economic life of the asset in line with depreciation rates for owned property, plant and equipment. The right-of-use asset is tested periodically for impairment if an impairment indicator is considered to exist.\n\nNon-lease components in a contract such as maintenance and other service charges are separated from lease payments and are expensed as incurred.\n\nThe Group adopted IFRS 16 using the modified retrospective approach on 1 January 2019. Accordingly, the comparative information for the year ended 31 December 2018 has not been restated and continues to be accounted for in accordance with the Group's previous accounting policy under IAS 17 Leases . Under the previous accounting policy, leases where the lessor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership were classified as operating leases. Operating lease rentals were charged to the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\n## Inventories - Note 18\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is based on the first-in/ first-out principle (and weighted average, where appropriate) and includes all expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their present location and condition. Raw materials are valued on the basis of purchase cost on a first-in/ first-out basis. In the case of finished goods and work-in-progress, cost includes direct materials, direct labour and attributable overheads based on normal operating capacity and excludes borrowing costs.\n\nNet realisable value is the estimated proceeds of sale less all further costs to completion, and less all\n\ncosts to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution. Estimates of net realisable value are based on the most reliable evidence available at the time the estimates are made, taking into consideration fluctuations of price or cost directly relating to events occurring after the end of the period, the likelihood of short-term changes in buyer preferences, product obsolescence or perishability (all of which are generally low given the nature of the Group's products) and the purpose for which the inventory is held. Materials and other supplies held for use in the production of inventories are not written down below cost if the finished goods, in which they will be incorporated, are expected to be sold at or above cost.\n\n## Trade and other receivables Note 19\n\nThe classification of financial assets depends on the Group's business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual terms of the cash flows.\n\nThe Group's principal financial assets are its trade and other receivables (including contract assets). Trade and other receivables are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contract and has a legal right to receive cash. Trade receivables (including contract assets) are carried at original invoice amount, which is equivalent to amortised cost, less an expected credit loss provision. Further details on the approach the Group applies to providing for expected credit losses is outlined in note 19.\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents Note 25\n\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances held for the purpose of meeting short-term cash commitments and investments which are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value. Cash and cash equivalents are classified as financial assets measured at amortised cost or, in the case of certain money market deposits, fair value through profit or loss. Bank overdrafts are included within current interest-bearing loans and borrowings in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Where the overdrafts are repayable on demand and form an integral part of cash management, they are netted against cash and cash equivalents for the purposes of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.\n\n## Interest-bearing loans and borrowings - Note 26\n\nAll loans and borrowings are initially recorded at the fair value of the consideration received net of directly attributable transaction costs. The computation of amortised cost includes any issue costs and any discount or premium materialising on\n\nsettlement. Subsequent to initial recognition, current and non-current interest-bearing loans and borrowings are, in general, measured at amortised cost employing the effective interest methodology. Fixed rate loans and borrowings, which have been hedged to floating rates (using interest rate swaps), are measured at amortised cost adjusted for changes in value attributable to the hedged risks arising from changes in underlying market interest rates.\n\nBorrowing costs arising on financial instruments are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred (unless capitalised as part of the cost of property, plant and equipment).\n\n## Derivative financial instruments and hedging practices - Note 27\n\nIn order to manage interest rate, foreign currency and commodity risks and to realise the desired currency profile of borrowings, the Group employs derivative financial instruments (principally interest rate swaps, currency swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts). Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value. The carrying value of derivatives is fair value based on discounted future cash flows and adjusted for counterparty risk. Future floating rate cash flows are estimated based on future interest rates (from observable yield curves at the end of the reporting period). Fixed and floating rate cash flows are discounted at future interest rates and translated at period-end foreign exchange rates. Short dated forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the forward foreign exchange risk on currency exposures. The forward price elements to these contracts are excluded from the hedge.\n\nAt the inception of a derivative transaction, the Group documents the relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument together with its risk management objective and the strategy underlying the proposed transaction. The Group also documents its assessment, both at the inception of the hedging relationship and subsequently on an ongoing basis, of the effectiveness of the hedging instrument in offsetting movements in the fair values or cash flows of the hedged items. Where derivatives do not fulfil the criteria for hedge accounting, changes in fair values are reported in the Consolidated Income Statement and Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n## Fair value and cash flow hedges\n\nThe Group uses fair value hedges and cash flow hedges in its treasury activities. For the purposes of hedge accounting, hedges are classified either as fair value hedges (which entail hedging the exposure to movements in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability or an unrecognised firm commitment that",

        "page_content": "could affect profit or loss) or cash flow hedges (which hedge exposure to fluctuations in future cash flows derived from a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable forecast transaction that could affect profit or loss).\n\nWhere the conditions for hedge accounting are satisfied and the hedging instrument concerned is classified as a fair value hedge, any gain or loss stemming from the remeasurement of the hedging instrument to fair value is reported in the Consolidated Income Statement. In addition, any gain or loss on the hedged item which is attributable to the hedged risk is adjusted against the carrying amount of the hedged item and reflected in the Consolidated Income Statement. Where the adjustment is to the carrying amount of a hedged interest-bearing financial instrument, the adjustment is amortised to the Consolidated Income Statement with the objective of achieving full amortisation by maturity.\n\nWhere a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction that could affect profit or loss, the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is recognised as other comprehensive income, net of the income tax effect, with the ineffective portion being reported in the Consolidated Income Statement. The associated gains or losses that had previously been recognised as other comprehensive income are transferred to the Consolidated Income Statement contemporaneously with the materialisation of the hedged transaction.\n\nHedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. At that point in time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised as other comprehensive income remains there until the forecast transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer anticipated to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss previously recognised as other comprehensive income is transferred to the Consolidated Income Statement in the period.\n\n## Net investment hedges\n\nWhere foreign currency borrowings provide a hedge against a net investment in a foreign operation, and the hedge is deemed to be effective, foreign exchange differences are taken directly to a foreign currency translation reserve. The ineffective portion of any gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement. Cumulative gains and losses remain in equity until disposal of the net investment in the foreign operation at which point the related differences are transferred to the Consolidated Income Statement as part of the overall gain or loss on sale.\n\n## Share capital and dividends Notes 31 and 13\n\n## Treasury Shares and own shares\n\nOrdinary Shares acquired by the Parent Company (Treasury Shares) or purchased by the Employee Benefit Trust on behalf of the Parent Company under the terms of the Performance Share Plans and the Restricted Share Plan (own shares) are deducted from equity and presented on the face of the Consolidated Balance Sheet. No gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Parent Company's Ordinary Shares.\n\n## Dividends\n\nDividends on Ordinary Shares are recognised as a liability in the Consolidated Financial Statements in the period in which they are declared by the Parent Company and approved by shareholders in respect of final dividends.\n\n## Other Reserves\n\nOther Reserves primarily comprise reserves relating to the Group's share-based payments expense.\n\n## Foreign currency translation\n\nItems included in the financial statements of each of the Group's entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates ('the functional currency'). The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in US Dollar, which is the presentation currency of the Group. The functional currency of the Parent Company is euro.\n\nTransactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. All currency translation differences are taken to the Consolidated Income Statement with the exception of all monetary items that provide an effective hedge for a net investment in a foreign operation. These are recognised in other comprehensive income until the disposal of the net investment, at which time they are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.\n\nResults and cash flows of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates with non-US Dollar functional currencies have been translated into US Dollar at average exchange rates for the year, and the related balance sheets have been translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Adjustments arising on translation of the results and net assets of non-US Dollar subsidiaries, joint ventures, associates and joint operations are recognised in a separate translation reserve within equity, net of differences on related currency borrowings. All other translation differences are taken to the Consolidated Income Statement. Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition of a foreign operation are regarded as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and are translated accordingly.",

It manufactures and supplies a diverse range of superior building materials and products for use in the construction and maintenance of infrastructure, housing and commercial projects of all sizes, all across the world.\n\nThe Group has three operating segments (as identified under IFRS 8 Operating Segments ) generating revenue through the following activities:\n\nAmericas Materials businesses are predominantly engaged in the production and sale of aggregates, asphalt, cement and readymixed concrete products and provide asphalt paving services in the US and Canada. This segment also includes the Group's cement operations in Brazil.\n\nEurope Materials businesses are predominantly engaged in the manufacture and supply of cement, lime, aggregates, readymixed and precast concrete and asphalt products, as well as\n\npaving and construction services. This segment comprises businesses operating in 21 countries across Western, Central and Eastern Europe as well as the Philippines in Asia.\n\nOur Building Products segment includes businesses operating across a portfolio of building product related platforms including architectural products, infrastructure products, construction accessories and building envelope. This segment also included up to their disposal in 2019, our perimeter protection and shutters & awnings businesses as well as our Do-It-Yourself (DIY) businesses in Belgium and the Netherlands which were disposed of in 2018. This segment comprises businesses operating in 19 countries primarily in the US, Canada and Western Europe.\n\nThe divestment of our Europe Distribution business (excluding DIY Benelux), formerly part of the Building Products segment, was completed in 2019. As a result, it was classified as discontinued operations in 2019; its performance in 2019 and\n\n2018 was therefore part of discontinued operations. As referenced above, DIY Benelux was separately divested in 2018 and therefore its performance up to the date of divestment is shown as part of continuing operations in 2018.\n\n## A. Disaggregated revenue\n\nIn the following tables, revenue is disaggregated by primary geographic market and by principal activities and products. Due to the diversified nature of the Group, the basis on which management reviews its businesses varies across the Group. Geography is the primary basis for the Americas Materials and Europe Materials businesses; while activities and products are used for the Building Products businesses.\n\nRevenue from external customers (as defined in IFRS 8) attributable to the country of domicile and all foreign countries of operation greater than 10% are included below. Further operating segment disclosures are set out in note 2.\n\nYear ended 31 December\n\n| Primary geographic markets                | Americas Materials 2020 $m   | Europe Materials 2020 $m   | Building Products 2020 $m   | Total 2020 $m   | Americas Materials 2019 $m   | Europe Materials 2019 $m   | Building Products 2019 $m   | Total 2019 $m   | Americas Materials 2018 $m   | Europe Materials 2018 $m   | Building Products 2018 $m   | Total 2018 $m   |\n|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------|------------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------|------------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------|\n| Continuing operations                     |                              |                            |                             |                 |                              |                            |                             |                 |                              |                            |                             |                 |\n| Republic of Ireland (country of domicile) | -                            | 632                        | -                           | 632             | -                            | 655                        | -                           | 655             | -                            | 553                        | -                           | 553             |\n| United Kingdom                            | -                            | 3,157                      | 180                         | 3,337           | -                            | 3,478                      | 243                         | 3,721           | -                            | 3,596                      | 263                         | 3,859           |\n| Rest of Europe (i)                        | -                            | 4,841                      | 992                         | 5,833           | -                            | 4,845                      | 1,162                       | 6,007           | -                            | 4,840                      | 1,735                       | 6,575           |\n| United States                             | 9,984                        | -                          | 5,479                       | 15,463          | 10,307                       | -                          |                             | 5,086 15,393    | 9,326                        | -                          |                             | 4,801 14,127    |\n| Rest of World (ii)                        | 1,289                        | 511                        | 522                         | 2,322           | 1,319                        | 531                        | 506                         | 2,356           | 1,246                        | 509                        | 580                         | 2,335           |\n| Total Group from continuing operations    | 11,273                       | 9,141                      | 7,173                       | 27,587          | 11,626                       | 9,509                      |                             | 6,997 28,132    | 10,572                       | 9,498                      |                             | 7,379 27,449    |\n| Discontinued operations                   |                              |                            |                             |                 |                              |                            |                             |                 |                              |                            |                             |                 |\n| United States - Americas Distribution     |                              |                            |                             | -               |                              |                            |                             | -               |                              |                            |                             | 8               |\n| Rest of Europe (i) - Europe Distribution  |                              |                            |                             | -               |                              |                            |                             | 3,557           |                              |                            |                             | 4,191           |\n| Total Group                               |                              |                            |                             | 27,587          |                              |                            |                             | 31,689          |                              |                            |                             | 31,648          |\n\n147",

The individual entities within the Group have a large number of customers spread across various activities, end-uses and geographies.\n\nRevenue derived through the supply of services and intersegment revenue are not material to the Group. The transfer pricing policy implemented by the Group between operating segments and across its constituent entities is described in note 34. In addition, due to the nature of building materials, which have a low value-to-weight ratio, the Group's revenue streams include a low level of cross-border transactions.\n\n## B. Contract balances\n\nFor information on the Group's construction contract balances, including movements during the year, refer to notes 18, 19 and 20. Movements in our net contract balances are not considered significant and are primarily driven by the timing of billing work-in-progress within our construction contract businesses.\n\n## C. Unsatisfied long-term construction contracts and other performance obligations\n\nRevenue yet to be recognised from fixed-price long-term construction contracts, primarily within our Americas Materials and Europe Materials businesses, amounted to $2,604 million at\n\n31 December 2020 (2019: $2,097 million; 2018: $2,116 million). The Group has applied the practical expedient of IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers whereby revenue yet to be recognised on contracts that had an original expected duration of less than one year is not disclosed. The majority of open contracts at 31 December 2020 will close and revenue will be recognised within 12 months of the balance sheet date.",

The segments reflect the Group's organisational structure and the nature of the financial information reported to and assessed by the Group Chief Executive and Finance Director, who are together determined to fulfil the role of Chief Operating Decision Maker (as defined in IFRS 8). No operating segments have been aggregated to form these reportable segments.\n\nThe principal factors employed in the identification of the three segments reflected in this note include:\n\n- \u00b7 the Group's organisational structure in 2020 (during 2020 each divisional President fulfilled the role of 'segment manager' as outlined in IFRS 8);\n- \u00b7 the nature of the reporting lines to the Chief Operating Decision Maker (as defined in IFRS 8);\n- \u00b7 the structure of internal reporting documentation such as management accounts and budgets; and\n- \u00b7 the degree of homogeneity of products and services within each of the segments from which revenue is derived\n\n## A.

Segment performance is predominantly evaluated using EBITDA (as defined)*; supplemental operating profit information is provided below. Given that net finance costs and income tax are managed on a centralised basis, these items are not allocated between operating segments for the purposes of the information presented to the Chief Operating Decision Maker and are accordingly omitted from the detailed segmental analysis below. There are no asymmetrical allocations to reporting segments which would require disclosure.\n\n149",

Both of these transactions were considered to be discontinued operations as defined in IFRS 5 Non-Current\n\nAssets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations and were classified accordingly in 2019 and 2018 .\n\nNo businesses divested in 2020 are considered to be either separate major lines of business or geographical areas of operation and therefore do not constitute discontinued operations.\n\nAssets and liabilities that met the IFRS 5 criteria at 31 December 2020 have not been separately disclosed as held for sale as they were not considered material in the context of the Group.\n\nThe table below sets out the proceeds and related (loss)/profit recognised on divestments which were included in profit after tax for the financial years 2019 and 2018 from discontinued operations.\n\n|                                                              | 2019 $m   | 2018 $m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Assets/(liabilities) disposed of at net carrying amount:     |           |           |\n| - non-current assets                                         | 1,462     | 570       |\n| - cash and cash equivalents                                  | 112       | 21        |\n| - working capital and provisions                             | 665       | 443       |\n| - current tax                                                | 2         | -         |\n| - lease liabilities                                          | (410)     | -         |\n| - deferred tax                                               | (32)      | (17)      |\n| - retirement benefit obligations                             | (47)      | -         |\n| - non-controlling interests                                  | (9)       | -         |\n| Net assets disposed                                          | 1,743     | 1,017     |\n| Reclassification of currency translation effects on disposal | 117       | -         |\n| Total                                                        | 1,860     | 1,017     |\n| Proceeds from disposal (net of disposal costs)               | 1,855     | 2,861     |\n| (Loss)/profit on disposal from discontinued operations       | (5)       | 1,844     |\n| Net cash inflow arising on disposal                          |           |           |\n| Proceeds from disposal from discontinued operations          | 1,855     | 2,861     |\n| Less: cash and cash equivalents disposed                     | (112)     | (21)      |\n| Total                                                        | 1,743     | 2,840     |",

The other 50% of each award is subject to a cumulative cashflow metric). Further details are set out on page 90 in the Directors' Remuneration Report.\n\nThe fair values assigned to the portion of awards which are subject to TSR performance against peers and, in the case of 2018, the index, was\n\n\u20ac 18.52 (2019: \u20ac 18.59; 2018: \u20ac 13.52). The fair value of these awards was calculated using a TSR pricing model taking account of peer group TSR, volatilities and correlations together with the following assumptions:\n\n|                             | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   |\n|-----------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Risk-free interest rate (%) | (0.61) | (0.37) | (0.43) |\n| Expected volatility (%)     | 22.1   | 23.2   | 27.4   |\n\nThe expected volatility was determined using a historical sample of daily CRH share prices.\n\nThe fair value of (i) the portion of awards subject to cash flow performance; (ii) from 2019, the portion of awards subject to a RONA metric; and (iii) the awards with no performance conditions (which are subject to a one or three-year service period) was \u20ac 31.50 (2019: \u20ac 29.44; 2018: \u20ac 28.32). The fair value was calculated using the closing CRH share price at the date the award was granted.",

Challenging market conditions in Northeast China affecting pricing, combined with an increase in the discount rate and the economic impact of COVID-19, are the primary drivers of the impairment charge.

        "page_content": "## Annual goodwill testing\n\nThe net book value of goodwill capitalised under previous GAAP (Irish GAAP) as at the transition date to IFRS (1 January 2004) has been treated as deemed cost. Goodwill arising on acquisition since that date is capitalised at cost.\n\n## Cash-generating units\n\nGoodwill acquired through business combination activity has been allocated to CGUs that are expected to benefit from synergies in that combination. The CGUs represent the lowest level within the Group at which the associated goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes, and are not larger than the operating segments\n\n## Impairment testing methodology and results\n\nGoodwill is subject to impairment testing on an annual basis. The recoverable amount of 22 CGUs is determined based on a value-in-use computation, using Level 3 inputs in accordance with the fair value hierarchy.\n\nAmong other macroeconomic considerations the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has been factored into our impairment testing. The cash flow forecasts are primarily based on a five-year strategic plan document formally approved by the Board of Directors and specifically exclude the impact of future development activity. To align with the Group's acquisition modelling methodology, these cash flows are projected forward for an additional five years to determine the basis for an annuitybased terminal value. As in prior years, the terminal value is based on a 20-year annuity, with the exception of certain long-lived cement assets, where an assumption of a 30-year annuity has been used. Projected cash flows beyond the initial evaluation period have been extrapolated using real growth rates ranging from 1.6% in the Americas, 0.7% to 2.0% in Europe and 3.1% in Asia.\n\n## Key sources of estimation uncertainty\n\nThe cash flows have been arrived at taking into account the Group's strong financial position, its established history of earnings and cash flow generation and the nature of the building materials industry, where product obsolescence is very low. However, expected future cash flows are inherently uncertain and are therefore liable to\n\nmaterial change over time. The key assumptions employed in arriving at the estimates of future cash flows factored into impairment testing are subjective and include projected EBITDA (as defined)* margins, net cash flows, discount rates used and the duration of the discounted cash flow model.\n\nSignificant under-performance in any of CRH's major CGUs may give rise to a material writedown of goodwill which would have a substantial impact on the Group's income and equity, however given the excess headroom on the models the likelihood of this happening is not considered reasonably possible.\n\nSuch real growth rates do not exceed the long-term average growth rates for the countries in which each CGU operates. The value-in-use represents the present value of the future cash flows, including the terminal value, discounted at a rate appropriate to each CGU. The real pre-tax discount rates used range from 6.5% to 8.6% (2019: 6.6% to 8.7%); these rates are in line with the Group's estimated weighted average cost of capital, arrived at using the Capital Asset Pricing Model.\n\nThe 2020 annual goodwill impairment testing process has resulted in our UK CGU in Europe Materials recording an impairment charge of $410 million (2019: $nil million). Our UK business has experienced a sustained period of economic disruption following the Brexit referendum in 2016,\n\ndetermined in accordance with IFRS 8. A total of 22 (2019: 25) CGUs have been identified and these are analysed between the three business segments below. The decrease in the number of CGUs in 2020 relates to organisational changes in our Americas Materials and Business Products\n\nsegments. All businesses within the various CGUs exhibit similar and/or consistent profit margin and asset intensity characteristics. Assets, liabilities, deferred tax and goodwill have been assigned to the CGUs on a reasonable and consistent basis.\n\n|                    | Number of cash-generating units   | Number of cash-generating units   | Goodwill   | Goodwill   |\n|--------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------|------------|\n|                    | 2020                              | 2019                              | 2020       | 2019       |\n|                    |                                   |                                   | $m         | $m         |\n| Americas Materials | 5                                 | 7                                 | 4,057      | 3,997      |\n| Europe Materials   | 16                                | 16                                | 2,402      | 2,645      |\n| Building Products  | 1                                 | 2                                 | 2,573      | 2,451      |\n| Total Group        | 22                                | 25                                | 9,032      | 9,093      |\n\nthe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the political uncertainty that presented in the second half of 2020 prior to the UK's formal withdrawal from the EU. When combined, these have had a significant impact on the growth prospects for this business, resulting in much slower than previously anticipated market recovery leading to a significant reduction in the recoverable amount of this CGU compared with prior years. The assumptions underlying the value-in-use model projections result in a present value (using a real pre-tax discount rate of 7.6%, 2019: 6.8%) of $1,782 million and a related goodwill impairment being recorded of $410 million.

The values applied to each of the key estimates and assumptions are specific to the individual CGUs and were derived from a combination of internal and external factors based on historical experience and took into account the cash flows specifically associated with these businesses. The cash flows and annuity-based terminal value were projected in line with the methodology disclosed above.\n\nThe Americas Cement, AMAT South and Building Products CGUs are not included in the CGUs referred to in the 'Sensitivity analysis' section below. Given the magnitude of the excess of value-in-use over carrying amount, and our belief that the key assumptions are reasonable, management believes that it is not reasonably possible that there would be a change in the key assumptions such that the carrying amount would exceed the value-in-use. Consequently no further disclosures relating to sensitivity of the value-in-use computations for the Americas\n\n## Sensitivity analysis\n\nSensitivity analysis has been performed and results in additional disclosures in respect of three of the total 22 CGUs of which one was also disclosed as sensitive in the prior year. The key assumptions, methodology used and values applied to each of the key assumptions for these CGUs are in line with those outlined above (a 30-year annuity period has been used). The three CGUs have aggregate goodwill of $915 million at the date of testing.

Customer credit quality is assessed in line with strict credit rating criteria and credit limits are established where appropriate. Outstanding customer balances are regularly monitored for evidence of customer financial difficulties including payment default, breach of contract etc. Significant balances are reviewed individually while smaller balances are grouped and assessed collectively. Receivables balances are in general unsecured and non-interest-bearing. Customer credit risk arising in the context of the Group's receivables is not significant and the total expected credit loss allowance for impairment of trade receivables amounts to 3.8% of the Group's gross trade receivables (2019: 3.6%). The Group considers the ageing of past due receivables a key factor in assessing credit risk. The trade receivables balances disclosed above\n\ncomprise a large number of customers spread across the Group's activities and geographies with balances classified as 'not past due' representing 66% of the total gross trade receivables balance at the balance sheet date (2019: 65%).\n\nDue to the global financial uncertainty arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, consideration has been given as to whether or not the future credit risk on trade and other receivables has been elevated for the year ended 31 December 2020. The impact of the pandemic is not considered material due to the Group's strong record of cash generation, good working capital management practices and our assessment of the future economic outlook. There have been no other significant changes to the Group's credit risk parameters or to the composition of the Group's trade receivables portfolio during the financial year.\n\nThe Group applies the simplified approach to providing for expected credit losses (ECL) permitted by IFRS 9 Financial Instruments , which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised from initial recognition of the receivables. Receivables such as those which relate to bonded government contracts and receivables which fall under credit insurance are considered lower risk and would not attract a material ECL. Considering the uncertain economic outlook for the next 12 months, our ECL allowance adequately represents the risk of default on our receivables balances.\n\nTrade receivables are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery, such as a debtor failing to engage in a repayment plan with the company. Where recoveries are made, these are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.",

Net debt is commonly used in computations such as net debt as a % of total equity and net debt as a % of market capitalisation.\n\n|                                                   | As at 31 December 2020   | As at 31 December 2020   | As at 31 December 2019*   | As at 31 December 2019*   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n|                                                   | Fair value $m            | Book value $m            | Fair value $m             | Book value $m             |\n| Cash and cash equivalents (note 25)               | 7,721                    | 7,721                    | 9,918                     | 9,918                     |\n| Interest-bearing loans and borrowings (note 26)** | (13,407)                 | (12,215)                 | (16,454)                  | (15,827)                  |\n| Lease liabilities under IFRS 16 (note 22) (i)     | (1,635)                  | (1,635)                  | (1,697)                   | (1,697)                   |\n| Derivative financial instruments (net) (note 27)  | 188                      | 188                      | 74                        | 74                        |\n| Group net debt                                    | (7,133)                  | (5,941)                  | (8,159)                   | (7,532)                   |\n\n## Reconciliation of opening to closing net debt\n\n|                                                                                | 2020 $m   | 2019 $m   | 2018 $m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| At 1 January                                                                   | (7,532)   | (7,998)   | (6,953)   |\n| Movement in year                                                               |           |           |           |\n| Increase in interest-bearing loans and borrowings (ii)                         | (6,427)   | (106)     | (1,587)   |\n| Repayment of interest-bearing loans, borrowings and finance leases (iii) (iv)  | 4,943     | 640       | 291       |\n| Debt, including lease liabilities, in acquired companies (note 32)             | (12)      | (81)      | (87)      |\n| Debt, including lease liabilities, in disposed companies                       | 12        | 463       | -         |\n| Effect of adopting IFRS 16                                                     | -         | (2,237)   | -         |\n| Net increase in lease liabilities under IFRS 16 (i)                            | (153)     | (184)     | -         |\n| Repayment of lease liabilities under IFRS 16 (i)                               | 258       | 356       | -         |\n| Net cash flow arising from derivative financial instruments                    | (26)      | 40        | (8)       |\n| Mark-to-market adjustment                                                      | 22        | 28        | 3         |\n| Translation adjustment on financing activities                                 | (529)     | 15        | 217       |\n| Increase in liabilities from financing activities                              | (1,912)   | (1,066)   | (1,171)   |\n| Translation adjustment on cash and cash equivalents                            | 338       | (20)      | (122)     |\n| Increase in cash and cash equivalents per Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows | 3,165     | 1,552     | 248       |\n| At 31 December                                                                 | (5,941)   | (7,532)   | (7,998)   |\n\nNotes (i) to (iv) are set out overleaf.",

Capital and Financial Risk Management\n\n## Capital management\n\n## Overall summary\n\nThe primary objectives of CRH's capital management strategy are to ensure that the Group maintains a strong credit rating to support its business and to create shareholder value by managing the debt and equity balance and the cost of capital. The Group is committed to optimising the use of its balance sheet within the confines of the overall objective to maintain an investment grade credit rating.\n\nThe capital structure of the Group, which comprises net debt and capital and reserves attributable to the Company's equity holders, may be summarised as follows:\n\n|                                                                   | 2020 $m   | 2019 $m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Capital and reserves attributable to the Company's equity holders | 19,656    | 19,028    |\n| Net debt                                                          | 5,941     | 7,532     |\n| Capital and net debt                                              | 25,597    | 26,560    |\n\nThe Board periodically reviews the capital structure of the Group, including the cost of capital and the risks associated with each class of capital. The Group manages and, if necessary, adjusts its capital structure taking account of underlying economic conditions; any material adjustments to the Group's capital structure in terms of the relative proportions of debt and equity are approved by the Board. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may issue new shares, dispose of assets, amend investment plans, alter dividend policy or return capital to shareholders.\n\nDividend cover for the year ended 31 December 2020 amounted to 1.2x (2019: 2.3x; on a continuing basis 2.2x).\n\nNo changes were made in the objectives or policies during 2020.\n\n## Financial risk management objectives and policies\n\nThe Group uses financial instruments throughout its businesses: interest-bearing loans and borrowings, cash and cash equivalents and leases are used to finance the Group's operations; trade receivables and trade payables arise directly from operations; and derivatives, principally interest rate and currency swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts, are used to manage interest rate risks and currency exposures and to achieve the desired profile of borrowings.\n\nThe London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and other benchmark interest rates are expected to be replaced by alternative risk-free rates by the end of 2021 as part of inter-bank offer rate (IBOR) reform.\n\nThe Group's existing USD LIBOR linked contracts (see note 23) do not include adequate and robust\n\nfallback provisions for a cessation of the referenced benchmark interest rate. Regulatory authorities and private sector working groups have been discussing alternative benchmark rates for IBOR. The Group has been closely monitoring the market and the output from these working parties who are managing the transition to these new benchmark interest rates. It is currently anticipated that IBOR rates will be replaced with backward looking riskfree rates based on actual transactions.\n\nThe Group has assumed that uncertainty arising from the interest rate benchmark reform will not end until the Group's contracts that reference IBORs are amended to specify the date on which the interest rate benchmark will be replaced.\n\nThe Group is working to prepare and deliver on an action plan, encompassing treasury, legal, accounting and IT functions, to enable a smooth transition to the alternative benchmark rates. At present, it is not anticipated that these changes will impact the Group's financing or interest rate hedging strategies, nor would they have a material financial impact.\n\nThe Group does not trade in financial instruments nor does it enter into any leveraged derivative transactions.\n\nThe Group's corporate treasury function provides services to the business units, co-ordinates access to domestic and international financial markets, and monitors and manages the financial risks relating to the operations of the Group. The Group Treasurer reports to the Director of Group Finance and the activities of the corporate treasury function are subject to regular internal audit. Systems and processes are in place to monitor and control the Group's liquidity risks. The Group's net debt position forms part of the monthly documentation presented to the Board.\n\nThe Group's hedging activity is based on observable economic relationships, when there is confidence that such relationships will continue for the foreseeable future. Matching critical terms such as notional amount, tenor, timing and currency, the Group establishes relationships between a hedge item and hedge instrument where directional response to changes in fair value, driven by underlying economic conditions, are opposing and proportional in equal measure being an economic relationship under IFRS 9. Hedging ratios of one to one are used throughout all hedging activity as the hedge item and hedge instrument are of the same type and currency. The hedges employed mitigate identified risks and have consistently demonstrated close economic relationships. Ineffectiveness between the hedge item and hedge instrument are immaterial in the overall context of the Group.\n\nThe main risks attaching to the Group's financial instruments are interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and commodity price risk. The Board reviews and agrees policies for the\n\nprudent management of each of these risks as documented below.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nThe Group's exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates stems predominantly from its long-term debt obligations. Interest cost is managed using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. With the objective of managing this mix in a cost-efficient manner, the Group enters into interest rate swaps, under which the Group contracts to exchange, at predetermined intervals, the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated by reference to a pre-agreed notional principal. Such contracts enable the Group to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates on the fair value of issued fixed rate debt and the cash flow exposures of issued floating rate debt.\n\nThese swaps are designated under IFRS 9 to hedge underlying debt obligations and qualify for hedge accounting treatment. Undesignated financial instruments are termed 'not designated as hedges' in the analysis of derivative financial instruments presented in note 27.\n\nThe Group applies hedge accounting where there is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument. The existence of an economic relationship is determined initially by comparing the critical terms of the hedging instrument and those of the hedged item and it is prospectively assessed using linear regression analysis. The Group issues fixed rate debt and may enter into interest rate swaps with critical terms that match those of the debt and on a 1:1 hedge ratio basis. The hedge ratio is determined by comparing the notional amount of the derivative with the notional amount of the debt. The hedge relationship is designated for the full term and notional value of the debt.\n\nThe following table demonstrates the impact on profit before tax and total equity of a range of possible changes in the interest rates applicable to net floating rate borrowings, with all other variables held constant. These impacts are calculated based on the closing balance sheet for the relevant period and assume that all floating interest rates and interest curves change by the same amount. For profit before tax, the impact shown is the impact on closing balance sheet floating rate net debt for a full year while for total equity the impact shown is the impact on the value of financial instruments.\n\n## Percentage change in cost of borrowings (i)\n\n|                             |   +/-1% | +/-1%    |\n|-----------------------------|---------|----------|\n| Impact on profit before tax |    2020 | +/- $59m |\n|                             |    2019 | +/-$23m  |\n|                             |    2018 | +/-$5m   |\n| Impact on total equity      |    2020 | -/+ $3m  |\n|                             |    2019 | -/+ $3m  |\n|                             |    2018 | -/+ $8m  |",

        "page_content": "## Foreign currency risk\n\nDue to the nature of building materials, which in general have a low value-to-weight ratio, the Group's activities are conducted primarily in the local currency of the country of operation resulting in low levels of foreign currency transaction risk; variances arising in this regard are reflected in operating costs or cost of sales in the Consolidated Income Statement in the period in which they arise.\n\nGiven the Group's presence in 30 countries worldwide, the principal foreign exchange risk arises from fluctuations in the US Dollar value of the Group's net investment in a wide basket of currencies other than the US Dollar; such changes are reported separately within the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. A currency profile of the Group's net debt and net worth is presented in note 23. The Group's established policy is to spread its net worth across the currencies of its various operations with the objective of limiting its exposure to individual currencies and thus promoting consistency with the geographical balance of its operations. In order to achieve this objective, the Group manages its borrowings, where practicable and cost effective, to hedge a portion of its foreign currency assets. Hedging is done using currency borrowings in the same currency as the assets being hedged or through the use of other hedging methods such as currency swaps.\n\nThe Group's foreign exchange hedging strategy and activity is based on the assumption that changes in international economic factors are reflected in current foreign exchange rates and impacts the translation of the Group's non-US Dollar net assets. The economic relationship, being the translation impact of the Group's net investment in non-US Dollar subsidiaries (hedge item) is hedged against a foreign currency swap (hedge instrument) to counterbalance movements in foreign currency rates. The Group identifies certain portions of foreign currency net investments where foreign currency translation movements can be mitigated through the use of currency swaps in the same currency pairing. A hedge ratio of 1:1 is established. As at 31 December 2020, the notional amount of hedged net investments was $1,028 million (2019: $1,055 million). The fair value movements of the hedge instruments are inverse to the impact of the translation of the hedged net assets because the critical terms match. This reduces the Group's exposure to fluctuations on the translation of the Group's subsidiaries with a non-US Dollar functional currency into US Dollar. Potential sources of ineffectiveness are changes in the interest rate differential of the hedged currency pair, recorded through the Consolidated Income Statement. Past trends indicate that the economic relationship described will continue for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe fair values and maturity analysis of the hedge instruments are set out in note 27.\n\nThe following table demonstrates the sensitivity of profit before tax and equity to selected movements in the relevant US Dollar/euro exchange rate (with all other variables held constant); the euro has been selected as the appropriate currency for this analysis given the materiality of the Group's activities in euro. The impact on profit before tax is based on changing the US Dollar/euro exchange rate used in calculating profit before tax for the period. The impact on total equity and financial instruments is calculated by changing the US Dollar/ euro exchange rate used in measuring the closing balance sheet.\n\n## Percentage change in relevant $/ \u20ac exchange rate (i)\n\n|                                                                     |      | +/- 5%         |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|------|----------------|\n| Impact on profit before tax                                         | 2020 | -/+ $19m       |\n|                                                                     | 2019 | +/- $4m        |\n|                                                                     | 2018 | -/+ $10m       |\n| Impact on total equity*                                             |      | 2020 +/-$157m  |\n|                                                                     |      | 2019 +/- $177m |\n|                                                                     |      | 2018 +/- $183m |\n| * Includes the impact on financial instruments which is as follows: | 2020 | -/+ $27m       |\n|                                                                     | 2019 | -/+ $11m       |\n|                                                                     | 2018 | -/+ $53m       |\n\nFinancial instruments include deposits, money market funds, commercial papers, bank loans, medium-term notes and other fixed term debt, interest rate swaps, commodity swaps and foreign exchange contracts. They exclude trade receivables and trade payables on the basis that they are denominated in the currency of the underlying operations. The Group minimises the impact of movements in foreign exchange rates on the Group's income statement through matching where possible, foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities or the use of derivative contracts.\n\n## Credit/counterparty risk\n\nIn addition to cash at bank and in hand, the Group holds significant cash balances which are invested on a short-term basis and are classified as cash equivalents (see note 25). These deposits, investments and other financial instruments (principally certain derivatives and loans and receivables included within financial assets) give rise to credit risk on amounts due from counterparty financial institutions (stemming from their insolvency or a downgrade in their credit ratings). Credit risk is managed by limiting the aggregate amount and duration of exposure to any one counterparty primarily depending on its credit rating and by regular review of these ratings and internal treasury policies. Acceptable credit ratings for deposits and\n\nother financial instruments are higher investmentgrade ratings - in general, counterparties have ratings of A3/A-/A- or higher from at least two of Moody's/Standard & Poor's/Fitch ratings agencies. The maximum exposure arising in the event of default on the part of the counterparty (including insolvency) is the carrying value of the relevant financial instrument. Money market liquidity funds are managed by external third-party fund managers to maintain Aaa/AAA long-term ratings and P1/A1 short-term ratings from Moody's/Standard & Poor's. The Group limits its investment in each fund to a prescribed maximum amount or 5% of the fund's assets under management, whichever is the lower. The Group has two managed investment funds that hold fixed income euro securities with an average credit quality of Aaa/AAA. As at 31 December 2020, 88% of cash and cash equivalents was held with higher investment grade bank counterparties, and 12% with the money market funds.\n\nCredit risk arising in the context of the Group's operations is not significant with the total loss allowance at the balance sheet date amounting to 3.8% of gross trade receivables (2019: 3.6%). Information in relation to the Group's credit risk management of trade receivables is provided in note 19. Amounts receivable from related parties (notes 19 and 34) are immaterial. Factoring arrangements and supplier financing arrangements are employed in certain of the Group's operations where deemed to be of benefit by operational management and are deemed immaterial.\n\nIn its worldwide insurance programme, the Group carries appropriate levels of insurance for typical business risks (including product liability) with various leading insurance companies. However, in the event of the failure of one or more of its insurance counterparties, the Group could be impacted by losses where recovery from such counterparties is not possible.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nThe principal liquidity risks faced by the Group stem from the maturation of debt obligations and derivative transactions. A downgrade of CRH's credit ratings may give rise to increases in funding costs in respect of future debt and may impair the Group's ability to raise funds on acceptable terms. The Group's corporate treasury function ensures that sufficient resources are available to meet such liabilities as they fall due through a combination of cash and cash equivalents, cash flows and undrawn committed bank facilities. Flexibility in funding sources is achieved through a variety of means including (i) maintaining cash and cash equivalents only with a diverse group of highly-rated counterparties; (ii) limiting the annual maturity of such balances; (iii) borrowing the bulk of the",

The repayment schedule (analysed by maturity date) applicable to the Group's outstanding interest-bearing loans and borrowings as at the balance sheet date is also presented in note 26.\n\nThe Group's \u20ac 1.5 billion Euro Commercial Paper Programme and $2.0 billion US Dollar Commercial\n\nPaper Programme means we have framework programmes in the money markets in place that allow the Group to issue in the relevant markets within a short period of time.\n\n## Commodity price risk\n\nThe principal commodity price risks are identified in a variety of highly probable and active commodity contracts where a significant part of the price to be paid relies on a reference to specific floating price indices (usually US Dollar) for a specific period. Programmes are in place to hedge the quantities and qualities of commodity products, including fuel oil and related products, electricity and carbon credits. The aim of the programmes is to neutralise the variability in the\n\nConsolidated Income Statement as a result of changes in associated commodity indices over a timeframe of approximately five years (2019: five years). A hedge ratio of 1:1 is established. Fixed price swap contracts in the entity's operating currency are used to hedge the same specific floating index risk and currency risk where it is determined that those risks are better managed at a fixed price rather than being exposed to uncontrollable price fluctuations due to the floating price index element of the contract. Sources of ineffectiveness can relate to timing of cash flows and counterparty credit risk adjustments. The derivative contracts qualify for cash flow hedge accounting under IFRS 9 and the fair values by maturity are set out in note 27.\n\nThe notional and fair values in respect of derivative contracts as at 31 December 2020 and 31 December 2019 were as follows:\n\n## Profile of commodity products\n\n|                      | As at 31 December 2020   | As at 31 December 2020   | As at 31 December 2019   | As at 31 December 2019   |\n|----------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n|                      | Notional value $m        | Fair value $m            | Notional value $m        | Fair value $m            |\n| Commodity contracts  | 85                       | -                        | 118                      | -                        |\n| Derivative liability | -                        | (2)                      | -                        | -                        |",

The credit risk attaching to these items is documented in note 24.\n\nCash and cash equivalents are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at amortised cost and are analysed as follows:\n\n|                                   | 2020 $m   | 2019 $m   |\n|-----------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Cash at bank and in hand          | 1,482     | 6,829     |\n| Investments (short-term deposits) | 6,239     | 3,089     |\n| Total                             | 7,721     | 9,918     |\n\nAs disclosed in the Accounting Policies on page 137, cash and cash equivalents and interest-bearing loans and borrowings have been restated to meet the presentation requirements of IAS 32. The comparative information for the year ended 31 December 2019 has increased cash and cash equivalents from $4.2 billion to $9.9 billion (2018: $2.7 billion to $9.2 billion) and interest-bearing loans and borrowings (note 26) from $10.1 billion to $15.8 billion (2018: $10.7 billion to $17.2 billion). At 31 December 2020, the Group's notional cash pool balances were net settled and accordingly net presentation of the balances at 31 December 2020 is appropriate.\n\nCash at bank earns interest at floating rates based on daily deposit bank rates. Short-term deposits, which include bank and money market deposits, are made for varying periods of between one day and three months depending on the immediate cash requirements of the Group, earning interest at the respective short-term deposit rates.\n\nMoney market deposits are held at fair value through profit and loss and are Level 1 instruments. The fair values of money market deposits are calculated by multiplying the net asset value per share by the investment held at the balance sheet date.\n\nFor the purposes of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, cash and cash equivalents and bank overdrafts in notional cash pooling arrangements are presented net as follows:\n\n|                                                                | 2020 $m   | 2019 $m   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Cash and cash equivalents                                      | 7,721     | 9,918     |\n| Bank overdrafts - notional cash pooling arrangements (note 26) | -         | (5,700)   |\n| Total                                                          | 7,721     | 4,218     |\n\n## 26.

The amount of tax losses where recovery is not probable and is therefore not recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet is $1.4 billion (2019: $1.7 billion). The vast majority either do not expire based on current tax legislation or they expire post 2025 (2019: 2024). Of the losses not recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, $0.1 billion (2019: $0.2 billion) expire within five years, $0.3 billion (2019: $0.2 billion) expire post five years and the remainder of the losses do not expire.\n\n## Deferred income tax liabilities (taxable temporary differences)\n\n| Taxable temporary differences principally attributable to accelerated tax depreciation and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition (i)   | 3,123   | 3,003   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Leased right-of-use assets                                                                                                                     | 315     | 307     |\n| Investment in subsidiaries                                                                                                                     | 161     | 164     |\n| Revaluation of derivative financial instruments to fair value                                                                                  | 12      | 12      |\n| Rolled-over capital gains                                                                                                                      | 17      | 15      |\n| Total                                                                                                                                          | 3,628   | 3,501   |\n\n## Investments in subsidiaries\n\nThe aggregate temporary differences in relation to investments in subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised is $10.9 billion (2019: $9.3 billion) given the Group is in a position to control the timing of reversal and management's intention not to unwind these temporary differences.

        "page_content": "## 30. Retirement Benefit Obligations\n\nThe Group operates either defined benefit or defined contribution pension schemes in all of its principal operating areas. The disclosures included below relate to all pension schemes in the Group.\n\nThe Group operates defined benefit pension schemes in Belgium, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, the Philippines, the Republic of Ireland, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Switzerland, the UK and the US. The Group has a mixture of funded and unfunded defined benefit pension schemes. The net liability of the funded schemes is $154 million, net of surpluses of $111 million (2019: $110 million, net of surpluses of $75 million). Unfunded obligations (including jubilee, postretirement healthcare obligations and long-term service commitments) comprise of a number of schemes in Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, the Philippines, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Switzerland and the US, totalling a net liability of $402 million (2019: $370 million).\n\nFunded defined benefit schemes in the Republic of Ireland, Switzerland and the UK are administered by separate funds that are legally distinct from the Group under the jurisdiction of Trustees. The Trustees are required by law to act in the best interests of the scheme participants and are responsible for the definition of investment strategy and for scheme administration. Other schemes are also administered in line with the local regulatory environment. The level of benefits available to most members depends on length of service and either their average salary over their period of employment or their salary in the final years leading up to retirement. For Switzerland, the\n\nlevel of benefits depends on salary, level of savings contributions, the interest rate on old age accounts (which cannot be negative) and the annuity conversion factor on retirement. The Group's pension schemes in Switzerland are contribution-based schemes with guarantees to provide further contributions in the event that the plan assets are insufficient to meet the benefit obligations.\n\n## Defined benefit pension schemes principal risks\n\nThrough its defined benefit pension and jubilee schemes, long-term service commitments and post-retirement healthcare plans, the Group is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below:\n\nAsset volatility: Under IAS 19 Employee Benefits , the assets of the Group's defined benefit pension schemes are reported at fair value (using bid prices, where relevant). The majority of the schemes' assets comprise equities, bonds and property, all of which may fluctuate significantly in value from period to period. Given that liabilities are discounted to present value based on bond yields and that bond prices are inversely related to yields, an increase in the liability discount rate (which would reduce liabilities) would reduce bond values, though not necessarily by an equal magnitude.\n\nGiven the maturity of certain of the Group's funded defined benefit pension schemes, de-risking frameworks have been introduced to mitigate deficit volatility and enable better matching of investment returns with the cash outflows related to benefit obligations. These frameworks entail the usage of asset-liability\n\nmatching techniques, whereby triggers are set for the conversion of equity holdings into bonds of similar average duration to the relevant liabilities.\n\nDiscount rates: The discount rates employed in determining the present value of the schemes' liabilities are determined by reference to market yields at the balance sheet date on high-quality corporate bonds of a currency and term consistent with the currency and term of the associated post-employment benefit obligations. Changes in discount rates impact the quantum of liabilities as discussed above.\n\nInflation risk: A significant amount of the Group's pension obligations are linked to inflation; higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities (although in most cases, caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect the schemes against extreme inflation).\n\nLongevity risk: In the majority of cases, the Group's defined benefit pension schemes provide benefits for life with spousal and dependent child reversionary provisions; increases in life expectancy (decreases in mortality assumptions) will therefore give rise to higher liabilities.\n\n## Aggregation\n\nFor the purposes of the disclosures which follow; the schemes in Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, the Republic of Ireland and Slovakia have been aggregated into a 'Eurozone' category on the basis of common currency and financial assumptions; schemes in Brazil, the Philippines, Romania, Serbia and the UK have been aggregated into an 'Other' category.\n\n## Financial assumptions-scheme liabilities\n\nThe major long-term assumptions used by the Group's actuaries in the computation of scheme liabilities and post-retirement healthcare obligations are as follows:\n\n|                         | United States and Canada Switzerland   | United States and Canada Switzerland   | United States and Canada Switzerland   | United States and Canada Switzerland   | United States and Canada Switzerland   | United States and Canada Switzerland   | United States and Canada Switzerland   | United States and Canada Switzerland   | United States and Canada Switzerland   |\n|-------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n|                         | 2020                                   | 2019                                   | 2018                                   | 2020                                   | 2019                                   | 2018                                   | 2020                                   | 2019                                   | 2018                                   |\n|                         | %                                      | %                                      | %                                      | %                                      | %                                      | %                                      | %                                      | %                                      | %                                      |\n| Rate of increase in:    |                                        |                                        |                                        |                                        |                                        |                                        |                                        |                                        |                                        |\n| - salaries              | 2.52                                   | 3.37                                   | 3.50                                   | 3.37                                   | 3.37                                   | 3.38                                   | 1.00                                   | 1.50                                   | 1.50                                   |\n| - pensions in payment   | 1.45                                   | 1.46                                   | 1.62                                   | -                                      | -                                      | -                                      | -                                      | -                                      | -                                      |\n| Inflation               | 1.50                                   | 1.50                                   | 1.65                                   | 2.00                                   | 2.00                                   | 2.00                                   | 0.50                                   | 1.00                                   | 1.00                                   |\n| Discount rate           | 1.14                                   | 1.43                                   | 2.12                                   | 2.34                                   | 3.14                                   | 4.10                                   | 0.20                                   | 0.30                                   | 0.85                                   |\n| Medical cost trend rate | n/a                                    | n/a                                    | n/a                                    | 5.97                                   | 5.18                                   | 1.55                                   | n/a                                    | n/a                                    | n/a                                    |\n\n191",

In 2020, the appropriation was satisfied by the purchase of 144,702 shares (2019: 148,846 satisfied by the purchase of new shares). The Ordinary Shares appropriated pursuant to these schemes were issued at market value on the dates of appropriation. The shares issued pursuant to these schemes are excluded from the scope of IFRS 2 and are hence not factored into the expense computation and the associated disclosures in note 9.",

Business Combinations - continued\n\nThe acquisition balance sheet presented on the previous page reflects the identifiable net assets acquired in respect of acquisitions completed during 2020, together with adjustments to provisional fair values in respect of acquisitions completed during 2019. The measurement period for a number of acquisitions completed in 2019, closed in 2020 with no material adjustments identified.\n\nCRH performs a detailed quantitative and qualitative assessment of each acquisition in order to determine whether it is material for the purposes of separate disclosure under IFRS 3 Business Combinations . None of the acquisitions completed during the year were considered sufficiently material to warrant separate disclosure of the attributable fair values. The initial assignment of the fair values to identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed as disclosed are provisional (principally in respect of property, plant and equipment) in respect of certain acquisitions due to timing of close. The fair value assigned to identifiable assets and liabilities acquired is based on estimates and assumptions made by management at the time of acquisition. CRH may revise its purchase price allocation during the subsequent reporting window as permitted under IFRS 3.\n\n- (i) The gross contractual value of trade and other receivables as at the respective dates of acquisition amounted to $47 million (2019: $74 million; 2018: $379 million). The fair value of these receivables is $47 million (all of which is expected to be recoverable) (2019: $73 million; 2018: $373 million).\n- (ii) The principal factor contributing to the recognition of goodwill on acquisitions entered into by the Group is the realisation of cost savings and other synergies with existing entities in the Group which do not qualify for separate recognition as intangible assets. Due to the asset-intensive nature of operations in the Americas Materials and Europe Materials business segments, no significant separately identifiable intangible assets are recognised on business combinations in these segments. $148 million of the goodwill recognised in respect of acquisitions completed in 2020 is expected to be deductible for tax purposes (2019: $184 million; 2018: $330 million).\n\nAcquisition-related costs for continuing operations, which exclude post-acquisition integration costs, amounting to $6 million (2019: $7 million; 2018: $21 million) have been included in operating costs in the Consolidated Income Statement (note 4).\n\nThe following table analyses the 17 acquisitions completed in 2020 (2019: 58 acquisitions; 2018: 44 acquisitions) by reportable segment and provides details of the goodwill and consideration figures arising in each of those segments:\n\nNumber of\n\n|                                                                   | acquisitions   | acquisitions   | acquisitions   | Goodwill   | Goodwill   | Goodwill   | Consideration   | Consideration   | Consideration   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|------------|------------|------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Reportable segments                                               | 2020           | 2019           | 2018           | 2020       | 2019       | 2018       | 2020            | 2019            | 2018            |\n| Continuing operations                                             |                |                |                | $m         | $m         | $m         | $m              | $m              | $m              |\n| Americas Materials                                                | 7              | 27             | 24             | 53         | 35         | 1,575      | 163             | 182             | 3,957           |\n| Europe Materials                                                  | 4              | 15             | 10             | -          | 4          | 56         | 7               | 71              | 103             |\n| Building Products                                                 | 6              | 15             | 8              | 90         | 253        | 87         | 182             | 501             | 248             |\n| Total Group from continuing operations                            | 17             | 57             | 42             | 143        | 292        | 1,718      | 352             | 754             | 4,308           |\n| Discontinued operations                                           |                |                |                |            |            |            |                 |                 |                 |\n| Europe Distribution                                               | -              | 1              | 2              | -          | -          | -          | -               | 4               | 38              |\n| Total Group                                                       | 17             | 58             | 44             | 143        | 292        | 1,718      | 352             | 758             | 4,346           |\n| Adjustments to provisional fair values of prior year acquisitions |                |                |                | 14         | 18         | 36         | 6               | -               | -               |\n| Total                                                             |                |                |                | 157        | 310        | 1,754      | 358             | 758             | 4,346           |\n\nThe post-acquisition impact of acquisitions completed during the year on the Group's profit for the financial year was as follows:\n\n| Continuing operations                    |   2020 $m |   2019 $m | 2018 $m   |\n|------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Revenue                                  |       103 |       228 | 1,420     |\n| Profit before tax for the financial year |         9 |         2 | 171       |",

Related Party Transactions\n\nThe principal related party relationships requiring disclosure in the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Group under IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures pertain to: the existence of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates; transactions with these entities entered into by the Group; the identification and compensation of key management personnel, and lease arrangements.\n\n## Subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the financial statements of the Company (CRH plc, the ultimate parent) and its subsidiaries as well as its joint ventures and associates accounted for by applying the equity method as documented in the accounting policies on pages 137 to 146. The Group's principal subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are disclosed on pages 250 to 254.\n\nSales to and purchases from joint ventures and associates are as follows:\n\n|                       | Joint ventures   | Joint ventures   | Joint ventures   | Associates   | Associates   | Associates   |\n|-----------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n|                       | 2020             | 2019             | 2018             | 2020         | 2019         | 2018         |\n| Continuing operations | $m               | $m               | $m               | $m           | $m           | $m           |\n| Sales                 | 127              | 132              | 126              | 31           | 41           | 48           |\n| Purchases             | 24               | 27               | 37               | 15           | 18           | 228          |\n\nLoans extended by the Group to joint ventures and associates (see note 17) are included in financial assets. Amounts receivable from and payable to equity accounted investments (arising from the aforementioned sales and purchases transactions) as at the balance sheet date are included as separate line items in notes 19 and 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Terms and conditions of transactions with subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates\n\nIn general, the transfer pricing policy implemented by the Group across its subsidiaries is market-based. Sales to and purchases from joint ventures and associates are conducted in the ordinary course of business and on terms equivalent to those that prevail in arms-length transactions. The outstanding balances included in receivables and payables as at the balance sheet date in respect of transactions with joint ventures and associates are unsecured and settlement of these arise in cash. No guarantees have been either requested or provided in relation to related party receivables and payables. Loans to joint ventures and associates (as disclosed in note 17) are extended on normal commercial terms in the ordinary course of business with interest accruing and, in general, paid to the Group at predetermined intervals.\n\n## Key management personnel\n\nFor the purposes of the disclosure requirements of IAS 24, the term 'key management personnel' (i.e. those persons having authority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities of the Company) comprises of the Board of Directors which manage the business and affairs of the Company.\n\n| Key management remuneration amounted to:                                                |   2020 $m |   2019 $m |   2018 $m |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Short-term benefits                                                                     |         9 |         9 |         9 |\n| Post-employment benefits                                                                |         1 |         1 |         1 |\n| Share-based payments - calculated in accordance with the principles disclosed in note 9 |         6 |         6 |         5 |\n| Total                                                                                   |        16 |        16 |        15 |\n\nOther than these compensation entitlements, there were no other transactions involving key management personnel.\n\n## Lease arrangements\n\nCRH has a number of lease arrangements in place with related parties across the Group, which have been negotiated on an arms-length basis at market rates.

        "page_content": "## Notes to the Company Balance Sheet\n\n## 1. Basis of Preparation\n\nThe financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention in accordance with the Companies Act 2014 and GAAP in the Republic of Ireland (Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework (FRS 101)). Note 2 below describes the principal accounting policies under FRS 101, which have been applied consistently.\n\nIn these financial statements the Company has applied the exemptions available under FRS 101 in respect of the following disclosures:\n\n- \u00b7 Statement of Cash Flows;\n- \u00b7 Disclosures in respect of transactions with wholly-owned subsidiaries;\n- \u00b7 Certain requirements of IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements ;\n- \u00b7 Disclosures required by IFRS 7 Financial Instrument Disclosures ;\n- \u00b7 Disclosures required by IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement ; and\n- \u00b7 The effects of new but not yet effective IFRSs\n\nAs outlined in the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 137, on 28 February 2020, the Group announced that with effect from 1 January 2020 it would be changing the currency in which it presents its financial results from euro to US Dollar. CRH plc (the 'Company') also changed its presentation currency on this basis.\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of FRS 101, the reported results for the year ended 31 December 2019 have been translated from euro to US Dollar using the procedures disclosed on page 137 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. A change in presentation currency represents a change in accounting policy which is accounted for retrospectively.\n\nAn opening balance sheet has been presented on page 205 showing the impact of the change in presentation currency on 31 December 2018.\n\n## 2. Accounting Policies\n\n## General information\n\nThe Company and its subsidiaries (together the 'Group') is a diversified building materials business which manufactures and supplies a diverse range of superior building materials and products for use in the construction and maintenance of infrastructure, housing and commercial projects of all sizes, all across the world. The Company is a public limited company whose shares are publicly traded. The Company is incorporated and domiciled in the Republic of Ireland. The Company's registered number is 12965 and registered office address is 42 Fitzwilliam Square, Dublin 2, Ireland.\n\n## Key accounting policies which involve estimates, assumptions and judgements\n\nPreparation of the financial statements requires management to make significant judgements and estimates. The items in the financial statements where these judgements and estimates have been made include:\n\n## Financial assets\n\nInvestments in subsidiaries, are stated at cost less any accumulated impairment and are reviewed for impairment if there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Impairment assessment is considered as part of the Group's overall impairment assessment.\n\n## Loans receivable and payable\n\nIntercompany loans receivable and payable are initially recognised at fair value. These are\n\nsubsequently measured at amortised cost, less any loss allowance.\n\n## Other significant accounting policies\n\n## Operating income and expense\n\nOperating income and expense arises from the Company's principal activities as a holding and financing company for the Group and are accounted for on an accruals basis.\n\n## Foreign currencies\n\nThe functional currency of the Company is euro. Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the transaction date. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into euro at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date, with a corresponding charge or credit to the profit and loss account.\n\nThe presentation currency of the Company is the US Dollar.\n\n## Share-based payments\n\nThe Company has applied the requirements of Section 8 of FRS 101.\n\nThe accounting policy applicable to share-based payments is addressed in detail on page 141 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Treasury Shares and own shares Treasury Shares\n\nOwn equity instruments (i.e. Ordinary Shares) acquired by the Company are deducted from equity\n\nand presented on the face of the Company Balance Sheet. No gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Company's Ordinary Shares.\n\n## Own shares\n\nOrdinary Shares purchased by the Employee Benefit Trust on behalf of the Company under the terms of the Performance Share Plan are recorded as a deduction from equity on the face of the Company Balance Sheet.\n\n## Dividends\n\nDividends on Ordinary Shares are recognised as a liability in the Company's Financial Statements in the period in which they are declared by the Company and approved by shareholders in respect of final dividends.\n\n## Dividend income\n\nDividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances held for the purpose of meeting short-term cash commitments and investments which are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value. Bank overdrafts are included within creditors falling due within one year in the Company Balance Sheet.\n\n207",

EBITDA is de/fined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortisation, asset impairment charges, pro/fit on disposals and the Group's share of equity accounted investments' pro/fit after tax and is quoted by management in conjunction with other GAAP and non-GAAP /financial measures, to aid investors in their analysis of the performance of the Group and to assist investors in the comparison of the Group's performance with that of other companies. EBITDA (as de/fined)* by segment is monitored by management in order to allocate resources between segments and to assess performance. Given that net /finance costs and income tax are managed on a centralised basis, these items are not allocated between operating segments for the purpose of the information presented to the Chief Operating Decision Maker. EBITDA (as de/fined)* margin is calculated by expressing EBITDA (as de/fined)* as a percentage of sales.\n\nNet Debt. Net debt is used by management as it gives a more complete picture of the Group's current debt situation than total interest-bearing loans and borrowings. Net debt is provided to enable investors to see the economic effect of gross debt, related hedges and cash and cash equivalents in total. Net debt is a non-GAAP measure and comprises current and non-current interest-bearing loans and borrowings, lease liabilities under IFRS 16, cash and cash equivalents and current and non-current derivative /financial instruments (net).\n\nNet Debt/EBITDA (as de/fined)* is monitored by management and is useful to investors in assessing the Company's level of indebtedness relative to its pro/fitability. It is the ratio of Net Debt to EBITDA (as de/fined)* and is calculated on page 215.\n\nEBITDA (as de/fined)* Net Interest Cover. EBITDA (as de/fined)* Net Interest Cover is used by management as a measure which matches the earnings and cash generated by the business to the underlying funding costs. EBITDA (as de/fined)* Net Interest Cover is presented to provide investors with a greater understanding of the impact of CRH's debt and /financing arrangements. It is the ratio of EBITDA (as de/fined)* to Net Interest and is calculated on page 215.\n\nRONA. Return on Net Assets is a key internal pre-tax and pre-non-cash impairment measure of operating performance throughout the CRH Group and can be used by management and investors to measure the relative use of assets between CRH's business segments and to compare to other businesses. The metric measures management's ability to generate pro/fits from the net assets required to support that business, focusing on both pro/fit maximisation and the maintenance of an ef/ficient asset base; it encourages effective /fixed asset maintenance programmes, good decisions regarding expenditure on property, plant and equipment and the timely disposal of surplus assets,\n\nand also supports the effective management of the Group's working capital base. RONA is calculated by expressing total Group operating pro/fit excluding non-cash impairment charges 1 as a percentage of average net assets. Net assets comprise total assets by segment (including assets held for sale) less total liabilities by segment (excluding lease liabilities and including liabilities associated with assets classi/fied as held for sale) as shown on page 214 and detailed in note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and excludes equity accounted investments and other /financial assets, net debt (as previously de/fined) and tax assets & liabilities. The average net assets for the year is the simple average of the opening and closing balance sheet /figures.\n\nOrganic Revenue, Organic Operating Pro/fit and Organic EBITDA (as de/fined)*. CRH pursues a strategy of growth through acquisitions and investments, with $406 million spent on acquisitions and investments in 2020 (2019: $813 million). Acquisitions completed in 2019 and 2020 contributed incremental sales revenue of $368 million, operating pro/fit of $32 million and EBITDA (as de/fined)* of $65/uni00A0million in 2020. Cash proceeds from divestments and non-current asset disposals amounted to $307 million (net of cash disposed and including deferred consideration proceeds in respect of prior year divestments) (2019: $2,343 million).

        "page_content": "activities in 2020 was a negative $413 million and the impact at an operating pro/fit and EBITDA (as de/fined)* level was a negative $14 million and $33/uni00A0million respectively.\n\nThe US Dollar weakened against most major currencies during 2020 resulting in the average US Dollar/euro rate strengthening from 0.8933 in 2019 to 0.8771 in 2020 and the Pound Sterling strengthening from an average 0.7841 in 2019 to 0.7798 in 2020. Overall currency movements resulted in a favourable net foreign currency translation impact on our results as shown on the table on page 33.\n\nBecause of the impact of acquisitions, divestments, exchange translation and other non-recurring items on reported results each year, the Group uses organic revenue, organic operating pro/fit and organic EBITDA (as de/fined)* as additional performance indicators to assess performance of pre-existing (also referred to as underlying, heritage, like-for-like or ongoing) operations each year.\n\nOrganic revenue, organic operating pro/fit and organic EBITDA (as de/fined)* are arrived at by excluding the incremental revenue, operating pro/fit and EBITDA (as de/fined)* contributions from current and prior year acquisitions and divestments, the impact of exchange translation and the impact of any non-recurring items. In the Business Performance section on pages 38 to 51, changes in organic revenue, organic operating pro/fit and organic EBITDA (as de/fined)* are presented as additional measures of revenue, operating pro/fit and EBITDA (as de/fined)* to provide a greater understanding of the performance of the Group. Organic change % is calculated by expressing the organic movement as a percentage of the prior year (adjusted for exchange effects). A reconciliation of the changes in organic revenue, organic operating pro/fit and organic EBITDA (as de/fined)* to the changes in total\n\nrevenue, operating pro/fit and EBITDA (as de/fined)* for the Group and by segment, is presented with the discussion of each segment's performance in tables contained in the segment discussion commencing on page 30.\n\nRevenue from continuing and discontinued operations, EBITDA (as de/fined)* from continuing and discontinued operations and Operating Pro/fit from continuing and discontinued operations. As detailed in note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, our Europe Distribution and our Americas Distribution businesses have been classi/fied as discontinued operations in accordance with IFRS 5. In certain instances throughout the Annual Report and Form 20-F we refer to revenue, EBITDA (as de/fined)* and operating pro/fit from continuing and discontinued operations. Information presented on this basis is useful to investors as (i) it provides further understanding of the Group's performance and (ii) assists investors in the comparison of the Group's performance with that of other companies. A reconciliation of each of these measures is detailed in note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and on page 213.\n\nCash paid to Shareholders. Cash paid to shareholders is a measure of cash returned to shareholders representing dividends of $0.7 billion (2019: $0.7 billion) paid during the year and excess cash of $0.2 billion (2019: $0.9 billion) returned through the share buyback programme. The metric provides information on dividend growth for shareholders and is re/flective of CRH's continued commitment to return excess cash to shareholders. CRH monitors the cash paid to shareholders as part of its overall capital allocation strategy.\n\nTotal Shareholder Return (TSR). TSR is a measure of shareholder returns delivery through the cycle. It represents the total accumulated value delivered to\n\nshareholders since the formation of the Group in 1970 (via gross dividends reinvested and share appreciation) and is calculated on page 215. The metric provides information on total returns for shareholders and is provided to assist investors in the comparison of the Group's performance with that of other companies.\n\nPro/fit after Tax (Pre-impairment) . Pro/fit after Tax pre-impairment as calculated on page 216 is a measure of the Group's pro/fitability from continuing operations excluding any non-cash impairment charges and the related tax impact of such impairments. Pro/fit after Tax presented on a pre-impairment basis is used by management to evaluate the Group's pro/fitability in a given year and is useful to investors as it (i) provides an understanding of the Group's underlying performance and (ii) assists investors in the comparison of the Group's performance with that of other companies.\n\nEarnings per Share (Pre-impairment). Earnings per Share (EPS) pre-impairment is a measure of the Group's pro/fitability per share from continuing operations excluding any non-cash impairment charges and the related tax impact of such impairments. It is used by management to evaluate the Group's underlying pro/fitability performance relative to that of other companies and its own past performance. EPS information presented on a pre-impairment basis is useful to investors as it (i) provides an insight into the Group's underlying performance and pro/fitability and (ii) assists investors in the comparison of the Group's performance with that of other companies. EPS pre-impairment is calculated on page 216 as pro/fit attributable to the ordinary equity holders of the Company from continuing operations excluding any non-cash impairment charges (and the related tax impact of such impairments) divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMoistureShield \u00ae , a division of Oldcastle APG within CRH's Building Products Division, launched Cold Brew, a new part of its capped composite decking line in 2020.

The technique used measures the estimated impact on pro/fit before tax and on total equity arising on net year-end /floating rate debt and on year-end equity, based on either an\n\nincrease/decrease of 1% in /floating interest rates or a 5% strengthening/weakening in the US Dollar/euro exchange rate. The US Dollar/euro rate has been selected for this sensitivity analysis given the materiality of the Group's activities in euro. This analysis, set out in note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, is for illustrative purposes only as in practice interest and foreign exchange rates rarely change in isolation.\n\nQuantitative and qualitative information and sensitivity analysis of market risk is contained in notes 23 to 27 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\nCRH does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on CRH's /financial condition, changes in /financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.",

The clinker (the key intermediate product in the manufacture of cement) capacity for these locations is set out in the table below. Further details on locations and products manufactured are provided on pages 258 and 259. None of CRH's individual properties is of material signi/ficance to the Group.\n\nCRH believes that all the facilities are in good condition, adequate for their purpose and suitably utilised according to the individual nature and\n\nrequirements of the relevant operations. CRH has a continuing programme of improvements and replacements to properties when considered appropriate to meet the needs of the individual operations.

Subsequent to acquisition, estimates are typically updated by company engineers and/or geologists and are reviewed annually by corporate and/or divisional staff. However, where deemed appropriate by management, in the context of large or strategically important deposits, the services of third-party consultant geologists and/or engineers may be employed to validate reserves quantities outside of the aforementioned due diligence framework on an ongoing basis.\n\nThe Group has not employed third-parties to review reserves over the three-year period ending 31 December 2020 other than in business combination activities and speci/fic instances where such a review was warranted.\n\nReserve estimates are subject to annual review by each of the relevant operating entities across the Group. The estimation process distinguishes between owned and leased reserves segregated into permitted and unpermitted as appropriate and includes only those permitted reserves which are proven and probable. The term 'permitted' reserves refers to those tonnages which could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination. Permitted owned reserve estimates are based on estimated recoverable tonnes whilst permitted leased reserve estimates are based on estimated total recoverable tonnes which may be extracted over the term of the lease contract.\n\nProven and probable reserve estimates are based on recoverable tonnes only and are thus stated net of estimated production losses and other matters factored into the computation (e.g. required slopes/ benches). In order for reserves to qualify for inclusion in the 'proven and probable' category, the following conditions must be satis/fied:\n\n- \u00b7 the reserves must be homogeneous deposits based on drill data and/or local geology; and\n- \u00b7 the deposits must be located on owned land or on land subject to lease\n\nNone of CRH's mineral-bearing properties is individually material to the Group.",

If any of these risks occur, the Group's business, /financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected.\n\nThe risk factors listed below should be considered in connection with any forward-looking statements in this Annual Report and Form 20-F and the\n\ncautionary statements contained in Corporate Governance - Disclaimer/Forward-Looking Statements on page 101.\n\nThe risk factors presented below are reviewed on an annual basis and represent the key risk factors faced by the Group at the time of compilation of the 2020 Annual Report and Form 20-F.

The Group may also be negatively impacted by unfavourable swings in fuel and other commodity/raw material prices.\n\n## Impact:\n\nFailure to predict and plan for cyclical events or adverse economic conditions could negatively impact /financial performance.\n\nThe Group's operating and /financial performance is in/fluenced by general economic conditions and the state of infrastructure, residential and non-residential sectors in the countries in which it operates.\n\nIn general, economic uncertainty exacerbates negative trends in construction activity leading to postponement of orders. Construction markets are inherently cyclical and are affected by many factors that are beyond the Group's control, including:\n\n- \u00b7 The performance of the national economies in the countries in which the Group operates, across Europe, the Americas and Asia;\n- \u00b7 Monetary policies in the countries in which the Group operates - for example, an increase in interest rates typically reduces the volume of mortgage borrowings thus adversely impacting residential construction activity;\n- \u00b7 The level of demand for building materials and services, with sustained adverse weather conditions leading to potential disruptions or curtailments in outdoor construction activity; and\n- \u00b7 The price of fuel and principal energy-related raw materials such as bitumen and steel (which accounted for approximately 9% of annual Group sales revenues in 2020 (11% in 2019))\n\nThe adequacy and timeliness of the actions taken by the Group's management team are of critical importance in maintaining /financial performance at appropriate levels. There is no guarantee that any future actions taken by Group management will be effective in managing these risks. Each of the above factors could have a material adverse effect on the Group's operating results and the market price of CRH plc's Ordinary Shares.\n\nattributable to changes in markets, regulatory environments and other factors and existing risk factors may become less relevant.\n\nThe Risk Factors have been grouped to focus on key strategic, operational, compliance and /financial and reporting risks.\n\n223",

In addition, situations may arise where the Group  may be liable for the past acts, omissions or liabilities of companies acquired, or may remain liable in cases of  divestment; for example, the potential environmental liabilities addressed under the Sustainability and Corporate  Social Responsibility Risk Factor on page 228. |\n\n## Public Policies and Geopolitics\n\n| Risk                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Discussion                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Description: Adverse public policy, economic, social and political  situations in any country in which the Group operates  could lead to a fall in demand for the Group's  products, business interruption, restrictions on  repatriation of earnings or a loss of plant access. Impact: Changes in these conditions may adversely affect  the Group's business, results of operations, /financial  condition or prospects. | Our markets and demand for the Group's products is in/fluenced by public policy and the /fiscal ability and  investment strategy of local and national governments in the jurisdictions in which we operate. The allocation  of government funding for public infrastructure programmes is a key driver for our markets, such as the  development of highways in the US under the Fixing Americas Surface Transportation Act (FAST Act), which  has been extended to September 2021. COVID-19 restrictions and lockdowns increase the demand for  government social expenditure, while having a dampening effect on the receipt of taxes. Any signi/ficant local  and national government budget de/ficits, exacerbated by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, might result in  a reduction in the investment made by local and national governments in infrastructure spending, thus reducing  the demand for the Group's products. Similarly, any signi/ficant change in investment strategy by policy makers  in any of the Group's key markets could reduce addressable market demand, adversely impacting /financial  performance. |\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | The Group currently operates mainly in Western Europe and North America as well as, to a lesser degree, in  developing countries/emerging markets in Eastern Europe, the Philippines and China.

Operational productivity and demand for the Group's products may be reduced during these weather events leading to reduced /financial performance\n\n## Transition Risks including:\n\n- \u00b7 Technology: The failure to leverage innovation arising from technological advances related to carbon ef/ficiencies in products and processes may increase operational costs, shorten product life cycles or give rise to early product obsolescence, thus impairing /financial performance and/or future value creation\n- \u00b7 Legal & Regulatory: Efforts to address climate change through laws and regulations, for example by requiring reductions in emissions of GHGs such as CO 2 , can create economic risks and uncertainties for the Group's businesses. Such risks could include the cost of purchasing allowances or credits to meet GHG emissions caps, the cost of installing equipment to reduce emissions to comply with GHG limits or required technological standards, decreased pro/fits or losses arising from decreased demand for the Group's goods and higher production costs resulting directly or indirectly from the imposition of legislative or regulatory controls. Manifestation of these increased costs may increase the underlying cost of production of the Group's products which may adversely impact the /financial performance of the Group\n- \u00b7 Market & Reputation: Stakeholder expectations in relation to climate change continue to increase. The Group is subject to a broad range of additional environmental product information requests by customers in certain regions and increasing levels of disclosure regarding climate-related environmental performance from /financial institutions, investors and other interested stakeholders. The Group includes within its offerings products aimed at climate adaptation, including sustainable drainage systems, /flood defences and more resilient structures, as well as products that lower the operational carbon footprint of buildings, including high performance glass and glazing products that incorporate innovative thermal break technologies for superior thermal performance, precast concrete /flooring and walling elements delivering energy savings, and balcony connector products that reduce thermal bridging, delivering energy saving. If customers' and other stakeholders' sustainability expectations are not satis/fied, the Group's product portfolio may be of reduced relevance due to weakened customer demand, the Group's reputation may be harmed through not meeting investor expectations, and the Group could experience a deterioration in /financial performance, such as increased cost of capital\n\nThe Group continues to be exposed to costs related to carbon emissions trading schemes. While these costs do not currently have a material /financial impact, there can be no assurances that more extensive carbon cost mechanisms may be introduced that could potentially impact the Group's /financial performance. Further, the Group continues to engage with stakeholders to fully understand their expectations in relation to climate change. However, it is recognised that expectations continue to evolve rapidly and the Group cannot guarantee that all stakeholders' expectations will continue to be met.\n\nPlease refer to page 234 of this Annual Report and Form 20-F for further details.

Further, the Group is subject to stringent regulations  from a health and safety perspective in the various  jurisdictions in which it operates.   | The Group's industry involves dangerous work and a failure to maintain the focus on making its workplaces safe  for our people could result in a deterioration in the Group's safety performance and ultimately fatalities. Building  materials production can be hazardous and particular hazards are associated with heavy vehicles, working at  height and using mechanised processes. Additionally, the Group's safety risks are not limited to facility sites but  extend to paving and construction sites and regular encounters with stakeholder sites. This presents a complex  challenge which requires safe behaviours and engagement from employees that match the Group's robust  policies and procedures.   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Impact:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| A serious health and safety incident could have  a signi/ficant impact on the Group's operational  and /financial performance, as well as the Group's  reputation.                                                                                                      | The Group is subject to a broad and stringent range of existing and evolving laws, regulations, standards  and best practices with respect to health and safety in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates.

Customers, from architects and construction companies to public bodies, have an immediate need for sustainable solutions which respond to climate change. In order to be involved in the green agenda, the Group needs to work with customers and vendors to innovate around design, delivery and application of products. If the Group fails to identify and execute on areas for improved sustainable performance, the demand for the Group's products may fall. If customers' and other stakeholders' sustainability expectations are not satis/fied, the Group's product portfolio will be of reduced relevance and the Group will experience a deterioration in /financial performance.\n\nThe Group is subject to a broad and increasingly stringent range of existing and evolving laws, regulations, standards and best practices with respect to governance, the environment and social performance in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates giving rise to signi/ficant compliance costs, potential legal liability exposure and potential obligations for the development of its operations. These laws, regulations, standards and best practices relate to, amongst other things, climate change, noise, emissions to air, water and soil, the use and handling of hazardous materials and waste disposal practices.\n\nPlease refer to pages 20 to 25 of this Annual Report and Form 20-F for further details.

In addition, the Group's future effective income tax rate could be affected (positively or negatively) by                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Finally, changes to international tax principles, for example at an EU level, could adversely affect the Group's  effective tax rate or result in higher cash tax liabilities. If the Group's effective income tax rate was to increase, its  cash /flows, /financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n\n## De/fined Bene/fit Pension Schemes and Related Obligations\n\n## Risk\n\n## Discussion\n\n## Description:\n\nThe assets and liabilities of de/fined bene/fit pension schemes, in place in certain operating jurisdictions, may exhibit signi/ficant period-on-period volatility attributable primarily to asset values, changes in bond yields/discount rates and anticipated longevity.\n\n## Impact:\n\nSigni/ficant cash contributions may be required to remediate de/ficits applicable to past service. Fluctuations in the accounting surplus/de/ficit may adversely impact the Group's credit metrics thus harming its ability to raise funds.\n\nThe assumptions used in the recognition of pension assets, liabilities, income and expenses (including discount rates, rate of increase in future compensation levels, mortality rates and healthcare cost trend rates) are updated based on market and economic conditions at the respective balance sheet date and for any relevant changes to the terms and conditions of the pension and post-retirement plans. These assumptions can be affected by (i) the discount rate or changes in the rates of return on high-quality /fixed income investments; (ii) future compensation levels, future labour market conditions and anticipated in/flation; (iii) mortality rates, changes in the relevant actuarial funding valuations or changes in best practice; and (iv) healthcare cost trend rates or the rate of medical cost in/flation in the relevant regions. The weighted average actuarial assumptions used and sensitivity analysis in relation to the signi/ficant assumptions employed in the determination of pension and other post-retirement liabilities are disclosed in note 30 to the Consolidation Financial Statements on pages 191 to 196. A prolonged period of /financial market instability or other adverse changes in the assumptions mentioned above would have an adverse impact on the valuations of pension scheme assets.\n\n## Foreign Currency Translation\n\n| Risk                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Discussion                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Description: The principal foreign exchange risks to which the  Consolidated Financial Statements are exposed  pertain to (i) adverse movements in reported results  when translated into the reporting currency; and  (ii) declines in the reporting currency value of net  investments which are denominated in a wide basket  of currencies other than the reporting currency. Impact: Adverse changes in the exchange rates will continue  to negatively affect retained earnings. The annual | Effective 1 January 2020, the Group changed reporting currency from euro to US Dollar.

In common with companies listed on the LSE and Euronext Dublin, CRH's corporate governance practices re/flect, inter alia, compliance with (a) domestic company law; (b) the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority and Euronext Dublin; and (c) the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code, which is appended to the listing rules of the LSE and Euronext Dublin.\n\nThe Board of CRH has adopted a robust set of governance principles, which re/flect the Code and its principles-based approach to corporate governance. Accordingly, the way in which CRH makes determinations of Directors' independence differs from the NYSE rules. The Board has determined that, in its judgement, all of the non-executive Directors are independent. In doing so the Board did not explicitly take into consideration the independence requirements outlined in the NYSE's listing standards.\n\nHowever, the Board has determined that all of the non-executive Directors on the Audit Committee are independent according to the requirements of Rule 10A-3 of the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Further, CRH considers that the Terms of Reference for its Audit Committee, Remuneration Committee, Nomination and Corporate Governance Committee are generally responsive to the relevant NYSE rules, but may not address all aspects of such rules.\n\n## Shareholder Approval of Equity Compensation Plans\n\nThe NYSE rules require that shareholders must be given the opportunity to vote on all equity-compensation plans and material revisions to those plans with certain limited exceptions. CRH complies with Irish requirements, which are similar to the NYSE rules. The Board, however, does not explicitly take into consideration the NYSE's detailed de/finition on what are considered 'material revisions'.\n\n## Risk Management and Internal Control\n\nThe Board has delegated responsibility for monitoring the effectiveness of the Group's risk management and internal control systems to the Audit Committee 1 . Such systems are designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and, in the case of internal control systems, can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared subject to oversight and control of the Finance Director, who seeks to ensure that data is captured from Group locations and all required information for disclosure in the Consolidated Financial Statements is provided. An appropriate control framework has been put in place around the recording of appropriate consolidation journals and other adjustments. The Consolidated Financial Statements are reviewed by the internal CRH Financial Reporting and Disclosure Group prior to being reviewed by the Finance Director and Audit Committee and approved by the Board of Directors.\n\nGroup management has responsibility for major strategic development and /financing decisions. Responsibility for operational issues is devolved, subject to limits of authority, to product group and operating company management. Management at all levels is responsible for internal control over the business functions that have been delegated. This embedding of the system of internal control throughout the Group's operations is designed to enable the organisation to respond quickly to evolving business risks, and to ensure that signi/ficant internal control issues, should they arise, are reported promptly to appropriate levels of management.\n\n## Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of Rule 13a-15 of the US Securities Exchange Act, the following report is provided by management in respect of the Company's internal control over /financial reporting. As de/fined by the SEC, internal control over /financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company's principal executive and principal /financial of/ficers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the Company's Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of /financial reporting and the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:\n\n- \u00b7  pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly re/flect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;\n- \u00b7   provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and Directors of the Company; and\n- \u00b7  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over /financial reporting as de/fined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the US Securities Exchange Act. Our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of /financial reporting and the preparation of our Company's published Consolidated Financial Statements for external purposes under generally accepted accounting principles.\n\nIn connection with the preparation of the Company's annual Consolidated Financial Statements, management has undertaken an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over /financial reporting as of 31 December 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organisations of the Treadway Commission.",

        "page_content": "As permitted by the SEC, based on the quantitative and qualitative risk factors of our acquisitions in 2020, the Company has elected to exclude an assessment of the internal controls of acquired business combinations for the year 2020. Acquisitions, which are listed in note 32 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, constituted 0.5% and 1.0% of total and net assets respectively, as of 31 December 2020 and 0.4% and 0.6% of revenue and Group pro/fit, respectively, for the /financial year then ended.\n\nManagement's assessment included an evaluation of the design of the Company's internal control over /financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of those controls. Based on this assessment, management has concluded and hereby reports that as of 31 December 2020, the Company's internal control over /financial reporting is effective.\n\nOur auditors, Deloitte, a registered public accounting /firm, who have audited the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2020, have audited the effectiveness of the Company's internal controls over /financial reporting. Their report, on which an unquali/fied opinion is expressed thereon, is included on page 130.\n\n## Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nDuring 2020, there has been no change in our internal control over /financial reporting identi/fied in connection with the evaluation required by Rules 13a-15 that occurred during the period covered by this Annual Report and Form 20-F that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over /financial reporting.\n\nAcquisitions excluded from the 2019 assessment of internal control over /financial reporting were all successfully integrated into the CRH internal control systems in 2020.\n\n## Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\n\nManagement has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the disclosure controls and procedures as de/fined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e) as of 31 December 2020. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive and the Finance Director have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of such date at the level of providing reasonable assurance.\n\nIn designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management, including the Chief Executive and the Finance Director, recognised that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgement in evaluating the cost-bene/fit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.\n\n233",

In Europe, operations are subject to national environmental laws and regulations, most of which now emanate from European Union Directives and Regulations. In North America, operations may be subject to federal, state, provincial and local environmental laws and regulations. In other jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom, national environmental and local laws apply.\n\n## Environmental Compliance Policy\n\nIn order to comply with environmental regulations and address environmental risks and opportunities, CRH has developed an environmental policy. The statement of policy, applied across all Group companies, is to:\n\n- \u00b7  address proactively the challenges of climate change, reduce emissions and waste as well as optimise our use of energy, water, land and other resources;\n- \u00b7  promote sustainable product and process innovation and new business opportunities;\n- \u00b7  support and enhance biodiversity, ensuring responsible land use and biodiversity management;\n- \u00b7  comply with or exceed all applicable environmental legislation and continually implement and improve our environmental management systems, always striving to meet or exceed industry best practice standards, monitoring and reporting performance;\n- \u00b7  maintain open communications and ensure that our employees and contractors are aware of and adhere to their environmental responsibilities; and\n- \u00b7  maintain positive relationships with stakeholders through engagement and consultation, always striving to be good neighbours in every community in which we operate\n\n## Environmental Management and Governance\n\nAchieving the Group's environmental policy objectives at all locations is a management imperative. At Board level there is a dedicated Safety, Environment & Social Responsibility (SESR) Committee.\n\nOverseen by the Board, the Group Chief Executive has overall responsibility for CRH's sustainability performance and for ensuring sustainability policies are implemented in all business lines.\n\nDaily responsibility for ensuring that the Group's environmental policy is effectively implemented lies with individual location managers, assisted by a network of Group environmental specialists.\n\nAt each year end, the Group Sustainability function carries out a detailed assessment of Group environmental performance, which is reviewed by the SESR Committee and the Board.\n\n## Addressing Climate Change\n\nCRH has evaluated the risks associated with climate change, including physical and transitional risks, together with opportunities arising from the transition to a low-carbon economy. A management strategy has been put in place to address these risks and opportunities. This focuses on reducing the carbon footprint of products during manufacture as well as contributing to reducing the lifetime emissions from the built environment. For example, CRH includes within its offerings multiple products aimed at climate adaptation and mitigation, including sustainable drainage systems, concrete products used in /flood defence systems, products contributing to more resilient structures as well as products with high levels of recycled content, such as recycled asphalt pavement (RAP). In delivering this management strategy, CRH reduces carbon emissions and energy usage, achieves /financial ef/ficiencies, and, in addition, helps to address the global challenge of climate change.\n\nCRH has developed an ambition to achieve carbon neutrality along the cement and concrete value chain by 2050. Having achieved its 2020 CO 2 reduction commitment, CRH committed to a target of <520kg CO 2 /tonnes of cementitious product by 2030, covering the portfolio of cement plants owned by CRH in 2019. This target represents a 33% reduction in speci/fic net cement CO 2 compared with 1990 levels. CRH's carbon reduction roadmap is a science-based target that has been independently veri/fied using Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) methodologies to be in line with the Paris Agreement objectives at a 2\u00b0C scenario.\n\nIn order to meet its target, CRH has implemented capital expenditure programmes in its cement operations to reduce carbon emissions in the context of international and national commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as well as CRH's own emission reduction programme and targets discussed above. In regions and countries where trading schemes are in operation, facilities that fall within this scope of this legislation comply with CO 2 'cap and trade' schemes, including the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme and other regional schemes.\n\nCRH continues to be a member of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) and is a founding member of the Global Cement and Concrete Association (GCCA), which is dedicated to developing and strengthening the sector's contribution to sustainable construction.\n\nThrough its membership of the GCCA, WBCSD and various regional industry associations, CRH is actively involved in global and regional discussions on the climate change agenda.\n\nThe European Union aims to be climate-neutral, where there are no net emissions of greenhouse gases, by 2050. During 2020 European Union leaders agreed to a more ambitious emissions reduction target of 55% by 2030, compared to 1990. While CRH has a plan to address carbon emissions reductions to 2030 in the context of existing legislation, achieving further reductions would represent a signi/ficant extra constraint on cement operations in Europe.\n\nCRH operations in the US are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations addressing climate change. Ultimately more comprehensive 'cap and trade' schemes or other emission reduction legislation may be implemented in the US and Canada; depending on the scope of the legislation, this could signi/ficantly impact certain operations in North America. CRH continuously monitors developments in regulations and greenhouse gas initiatives involving local, provincial, state or federal governments. As of 19 February 2021, the Group is not aware of any such schemes that would materially affect its US operations.\n\n## Possible Environmental Liabilities\n\nAt 19 February 2021, there were no pending legal proceedings relating to site remediation which are anticipated to have a material adverse effect on the /financial position or results of operations or liquidity of the Group, nor have internal reviews revealed any situations of likely material environmental liability to the Group.\n\n## Governmental Policies\n\nThe overall level of government capital expenditures and the allocation by state entities of available funds to different projects, as well as interest rate and tax policies, directly affect the overall levels of construction activity. The terms and general availability of government permits required to conduct Group business also has an impact on the scope of Group operations. As a result such governmental decisions and policies can have a signi/ficant impact on the operating results of the Group.",

Other currencies referred to in this Annual Report and Form 20-F include Polish Zloty (PLN), Swiss Franc (CHF), Canadian Dollar (CAD), Chinese Renminbi (RMB), Indian Rupee (INR), Ukrainian Hryvnia (UAH), Philippine Peso (PHP), Romanian Leu (RON) and Serbian Dinar (RSD).\n\nFor a discussion on the effects of exchange rate /fluctuations on the /financial condition and results of the operations of the Group, see the Business Performance section beginning on page 30.\n\n## Legal Proceedings\n\nGroup companies are parties to various legal proceedings, including some in which claims for damages have been asserted against the companies. Having taken appropriate advice, we believe that the aggregate outcome of such proceedings will not have a material effect on the Group's /financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\n\n## Research and Development\n\nCRH is engaged in ongoing initiatives that advance its business as part of its relentless focus on continuous improvement. One of these areas is research and development, where such costs are not material in the context of the Consolidated Income Statement. CRH's policy is to expense such costs as they occur.\n\n## Employees\n\nThe average number of employees for the past three /financial years is disclosed in note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 155. No signi/ficant industrial disputes have occurred at any of CRH's factories or plants during the past /five years. The Group believes that relations with its employees and labour unions are satisfactory.\n\n## Seasonality\n\nActivity in the construction industry is characterised by cyclicality and is dependent to a considerable extent on the seasonal impact of weather in CRH's operating locations, with activity in some markets reduced signi/ficantly in winter due to inclement weather. First-half sales from continuing operations accounted for 44% of full-year 2020 (2019: 46%), while EBITDA (as de/fined)* from continuing operations for the /first six months of 2020 represented 34% of the full-year out-turn (2019: 36%).\n\n## Signi/ficant Changes\n\nNo signi/ficant changes have occurred since the balance sheet date.\n\n## Latest Practical Information\n\nWhere referenced in the Supplementary 20-F Disclosures and Shareholder Information sections, information is provided at the latest practicable date, 19 February 2021.\n\n235",

As it is essential for the Company that electronic settlement of trading of its shares can continue on the LSE and on Euronext Dublin, shareholder approval was obtained at an EGM held on 9 February 2021 for the migration of the Company's shares from the CREST system to the CSD system operated by Euroclear Bank.",

Dividends are paid to shareholders on the Register of Members on the record date for the dividend. Record dates are set in accordance with the rules of the LSE and Euronext Dublin. An interim dividend is normally declared by the Board of Directors in August of each year and is generally paid in September/October. A /final dividend is normally recommended by the Board of Directors following the end of the /fiscal year to which it relates and, if approved by the shareholders at an AGM, is generally paid in April/May of that year.\n\nThe payment of future cash dividends will be dependent upon future earnings, the /financial condition of the Group and other factors.\n\nThe below table sets forth the amounts of interim, /final and total dividends declared in US cents (2020) and euro cent (2016-2019) per Ordinary Share in respect of each /fiscal year indicated. Solely for the convenience of the reader, dividends declared in the years 2016-2019 have been translated into US cents per Ordinary Share at the dividend record date exchange rate. An interim dividend of 22.00 US cents was paid in respect of Ordinary Shares on 25 September 2020. The /final dividend, if approved at the forthcoming AGM of shareholders to be held on 29 April 2021, will be paid on 5 May 2021 to shareholders on the Register of Members as at the close of business on 19 March 2021 and will bring the full-year dividend for 2020 to 115.0 US cents.\n\nDividend Withholding Tax (DWT) must be deducted from dividends paid by an Irish resident company, unless a shareholder is entitled to an exemption and has submitted a properly completed exemption form to the Company's Registrars, Link Registrars Limited (the 'Registrars'). DWT applies to dividends paid by way of cash or by way of shares under a scrip dividend scheme and is deducted at the standard rate of Income Tax (25%). Non-resident shareholders located in countries with a double tax treaty with Ireland and certain Irish companies, trusts, pension schemes, investment undertakings and charities may be entitled to claim exemption from DWT. Copies of the exemption form may be obtained from the Registrars. Shareholders should\n\nnote that DWT will be deducted from dividends in cases where a properly completed form has not been received by the speci/fied deadline noti/fied when a dividend is announced. Individuals who are resident in the Republic of Ireland for tax purposes are not entitled to an exemption. If shares are held via Euroclear Bank or CREST, the owners of the shares will need to contact the intermediary through whom the shares are held in order to arrange for the submission of the completed form.\n\nShareholders holding Ordinary Shares in certi/ficated form who wish to have their dividend paid direct to their bank account, by electronic funds transfer, can do so by logging on to www.signalshares.com, selecting CRH plc and registering for the share portal (the 'Share Portal'). Shareholders should note that they will need to have their Investor Code (found on their share certi/ficate), and follow the instructions online to register.\n\nAlternatively such shareholders can complete a paper dividend mandate form and submit it to the Registrars. A copy of the form can be obtained on the Registrar's Share Portal or can be requested directly from the Registrars. Tax vouchers will continue to be sent to the shareholder's registered address under this arrangement.\n\nIf shares are held via Euroclear Bank or CREST, the dividend will be paid by the Company in accordance with the instructions received from Euroclear Bank.\n\nSection 5 of the Euroclear Terms and Conditions governing use of the Euroclear system provides that income/dividends received by Euroclear Bank will be distributed pro-rata to the holders of the relevant securities (i.e. the relevant EB Participants). Further details on the process of collection, distribution and payment of dividends are provided for in section 5.3 of the EB Operating Procedures, with reference to the Online Market Guides for market speci/fic operational elements (currently the EB Service Description). All material information regarding the manner in which receipt of dividends and participation in corporate actions is processed is described in section 5 of the EB Services Description- (Version 4) - Custody - Income and\n\nCorporate Actions. The owners of the shares held via Euroclear Bank or CREST will need to contact the intermediary through whom the shares are held in order to arrange for the onward payment of the dividend to them.\n\nOn 22 January 2021, EUI announced that by 29 March 2021 it expects to have in place new arrangements for how settlement banks provide their euro liquidity to EUI. In the same announcement, EUI con/firmed that these arrangements will not impact how CREST participants instruct euro settlements nor the settlement process itself. In the announcement, EUI con/firmed that it expects to publish details of the new euro settlement arrangements in the coming weeks. CREST participants are encouraged to speak to their settlement banks (who are fully aware of these changes) to consider what (if any) impact the new arrangements will have on their euro settlement activity with them.\n\nTo re/flect the change in reporting currency from euro to US Dollar with effect from 1 January 2020, the 2020 interim dividend and all future dividends are declared in US Dollar. However, they are generally paid in euro. In order to avoid costs to shareholders, dividends are paid in Pound Sterling and US Dollar to shareholders whose shares are held in certi/ficated form (see page 239) and whose address, according to the Share Register, is in the UK and the US respectively, unless they require otherwise. In respect of the 2020 /final dividend, the latest date for receipt of currency elections is 31 March 2021. Where shares are held in the Euroclear Bank system, dividends are automatically paid in euro unless a currency election is made.\n\nInvestors holding CREST Depositary Interests ('CDI's) should refer to the CREST International Service Description for information on currency elections in respect of CDIs.\n\nDividends in respect of 7% 'A' Cumulative Preference Shares are paid half-yearly on 5 April and 5 October. Dividends in respect of 5% Cumulative Preference Shares are paid half-yearly on 15 April and 15 October.\n\n|                         |                              |                              |                              | US cents per Ordinary Share      | US cents per Ordinary Share      | US cents per Ordinary Share      |\n|-------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Year ended 31 December  |                              |                              |                              | Interim                          | Final                            | Total                            |\n| 2020                    |                              |                              |                              | 22.00                            | 93.00 (i)                        | 115.0                            |\n|                         | euro cent per Ordinary Share | euro cent per Ordinary Share | euro cent per Ordinary Share | US cents per Ordinary Share (ii) | US cents per Ordinary Share (ii) | US cents per Ordinary Share (ii) |\n| Years ended 31 December | Interim                      | Final                        | Total                        | Interim                          | Final                            | Total                            |\n| 2019                    | 20.00                        | 63.00                        | 83.00                        | 22.00                            | 70.00                            | 92.00                            |\n| 2018                    | 19.60                        | 52.40                        | 72.00                        | 22.80                            | 59.20                            | 82.00                            |\n| 2017                    | 19.20                        | 48.80                        | 68.00                        | 23.20                            | 60.00                            | 83.20                            |\n| 2016                    | 18.80                        | 46.20                        | 65.00                        | 21.20                            | 49.00                            | 70.20                            |",

        "page_content": "## Share Plans\n\nThe Group operates share option schemes, performance share plans, share participation schemes and savings-related share option schemes (the 'Schemes') for eligible employees in all regions where the regulations permit the operation of such schemes. A brief description of the Schemes is outlined below. Shares issued (whether by way of the allotment of new shares or the reissue of Treasury Shares) in connection with the Schemes rank pari passu in all respects with the existing shares in the Company.\n\n## 2010 Share Option Schemes\n\nAt the AGM held on 5 May 2010, shareholders approved the adoption of new share option schemes to replace the schemes which were approved in May 2000 (2000 share option schemes). Following the approval by shareholders of the 2014 Performance Share Plan (see below), no further awards will be granted under the 2010 Share Option Schemes. Consequently, the last award under the 2010 Share Option Schemes was made in 2013.\n\nThe 2010 Share Option Schemes were based on one tier of options with a single vesting test. The performance criteria for the 2010 Share Option Schemes was EPS-based. Vesting only occurred once an initial performance target had been reached and, thereafter, exercise was dependent on continued employment in the Group. In considering the level of vesting based on EPS performance, the Remuneration Committee also considered the overall results of the Group.\n\nSubject to the achievement of the EPS performance criteria, options may be exercised not later than ten years from the date of grant of the option, and not earlier than the expiration of three years from the date of grant. Bene/fits under the schemes are not pensionable.\n\n## 2014 Performance Share Plan\n\nThe 2014 Performance Share Plan was approved by shareholders at the AGM on 7 May 2014. It replaces the 2010 Share Option Scheme. See the 2020 Directors' Remuneration Report on page 88 for more details.\n\n## Restricted Share Plan\n\nIn 2013, the Board approved the adoption of the 2013 Restricted Share Plan. Under the rules of the 2013 Restricted Share Plan, certain senior executives (excluding executive Board Directors) can receive conditional awards of shares. As (i) executive Directors are excluded from awards and (ii) no shares are allotted or reissued to satisfy the awards, the listing rules of the LSE and Euronext Dublin do not require shareholder approval for the 2013 Restricted Share Plan.\n\n## 2010 Savings-related Share Option Schemes\n\nAt the AGM held on 5 May 2010, shareholders approved the adoption of savings-related share option schemes for the UK and Ireland (the '2010 Savings-related Share Option Schemes') to replace the 2000 Savings-related Share Option Schemes. These schemes expired in May 2020.\n\nPrior to the expiry of these schemes, all employees of a participating subsidiary in the Republic of Ireland or the UK, who had satis/fied a required qualifying period, would be invited to participate in this scheme.\n\nEligible employees who wished to participate in the scheme would enter into a savings contract with a nominated savings institution, for a three or a /five-year period, to save a maximum of \u20ac500 or Stg\u00a3500, as appropriate, per month.\n\nAt the commencement of each contract period employees would have been granted an option to acquire Ordinary Shares in the Company at an option price which is equal to the amount proposed to be saved plus the bonus payable by the nominated savings institution at the end of the savings period. The price payable for each Ordinary Share under an option could not be less than the higher of par or 75% (or in the case of the UK scheme 80%) of the market value of a share on the day the invitation to apply for the option is issued.\n\nOn completion of the savings contract, employees may use the amount saved, together with the bonus earned, to exercise the option.\n\nAt 3 March 2021, 1,648,641 Ordinary Shares have been issued 1 pursuant to the 2010 Savings-related Share Option Schemes to date.\n\nIt is proposed to seek approval from shareholders at the 2021 AGM to establish new savings-related share option schemes. The principal features of the proposed 2021 Schemes will be set out in the Circular containing the notice for the 2021 AGM. There are no material differences between the 2010 Schemes and 2021 Schemes.\n\n## Share Participation Schemes\n\nAt the AGM on 13 May 1987, shareholders approved the establishment of Share Participation Schemes for the Company, its subsidiaries and companies under its control. Directors and employees of the companies who are tax resident in Ireland and have at least one year's service may elect to participate in these Share Participation Schemes.\n\nAt 3 March 2021, 8,319,280 Ordinary Shares have been issued 1 pursuant to the Share Participation Schemes.\n\n241",

        "page_content": "## Taxation\n\nThe following summary outlines the material aspects of US federal income and Republic of Ireland tax law regarding the ownership and disposition of Ordinary Shares or ADSs. Because it is a summary, holders of Ordinary Shares or ADSs are advised to consult their tax advisors with respect to the tax consequences of their ownership or disposition. The discussion regarding US federal income tax only applies to you if you hold your shares or ADSs as capital assets for US federal income tax purposes. This discussion addresses only US federal income and Republic of Ireland taxation and does not discuss all of the tax consequences that may be relevant to you in light of your individual circumstances, including foreign, state or local tax consequences, estate and gift tax consequences, and tax consequences arising under the Medicare contribution tax on net investment income or the alternative minimum tax. This summary does not take into account the speci/fic circumstances of any particular holders (such as tax-exempt entities, certain insurance companies, broker-dealers, traders in securities that elect to mark-to-market, investors liable for alternative minimum tax, investors that actually or constructively own 10% or more of the stock of the Company (by vote or value), investors that hold Ordinary Shares or ADSs as part of a straddle or a hedging or conversion transaction, investors that hold Ordinary Shares or ADSs as part of a wash sale for tax purposes or investors whose functional currency is not the US Dollar), some of which may be subject to special rules. In addition, if a partnership holds the Ordinary Shares or ADSs, the US federal income tax treatment of a partner will generally depend on the status of the partner and the tax treatment of the partnership and may not be described fully below. Holders of Ordinary Shares or ADSs are advised to consult their tax advisors with respect to US federal, state and local, Republic of Ireland and other tax consequences of owning and disposing of Ordinary Shares and ADSs in their particular circumstances, and in particular whether they are eligible for the bene/fits of the Income Tax Treaty (as de/fined below) in respect of their investment in the Ordinary Shares or ADSs.\n\nThe statements regarding US and Irish laws set forth below are based, in part, on representations of the Depositary and assume that each obligation in the Deposit Agreement and any related agreement will be performed in accordance with their terms.\n\nThis section is based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, its legislative history, existing and proposed US Treasury regulations, published rulings and court decisions, and the laws of the Republic of Ireland all as currently in effect, as well as the Convention between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of Ireland for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes\n\non Income and Capital Gains (the 'Income Tax Treaty'). These laws are subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis.\n\nIn general, holders of ADSs will be treated as the owners of Ordinary Shares represented thereby for the purposes of the Income Tax Treaty and for US federal income tax purposes. Exchanges of Ordinary Shares for ADSs, and ADSs for Ordinary Shares, generally will not be subject to US federal income or Irish tax.\n\nAs used herein, the term 'US holder' means a bene/ficial owner of an Ordinary Share or ADS who, for US federal income tax purposes: (i) is a US citizen or resident, a US corporation, an estate whose income is subject to US federal income tax regardless of its source, or a trust if a US court can exercise primary supervision over the trust's administration and one or more US persons are authorised to control all substantial decisions of the trust, and (ii) is not a resident of, or ordinarily resident in, the Republic of Ireland for purposes of Irish taxes.\n\n## Taxation of Dividends Paid to US Holders\n\nUnder general Irish tax law, US holders are not liable for Irish tax on dividends received from the Company. On the payment of dividends, the Company is obliged to withhold DWT. The statutory rate during 2020 was 25% of the dividend payable. Dividends paid by the Company to a US tax resident individual will be exempt from DWT provided the following conditions are met:\n\n- 1.  the individual (who must be the bene/ficial owner) is resident for tax purposes in the US (or any country with which Ireland has a double tax treaty) and neither resident nor ordinarily resident in Ireland; and\n- 2.   the individual signs a declaration to the Company, which states that he/she is a US tax resident individual at the time of making the declaration and that he/she will notify the Company in writing when he/she no longer meets the condition in (1) above; or\n- 3.   the individual provides the Company with a certi/ficate of tax residency from the US tax authorities\n\nDividends paid by the Company to a US tax resident company (which must be the bene/ficial owner) will be exempt from DWT, provided the following conditions are met:\n\n- 1.   the recipient company is resident for tax purposes in the US (or any country with which Ireland has a double tax treaty) and not under the control, either directly or indirectly, of Irish resident persons;\n\n- 2.  the recipient company is not tax resident in Ireland; and\n- 3.   the recipient company provides a declaration to the Company, which states that it is entitled to an exemption from DWT, on the basis that it meets the condition in (1) above at the time of making the declaration, and that it will notify the Company when it no longer meets the condition in (1) above\n\nFor US federal income tax purposes, and subject to the passive foreign investment company (PFIC) rules discussed below, US holders will include in gross income the gross amount of any dividend paid by the Company out of its current or accumulated earnings and pro/fits (as determined for US federal income tax purposes) as ordinary income when the dividend is actually or constructively received by the US holder, in the case of Ordinary Shares, or by the Depositary, in the case of ADSs. Any Irish tax withheld from this dividend payment must be included in this gross amount even though the amount withheld is not in fact received. Dividends paid to non-corporate US holders that constitute quali/fied dividend income will be taxed at the preferential rates applicable to long-term capital gains provided certain holding period requirements are met. Dividends the Company pays with respect to Ordinary Shares or ADSs generally will be quali/fied dividend income.\n\nDividends paid by CRH will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction generally allowed to US corporations in respect of dividends received from other US corporations.\n\nThe amount of the dividend distribution includable in income of a US holder will be the US Dollar value of the dividends declared, regardless of whether the US holder elects to receive the payment in a currency other than US Dollars. If the US holder elects to receive the payment in a currency other than US Dollars, generally any gain or loss resulting from currency exchange /fluctuations during the period from the date the dividend payment is includable in income to the date such payment is received will be treated as ordinary income or loss and will not be eligible for the special tax rate applicable to quali/fied dividend income. Such gain or loss will generally be income or loss from sources within the US for foreign tax credit limitation purposes.\n\n243",

        "page_content": "244\n\n## Taxation - continued\n\nDistributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and pro/fits, as determined for US federal income tax purposes, will be treated as a nontaxable return of capital to the extent of the US holder's basis in the Ordinary Shares or ADSs and thereafter as capital gain. However, the Company does not calculate earnings and pro/fits in accordance with US federal income tax principles. Accordingly, US holders should expect to generally treat distributions the Company makes as dividends.\n\nFor foreign tax credit limitation purposes, dividends the Company pays with respect to Ordinary Shares or ADSs will generally be income from sources outside the US, and will, depending on your circumstances, generally be 'passive' income for purposes of computing the foreign tax credit allowable to a US holder.\n\nSubject to certain limitations, the Irish tax withheld in accordance with the Income Tax Treaty and paid over to the Republic of Ireland will be creditable or deductible against your US federal income tax liability. Special rules apply in determining the foreign tax credit limitation with respect to dividends that are subject to the preferential tax rates. Any Irish tax withheld from distributions will not be eligible for a foreign tax credit to the extent an exemption from the tax withheld is available to the US holder.\n\n## Capital Gains Tax\n\nA US holder will not be liable for Irish tax on gains realised on the sale or other disposition of Ordinary Shares or ADSs unless the Ordinary Shares or ADSs are held in connection with a trade or business carried on by such holder in the Republic of Ireland through a branch or agency. A US holder will be liable for US federal income tax on such gains in the same manner as gains from a sale or other disposition of any other shares in a company.\n\nSubject to the PFIC rules below, US holders who sell or otherwise dispose of Ordinary Shares or ADSs will recognise a capital gain or loss for US federal income tax purposes equal to the difference between the US Dollar value of the amount realised on the sale or disposition and the tax basis, determined in US Dollars, in the Ordinary Shares or ADSs.\n\nCapital gains of a non-corporate US holder are generally taxed at a preferential rate where the holder has a holding period greater than one year, and the capital gain or loss will generally be US source for foreign tax credit limitation purposes.\n\n## Capital Acquisitions Tax (Estate/Gift Tax)\n\nAlthough non-residents may hold Ordinary Shares, the shares are deemed to be situated in the Republic of Ireland, because the Company is required to maintain its Share Register in the Republic of Ireland for Irish Capital Gains Tax purposes.\n\nAccordingly, holders of Ordinary Shares may be subject to Irish gift or inheritance tax, notwithstanding that the parties involved are domiciled and resident outside the Republic of Ireland. Certain exemptions apply to gifts and inheritances depending on the relationship between the donor and donee.\n\nUnder the Ireland-US Estate Tax Treaty with respect to taxes on the estates of deceased persons, credit against US federal estate tax is available in respect of any Irish inheritance tax payable in respect of transfers of Ordinary Shares.\n\n## Additional US Federal Income Tax Considerations\n\nThe Company believes that Ordinary Shares and ADSs should not currently be treated as stock of a PFIC for US federal income tax purposes and does not expect them to become stock of a PFIC in the foreseeable future. However, this conclusion is a factual determination that is made annually and thus may be subject to change. If the Company is treated as a PFIC and you are a US holder that did not make a mark-to-market election, you will be subject to special rules with respect to any gain you realise on the sale or other disposition of your Ordinary Shares or ADSs and any excess distribution that the Company makes to you. Generally, any such gain or excess distribution will be allocated ratably over your holding period for the Ordinary Shares or ADSs, the amount allocated to the taxable year in which you realised the gain or received the excess distribution, or to prior years before the /first year in which we were a PFIC with respect to you, will be taxed as ordinary income, the amount allocated to each prior year will be generally taxed as ordinary income at the highest tax rate in effect for each other such year, and an interest charge will be applied to any tax attributable to such\n\ngain or excess distribution for the prior years. With certain exceptions, Ordinary Shares or ADSs will be treated as stock in a PFIC if the company was a PFIC at any time during the investor's holding period in the Ordinary Shares or ADSs. In addition, dividends that you receive from the Company will not constitute quali/fied dividend income to you if the Company is deemed to be a PFIC either in the taxable year of the distribution or the preceding taxable year, but instead will be taxable at rates applicable to ordinary income.\n\n## Stamp Duty\n\nSection 90 Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999 exempts from Irish stamp duty transfers of ADSs where the ADSs are dealt in and quoted on a recognised stock exchange in the US and the underlying deposited securities are dealt in and quoted on a recognised stock exchange. The Irish tax authorities regard NASDAQ and the NYSE as recognised stock exchanges. Irish stamp duty will be charged at the rate of 1% of the amount or value of the consideration on any conveyance or transfer on sale of Ordinary Shares (exemption generally available in the case of single transfers with a value of less than \u20ac1,000).",

The passing of resolutions at a meeting of the Company, other than special resolutions, requires a simple majority. A special resolution, in respect of which not less than 21 clear days' notice in writing must be given, requires the af/firmative vote of at least 75% of the votes cast.\n\n## Disclosure of Shareholders' Interests\n\nA shareholder may lose the right to vote by not complying with any statutory notice or notice pursuant to Article 14 of the Articles of Association given by the Company requiring an indication in writing of: (i) the capacity in which the shares are held or any interest therein; (ii) the persons who have an interest in the shares and the nature of their interest; or (iii) whether any of the voting rights carried by such shares are the subject of any agreement or arrangement under which another person is entitled to control the shareholder's exercise of these rights.\n\n## Preference Shares\n\nDetails of the 5% and 7% 'A' Cumulative Preference Shares are disclosed in note 31 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Use of Electronic Communication\n\nWhenever the Company, a Director, the Secretary, a member or any of/ficer or person is required or permitted by the Articles of Association to give information in writing, such information may be given by electronic means or in electronic form, whether as electronic communication or otherwise, provided that the electronic means or electronic form has been approved by the Directors.",
