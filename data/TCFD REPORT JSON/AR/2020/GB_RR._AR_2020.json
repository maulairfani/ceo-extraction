otherwise stated. We believe this is the most appropriate basis to measure our in-year performance as underlying results reflect the substance of trading activity, including the impact of the Group's foreign exchange forward contracts, which lock in transactions at predetermined exchange rates. In addition, underlying results exclude the accounting impact of business acquisitions and disposals, impairment charges and exceptional items. A full definition of underlying and the reconciliation to the reported figures are in note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 126. All references to organic change are at constant translational currency and exclude M&A.\n\n## Forward-looking statements\n\nThis Annual Report contains forward-looking statements. Any statements that express forecasts, expectations and projections are not guarantees of future performance and guidance may be updated from time to time. This report is intended to provide information to shareholders, and is not designed to be relied upon by any other party or for any other purpose, and the Company and its Directors accept no liability to any other person other than that required under English law. Latest information will be made available on the Group's website. By their nature, these statements involve risk and uncertainty, and a number of factors could cause material differences to the actual results or developments.",

The steps we have taken in 2020 will provide the Group with improved financial resilience in order to weather macroeconomic risks before we return to strong cash generation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Rolls-Royce has been stark and we have taken decisive and transformative action to restructure fundamentally our operations, materially reduce our cost base and improve our financial position. During the year, we have launched the largest restructuring in our recent history, secured further liquidity through a rights issue and by raising additional debt, and launched a significant disposal programme. We believe these steps will provide the Group with improved financial resilience, in order to weather the macroeconomic risks, before we return to strong cash generation; and assist us in creating a more appropriate balance sheet structure as we position the Group for the long term to benefit from new technologies focused on sustainable power.\n\nThe sudden and material effect of measures taken by governments worldwide to stem the outbreak of COVID-19 has had a significant impact on the commercial aviation industry, particularly the market for long-haul travel. This resulted in a sharp deterioration in the financial performance of our Civil Aerospace business - which makes the majority of its cash flow from payments based on the number of hours that our engines are powering our customers' aircraft - and, to a much lesser extent, our Power Systems business.\n\nWe came into the year in a stronger position than previously, with net funds of \u00a31.4bn and confident of our ability to achieve our target of at least \u00a31bn of free cash flow, following significant progress made over the previous two years. As a result of the impact of the pandemic, however, we exited the year with net debt of \u00a31.5bn and a free cash outflow of \u00a34.2bn.\n\n## Decisive actions in response to COVID-19\n\nThe pandemic has affected lives throughout the world and impacted everyone at Rolls-Royce. The Board has actively scrutinised the actions being taken to secure the safety and wellbeing of our people. Alongside measures introduced to ensure physical health in the workplace, we have paid particular attention to mental health support. This has been a time of understandable anxiety for many employees, with the impact of the pandemic compounded by our restructuring, the pressures of remote working and, for some of our people, a period of time on furlough or similar schemes. The mental wellbeing of our people has been a significant focus for the Board.\n\nEnsuring safety is one of our key values at Rolls-Royce and in our initial response to the outbreak, we rapidly implemented a number of proactive safety measures, in line with local and national guidelines (see pages 6 and 40). Despite the obvious pressure the virus has created, we continued to reduce workplace incidents (see page 41) while avoiding any significant outbreaks of the virus at our sites. The cultural and behavioural progress that Rolls-Royce has made over the past several years, I believe, also benefitted the Group during these incredibly testing times. Our people around the world have embraced agility, acted boldly, worked more collaboratively and promoted simplicity in the actions they have taken to deal with the i mpact of the pandemic. We also supported local and national efforts to combat the impact of the pandemic (see page 43) including participating in the production of additional healthcare equipment.\n\nWe implemented a number of cost mitigation measures to conserve cash from March and took action to bolster our liquidity position, allowing us time to conduct a more detailed review of the Group's capital structure and funding options. We also made use of government schemes, such as furlough in the UK, and remain grateful for the support we have received. In May, we launched a fundamental restructuring programme that will resize the cost base and capital requirements of our Civil Aerospace business and increase cost efficiency. This vital 'self-help' is intended to adjust our business to the new level of anticipated demand from customers and deliver larger, permanent savings to replace and expand on the mitigating actions delivered by the Group in 2020.\n\nDuring the year, the Board increased oversight and scrutiny, providing counsel and constructive challenge to the Executive Team as it dealt with the pandemic, through a high number of additional meetings and calls (see page 70). We conducted a detailed review of the Group's",

This included consideration of a severe but plausible downside scenario (see page 53). There remains significant uncertainty about the precise pace of the recovery and the possibility of delays remains a risk and, as a Board, we considered it prudent to prioritise resilience and flexibility. Taking into account, in particular, our severe but plausible downside scenario, alongside continued global and macroeconomic uncertainty, we determined in October that it was in the best interests of shareholders to seek to raise additional capital of approximately \u00a32bn through a rights issue, secure additional facilities to take our total debt raised in the year to \u00a35.3bn, and deliver a number of potential disposals to raise gross proceeds of at least \u00a32bn by early 2022.\n\nWe thank shareholders for the overwhelming support we received for the rights issue, which enabled us to improve our liquidity headroom while supporting disciplined execution and investment to ensure we maximise value from our existing capabilities. It will allow us to continue on our journey to securing a more appropriate balance sheet and deliver disposals in a manner that ensures value for our shareholders, as we position the Group for the long term to benefit from new technologies focused on sustainable power.\n\nDue to the limited visibility of the duration and impact of the pandemic, we withdrew our previous guidance for 2020 in April and subsequently made clear commitments to investors alongside our fund raising. It is vital that the interests of the Executive Team are aligned to our new reality, while our remuneration policy must avoid the potential for windfalls caused by a general market recovery following the pandemic. As a result, the Remuneration Committee has decided to replace our previous long-term incentive plan and introduce a new policy to be voted on at the 2021 AGM (see page 81).\n\nAs the world emerges from the pandemic, we will benefit from our broad portfolio, with Defence expected to remain resilient and Power Systems benefitting from its shorter cycle industrial end market exposure. We believe we have a clear responsibility to all our stakeholders to return the Group to strength with a sustainable and right-sized cost base, aimed at ensuring the Group's future success and the Board intends to take all appropriate actions to secure this outcome.\n\n## Shareholder payments\n\nAlthough we took swift action to conserve cash and bolster our liquidity, the Board decided in April that, in light of the uncertain macro outlook, they would not recommend a final shareholder payment for 2019. This was a difficult but prudent decision as the scale of the crisis became apparent. We also confirmed in August that no interim shareholder payment would be made in 2020. For the foreseeable future, under the terms of certain of our loan facilities we have in place, we are currently restricted from making payments to our shareholders until after 31 December 2022. Further information can be found in Shareholder Information on page 211.\n\n## Board developments\n\nIn August, Stephen Daintith informed the Board that he had decided to leave to take up another opportunity. Stephen has remained in his role to ensure the effective delivery of the cost mitigations targeted i n 2020 and will leave on 19 March 2021. He has been a valued member of the Board and management team and has made a huge contribution to the Group. I would like to thank him for his hard work. His successor, Panos Kakoullis, will take up his role on 3 May 2021. During the year, we welcomed George Culmer and Dame Angela Strank to the Board as Non-Executive Directors in January and May respectively. We have also appointed Paul Adams who joins us in March 2021. Finally, on behalf of the Board, I would like to thank Lewis Booth, Sir Frank Chapman and Jasmin Stablin, all of whom will be stepping down at the 2021 AGM, for their tremendous support during their tenure (see page 61).\n\n## Looking forward\n\nOur markets remain fundamentally attractive and the actions we have taken in 2020 should enable us to deliver on the clear commitments we have made to investors. We must complete the fundamental restructuring of our business in order to be able to benefit from the eventual recovery in commercial aviation from COVID-19. Although the pathway to strong free cash flow remains dependent on the exact timing and shape of that recovery, notably with regards to long-haul air travel, our intent is to return the Group to positive free cash flow during the second half of 2021, with positive annual free cash flow as early as 2022, excluding the cash impact from our disposal programme. Continuing news about vaccine programmes being developed and undertaken around the world should give all of us cause for optimism about the future.\n\nAs countries across the world emerge from the restrictions designed to combat the pandemic and seek to revive their economies, the desire for economic development to be more robustly coupled with a reduction in global carbon emissions will only grow stronger. This represents a challenge for Rolls-Royce (see page 48), but also a very significant business opportunity, which we are grasping firmly as a central part of our strategy (see page 10). We believe that over the longer term, the end markets in which we operate will see growing demand for cleaner and more sustainable power and we are already positioning ourselves to play a crucial role in the world's transition towards a net zero carbon economy. Alongside our own commitment to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions in our operations and facilities by 2030 (see page 36), our technology will play a fundamental role in enabling the sectors in which we operate achieve net zero carbon by 2050 (see page 34).\n\nFinally, I and the Board would like to thank everyone in Rolls-Royce for their resilience, determination and extraordinary hard work in what have been exceptionally challenging circumstances.\n\nSir Ian Davis\n\nChairman",

We entered 2020 with real momentum. Following a period of rapid growth and new engine programme launches, R&D investment demands were falling in Civil Aerospace and returns improving as we began to benefit from our large, growing and relatively young installed base. The benefits from this have now been delayed, but these fundamentals remain in place and position us well for the eventual rebound.\n\nUnprecedented is a word I have used many times during 2020 and for good reason. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic during the year on the largest part of our business, Civil Aerospace, has been exactly that and unprecedented times have called for unprecedented action. We have launched the largest restructuring in our recent history, embarked upon the consolidation of our global manufacturing footprint, introduced stringent cost reduction measures and begun a disposals programme to raise at least \u00a32bn by early 2022. The hard work, dedication and sacrifice of everyone at Rolls-Royce in securing our future in the face of the sudden and material effect of the pandemic on the commercial aviation industry, has been exceptional.\n\nDuring the year, we have had to call upon investors for funds, securing \u00a32bn in equity and \u00a35.3bn of debt to increase our resilience, support our long-term strategy and assist us in our journey towards enhancing our liquidity and strengthening the balance sheet. Of the existing facilities available to the Group, \u00a35.5bn remains undrawn at the year-end. All of us at Rolls-Royce are grateful for the support that investors have given us in providing sufficient liquidity to weather this crisis. We now have a heightened sense of responsibility to all our stakeholders, who have shown such faith in us during 2020, to secure a sustainable and prosperous future for Rolls-Royce. My sense of responsibility is particularly acute to those who are leaving the business in the restructuring, to those who remain with us and those who will come after us and pioneer the technologies required for decades to come. As we recover from the impact of the pandemic on our business, we must retain and indeed strengthen our focus on playing a crucial role in the transition to a net zero carbon economy by creating the sustainable power that our customers require.\n\nAs the pandemic hit, we implemented proactive measures, aligned with local and national guidelines, to help keep our people safe and minimise operational disruption. These included introducing remote working practices alongside workplace measures such as social distancing, enhanced hygiene procedures and modified shift systems in our manufacturing facilities. As a result, our facilities have remained operational throughout the pandemic with no significant outbreaks. Recognising that the impact of the pandemic extends well beyond the purely physical, we also increased our focus on employee mental health and wellbeing, with additional online tools and an expansion of our network of mental health champions. We also provided practical assistance to our communities where we could. In the UK, we worked with partners, suppliers and healthcare professionals to build a parallel supply chain for new ventilator assembly plants. We also created a fast-make intubation shield for use with ventilators and we allowed many of our own employees to use their own initiative to create vital PPE for local hospitals. Our R 2 Data Labs team, meanwhile, launched the Emergent Alliance, a global community with more than 140 members that is using data analytics to assist the global economic recovery. As schools closed worldwide, we also increased the range of STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) materials that we have available for free online.\n\nAs governments around the world moved quickly to try and halt the spread of COVID-19, much of the global airline fleet was grounded from the end of the first quarter of the year. At their lowest point, in April, our large engine flying hours (EFH) were down 80% on the same period in 2019. In response to this sudden market deterioration, we executed short-term mitigations to reduce our cash expenditure including minimising discretionary spend and reducing salary costs. These swift actions saved us more than \u00a31bn in 2020.",

        "page_content": "Although flying activity increased from the low point in April, for the year as a whole large engine flying hours were 43% of 2019 levels, with a consequent dramatic impact on our free cash flow. The drop in activity in Civil Aerospace and our decision to cease invoice factoring (see page 18), resulted in an overall free cash outflow of \u00a34.2bn for the year as a whole.\n\n## Fundamental restructuring\n\nThe impact of COVID-19 on our Civil Aerospace business will not just be felt in 2020. The pandemic has created probably the most difficult period that global aviation has faced in peacetime. The medium-term market for our Civil Aerospace business will be significantly smaller than previously anticipated. As a result, in May we launched a major restructuring programme to resize the cost base and capital requirements of our Civil Aerospace business to adapt to this new reality\n\nand deliver run-rate savings of at least \u00a31.3bn by the end of 2022. The successful completion of this programme, alongside an anticipated recovery in our end markets, is vital to restoring our financial performance.\n\nI n total, we expect the restructuring to lead to the reduction of at least 9,000 roles. By the end of the year, approximately 7,000 roles (see page 42) had been removed with a significant proportion achieved through voluntary severance. Telling anyone that there is no longer a job for them is a terrible prospect and it is especially hard when all of us take so much pride in working for Rolls-Royce. But we have had to make tough choices to see the Group through these unprecedented times. Throughout\n\n## Power Systems and Defence\n\nThe impact of the pandemic on Power Systems has been far less severe than on Civil Aerospace and driven primarily by lower levels of economic activity caused by the restrictions imposed globally in order to contain the outbreak (see page 28). Diversified end market exposure resulted in a relatively resilient performance. Lower economic activity and reduced utilisation of the installed base of engines due to the pandemic caused a substantial drop in commercial and industrial markets. However, governmental demand remained intact and we grew strongly in China, where economic conditions were better. Power Systems has been working actively to improve i t s manufacturing fixed cost base, optimising efficiency and balancing its global footprint. As economic activity resumes, we expect Power Systems to recover relatively quickly. Some end markets may actually experience structurally higher demand as a result of the pandemic,\n\nThe impact of COVID-19 on Civil Aerospace will not just be felt in 2020. A successful completion of our fundamental restructuring is vital to restoring our financial performance.\n\nthe pandemic, we have made use of the short-term support mechanisms created by governments including furlough in the UK and comparable schemes in other countries. We are grateful for this support, but no government scheme can replace sustainable customer demand that is not there over the medium-term and we have had to act. Our Civil Aerospace facilities have seen a medium-term reduction in demand and so we must resize our manufacturing footprint. During the year, we announced proposals including the consolidation of widebody engine assembly and test from three global sites to one in Derby, UK, and the transfer of our aero-engine parts facility and workforce in Hucknall, UK, into ITP Aero.\n\nITP Aero is one of a number of assets that we have identified for potential disposal to raise proceeds of at least \u00a32bn by early 2022. Notwithstanding the outcome, ITP Aero is a key partner and we will retain a long-term relationship with the business across our Civil Aerospace and Defence programmes. In December 2020, we announced the sale of our Civil Nuclear Instrumentation & Control business and in early in 2021, we also announced the sale of our Bergen Engines medium-speed gas and diesel engines business.\n\nnotably in mission-critical power generation. This is one of the areas where we expanded the capabilities of Power Systems during the pandemic through acquisition, buying Kinolt Group, to strengthen our position in back-up power generation. That followed the acquisition of a majority stake in Qinous at the start of the year, which enhanced our microgrid offering.\n\nOur Defence business had a strong year and did not experience any material operational or financial disruption from the pandemic (see page 30). Support for the defence industry from governments and other customers in our key markets was swift. Action from the UK Government, for instance, has enabled us to redeploy engineers from Civil Aerospace into Defence in order to\n\nretain key skills. We also continued with our work on the Tempest future combat programme in the UK and won business during the year, with our MT30 marine gas turbine selected for the Republic of Korea Navy's FFX Batch III frigate.\n\n## Driving growth and maximising value from our existing capabilities\n\nWhile the pandemic has not altered our commitment to our long-term strategy, we are pursuing stronger medium-term growth opportunities and placing a greater relative focus on investment in Power Systems and Defence.\n\nIncreased investment in Power Systems will enable the continued development of new technologies such as hybrid-electric systems and assist us in exploiting the opportunities presented by fast growing markets and the move to more integrated power systems solutions. We have reorganised the internal structure of Power Systems to focus individually on stationary, mobile and sustainable power solutions with a fourth business unit concentrating solely on China.",

        "page_content": "In Defence, we have invested significantly in recent years in pursuing growth opportunities including two major opportunities in the US market: the re-engining of the iconic B-52 and the U.S. Army's Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) programme (see page 31). These programmes have the potential for over 650 and 4,000 engines respectively, with a combined estimated lifetime value of roughly \u00a37bn. In the latter competition, during the year, we signed an agreement with Bell Textron to provide the propulsion system for its offering, the V-280 Valor aircraft.\n\nIn Civil Aerospace, our priority is to drive higher cash returns from our existing installed base while seeking new approaches to reduce the investment requirements for the development of our next generation gas turbine technology. There is significant value embedded in our installed base of approximately 5,000 large and 9,000 small and\n\nbusiness aviation engines and we have an important opportunity to realise that value through enhanced time-on-wing, further services offerings and improved engineering efficiency. My confidence in our ability to rise to this challenge was further bolstered in 2020 as we achieved zero aircraft on ground (AOG) for the Trent 1000 fleet half way through the year, assisted by the impact of the pandemic but beating our ambition of single digits.\n\nAlthough we are exiting a period of very intense investment in new Civil Aerospace engine programmes - with seven new engines launched\n\nare also building the capability to produce world-class, modular and scalable electric power and propulsion systems for aviation. We have conducted successful ground tests of a hybrid M250 engine for the commuter and urban air mobility markets and have developed an all-electric aircraft, through the ACCEL programme, designed to break the world electric air speed record in 2021. It will provide us with invaluable insights into battery technology for these new disruptive markets. In addition, we are using our growing expertise to develop technologies for the electrification of larger regional aircraft. Electrification is also playing an increasing role in Defence projects.\n\nThe sheer scale of the challenge presented by the weight constraints of long-haul flight, means the gas turbine will remain the only viable propulsion option in widebody aircraft for multiple decades. As a result, we must make this technology compatible with a net zero\n\nWe remain well positioned to play a crucial role in the world's transition to a net zero carbon economy.\n\nin the past decade - we are giving ourselves technological optionality for the future through our UltraFan programme (see page 10). During the year, we started a new phase of testing for its low emissions combustion system and put into production the first component sets required for a full engine demonstrator which will be fully assembled at the end of 2021. To deliver more compelling returns, we are actively exploring new forms of industrial partnership on the programme.\n\n## Focus on sustainable power\n\nWe have a target to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions in our operations and facilities by 2030, excluding product test emissions (see page 36). We believe, however, that the breadth of our engineering expertise and our established access to a range of end markets mean that we are also well positioned to play a crucial role in the world's transition to a net zero carbon economy. Once we achieve our aim of restoring financial returns and a more appropriate balance sheet, we intend to accelerate this aspect of our strategy to deliver substantial growth by 2025.\n\nWe are building on our existing capabilities within Power Systems where land and sea applications are already moving to more electric systems. We already have a proven microgrid product offering and are developing hybrid systems for applications including yachts. We\n\ncarbon future. We are working with governments and industrial partners to explore the development of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) and already testing them within our existing Trent engines. As the cost of these new fuels is expected to be higher than existing kerosenebased fuel, an efficient gas turbine architecture, such as our next generation UltraFan, will be a vital component in achieving sustainable aviation. SAFs must be created in a way compatible with net zero carbon, which represents a real opportunity for our small modular reactor (SMR) concept to power their production.\n\n## 2021 outlook and longer-term prospects\n\nThe decisive actions we have taken during 2020 leave us well placed as the recovery unfolds, but we must continue to drive our restructuring in order to realign our cost base. Based on our current view of the shape and timing of the recovery in air traffic, we expect a free cash outflow in the region of \u00a32bn in 2021, weighted towards the first half before we turn free cash flow positive at some point during the second half. We are targeting a return to annual free cash flow of at least \u00a3750m (excluding disposals) as early as 2022.\n\nOver the longer term, we believe that the key markets for all our businesses are fundamentally attractive and we remain committed to playing a key part in enabling the sectors in which we operate, some of which are among the hardest to abate, achieve net zero carbon by 2050. We clearly signalled our ambitions in this area during 2020 by joining the UN Race to Zero campaign (see page 36). I firmly believe the world needs the resourcefulness, ingenuity and determination of Rolls-Royce, not only to assist in the recovery of the global economy in the wake of the pandemic, but to provide solutions to the climate crisis. The way that we have tackled the challenge posed by COVID-19 during the year gives me increased confidence that we will repay the faith placed in us by all our stakeholders and achieve a sustainable and prosperous future.",

Our vision is to pioneer the power that matters and our purpose is to use that power to connect, power and protect society. We believe that, despite the current impact of the pandemic, the key end markets for our businesses remain fundamentally attractive and as a result our overall strategic architecture remains largely unchanged. We have, however, refined our strategic pillar of 'champion electrification' to encompass a wider range of net zero carbon technologies under the banner 'champion sustainable power'. This is in recognition of the increasing importance of ensuring that economic recovery and growth is achieved in a manner compatible with combatting climate change. We are determined to play a crucial role in pioneering a resilient, inclusive, net zero carbon future (see page 36).\n\nHORIZON 1\n\n## V I T A L I S E   E X I S T I N G   C A P A B I L I T I E S\n\nDespite the obvious financial pressure caused by the pandemic, we have continued to invest in our existing thermomechanical products to ensure that they provide clean, safe and competitive solutions for our customers, while developing next generation technologies.\n\nThe gas turbine will continue to be the bedrock of long-haul aviation for many years and it is vital that we continue to increase its efficiency, not least to improve the economics of the transition to more sustainable fuels which are likely to be more expensive in the short-term than fossil fuels. During the year, we continued to develop the new technologies we will need to achieve this. We started a new phase of testing for our Advanced Low Emissions Combustion System ( ALECSys) demonstrator, a key part of our UltraFan programme. Our work on UltraFan continued with parts for our first engine demonstrator going into production in 2020 including the power gearbox, fan blades and fan case. We ended the year training our team in Derby, UK, to build and assemble the engine and commissioning our new Testbed 80, which will be large enough to accommodate it. In business jets, we delivered the 8,000th engine from our site in Dahlewitz, Germany, and our BR725 engine achieved one million flying hours. Our latest business jet engine, the Pearl 700, successfully powered the new Gulfstream G700 for the first time.\n\nIn Power Systems, we launched a new MTU Series 500 engine for power generation, which will initially be offered for operation with natural gas but from the end of 2021 will also be available for power by biogas. The 500 series can also be converted to hydrogen operation. We also formed a 50:50 joint venture with Shanghai Cooltech Power, a leading Chinese manufacturer of power generation systems, to produce back-up generator sets powered by MTU engines.\n\nI n Defence, our MT30 marine gas turbine was selected for the Republic of Korea Navy's FFX Batch III frigate and we signed a collaborative agreement with the UK Ministry of Defence to strengthen ways of\n\nworking across key Royal Navy programmes and deliver ongoing support for MT30 and WR-21 engines. Work continued at pace on the Tempest future combat programme, with our engineers developing advanced combustion system technology and exploring composite materials and additive manufacturing to produce lightweight, more power-dense components capable of operating at higher temperatures. In North America, we completed the expansion of our Centre of Excellence for Naval Handling Equipment in Canada. Our LibertyWorks team completed rig testing on a new core design for a small engine, successfully executing a rapid prototyping plan from design to test in under a year; and delivered an upgraded thermal management and power system for directed energy applications.\n\nHORIZON 2\n\n## C H A M P I O N   S U S T A I N A B L E   P O W E R\n\nTo meet the demands of a growing, more connected society, the power that matters must be sustainable, net zero carbon power. We have a key role to play in enabling the sectors in which we operate achieve net zero carbon by 2050 and during the year we ratified this ambition by joining the UN Race to Zero campaign. This means pioneering new electric and hybrid-electric technologies, but also ensuring that our products can be utilised in a way that is compatible with net zero through the use of new innovative fuels. The journey to net zero will create significant business opportunities for Rolls-Royce from even more efficient gas turbines using sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs ) and all-electric and hybrid-electric propulsion, to microgrids, battery containers and small modular reactors (SMRs).\n\nAviation has traditionally been seen as hard to decarbonise. We believe, however, that it can be compatible with a net zero future through relentless pursuit of airframe and engine efficiency improvements; improving the economics, and scaling up the production of SAFs; and the exploration of radically new methods of aviation propulsion and fuelling. The vast majority of CO2 created from aviation is from flights beyond 1,500km, where we believe that radically new methods of propulsion are unlikely to play a significant part in decarbonisation prior to 2050. As a result, gas turbine efficiency improvements and the scale-up of SAFs will be vital. Following the development and entry into service of the world's most efficient large aero engine in service today, the Trent XWB, our UltraFan programme will offer a step-change in efficiency. We believe that the introduction, by regulators or governments, of mandated levels of SAF will bring about a cost burden for airlines and UltraFan will help mitigate rising fuel costs as well as reduce net emissions.\n\nTowards the end of 2020, we conducted ground tests on a Trent 1000 using 100% SAF for the first time (see page 37). The scale-up of SAFs to meet global aviation demand is a major undertaking, with an estimated 500 million tonnes per year needed in order to fuel the global airline fleet that is expected to be flying in 2050. We are engaged with the world's leading energy companies to promote increased production. Our SMR concept also represents a potential low carbon",

Our Defence aviation customers are also becoming increasingly interested in SAF availability and engine compatibility for reasons of energy security and to assist in their own contribution to decarbonisation. The higher calorific value of SAFs, compared to fossil fuels, may also provide operating range benefits.\n\nElectric and hybrid-electric technologies are set to power a new generation of fixed-wing and vertical take-off aircraft. During the year, we celebrated the first anniversary of the acquisition of eAircraft and we have sharpened our short-term focus to target the small propeller, commuter and urban air mobility (UAM) markets where we are developing complete propulsion systems.\n\nIn the small propeller category, our first prototype of an electric propulsion unit to serve aircraft with two to four seats, the RRP70, gained an agreed certification plan with EASA; and in the commuter market we announced plans to work with leading general aviation manufacturer, Tecnam, to jointly develop an all-electric 11-seater aircraft. In UAM, we provided the propulsion system for the CityAirbus demonstrator which successfully completed its flight test programme in 2020. During the year, we decided with our partner Airbus that we did not need to carry out a test flight programme for our E-Fan X technology demonstrator, having already learned valuable lessons. However, our technology in the megawatt space for regional sized jets continues to progress at pace with our 2.5MW generator now in ground testing with system integration tests planned for 2021.\n\nDuring the year, our ACCEL all-electric aircraft programme completed ground testing of the technology that will power what we hope will be the world's fastest all-electric plane. The aircraft is a test environment for our pure electric flight pack and also intended to inspire the next generation of aerospace innovators. We are aiming to beat the current all-electric flight world speed record in 2021.\n\nLand and sea power generation and propulsion also represent a significant proportion of global emissions and Power Systems is rapidly embracing the drive towards sustainable power. In 2020, we acquired a majority stake in electricity storage specialist Qinous which is now central to our microgrid solutions. We also increased our capacity for producing battery containers and formed a new 'Power Lab' to focus on innovative and net zero carbon drive and energy solutions.\n\n## R E I N V E N T   W I T H   D I G I T A L\n\nWe are using digital technologies across our activities to generate new insights, new solutions and new opportunities. Our capabilities, expertise and connection with the wider data analysis and digital community were highlighted by two activities during the year: the Emergent Alliance and the Aletheia Framework. As the impact of the pandemic grew, we formed the Emergent Alliance of data analytics experts challenged with finding new, faster ways of supporting businesses and governments globally as they recover from its economic impact. At the end of the year, we released the Aletheia Framework,\n\na comprehensive ethical framework and trustworthiness process which we created to assure our own use of artificial intelligence in safety-critical processes. Both programmes were borne out of R\u00b2 Data Labs which also launched Yocova, a collaboration platform for the aviation sector, in 2020. Across our business, we are making increasing use of digital skills and ensuring that our people can increase their capabilities through our Digital Academy. To help as many as possible during the pandemic, we made its content available online and more than 30,000 have already enrolled.\n\nHORIZON 3\n\n## T R A N S F O R M   O U R   B U S I N E S S\n\nWe are advancing new opportunities that could capture substantial growth and value for the Group. During the year, the UK Government committed to \u00a3215m of grant funding for our consortium working on SMR power plants. This enables the consortium to begin securing additional private investment. The strength of the SMR concept was highlighted during the year as we announced a partnership with Exelon, one of America's largest operators of nuclear power stations, and signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with CEZ, the largest utility company in central and eastern Europe.\n\nDuring the year we also announced a collaboration with Boom Supersonic to explore a propulsion system for Overture, their flagship supersonic passenger aircraft; and signed an MOU with Virgin Galactic to collaborate in designing and developing engine propulsion technology for high-speed commercial aircraft.\n\n## B U I L D   A   B A L A N C E D   P O R T F O L I O\n\nWe actively manage our portfolio to focus on activities that are aligned with our strategy and business model. During the year, we announced plans to raise at least \u00a32bn by early 2022 through disposals i ncluding ITP Aero. The business is a key partner and we plan to retain a long-term relationship with it across our Civil Aerospace and Defence programmes, but owning ITP Aero is not necessarily a strategic imperative and it may be able to unlock further investment and business opportunities under new ownership. During the year, we completed the sale of our Civil Nuclear North America Services business and announced the sale of our Civil Nuclear Instrumentation & Control business. In early 2021, we also announced the sale of our Bergen Engines medium-speed gas and diesel engines business. We made three acquisitions during 2020 to accelerate our strategy in Power Systems. We acquired a majority stake in electricity storage specialist Qinous, to enhance our microgrid offering. We completed the acquisition of Kinolt, a leader in dynamic uninterruptible power supply, to strengthen our market position in safety-critical applications. We also acquired Servowatch Systems, an international supplier of integrated marine automation solutions for navies, commercial vessels and large yachts, to expand our ship automation activities.",

See our Viability Statement on page 55 and Stakeholder Engagement on page 72.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Anticipate the needs of our customers\n\nOur focus on building complete power solutions provides the basis for strong customer relationships as we act as a single, trusted power provider. Our aftermarket model of through-life support further deepens these relationships. We have built strong, direct customer relationships which have allowed us to continue winning business during a period of increased macroeconomic uncertainty associated with the pandemic.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Develop cutting-edge technologies\n\nOur products incorporate significant intellectual property, capturing cutting-edge technologies that have been developed over decades. Commercial aero engines are extremely complex mechanical engineering products, requiring significant expertise in aerodynamic, thermodynamic and materials technologies. In our Defence business, we are one of only a handful of companies currently capable of designing, integrating and manufacturing complete military jet engines; with significant expertise in powerplants for nuclear-powered submarine applications. Our Power Systems business focuses on demanding, high-end applications for reciprocating engines, in areas such as mission-critical back-up power where start-up time and reliability are critical. We act as a global technology sponsor, drawing upon expertise inside and outside our organisation. In 2020, we continued to invest in R&D despite the pressures on our business caused by the pandemic, with \u00a31.25bn in gross R&D expenditure, supported by governments around the world.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Design solutions\n\nWe harness the potential of digital technologies and design thinking to create solutions that generate the greatest value from our cuttingedge technologies. This activity is supported by our data innovation catalyst R 2 Data Labs. We produce digital twins in order to test our hypotheses and then validate our results through a rigorous physical testing regime. In our Civil Aerospace and Defence businesses, our capabilities cover end-to-end design, assembly and through-life support of complete gas turbine power solutions. Our Power Systems business is increasingly moving into the provision of complete power generation systems.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Develop world-class production capability\n\nWe generate value from our cutting-edge technologies and innovative solution designs through effective and efficient delivery of final products. We use our production expertise and network of Advanced Manufacturing Research Centres, alongside our supply chain partners, to harness new manufacturing techniques and technologies.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Grow installed original equipment base\n\nIncreasing our installed base of products generates both in-year growth and the potential for our business to capture long-term service revenue. In line with our strategic aim to vitalise existing capabilities, we continually look for ways to reduce the time and resource expended on producing existing products, and roll-back new technologies from new programmes into legacy products.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Capture through-life value of in-service products\n\nWe believe our substantial installed base provides a large, captive, visible, and long-term revenue and cash flow stream. The installed base within our Civil Aerospace business is relatively young, with approximately 9,000 small and business aviation engines in service with an average age of 19 years for small civil jets and 13 years for business jets, as well as approximately 5,000 large engines with an average age of less than nine years. Given an average expected engine life of approximately 40 years for a small or business aviation engine and approximately 25 years for a widebody engine, we expect significant aftermarket revenue and value from our installed base. Similarly, the installed base in our Defence business of approximately 16,000 defence engines is expected to continue to operate for many decades.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Generate stakeholder value\n\nOur activities are global, complex and touch upon a wide variety of stakeholders. From investors, employees, customers, suppliers and partners, to communities, local and national authorities, regulatory bodies and armed forces, we aim to create trusted relationships. Over the longer term, the end-markets in which we operate will see growing demand for cleaner and more sustainable power. We will be well positioned to play a crucial role in the world's transition towards a net zero carbon economy and believe execution of our strategy will ultimately provide a strong platform to drive a significant improvement in free cash flow and deliver attractive shareholder returns.",

This was most strongly felt in our widebody business in Civil Aerospace, but also in business aviation and Power Systems. Conditions i n Defence proved resilient despite the challenging global macroeconomic environment.\n\n## Market dynamics\n\n- - The civil aviation industry has been severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with a particular impact on the widebody market.\n- - As a result, airlines have postponed investment i n new aircraft, leading to a reduction in aircraft production from both Airbus and Boeing.\n- - Business aviation has also seen a reduction in activity as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, however the impact was less severe than in the large commercial market.\n- - In the longer term, the business expects to return to growth, driven by the same market trends witnessed prior to COVID-19:\n- \u00b7 economic growth in both the developed and the developing world;\n- \u00b7 growth in business jet travel supported by further increases in the number of high-networth individuals; and\n- \u00b7 the need for newer, more efficient aircraft with reduced greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n## Market recovery\n\n## Our positioning\n\nThe Group expects its key markets to recover over time. Power Systems is expected to recover relatively quickly as economic conditions improve, while a more gradual improvement is expected in Civil Aerospace. Longer term, the outlook remains strong across the Group; global economic growth is expected  to  increase  demand across Civil Aerospace, ITP Aero and Power Systems, while political tensions are expected to preserve the need for Defence products and services.\n\nThe Group expects to outperform many of its markets through this recovery period. In Civil Aerospace and ITP Aero, this is driven by our young installed base and strong product positions on new aircraft programmes. In Power Systems, this is due to growing market share in key markets and expanding our sales in low carbon products as our end markets transition to more sustainable power.\n\n## CIVIL AEROSPACE\n\n## Opportunities\n\n- - The business has the potential for market share gains during COVID-19, as our relatively young i nstalled base should be less impacted by retirements and recover more quickly than our competitors.\n- - The strong positions we hold on current inproduction widebody aircraft should drive a return to growth in our installed base post-COVID-19.\n- - In business jets, we hold a strong position in the market by value. This market has been less impacted by COVID-19 and has good long-term fundamental drivers.\n- - We have the potential to disrupt new markets with sustainable power solutions in general aviation, commuter aircraft and urban air mobility.\n\n## Low carbon power solutions\n\nThe Group sees common trends across all of its businesses towards electrification and lower carbon power solutions. This shift provides significant opportunities due to our strong technology positions in hybrid and electric power solutions in Power Systems and Civil Aerospace, as well as in small modular reactors and microgrid solutions.\n\n## Risk\n\n- - A slower than expected recovery of the civil aerospace market from the COVID-19 pandemic could significantly impact our financial performance.\n- - If our products do not achieve their required technical attributes, then our financial performance and reputation could be impacted.\n- - If a major product failure in service is experienced, then this could result in loss of life and significant financial and reputational damage.\n- - If there is disruption to the business' internal or external supply chain then our financial performance and reputation could be impacted.\n- - If there are significant changes to the regulatory environment for the airline industry, the business' market position could be impacted.",

We have created a separate business unit to focus entirely on these opportunities.\n- - There is significant potential for market share growth in the Chinese market based on our strategy of using partnerships and localised manufacturing. We have created a separate business unit to focus entirely on these opportunities.\n- - There is significant growth potential in the missioncritical back-up power market. We have a strong product position in this area.\n- - Our gas product portfolio has been expanded in recent years, providing growth potential as a lower carbon alternative to diesel.\n- - Small modular reactors offer a significant opportunity in a new market, with the UK Government expressing support.\n\n## DEFENCE\n\n## Opportunities\n\n- -  In the US, the business is well positioned for the B-52 re-engine competition for the US Air Force and the Future Vertical Long Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) competition for the US Army. The combined lifetime value of these programmes is expected to be approximately \u00a37bn.\n- -  In the UK, the Government has demonstrated its commitment to maintaining fighter capability through Project Tempest, with \u00a32bn of initial MOD investment spending committed.\n- - The business is exploring more electric and hybrid-electric propulsion technologies as well as power generation and thermal management for the growing directed energy systems market.\n- - The business has various sales opportunities for existing products such as the MT30 naval gas  turbine  and  the  EJ200  Eurofighter Typhoon engine.\n\n## ITP AERO\n\n## Opportunities\n\n- - Delivery volumes are expected to return to growth from 2021, driven by ITP Aero's position on narrowbody and business jet programmes.\n- -  ITP Aero has won shares as a risk-and-revenue partner on relatively new programmes including the latest Rolls-Royce engines as well as the Pratt & Whitney PW1000G and PW800.\n- - ITP Aero will benefit from government defence budget growth, particularly in Spain. Mid-life enhancements of existing aircraft programmes and new European aircraft programmes also enable potential growth.\n\n## Risks\n\n- - If the recovery from COVID-19 takes longer than anticipated, then our financial performance could be materially impacted.\n- - If requirements on export licenses and/or local content increase, then this may affect our ability to export to certain markets.\n- - If the CO2 price rises above our expectations and/or the demand for fossil-free power develops faster than anticipated, then this may affect demand for our products and/or affect margins.\n- - If new technologies or alternative propulsion concepts emerge, then this may lead to partial substitution or downsizing of diesel engines.\n\n## Risks\n\n- -  If global defence spending experiences a significant downturn, then financial performance could be impacted.\n- -  If a major product failure in service is experienced, then this may result in loss of life and significant financial and reputational damage.\n- - If we do not continue to invest in improving the portfolio performance and cost of Rolls-Royce products, then market share may be lost.\n- - If the business suffers a major disruption in its supply chain, then delivery schedules could be delayed, damaging financial performance and reputation.\n- -  If electrification proceeds faster than expected, then the business may not be positioned to capitalise on this potential growth.\n- - If geopolitical issues impact government-togovernment relations or export controls, then our routes to market may be impacted.\n\n## Risks\n\n- -  If there is a worse-than-expected recovery following COVID-19, then ITP Aero's financial performance could be impacted.\n- - If ITP Aero's products do not achieve their required technical attributes, then our financial performance and reputation could be impacted.\n- -  If a product failed in service, then this could result in loss of life and significant financial and reputational damage.\n- - If the business' internal or external supply chain i s disrupted then ITP Aero's financial performance and reputation could be impacted.\n- -  If customer programmes were to be delayed into service or production rates cut, then ITP Aero's financial performance could be impacted.",

These actions position us well to deliver improved financial returns in the future.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2020 Overview\n\nWe entered 2020 with strong momentum having reported encouraging 2019 results. However, the sudden impact of COVID-19 during the first quarter resulted in an immediate and sharp deterioration of our financial performance and resulted in a re-evaluation of our expectations and targets. We responded quickly to this unprecedented crisis by undertaking a number of significant and rapid actions:\n\n- - Starting in March 2020, we took a number of proactive steps to conserve cash and delivered over \u00a31bn of cash savings in the year. These savings were delivered through cutting non-critical capital expenditure, significantly reducing discretionary spend, reviewing and rephasing R&D and engineering spend together with role reductions and a temporary 10% salary reduction for our senior management. We prioritised strategic investment in critical programmes, with a focus on lower-carbon solutions and digitalisation.\n- - As part of this goal to reduce all unnecessary expenditure, we also took the decision to cease invoice factoring, a practice we have used in the past to align cash flows with the physical delivery of products to our customers. This had a one-time \u00a31.1bn negative impact on free cash flow in 2020, evident in our first half results.\n\nThere was strong appetite from investors for \u00a32.0bn of new bonds i n October and we arranged a new \u00a31.0bn credit facility, both facilitated by the successful rights issue at the same time. We have made a good start on our disposal programme which aims to achieve at least \u00a32.0bn of proceeds by early 2022. We have recently announced agreements to sell Civil Nuclear Instrumentation & Control and Bergen Engines, both expected to complete in 2021, and are progressing well with our plans for further disposals beyond these.\n\n- - We appreciate all the support that our stakeholders have given us in providing sufficient liquidity to weather the COVID-19 crisis. At the same time, we recognise the significant responsibility we have to secure a sustainable, profitable and cash generative future for Rolls-Royce. As a result, we launched this year the most significant restructuring in our recent history to consolidate our Civil Aerospace footprint and reduce our cost base. It was not a decision we took lightly. By the end of 2020, approximately 7,000 roles had been removed from the Group and we are well on track to achieve our target of at least a 9,000 reduction by the end of 2022.\n- - In addition, we reduced the size of our FX hedge book by $11.8bn, reflecting the changed market outlook for Civil Aerospace which means that we now expect lower US dollar receipts in the medium term. This reduction resulted in an underlying finance charge of \u00a31.7bn in 2020. This charge is already accounted for in reported results, as a result of them being presented on a mark-to-market basis (see note 4 on page 133). From a risk management perspective, we firmly believe this was the right action to take.\n\n## 2021 Outlook\n\nWhile the near-term outlook for Civil Aerospace remains uncertain and highly sensitive to the developments of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have the benefit of a broad and diverse portfolio, with Defence expected to remain resilient and Power Systems benefitting from its shorter-cycle industrial end market exposure.\n\nWe expect free cash outflow in the region of \u00a3(2.0)bn in 2021, based on engine flying hours recovering to around 55% of 2019 levels. The cash outflow is expected to be weighted towards the first half of the year and we expect to turn cash flow positive at some point during the second half. We aim to achieve positive free cash flow of at least \u00a3750m (excluding disposals) as early as 2022. This is based on engine flying hours exceeding 80% of 2019 levels. However, the exact timing and outturn of turning cash flow positive is dependent on the shape and timing of engine flying hours recovery along with the pace of delivery of our fundamental restructuring programme.\n\n- - We took actions to substantially improve liquidity and protect our balance sheet. Despite the total free cash outflow of \u00a34.2bn in 2020, our liquidity improved to \u00a39.0bn at the end of the year. This reflected \u00a35.3bn of new borrowing facilities and a \u00a32.0bn rights issue. We were well supported by the UK Government through the CCFF loan scheme in April and by the guarantee from UK Export Finance for 80% of our new \u00a32.0bn credit facility, which was syndicated in August.",

I look back on the good progress we had been making before the impact of COVID-19 and am confident that, following completion of our\n\nfundamental restructuring programme, the Group will once again be well positioned to return to delivering much improved financial returns in the future.\n\n## DEFINING OUR ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES\n\nBusiness performance is reviewed and managed on an underlying basis. These alternative performance measures reflect the economic substance of trading in the year, including the impact of the Group's foreign exchange activities.\n\nThe tables below and to the right summarise the adjustments between reported and underlying results for cash flow, revenue, and operating profit.\n\nFor more information on the reconciliation to statutory measures for:\n\n- i. free cash flow, see note 29 on page 176; and\n- ii. revenue and operating profit, see note 2 on page 126.\n\n## Cash flow\n\n| \u00a3m                                                                                     | 2020    | 2019   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------|\n| Reported measure                                                                       |         |        |\n| Reported cash flow                                                                     | (995)   | (413)  |\n| Underlying performance measure                                                         |         |        |\n| Reported cash flow                                                                     | (995)   | (413)  |\n| Net cash flow from changes in  short-term investments, borrowings &  lease liabilities | (1,636) | 1,385  |\n| Movement in net funds from cash flows                                                  | (2,631) | 972    |\n| Exclude: Capital element of lease  payments                                            | (284)   | (271)  |\n| Movement in net funds excluding lease  liabilities                                     | (2,915) | 701    |\n| Rights issue                                                                           | (1,972) | -      |\n| Payments to shareholders                                                               | 92      | 224    |\n| Business acquisitions & disposals                                                      | 119     | (409)  |\n| Penalties paid on agreements with  investigating bodies                                | 135     | 102    |\n| Restructuring exceptional cash flow                                                    | 323     | 216    |\n| Other underlying adjustments                                                           | 33      | 39     |\n| Free cash flow                                                                         | (4,185) | 873    |\n\n## Revenue\n\n| \u00a3m                             | 2020   | 2019    |\n|--------------------------------|--------|---------|\n| Reported measure               |        |         |\n| Reported revenue               | 11,824 | 16,587  |\n| Underlying performance measure |        |         |\n| Reported revenue               | 11,824 | 16,587  |\n| Derivative & FX adjustments    | (61)   | (1,137) |\n| Underlying revenue             | 11,763 | 15,450  |\n\n## (Loss)/profit\n\n| \u00a3m                                 | 2020    | 2019   |\n|------------------------------------|---------|--------|\n| Reported measure                   |         |        |\n| Reported operating (loss)          | (2,081) | (852)  |\n| Underlying performance measure     |         |        |\n| Reported operating (loss)          | (2,081) | (852)  |\n| Derivative & FX adjustments        | (1,006) | (144)  |\n| Programme exceptional charges      | (620)   | 1,409  |\n| Restructuring exceptional charges  | 489     | 136    |\n| Acquisition accounting             | 133     | 163    |\n| Impairments & asset write-offs     | 1,417   | 84     |\n| Pension past-service credit        | (308)   | -      |\n| Other underlying adjustments       | 4       | 12     |\n| Underlying operating (loss)/profit | (1,972) | 808    |",

Civil Aerospace was the most impacted, down \u00a3(3.0)bn (37%) including \u00a3(1,061)m of COVID-related negative LTSA catch-ups. Power Systems was down \u00a3(530)m (17%) mostly due to lower OE revenue and ITP Aero was \u00a3(240)m lower (26%) with a reduction in OE partly offset by a small increase in services. Defence revenue increased by \u00a3125m (4%), showing continuity of demand from government customers and effective measures to minimise operational disruption from COVID-19.\n\n## Underlying gross loss\n\nThe loss of \u00a3(512)m was predominantly driven by a \u00a3(2.0)bn loss in Civil Aerospace (including \u00a3(1.3)bn of COVID-related charges), partly offset by savings from role reductions and cost mitigations. Power Systems, Defence and ITP Aero all contributed positively, with Defence achieving an increase on the prior year.\n\n## Commercial and administration costs\n\nReduced by \u00a363m, reflecting some of the savings from the Groupwide focus on cost mitigations in response to COVID-19.\n\n## Research and development costs\n\nAn increase of \u00a343m reflected lower capitalisation due to the maturity of key aero engine programmes, partly offset by a reduction in expenditure due to our cost mitigation efforts to re-phase non-critical spending.\n\n## Underlying operating loss\n\nThe loss of \u00a3(2.0)bn reflected the gross loss and a higher R&D charge, partly offset by higher profit from joint ventures and associates and a reduction in C&A costs.\n\n## Financing costs\n\nCosts of \u00a3(2.0)bn included a one-off underlying finance charge of \u00a3(1.7)bn, mostly taken in the first half, to reduce the size of our USD hedge book by $11.8bn in response to a lower medium-term outlook for US$ cash receipts following COVID-19.\n\n## Taxation\n\nThe \u00a3(39)m tax charge (2019: \u00a3(277)m) reflected the tax on overseas profits together with the fact that we have not recognised any deferred tax on UK losses arising in 2020. In addition, \u00a3(51)m of the deferred tax previously recognised on UK losses was derecognised.",

As the Group does not generally hedge account for forecast transactions in accordance with IFRS 9 Financial Instruments , we believe underlying figures are more representative of the trading performance by excluding the impact of period-end mark-to-market adjustments. In particular, the USD:GBP hedge book has a significant impact on the reported results. In 2020, the USD:GBP spot rate moved from 1.32 to 1.36 while the EUR:GBP rate moved from 1.18 to 1.11.\n\nUnderlying performance also excludes the effect of acquisition accounting and business disposals, impairment of goodwill and other non-current and current assets, and exceptional items. These are included in arriving at reported results. The adjustments between the underlying income statement and the reported income statement are set out in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The impact of measuring revenues and costs and the impact of valuation of assets and liabilities using the period end exchange rate rather than the achieved rate or the exchange rate that is expected to be achieved by the use of the hedge book increased reported revenues by \u00a361m (2019: \u00a31,137m) and reduced loss before financing and taxation by \u00a3998m (2019: increased profit by \u00a3145m). Underlying financing excludes the impact of revaluing monetary assets and liabilities at the period end exchange rate.\n- 2.  The underlying results exclude the fair value changes on derivative contracts held for trading. These fair value changes are subsequently recognised in the underlying results when the contracts are settled.\n- 3.  In response to the deterioration in the medium-term outlook caused by COVID-19 and the related reduction in anticipated net US dollar cash inflows, the Group has taken action to reduce the size of the US dollar hedge book by $11.8bn predominately by transacting offsetting foreign exchange forward contracts across 2020-2026, resulting in a \u00a31,689m charge to underlying results. The \u00a31,503m included in unrealised loss (shown above) is the net cost of closing out the over-hedged position in future years. The cost related to future years has been included within the underlying\n\n(Loss)/profit before\n\nperformance. It is reversed in arriving at reported performance on the basis that, the cumulative fair value changes on these derivative contracts are recognised as they arise.\n\n- 4.  In 2020, the Group incurred a cash outflow of \u00a3186m as a result of closing out $1.2bn of the $11.8bn hedge book reduction and a cash outflow of \u00a316m to settle an over-hedged jet fuel position. The realised loss of \u00a3202m is included in underlying financing costs.\n- 5.  Includes the losses on hedge ineffectiveness in the year of \u00a311m (2019: losses \u00a313m) and net fair value losses of \u00a375m (2019: profit \u00a314m) on any interest rate swaps not designated into hedging relationships for accounting purposes.\n- 6.  In 2019, abnormal wastage costs were recorded in respect of the Trent 1000, related to remediation shop visit costs, customer disruption costs and contract losses. During the year, the total estimated Trent 1000 abnormal wastage costs have reduced by \u00a3620m as a result of COVID-19 made up of \u00a3390m (a gross provision release of \u00a3560m, offset by the impact of expected actual exchange rates and the share of the costs borne by RRSAs) related to remediation shop visit costs and customer disruption costs and an improvement of \u00a3230m in the position on contract losses.\n- 7. Discount rates have increased on exceptional contract loss provisions in relation to the Trent 900 and Trent 1000.",

At 31 December 2020, the Group recorded an exceptional restructuring charge of \u00a3489m following the announcement on 20 May 2020 to reshape and resize the Group due to the financial and operational impact of COVID-19 (see note 22 for more detail).\n- 9.  The Group has assessed the carrying value of its assets given the financial and operational impact of COVID-19 on the Group's future cash flow forecasts. Consequently, a number of impairments and write-offs have been recorded at 31 December 2020. Impairments comprise: intangible assets \u00a3567m, mainly related to programme intangibles; property, plant and equipment \u00a3318m (including \u00a3219m related to site rationalisation); right-of-use assets \u00a3384m, comprising engines of \u00a3311m, \u00a369m of site rationalisation and \u00a34m of other impairments; and a \u00a324m impairment on the carrying value of investments held.\n- 10. Other write-offs include \u00a3149m of participation fees in contract assets, \u00a32m in provisions for site rationalisation, offset by \u00a3(27)m for RRSA deferred cost contributions in payables. These write-offs are primarily a result of the impact of COVID-19.\n- 11.  The effect of acquisition accounting includes the amortisation of intangible assets arising on previous acquisitions.\n- 12. The Group recorded a past service gain of \u00a3308m (of which \u00a3248m was recorded at 30 June 2020) following changes to the pension benefits under the terms of the Rolls-Royce UK Pension Fund (RRUKPF), a defined benefit scheme. In respect of the \u00a3248m gain recorded at 30 June 2020, \u00a3127m was subsequently recognised as actuarial losses through other comprehensive income at 31 December 2020 - see note 2 and 23.\n- 13. Gains/(losses) arising on the acquisitions and disposals of businesses includes the acquisition of Qinous GmbH (increasing the Group's shareholding from 24% to 100%), the sale of the North America Civil Nuclear business, the sale of the Knowledge Management Systems business and the sale of Trigno Energy Srl.\n\nTax affecting these adjustments resulted in a tax charge of \u00a3(220)m (2019: \u00a3(143)m). The charges in 2020 and 2019 are mainly due to the non-recognition of deferred tax on UK losses arising in those years. The charge in 2020 includes a tax credit of \u00a3160m in respect of the change in the UK tax rate and a tax charge of \u00a3(276)m relating to the derecognition of some of the deferred tax asset on UK losses previously recognised. The 2019 charge included \u00a3(86)m relating to the derecognition of UK deferred tax assets on foreign exchange and commodity financial assets and liabilities.\n\n## G R O U P   F U N D S   F L O W",

        "page_content": "## F I N A N C I A L   R E V I E W\n\n## Free cash flow\n\n## Movement on provisions\n\nGroup free cash outflow of \u00a3(4,185)m deteriorated from a \u00a3873m i nflow in 2019. The key drivers of this outflow were significantly lower engine flying hour receipts as global travel dramatically declined and working capital outflows, including the decision to cease invoice discounting, as our OE and aftermarket volumes declined. Trent 1000 in-services cash costs were \u00a3(524)m (2019: \u00a3(578)m).\n\nKey changes in the funds flow items are described below:\n\n## Depreciation, amortisation and impairments\n\nThe decrease of \u00a3(117)m was largely driven by lower overall additions across intangible assets and property, plant and equipment as a result of management actions to reduce cash expenditure and a \u00a3102m adjustment to residual value guarantees which is non-cash and increased underlying operating profit.\n\n## Lease payments (capital plus interest)\n\nLease payments were higher than prior year largely due to changes in FX achieved rates used to convert US dollar lease payments into GBP.\n\n## Additions of intangible assets\n\nExpenditure included \u00a3(232)m capitalised R&D (2019: \u00a3481m), lower than 2019 due to completion of capitalisation of the Trent 1000 and Pearl 15 engine R&D, reflecting the maturity of these programmes, and no further capitalisation on the Pearl 700 programme.\n\n## Purchases of property, plant and equipment\n\nInvestment was lower than 2019 primarily as a result of management actions to reduce cash costs to mitigate the impact of COVID-19.\n\n## Decrease in inventory\n\nThe \u00a3588m decrease in 2020 (2019: \u00a3(43)m increase) was led by COVID-19 driven demand reductions as well as significant improvement measures delivered in Civil Aerospace, partly offset by certain actions to safeguard necessary parts supply in 2021.\n\n## Movement in receivables/payables/contract balances (excluding Civil Aerospace LTSA)\n\nThe \u00a3(2,207)m movement in 2020 reflected:\n\n- - \u00a30.4bn increase in receivables reflecting the decision to cease i nvoice discounting (\u00a3(1.1)bn increase), partly offset by significantly lower trading activity especially in Civil Aerospace.\n- - \u00a31.8bn reduction in payables reflecting lower amounts owed to suppliers, JVs and Risk and Revenue Share Partners (RRSPs) due to COVID-19 led demand reductions. In addition, reduction in OE deposits reflecting utilisation in Civil Aerospace. This was partly offset by new deposits in Defence and an increase in the Civil Aerospace OE engine concessions payable, due to aircraft delivery delays and associated concession payment deferrals.\n\n## Movement in underlying Civil Aerospace net LTSA balance\n\nThe LTSA net balance increased by \u00a3479m. There was a significant reduction in widebody and regional invoiced engine flying hour receipts during 2020 due to lower flying activity, resulting in a \u00a3(582) m underlying reduction to the net LTSA balance as revenues traded exceeded invoiced flying hour receipts. However, this was more than offset by the impact of \u00a31,061m of contract catch-ups, principally driven by a forecast reduction in engine flying hour receipts due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which reduced revenue recognised during the year.\n\nThe \u00a3(195)m movement reflected a decrease in the provision balance driven by Trent 1000 provision utilisation during the period partly offset by new provisions charges (details on page 163), largely as a result of COVID-19 which include the impact from the up-front recognition of future losses on a small number of loss-making Civil Aerospace contracts.\n\n## Interest\n\nThe net payment of \u00a3(75)m in 2020 was \u00a32m higher than prior year, reflecting movements in the overall total amount of debt and interest rates. \u00a35.3bn of additional debt was raised during 2020. At 31 December 2020, \u00a35.5bn of total debt was undrawn.\n\n## Contributions to defined benefit pensions\n\nCash contributions were \u00a3160m lower than the charge on the income statement (2019: \u00a39m higher). The \u00a3169m year-on-year movement reflected early payment in 2019 of contributions due in 2020 and deferral of certain 2020 contributions into 2021.\n\n## Taxation\n\nThe cash tax payments in 2020 were \u00a3(231)m compared to \u00a3(175)m in 2019. The increase reflected higher payments in Germany, largely due to timing.\n\n## Payments to shareholders\n\nThe \u00a3(92)m interim dividend was announced in August 2019 and paid in January 2020. Reflecting the Group's financial priorities and the challenging macro environment, the Board did not recommend a final dividend in respect of 2019.\n\n## Rights issue\n\nIn November 2020, a 10:3 rights issue raised net proceeds of \u00a31,972m.\n\n## Acquisitions and disposals\n\nNet costs of \u00a3(119)m included the acquisitions of Qinous, Kinolt and Servowatch; offset by disposal proceeds related to Civil Nuclear North America, Knowledge Management Systems, Trigno, Exostar and a L'Orange earn-out adjustment and M&A costs.\n\n## Exceptional Group restructuring\n\nPayments of \u00a3(323)m relating to the 2020 fundamental restructuring programme were made in 2020, of which \u00a355m related to restructuring capital expenditure.\n\n## Payment of financial penalties\n\nThe penultimate payment of \u00a3(135)m relating to the deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) was made in January 2020.\n\n## Other underlying adjustments\n\nOutflow of \u00a3(33)m includes timing of cash flows on a prior period disposal where the Group retains the responsibility for collecting cash before passing it on to the acquirer.\n\n## Net cash flow from changes in borrowings (excluding lease liabilities)\n\nDuring the year, the Group issued \u00a31,972m ($1,000m, \u20ac750m and \u00a3545m) of bond notes as well as \u00a3300m of commercial paper under the Covid Corporate Financing Facility. The Group also repaid a maturing $500m (\u00a3328m) bond.",

Additions of \u00a3364m primarily related to programme development in Civil Aerospace and investment in software applications. Acquisitions of Kinolt Group, Qinous GmbH and Servowatch Systems added \u00a3137m. There was a \u00a3137m FX impact and amortisation was \u00a3(323)m.\n\n## Property, plant and equipment\n\nNet decrease of \u00a3(283)m included impairments of \u00a3(332)m and depreciation of \u00a3(489)m partly offset by \u00a338m FX impact and additions of \u00a3553m. The additions were lower than the prior year as spending was limited to critical infrastructure projects.\n\n## Right-of-use assets\n\nNet reduction of \u00a3(596)m was driven by impairments of \u00a3(386)m, primarily of lease engines in Civil Aerospace and land and buildings as part of our footprint consolidation. The depreciation charge was \u00a3(346)m. Additions were \u00a3135m, \u00a392m lower than the prior year.\n\n## Contract assets and liabilities\n\nThe net liability balance increased by \u00a3(186)m, of which \u00a3(417)m related to the Civil Aerospace LTSA balance and included foreign exchange of \u00a362m and negative LTSA catch-ups of \u00a3(1,061)m. The remainder largely covered reduction in deposits in Civil Aerospace partly offset by new deposits in Defence.\n\n## Working capital\n\nThe \u00a3570m net current asset position reflected a \u00a31.8bn change on the prior year.\n\n- - Receivables increased by \u00a30.4bn as a \u00a31.1bn reduction in invoice discounting was partly offset by lower trading activity in Civil Aerospace.\n- - Payables reduced by \u00a31.8bn primarily due to COVID-19 led demand reductions and comparatively stronger Q4 2019 trading activity.\n\n- - Inventory reduced by \u00a30.5bn largely due to COVID-19 led demand reductions and parts rescheduling in Civil Aerospace partly offset by growth in Defence to protect 2021 deliveries and support the supply chain.\n- - The movement also included a financial penalty payment of \u00a3135m related to agreements reached with investigating authorities in January 2017.\n\n## Provisions\n\nThe \u00a3835m decrease reflected net restructuring charges of \u00a3(373)m, of which \u00a3206m was utilised in 2020 and Trent 1000 provisions utilisation and release of \u00a3541m and \u00a3560m respectively.\n\n## Net debt\n\nIncreased to \u00a3(3.6)bn (including lease liabilities) primarily driven by free cash outflow of \u00a3(4.2)bn partly offset by \u00a32.0bn of rights issue proceeds.\n\n## Net financial assets and liabilities\n\nThe \u00a3164m change was primarily driven by the utilisation of derivatives of \u00a3246m partially offset by the fair value movement in currency exchange rates and other derivatives.\n\n## Net post-retirement scheme surpluses/deficits\n\nThe \u00a3(474)m movement was driven by reduction in the UK surplus reflecting changes to members' benefits as part of restructuring the UK pension, closure of the scheme and deferral of company contributions. There have also been changes in financial and demographic assumptions across both the UK and overseas schemes. See note 23.\n\n## US$ hedge book\n\nDue to the impact of COVID-19 on Civil Aerospace our forecast future US$ receipts reduced significantly. As a result, we took the necessary decision to reduce the size of our hedge book by $11.8bn to $25bn. Our US$ hedge book runs to 2028. The total cost of closing out the overhedged position is \u00a3(1.7)bn, of which \u00a3(186)m was incurred in 2020. The remainder of the cash outflow will be incurred over the next six years.",

Large engine deliveries fell by 48% to 264 and large engine flying hours fell to 43% of 2019 levels as travel restrictions limited air traffic. Business aviation was less severely impacted, with engine deliveries down 16%. In response to the market impact, we have undertaken a fundamental restructuring of Civil Aerospace, which will substantially reduce our fixed cost base and position the business to deliver healthy profits and cash generation as the market recovers.\n\n| \u00a3m                                  | 2020    | 2019   | Change    | Organic  change   |\n|-------------------------------------|---------|--------|-----------|-------------------|\n| Underlying revenue                  | 5,089   | 8,107  | (37)%     | (37)%             |\n| Underlying OE revenue               | 2,298   | 3,246  | (29)%     | (29)%             |\n| Underlying services revenue         | 2,791   | 4,861  | (43)%     | (43)%             |\n| Underlying gross (loss)/profit      | (2,005) | 622    | (422)%    | (422)%            |\n| Gross margin %                      | (39.4)% | 7.7%   | (47.1)%pt | (47.1)%pt         |\n| Commercial and administration costs | (302)   | (306)  | (1)%      | (2)%              |\n| Research and development costs      | (436)   | (374)  | 17%       | 16%               |\n| Joint ventures and associates       | 169     | 102    | 66%       | 66%               |\n| Underlying operating (loss)/profit  | (2,574) | 44     | (2,618)   | (2,612)           |\n| Underlying operating margin %       | (50.6)% | 0.5%   | (51.1)%pt | (51.0)%pt         |",

Business jet deliveries were resilient in the first half of the year but reduced during the second half as the airframers adjusted to the impact on demand from COVID-19.\n- - Large engine LTSA flying hours were 43% of 2019 level. Flying hour performance was significantly more robust in newer engine programmes than more mature types.\n- - Business aviation LTSA engine flying hours were resilient, however there was a significant reduction in both regional and V2500 flying hours.\n- - Large engine LTSA major service visits were 11% lower than prior year, particularly in the second half of the year when we saw a substantial reduction in activity.\n- - Roles reduced by approximately 5,500 (20%), with most of the departures taking place in the second half of 2020 as a result of the fundamental restructuring programme.\n- - Agreement reached with Airbus to extend Trent XWB-84 exclusive position on A350-900 to 2030.\n- - Underlying revenue reduced by 37% to \u00a35.1bn (2019: \u00a38.1bn). This decline was driven by the reduction in engine delivery volumes, particularly for large engines, lower aftermarket revenues reflecting fall in shop visit volumes, and included a \u00a3(1.1)bn impact from negative LTSA contract catch-ups.\n- - Underlying gross loss of \u00a3(2.0)bn, \u00a3(2.6)bn lower than 2019. This reflected:\n- \u00b7 \u00a3(1.3)bn of largely COVID-related one-time charges:\n- \u00b7 LTSA catch-ups: \u00a3(974)m impact to profit from negative LTSA catch-ups, mainly driven by a forecast reduction in engine flying hour receipts as a result of COVID-19 and principally impacting mature engine programmes;\n- \u00b7 up-front recognition of future losses: primarily due to COVID-19 certain contracts have either become loss-making or have seen an increase in expected losses, driving a \u00a3(213)m charge; and\n- \u00b7 \u00a3(86)m charge reflecting specific customer provisions due to the impact of COVID-19 on the civil aviation industry and our customers' financial positions.\n- \u00b7 A material reduction in trading performance, primarily reflecting the impact of COVID-19:\n- \u00b7 a substantial reduction in large engine aftermarket, driven by lower shop visit volumes, adverse margin mix on LTSA shop visits, and reduced time & materials (T&M) profits;\n- \u00b7 lower OE profits from business aviation and reduced volumes of large spare engine sales, which offset the benefit from lower installed widebody engine volumes; and\n- \u00b7 a material impact in 2020 from under-recovery of fixed costs.\n- - Commercial and administration costs were relatively unchanged year-over-year, with cost reduction actions delivered in the year reflected more heavily in cost of sales and R&D spend.\n- - Research and development costs of \u00a3(436)m reflected a significant reduction in capitalisation during the period due to the maturity of key aero engine programmes partly offset by a reduction in expenditure due to the reducing investment burden on our new engine programmes and the rephasing of some R&D spending in light of COVID-19. Spending continued to shift towards next generation gas turbine technology and low carbon solutions such as electric and hybrid-electric aircraft.\n- - Underlying operating loss of \u00a3(2.6)bn reflected the fall in gross profit and slightly higher R&D charge, partly offset by an increase in profits from joint ventures and associates.\n- - Trading cash flow was a \u00a3(4.6)bn outflow during the year (2019: \u00a3419m inflow). This deterioration was driven by significantly lower engine flying hour receipts as well as a material working capital outflow, including the one-time impact from the cessation of invoice factoring in 2020.\n- - Trent 1000 and Trent XWB update: During 2020 in-service cash costs on Trent 1000 were in line with guidance at \u00a3(524)m and in June we reached our goal of zero aircraft on ground (AoG) due to the durability issues. There was a \u00a3620m exceptional credit reflecting a \u00a3390m net improvement in the outlook for future in-service cash costs, alongside a \u00a3230m improvement in expected future losses on our small number of loss-making contracts primarily due to the impact of COVID-19 on flying activity. Early identification and action regarding durability issues on the Trent XWB announced in August 2020 did not result in any grounded aircraft and it was not necessary to provide for any material additional costs in the year.",

        "page_content": "## Operational and strategic review\n\nThe aviation industry was severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and the travel restrictions put in place by governments around the world in response.\n\nAfter more than a decade of growth, commercial air traffic fell by 66% during 2020. While there was a gradual recovery, it was slower than expected and largely halted in December due to the impact of the second wave of COVID-19 across much of the world. Throughout the year, we worked tirelessly to ensure that our airline customers could continue to use their Trent engines - utilising new remote inspection techniques in order to abide with national restrictions on movement or working practices - or store them properly so they can be readily put back into service when restrictions ease.\n\nOur airline customers also adopted various mitigating measures in 2020, including postponing investment in new aircraft. This led to a material reduction in large commercial aircraft production from both major airframers, Boeing and Airbus.\n\nWhile business jet demand was more robust than widebody, it was not immune from the effects of the pandemic and travel restrictions. During 2020, we delivered the 8,000th engine from our site in Dahlewitz, Germany, and our BR725 engine, which powers Gulfstream's G650 business aircraft family, achieved one million flying hours.\n\nThe effects of COVID-19 are expected to be felt in our markets for a number of years. To respond to the new medium-term outlook and return the business to profitability, we launched a fundamental restructuring of our Civil Aerospace business. The programme includes:\n\n- - a significant reduction in Civil Aerospace headcount, representing a majority of the 9,000 roles to be removed across the Group by the end of 2022. This has been progressed at pace, with over 5,500 roles removed from Civil Aerospace during 2020, primarily through voluntary severance;\n- - a major footprint review to reduce fixed costs. This comprises a reduction from three widebody assembly and test facilities to one, as well as consolidating production facilities across a number of widebody components; and\n- - linked to this footprint review, we have announced plans to enhance the scope of ITP Aero. This involves the transfer of our engine structures activities in Barnoldswick, UK, into ITP Aero, as well as the transfer of our site and workforce in Hucknall, UK, which manufactures a range of aero-engine parts. These changes will deliver cost reductions for Civil Aerospace and increase the value of ITP Aero.\n\nOutside our response to COVID-19, excellent progress was made during 2020 in resolving the Trent 1000 in-service issues. Partially aided by the lower aircraft utilisation due to the pandemic, we were able to meet our target to reduce the number of aircraft on ground to singledigits by mid-year, subsequently reaching zero. We now have a buffer of available engines to safeguard against any risk of future disruption.\n\nDespite the COVID-19 pandemic, construction work on Testbed 80, the world's largest testbed, was completed during the year and in early 2021 we conducted our first test run on a Trent XWB engine.\n\nLonger term, we continue to position ourselves for the transition to a low carbon future for commercial aviation. Our next generation gas turbine, UltraFan, will progress to final assembly in 2021. The parts for our first engine demonstrator went into production in 2020 including the power gearbox, fan blades and fan case.\n\nIn November, we undertook successful ground tests using 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for the first time in a Trent 1000 engine, with additional tests planned in 2021 using our Pearl 700 business jet engine. These tests aim to demonstrate that our engines can operate with 100% SAF as a 'drop-in' alternative to conventional jet fuel. This exceeds current certification requirements which limit SAF to a 50% blend. We believe SAF represents a vital solution to the challenge of decarbonising long-haul travel.\n\nAt the smaller end of the market, electric and hybrid-electric technologies are set to power a new generation of fixed-wing and vertical take-off aircraft, providing an opportunity for us to disrupt a new market. In the small propeller category, our first prototype of an electric propulsion unit to serve small propeller aircraft with two to four seats, the RRP70, gained an agreed certification plan with EASA; and in the commuter market we announced plans to work with leading general aviation manufacturers, Tecnam, to jointly develop an all-electric 11-seater aircraft. In the urban air mobility space, we provided the propulsion system for the CityAirbus demonstrator which successfully completed its flight test programme in 2020. Finally, work on our ACCEL all-electric aircraft programme continued in 2020 as we completed ground testing of the technology that will power what we hope will be the world's fastest all-electric plane, with a record breaking attempt planned for 2021.\n\n## Civil Aerospace outlook\n\nThe near-term environment for Civil Aerospace remains highly uncertain. We continue to plan for a range of recovery scenarios, including the risk of further setbacks to the recovery in air travel caused by new strains of the COVID-19 virus. However, our central assumption is for a gradual market recovery in 2021, with a slow start to the year but accelerating in the second half as global vaccine roll-outs progress and travel restrictions ease.\n\nWe anticipate large engine flying hours of approximately 55% of 2019 levels in 2021 (2020: 43%), with a strong second-half weighting as the recovery accelerates, and approximately 80% of 2019 levels in 2022. Engine deliveries will remain low with 200 to 250 large engines and 100 to 150 business jet engine deliveries planned for 2021.\n\nOur severe but plausible downside scenario assumes approximately 45% EFH in 2021 and 70% in 2022, both compared to the 2019 level.

Despite COVID-19, we made significant progress against our medium-term strategy during 2020, expanding our power generation product portfolio, growing sales in China, and expanding our gas and low carbon offerings. While near-term conditions remain challenging, we believe Power Systems is positioned to recover relatively quickly when the macroenvironment improves.\n\n| \u00a3m                                  | 2020   | 2019  1   | Change  2   | Organic  change   |\n|-------------------------------------|--------|-----------|-------------|-------------------|\n| Underlying revenue                  | 2,745  | 3,184     | (14)%       | (17)%             |\n| Underlying OE revenue               | 1,794  | 2,183     | (18)%       | (21)%             |\n| Underlying services revenue         | 951    | 1,001     | (5)%        | (6)%              |\n| Underlying gross profit             | 681    | 878       | (22)%       | (25)%             |\n| Gross margin %                      | 24.8%  | 27.6%     | (2.8)%pt    | (2.7)%pt          |\n| Commercial and administration costs | (337)  | (343)     | (2)%        | (6)%              |\n| Research and development costs      | (167)  | (166)     | 1%          | (2)%              |\n| Joint ventures and associates       | 1      | (2)       | -           | -                 |\n| Underlying operating profit         | 178    | 367       | (51)%       | (52)%             |\n| Underlying operating margin %       | 6.5%   | 11.5%     | (5.0)%pt    | (4.9)%pt          |\n\n- 1 The underlying results for 2019 have been restated to reclassify Bergen Engines AS and the Civil Nuclear Instrumentation and Control business as non-core.\n- 2 The impact of M&A was \u00a355m on revenue and \u00a3nil on underlying operating profit.",

        "page_content": "## Financial overview\n\n- - Order intake of \u00a32.7bn was 17% lower year-on-year, a book-to-bill of 1.0x during 2020. Commercial marine was impacted by lower tourism and yacht production facility closures, while economic uncertainty led to a deferral of capital spending across power generation and industrial customers. However, there were signs of recovery in order intake in the second half and the underlying demand in key areas including mission-critical back-up generation remained strong.\n- - Underlying revenue reduced by 17% to \u00a32,745m. This reflected a fall in industrial and power generation revenues, with marine relatively stable due to strong governmental demand. OE revenue was down 21% while Services were more resilient, down just 6%.\n- - Underlying gross profit of \u00a3681m was 25% lower year-over-year. This reflects the lower sales, reduced factory utilisation, and an adverse mix effect due to the sharper fall in high-margin aftermarket spare parts.\n- - Commercial and administration costs fell 6% to \u00a3(337)m primarily reflecting management actions to mitigate costs.\n- - Research and development costs of \u00a3(167)m were focused on the i nvestment in lower carbon areas across our portfolio. This includes our expanding gas engine family, electric and hybrid-electric solutions (supported by the acquisition of battery storage company Qinous), and hydrogen solutions, such as our new co-operation with Daimler on hydrogen fuel cells.\n- - Underlying operating profit of \u00a3178m with a margin of 6.5%, 4.9%pts lower than prior year, reflecting the drop in gross profit, partly offset by the improvements in C&A and R&D.\n\n## Operational and strategic review\n\nCOVID-19 substantially impacted Power Systems during 2020, with delays to certain large projects, as well as a drop in new orders and aftermarket sales. Industrial markets were most affected, as the impact of COVID-19 was compounded by low commodity prices in mining and oil & gas, while project delays weakened construction sales. Other areas of Power Systems were more resilient, notably the Chinese market and governmental marine sales.\n\nDespite COVID-19, we reached major landmarks across all of our five key strategic opportunities during the year. These five opportunities are: capturing growth in power generation, increasing share in China, expanding our gas portfolio, enhancing services, and shifting towards integrated system solutions with a renewable energy focus.\n\nIn power generation, economic uncertainty impacted order intake during 2020 however, longer term, we continue to anticipate rising demand led by mission-critical back-up power solutions for data centres and hospitals.\n\nIn China, economic conditions recovered quickly and we continued to drive our strategy of partnerships and local production. In November, we announced a record level of provisional agreements at the China International Import Expo, for almost 1,000 MTU engines and systems. In addition, we signed two new strategic partnerships with Chinese companies from the marine, power generation and mining industries.\n\nOur gas portfolio expansion continued with the launch of the new MTU Series 500 engine for power generation, which will initially be offered for operation with natural gas but from end 2021 will also be available for power by biogas. The 500 series is also hydrogen-ready, which means that the engines can be converted to hydrogen operation at a later date. In addition, 2020 saw the premiere of our twin 16-cylinder gas engines with Dutch shipping company Doeksen.\n\nIn July, we took a further step in enhancing our services platform, signing a memorandum of understanding with MAN Energy Solutions to collaborate on m\u00fda, an open asset and fleet management system.\n\nMost importantly, we reached a number of milestones in our effort to transition towards complete system solutions and low carbon products. These milestones included:\n\n- - the creation of a new organisational unit called 'Power Lab' to focus on innovative energy solutions to support our net zero drive;\n- - significant advancements in battery storage products, beginning with the acquisition of a majority stake in storage specialist Qinous i n January, which is now central to our microgrid solutions business. We also increased our capacity for producing battery containers with the announcement of a new production facility in Bavaria;\n- - the acquisition of Kinolt, a specialist in dynamic, uninterruptible power supply systems, completes our product offering in back-up power generation; and\n- - the announcement of a partnership with Daimler Truck AG on stationary fuel-cell generators, as CO 2 neutral emergency power generators for safety-critical facilities including data centres and hospitals.\n\n## Power Systems outlook\n\nUncertainty remains over the near-term economic outlook. However, based on Power Systems' short-cycle exposures and the growth potential in key markets such as China, we expect an improvement in order intake during the first half of 2021, converting into a recovery in sales from the second half of the year with revenues returning to approximately 2019 levels in 2022. Longer term there are significant growth opportunities for Power Systems across both existing activities (notably in mission-critical back-up power and expansion in China) and in new low carbon solutions such as microgrids, hydrogen and hybrid-electric power solutions.",

        "page_content": "## Financial overview\n\n- - Order intake was \u00a32.4bn, representing a book-to-bill ratio of 0.7x. This follows on from a record order intake of \u00a35.3bn in 2019 (1.6x book-to-bill) and an average book-to-bill ratio of 1.2x between 2015 and 2019. Order cover for 2021 is in excess of 90% and the healthy order book currently represents approximately 2.3 years of Defence sales.\n- - Underlying revenue increased by 4% to \u00a33.4bn. This was largely driven by higher LiftSystem aftermarket revenues as the in-fleet service expands together with international sales of the EJ200 engine powering the Eurofighter Typhoon. Naval sales and UK parts sales also improved compared to the prior year.\n- - Underlying gross profit of \u00a3686m was 3% higher year-over-year. This reflects the higher sales volumes, with gross margin relatively stable at 20.4%.\n- - Commercial and administration costs were 4% lower year-on-year at \u00a3(151)m despite the underlying business growth.\n- - Research and development costs fell by \u00a39m despite an increase in expenditure on key strategic programmes in the period to support new growth opportunities.\n- - Underlying operating profit increased by 8% to \u00a3448m, with margins 0.5%pts higher. This reflected the stronger gross profit and modestly lower C&A and R&D charges outlined above.\n\n## Operational and strategic review\n\n2020 was another strong year for Defence with a healthy pipeline of orders and steady growth in revenue and profits. The business' resilient revenue growth with low cyclicality and high cash conversion provided support for the Group.\n\nOperations were largely unaffected by COVID-19, including the $400m investment project to revitalise our Indianapolis facilities. The new building opened during 2020, with work now ongoing to demolish the previous site. Other milestones included the delivery of the 400th V-22 Osprey tiltrotor, which is powered by our AE 1107C engine, and further test flying for the MQ-25 Stingray aircraft, which will provide unmanned, carrier-based air-to-air refuelling.\n\nConsistent demand for parts and services in Defence helped support the broader aerospace supply chain, particularly those suppliers suffering from reduced activity in commercial aviation. In addition, the growth opportunities in our Defence business enabled some of the experienced colleagues whose roles were removed in the Civil Aerospace restructuring to remain in the Group.\n\n2020 has seen a number of notable orders. The German Air Force placed an order for 56 EJ200 engines and Rolls-Royce's MT30 engine was chosen by the Republic of Korea Navy for its FFX Batch III frigate. Additionally, the UK selected the Rolls-Royce nuclear propulsion system, Pressurised Water Reactor 3 (PWR3), as the preferred bidder for the next generation of attack submarines.\n\nProgress was also promising on new opportunities in the US, including the B-52 re-engining competition and the Future Vertical Long Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) . Combined, these two programmes have an estimated potential lifetime value for Rolls-Royce of over \u00a37bn. For the B-52, we are proposing the F130 engine, which is based on the proven and efficient BR725 commercial engine. The outcome i s expected to be announced in 2021. On the FLRAA competition, we reached agreement with Bell Textron in 2020 to provide the propulsion for the V-280 Valor aircraft as it moves forward in the competition. A final decision is expected by 2022. Finally, our LibertyWorks team completed rig testing on a new core design for a small engine, successfully executing a rapid prototyping plan from design to test in under a year; and delivered an upgraded thermal management and power system for directed energy applications to Lockheed Martin for integration and testing.\n\nI n the UK, the Tempest programme welcomed new partners in 2020. A trilateral memorandum of understanding was signed by the respective Defence Ministers of the UK, Sweden and Italy, and trilateral industry discussions were initiated with leading defence companies, in preparation for the formal launch of the concept and assessment phase in 2021. Work continued at pace on the programme, with our engineers developing advanced combustion system technology and exploring composite materials and additive manufacturing to produce lightweight, more power-dense components capable of operating at higher temperatures. Rolls-Royce is the leading propulsion company in Team Tempest, which is expected to secure our combat engine revenues and expertise for years to come.\n\nWe also announced a new strategic partnership agreement with Reaction Engines. This aims to develop high-speed aircraft propulsion systems and to explore the application of their thermal management technology within civil and defence aerospace gas turbine engines, as well as hybrid-electric systems.\n\n## Defence outlook\n\nWe anticipate another good year for Defence in 2021. Revenue is expected to be stable, with a strong level of order cover coming into the year. Operating margins are also expected to be broadly flat at approximately 13%. We continue to pursue large opportunities in the US which would drive a step-change in growth prospects for Defence, notably the B-52 engine replacement programme for the US Air Force and the Future Vertical Long Range Assault Aircraft competition for the US Army. We also continue to progress Project Tempest in UK air combat. Finally, we are investing in adjacent technologies such as small engines and directed energy power systems in order to drive further medium-term growth.",

        "page_content": "## Financial overview\n\n- - Underlying revenue was \u00a3705m, down 26% versus 2019, primarily reflecting lower engine (OE) volumes on civil programmes, particularly in widebody. Defence OE revenue was more resilient, supported by EJ200 orders. Service revenue increased 8%.\n- - Commercial and administration costs of \u00a3(38)m were 40% lower year-on-year, including some benefit from management actions to reduce discretionary costs, with headcount 13% lower at the year-end compared to 2019.\n- - Research and development costs were \u00a36m lower in the period mainly due to phasing of projects.\n- - Underlying operating profit of \u00a368m, 39% lower year-on-year, reflecting the lower OE revenues and under-utilisation of the fixed cost base.\n\n## Operational and strategic review\n\nSimilar to the trends seen in Civil Aerospace, ITP Aero's 2020 performance was materially impacted by COVID-19 as the majority of the business' sales relate to civil aviation. ITP Aero's largest exposure is on Rolls-Royce widebody programmes, however the business also has significant activities in the business aviation and narrowbody markets. This diversity was beneficial in 2020 as these markets were less impacted than widebody which relies on demand for long-haul travel. In the defence market, COVID-19 has had a limited impact, with the reduction in sales in 2020 largely driven by phasing on key programmes. In response to the impact of COVID-19 on ITP Aero's core markets, we launched a substantial restructuring programme which aims to reduce ITP Aero's global headcount by approximately 1 5% by the end of the first half of 2021. In addition, in conjunction with the footprint review in Civil Aerospace, we proposed an increase to the business' manufacturing, engineering, and supply chain capabilities. This involves the integration of Civil Aerospace's facility and workforce i n Hucknall, UK, into ITP Aero, as well as the transfer of aero engines structures activities into ITP, currently carried out in Barnoldswick, UK. These actions will enhance ITP Aero's position as a major tier-one aerospace company. Our planned sale of ITP Aero is progressing well with ongoing conversations with a number of potential buyers.\n\nDespite COVID-19, ITP Aero made further progress on future programmes in 2020, including the design and manufacture of the first intermediate pressure turbine (IPT) casing for the future Rolls-Royce UltraFan engine.\n\nIn defence, we formalised our participation as the leader of the engine technology pillar in Spain for the next generation weapon system/future combat air system (NGWS/FCAS). In November, the EUROJET consortium signed a contract to provide 56 new EJ200 engines for the German Air Force's new order of Tranche 4 Typhoon aircraft. ITP Aero is a member of the consortium alongside RollsRoyce, MTU Aero Engines and Avio Aero.\n\n## ITP Aero outlook\n\nWe expect some stabilisation in 2021 followed by a recovery in our performance from 2022 onwards reflecting the wider recovery in commercial aerospace as well as the outcomes from our actions to reduce costs to improve profitability. We remain focused on cost savings, including the workforce capacity adjustment of approximately 15% globally from 2019 levels, which is already well underway and will be completed by the end of the first half of 2021. Our planned sale of ITP Aero is progressing well with ongoing conversations with a number of potential buyers.",

We are committed to conducting our business in an environmentally, ethically and socially responsible manner to create value for us and our stakeholders.\n\nAs a leading industrial technology company, Rolls-Royce has a key role to play in creating a more sustainable future. Our sustainability approach is driven by an understanding of the i mpacts we have on society and the environment, and we seek to use that understanding to inform our strategy and decision-making.\n\nOur global governance framework sets out how we govern our business, manage risk and opportunity, reward appropriately and maintain consistent operating standards across the Group. Sustainability is a core component of this.\n\n## Our approach\n\nThe most significant contribution Rolls-Royce can make to a more sustainable future is to reduce the carbon impacts of our product portfolio and to accelerate the decarbonisation of the sectors in which we operate. We are well positioned to play a crucial role in the transition to a low carbon global economy. We have recognised this in our\n\n2020 Highlights\n\nCompleted strategic review of our sustainability approach\n\nAnnounced commitment to net zero carbon by 2050\n\nAchieved second position in our sector in the DJSI\n\nIntroduced ESG metric into 2021 remuneration policy\n\ncommitment to reach net zero carbon by 2050, ratified through the UN Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C campaign, which builds on our existing 2030 target for operations and facility emissions. In 2021, we will produce our roadmap to achieve this, including setting interim targets and milestones. To support this, we are pivoting our R&D expenditure towards low carbon solutions including hybrid, hydrogen and electric power; in the short term, we intend to dedicate approximately 20% of our annual R&D expenditure to these technologies by 2023, an increase from 4% in 2019. The transition to low carbon must be coupled with a broader assessment of our impacts. This informs our sustainability approach. We work to create a more environmentally, ethically and socially responsible and resilient business.\n\nThe short-term impact of COVID-19 on our business has placed considerable strain on our workforce and has negatively affected progress against some of our key sustainability targets and measures, particularly those normalised by revenue. Yet our longer-term ambitions to be a sustainable business and play a key role in the transition to net zero carbon have not waned.\n\nDuring 2020, we completed a strategic review of our sustainability approach, overseen by the Safety, Ethics & Sustainability Committee (page 101). This involved a review of our material non-financial issues, including a consideration of the potential i mpact and the extent of our ability to influence these issues, as well as the views from a range of stakeholders including employees, customers and investors. As a result, we have revised our sustainability materiality assessment, and identified our key contributions to the UN Sustainable Development Goals. This will help inform our sustainability-related focus going forward.\n\n## Introducing our sustainability framework\n\nSustainability remains a broad and complex topic. We have introduced a set of guiding principles, underpinned by our values and behaviours, to support the continued integration of sustainability into decision-making at all levels of the organisation:\n\n- - understanding and minimising our impact on the environment, particularly in the context of climate change;\n- - seeking opportunities to adopt circular business practices to promote responsible resource consumption;\n- - making a positive contribution to the communities within which we operate;\n- - acting with integrity and considering the potential and actual ethical implications of all business decisions;\n- - ensuring zero harm to the people who work for or with us and give them the best opportunity to be at their best; and\n- - reporting and communicating with our key stakeholders transparently and honestly.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on our sustainability approach, including Group policies and performance data, see rolls-royce.com.",

        "page_content": "## LEADING THE TRANSITION TO NET ZERO\n\nTo meet the demands of a growing, more connected society, the power that matters must be sustainable power. Our technology will play a fundamental role in enabling the transition to a low carbon global economy.\n\nWe are determined to use our position as a global power group to play a role in creating a resilient, inclusive, net zero carbon future. During 2020, we ratified this ambition by joining the UN Race to Zero and UN Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C campaigns.\n\nAchieving net zero carbon will require a wholesale transformation of the systems that make up the backbone of our global economy, including power, transport and the built environment, the very sectors in which reducing emissions is the hardest. At Rolls-Royce, we believe there are technological solutions to decarbonising these vital parts of the economy. With the right policy, environment and public support, we have the potential to pioneer game-changing technology that will help deliver a net zero carbon future.\n\n## Our decarbonisation strategy\n\nThrough our decarbonisation strategy, we intend to become a net zero carbon company across our value chain. We have a target to achieve net\n\nzero greenhouse gas emissions in our operations and facilities (scope 1 + 2 emissions) by 2030, excluding product test emissions \u00b9. By 2050, we aim to mitigate these remaining emissions, which play a key role in product development and safety programmes, to become a carbon neutral business. More fundamentally, we are determined to use our capabilities and expertise to achieve and accelerate the decarbonisation of the sectors we serve (namely scope 3 emissions associated with the use of sold products). By 2050, we intend to make all our products compatible with net zero carbon emission operations and we will pioneer new industrial technologies that connect, power and protect a net zero carbon economy. We have built upon previous work on climate scenario planning to assess the viability of this decarbonisation strategy. Lastly, we have considered the impact of our climate change plan in our financial statements (see page 114).\n\n## Achieving carbon neutral operations and facilities\n\nWe have a target to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions in operations and facilities by 2030 \u00b9. This will be delivered through continued investment in onsite renewable energy installations; the procurement of renewable energy; and continued investment in energy efficiency improvements to reduce our overall energy demands and operating costs. We also have plans to expand the utilisation of Rolls-Royce technologies, such as microgrids, across our own estate.\n\nDuring 2020, absolute emissions of GHG associated with  our  operations  fell  by  55  ktCO 2 e  to 229 ktCO 2 e from 284 ktCO 2 e in 2019. This represents a reduction of 52% since 2014. The yearon-year  reduction  was  driven  by  lower operational activity as a result of COVID-19 and further decarbonisation activities across our European estate, including switching to renewable electricity suppliers at Oberursel and Dahlewitz, Germany, and an energy reduction campaign\n\nacross our larger sites. In 2021, we will concentrate on identifying renewable energy providers for our larger US sites.\n\n## ABSOLUTE GHG EMISSIONS (ktCO2e) 1,2,3,4\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| TARGET   |   0 |\n|----------|-----|\n| 2020     | 229 |\n| 2019     | 284 |\n| 2018     | 356 |\n| 2017     | 381 |\n| 2016     | 399 |\n| 2015     | 424 |\n| BASELINE | 473 |\n\n- 1 Emissions associated with product test and development, critical to ensuring product safety, are excluded from our GHG target.

        "page_content": "## Technologies for a zero carbon future\n\n## Electrification and hybridisation\n\nRolls-Royce technologies can play a crucial role in the transition to a net zero carbon future. However, the complex nature of the sectors we operate in means that the transition towards net zero will not be easy or straightforward; it will require a combination of technology and policy levers to execute, including further fuel-efficiency gains, new technologies and transition to lower carbon fuels. These plans are built into our short and medium-term forecasting.\n\n## Efficiency gains and engine architecture\n\nCarbon emissions are closely linked to fuel burn. By developing and implementing technologies  to  improve  efficiency,  we  can substantially reduce the CO2 impact of our products in operation. Despite the pressures of 2020, we have continued to progress our UltraFan design, which will deliver a 25% efficiency gain compared to early Trent engines, including reaching several design milestones during the year. We plan to progress to final assembly of UltraFan in 2021. Continued focus on engine efficiency gains will be critical given the significant costs associated with lower carbon alternative fuels.\n\nPower Systems continues to focus on improving efficiency and performance to decrease emissions and noise. The engine evolution of our iconic 4000 series engine is 5% more efficient and emits 75% l ess NOx than its predecessor and has been designed for compatibility with gas and synthetic fuels including methanol. Increasingly, our reciprocating engine family will be integrated into systems solutions, such as hybrid trains, hybrid ship propulsion and microgrids.\n\n## Transition to lower carbon alternative fuels\n\nMoving away from traditional fossil fuels and to low, ultimately zero, carbon fuels will make a significant contribution towards net zero carbon in both aviation and land-based power. Whilst the majority of our products are capable of running on synthetically derived low carbon fuels, industry faces shortages in demand based in part on the high costs associated with manufacturing such fuels. Rolls-Royce has a critical role to play in advocating and accelerating the availability of alternative fuels and we have worked in partnership with the fuels industry throughout 2020 to support this. We have also demonstrated our engines compatibility with new fuel types, ground testing 100% unblended sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in a Trent engine at the end of the year. Similar tests have already been carried out in our Defence engine portfolio. In Power Systems, we are actively exploring opportunities in the fuel cell and power-to-x markets. Power-to-x refers to the conversion of electricity into other forms of energy, including hydrogen and synthetic or e-fuels. We will introduce the first demonstrator for a stationary fuel cell in Friedrichshafen, Germany, during 2021. This is designed as a smaller scale, decentralised power plant in which electricity from renewable energy is synthesised into e-fuel. We also envision a key role for our SMR technology in providing a reliable and low carbon energy source for synthetic fuel production.\n\nHybrid and fully electric propulsion will play an exciting role in disrupting and decarbonising the personal mobility market. Through Rolls-Royce Electrical, our dedicated business unit, we are developing the capabilities and supply chain to capitalise on this technology. During 2020, we announced the conclusion of our partnership with Airbus on the E-Fan X programme. From that programme, Rolls-Royce has moved forward with the development of our Power Generation System 1 (PGS1) demonstrator, the most powerful hybrid-electric engine currently in development for aerospace. This programme will give us a greater understanding of delivering electrification in the MW category. We are also actively involved in a range of aircraft programmes in the kW class.\n\nIn early 2021, the first testing of a hybrid-electric rail service on the Chiltern railways line, UK, will commence, with the intent of entering public service in the later part of 2021.\n\n## Small modular reactors (SMRs)\n\nWe have been working with consortium partners and the UK Government to launch our SMR concept. SMRs are nuclear power stations, in the order of 440 MW (large enough to power a small city), designed to be low cost, low risk and quick to market. Rolls-Royce is ideally placed to exploit this technology bringing together the latest manufacturing technology with world-class nuclear expertise. SMRs can play a major role in decarbonising the energy grid, and can potentially be utilised for hydrogen and synthetic fuel production. During 2020, we secured further funding from the UK Government to move to the second stage in the development process.\n\n## Testing on 100% unblended SAFs\n\nTowards the end of 2020, we conducted a series of ground tests on a Trent 1000 engine using 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for the first time. At present SAF is only certified for commercial use in blends of up to 50%. We carried out the tests in order to confirm that using an unblended fuel can make a significant contribution to improving the environmental performance of gas turbine engines and to gain valuable data on how the fuel performs in the engine. We intend to make lower carbon alternative fuels a regular part of our testing programme, including conducting a series of tests on a Pearl 700 business aviation engine in early 2021. This is part of our drive to accelerate the availability of SAF, demonstrate technology readiness, and supports our aim to decarbonise our engine testing regime, which plays a vital role in ensuring product safety.",

We seek to consider and mitigate the environmental impact of our activities and major business decisions.\n\nOur Group policies set out our commitment to be environmentally responsible and to minimise the negative impact of our business activities. The nature of the products often requires specific, and sometimes significant, demands on material and energy resources across a global supply chain. Ensuring responsible consumption of resources ensures we are a more resilient business and contributes towards a more sustainable society.\n\n## Moving towards a circular economy\n\nThe nature of our business model is well aligned to the principles of a circular economy.

This has been driven by energy efficiency improvements, behaviour change programmes, and improved baseload management and weekend reductions at our larger manufacturing sites. Absolute energy consumption reduced by 82,814 MWh in 2020 compared to 2019 due to lower operational activity, however normalised energy consumption increased by 30%.\n\n| TARGET   |   3.39 |\n|----------|--------|\n|          |   4.14 |\n|          |   4.77 |\n|          |   4.62 |\n|          |   3.95 |\n|          |   3.89 |\n| BASELINE |   4.51 |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Target:\n\nReduce solid and liquid waste by 25% by 2025 1,2,3,4\n\nWe focus on opportunities to prevent and reduce the amount of waste we generate at source, reducing the costs and environmental impacts associated with processing and disposing of that waste. For example, our coolant waste reduction programme has mitigated over 480,000 litres of liquid waste, while providing cost savings of over \u00a30.5m per year. The total amount of solid and liquid waste generated in 2020 was 48.7 kilotonnes.

However, the financial impact of COVID-19 has negatively impacted progress against some of these targets, particularly those normalised by revenue, although the underlying data remains on track. Despite significant progress in diverting non-hazardous waste from landfill, a small number of waste streams continue to present significant technical and infrastructural challenges. This includes 1.8 kilotonnes of foundry sand from one of our casting operations. Notwithstanding these challenges, 88% of sites successfully transitioned to zero non-hazardous\n\nwaste to landfill status.

Whilst COVID-19 posed extra challenges this year, we acted swiftly to ensure the health and safety of our people and to safeguard our business operations. We used our pre-existing pandemic plan and risk frameworks to guide our response and support our people through the emerging crisis. We implemented strict workplace measures to protect against the spread of the virus at our sites around the world and increased our focus on employee mental health and wellbeing. In some facilities we introduced new ways of working, such as split shift patterns and alternating teams, with new booking systems to manage attendance patterns safely.\n\nWe utilised our incident support teams and accountable persons network to develop governance structures and global processes aligned with in-country requirements. We launched a COVID-19 intranet microsite, with regular communications and resources to help our people to protect themselves and others. We also continued to embed mental health as a Group priority through our global mental health strategy. We introduced a global mental health champion framework as an extension of our UK network, and trained in excess of 120 new champions this year. We made great progress with our LiveWell global accreditation scheme which recognises sites that have created environments to help people to lead healthier lives. In 2014, the LiveWell target was set for all sites with more than 50 people to become LiveWell accredited by 2020. We have significantly exceeded this target with more than two thirds (68%) of our sites going beyond bronze to reach silver, gold and even platinum levels of accreditation.\n\nTOTAL REPORTABLE INJURY (TRI) RATE (PER 100 EMPLOYEES) 1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1 Our TRI rate for previous years has been restated to reflect the disposal of the North American Civil Nuclear business and Trigno Energy. ITP Aero data is included from 2017. External assurance over the TRI data provided by Bureau Veritas. See page 204.\n\nOur TRI rate in 2020 was 0.35 per 100 employees, just missing our stretching Group target of 0.30. There were a total of 173 TRIs, of these 15 resulted in major injuries with no fatalities. Although we missed our target this year, our current TRI rate represents a 53% reduction from our baseline year and a 38% year-on-year reduction (116 fewer TRIs per year). These improvements followed the implementation of focused actions plans in 2020, based on detailed analysis of our TRI data. As a result, all of our businesses improved their TRI performance. We will continue our improvement efforts and will be moving to a safety-index scorecard which will include a TRI measure.\n\nIn response to the impact COVID-19 on our business, we implemented changes to reduce employment costs in the short term and to reset our approach to rewarding people in the future. In the UK, the Government's job retention scheme was used from April onwards to support significant numbers of employees on furlough. In Germany, where appropriate, the Kurzarbeit or short-time working scheme was used, as well as i ntroducing a two-week shutdown. Similar schemes were used in other countries in line with local legislation and business requirements. We introduced many changes to ways of working across the Group, according to local requirements and our agreements, including reduced hours working, adjustments to pay and various unpaid leave arrangements, as well as changes to some of our pension plans. We introduced a pay deferral for 2020, repaid in December 2020, and communicated there will be no 2020 bonus or 2021 pay review for most parts of the Group.\n\nWe tackled these difficult pay and employment-related challenges working closely with our employee representatives, often via frameworks that have had to be amended to meet the urgency of the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the scale and nature of the necessary change this has been challenging, but overall our approach has remained collaborative with successful results. In response to our proposed site consolidation, we experienced a period of industrial action at our Barnoldswick, UK, site but this was resolved with a collaborative agreement overwhelmingly supported by the local workforce. We will continue to work closely with our employee representatives to maintain the sustainability and competitiveness of our cost base and reward frameworks for the future, ensuring that our performance measures are aligned with company priorities.\n\nMany of our people needed to adapt swiftly to new ways of working through the COVID-19 pandemic, including working remotely or from home. We have supported this by enhancing our IT platforms, providing more digital learning and coaching our leaders on new ways of working. We have also taken this opportunity to emphasise our commitment to flexible working for the long term to enable our people to be at their best. We recognise that one size does not fit all and have developed tools to support our leaders to positively engage with their teams on a variety of different flexible working considerations. We will continue to develop and broaden our approach throughout 2021.\n\n## Fundamental restructuring\n\nOur business restructuring has been dominated by two themes: short-term mitigation measures to secure liquidity and longer-term restructuring to resize the business whilst accelerating progress on culture and leadership.\n\nFollowing the impact of COVID-19, we took significant steps to resize our business, focusing on Civil Aerospace where the impact was the greatest. We launched a strategic review of our facilities to help sustainably balance future load and capacity and to reduce our cost base. The review identified a range of actions including proposals to consolidate similar activity from multiple sites into fewer core sites.",

        "page_content": "## S U S T A I N A B I L I T Y\n\nSome of these have already been implemented and others are the subject of consultation with employees. In May, we proposed a major restructure, the largest in our recent history, which will see a reduction of at least 9,000 roles globally. Seeing our people leave the business is always difficult and we focused on doing this in the best way possible and treating everyone with dignity and respect. We have made strong progress this year removing around 7,000 roles, of which around 5,500 were from our Civil Aerospace business. The majority of people who left the business in the UK, left on voluntary redundancy. These difficult but necessary changes will help generate recurring operational benefits for the Group and our mitigating actions to preserve cash have significantly contributed to our in-year cost reduction targets.\n\n| Start of year headcount  1   | End of year headcount  1   | Number of roles removed  2   |\n|------------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------|\n| 53,770                       | 46,619                     | 7,151                        |\n\nThroughout our restructuring, we proactively focused on talent and made sure that, where possible, we did not lose capabilities critical to our future success, or negatively impact our diversity. This included establishing a redeployment talent hub to maximise the quality and quantity of critical talent retained in the business, and making some internal transfers of key capabilities.\n\n## UK defined benefit pensions review\n\nI n response to the impact of the pandemic on our business, we took further action with our pension arrangements for UK employees. Our UK pension plan closed to new hires in 2007 and i n 2020 we agreed with the trustees to cease the further build-up of benefits for all remaining active members. This followed a consultation process covering over 7,500 employees. From 1 January 2021, all employees transferred to a defined contribution pension with benefits at the standardised level for other UK employees (i.e. a maximum employer contribution of 12% of salary). This change will support the Group's future financial position and ensure a more equal level of total reward for our people regardless of when they commenced employment.\n\n## Enabling our people\n\nThe impact of our short-term mitigating measures to counter the effects of COVID-19 created an even greater need to focus on supporting and developing our people this year. A significant element of our planned investment in leadership development and broader learning was paused in 2020, however, we have still made progress. Our investment in learning and development in 2020 was \u00a313.5m (2019: \u00a328.7m), delivering just over half a million hours of formal l earning (2019: 1.4 million hours). In the future, we will report volumes of 'learning engagements' as well as costs and hours. This will provide data on our employees accessing online learning materials, which is not reflected in the above figures. We believe this will become a useful indicator of development, as we move to increasingly digital and virtual learning and development solutions. To support increased\n\nremote working, our leadership programmes were re-developed in 2020 to be fully virtual offerings and we introduced our digital leadership toolkit. We also created a new brand for learning: a framework to link all of our learning resources. This is focused on continuous learning with a growth mindset and will be launched early in 2021 along with a new more personalised learning technology platform.\n\nOur internal promotion and turnover rates in 2020 were negatively affected by the impact of COVID-19 and our fundamental restructuring programme. In 2020, 644 leaders were promoted internally (2019: 1,150) and our employee turnover was 15.3% (2019: 7.5%). We continue to focus on ensuring we have the right people, with the right skills, in the right roles to deliver organisational success.\n\n## Digital leadership toolkit\n\nAvailable on any device, digital learning content can be accessed quickly and simply, at the point of need, to support our current and future aspiring leaders.\n\nThrough 2020, we released learning materials focused on relevant challenges such as 'leading in a crisis'; 'leading through restructure'; 'leading inclusively'; and more recently 'leading sustainably' and 'leading the transition to net zero'. In the first nine months to the end of 2020, utilisation reached 74,300 learning engagements, which is more than we could have achieved through more traditional classroom based methods.\n\n## Employee engagement\n\nEmployee engagement continues to be a priority and is a key measure in our annual bonus plans. We believe that positive engagement is the result of excellent leadership and a working environment where everyone can be at their best. Our approach remains a mix of locallydriven and Group-wide global engagement. We provide a variety of channels to communicate and engage our employees and their representatives including employee newsletters, magazines and team briefings, as well as our digital communication channels such as Yammer. Our Executive Team have held regular 'YamJams' this year where all employees can direct questions to our leaders who will provide a response live, or as a follow up, posted on Yammer. We also work closely with elected employee representatives through well-established frameworks including our European Works Council. Our incentive schemes and share programmes are made available to all our people. In 2019, we launched our new employee engagement survey in partnership with Gallup and this simplified framework is now embedded across the Group. We have set a target to achieve top-quartile scores by the end of 2023, and our current results shows we are on track to do so. We ran our third Gallup survey this year and maintained a good participation rate of 72%. We achieved a meaningful increase of +0.16 reaching a company 'grand mean' of 3.68 which places us in the 31st percentile of manufacturing companies that partner with Gallup. This is an increase from the 13th percentile in 2019.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur non-financial KPIs are on page 17.

Whilst planned activities were significantly disrupted during 2020, we responded to the challenge by becoming more virtual. We moved our STEM education outreach resources online and shared additional resources to support learning from home, for example, through our digital academy's 'Helping You Prepare' programme and our many other education partnerships. We have reached one million people through our STEM programmes and are now 31% towards our target to inspire 25 million of tomorrows pioneers by 2030.\n\nManufacturing supply chains were put to work to increase ventilator production and we produced 3D printed face masks as well as donating PPE for health care workers. Our people continued to be at the core of all of our activities and volunteered their own time and expertise to support intitiatives as well as raising funds, and donating resources to support the communities in which we operate. In 2020, 36,487 hours of employee time was committed to STEM and community outreach activities (2019: 96,000).\n\nGlobal charitable contributions totalled \u00a34.8m in 2020 (\u00a33.4m cash contributions). This included \u00a30.9m raised by reclaiming and selling the shares of gone-away shareholders.* Most of the funds invested support STEM education outreach, particularly targeting underrepresented groups. For example, the Agastya Project in India brings a mobile science lab to schools in rural communities; our work with Social Return Foundation in Germany helps migrant communities to gain the skills needed to enter further education or jobs in STEM; and projects in the UK and India specifically encourage and support women to pursue STEM pathways into work. A small proportion of funds has been donated to causes supporting one-time humanitarian events such as the initial outbreak of COVID-19 in China and the Aegean earthquake in 2020.\n\n## Continued focus on accelerating inclusion\n\nIn a year that required a change of direction to focus on COVID-19 mitigations, and the launch of our fundamental business restructuring, we continued to take deliberate action to create an inclusive and more representative employee population. This year, we developed a new strategy with an overarching principle of leaders role modelling inclusion and action plans focused on four key pillars: leadership & governance; attracting & recruiting; retention; and development.\n\nHighlights in 2020 include:\n\n- - increasing women on business leadership teams - notably the appointment of the first female board member of Power Systems (CFO) as well as achieving a 50% female hiring ratio for our enterprise leadership group (ELG);\n- - Civil Aerospace signed up to IATA 25 - an initiative to advance gender diversity in the aviation industry;\n- - our graduate and intern selection processes were redesigned to remove barriers to ethnic minority candidates;\n- - in the US, we hired veterans in mid-career niche engineering roles to improve ethnic minority representation;\n- - globally, our female turnover remains lower than for males; and\n- - we created inclusive leadership development programmes and additional learning resources to be rolled out in 2021, along with new mandatory diversity & inclusion learning for all employees.\n\nOf significant note has been our response to the 2020 Black Lives Matter movement. Our Chief People Officer and people director responsible for inclusion led listening sessions with our employee resource groups (ERGs) representing our black colleagues in both the UK and US. These sessions subsequently led to the evolution of our diversity & inclusion strategy, as outlined above.\n\nIn 2020, we maintained our focus on the diversity of external hires despite significantly reduced hiring due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. We increased female hires globally at all grades from 18% to 19% and our apprentice hires were 22% female compared to 16% i n 2019. Our early career intake was reduced to a quarter of the volume of previous years and we temporarily paused our business and functional programmes, which typically attract more females than our engineering programmes. The gender diversity of our graduate hires was particularly impacted by this, as well as our restructure activity and only 13% of our hires in 2020 were female compared with 32% in 2019. We remain focused on improving our diversity and any candidates delayed from joining this year have formed our talent pipeline for the future. We have provided career support and frequent communication to them throughout the pandemic.\n\nWe give full and fair consideration to all employment applications from people with disabilities. If an employee becomes disabled whilst working for us we take steps to support their continued employment including, wherever possible, making adjustments to ways of working. All employees can take advantage of our learning programmes, often available online, and promotion opportunities are open to all employees regardless of any disabilities.\n\n## Treating everyone with dignity and respect\n\nWe launched our anti-bullying and harassment programme i n 2019 with a culture change goal of eliminating inappropriate behaviours from our workplaces.\n\nIn 2020, we focused on embedding knowledge and understandi ng, with all leaders, and our HR teams were required to complete online and face to face learning on the topic. We also continued to raise behavioural expectations and maintained focus on the topic through regular communications, real life case studies and interviews from our leaders.\n\n- *  Shareholders the company has been unable to trace for 12 years, a change to the Company's Articles of Association approved by shareholders in 2017.",

Our progress against these targets can be seen below. We have missed some of these targets and acknowledge there is work to do in a number of areas. We have no female Executive Team members, however our succession pool is 42% female and we have increased representation of non-British nationalities from 50% in 2019 to 58% in 2020.

We work hard to create a working environment where everyone at Rolls-Royce and those we work with can be at their best.\n\nWe are committed to maintaining the highest ethical standards and have a suite of Group policies and processes in place to help us avoid any potential complicity in misconduct. Our Code of Conduct (Our Code) and associated policies set out the values and behaviours we expect everyone to demonstrate. They also provide guidance on how to apply these principles in our daily decisions.\n\nIn 2020, our mandatory ethics training focused on making decisions. This comprised of team discussions on real-life cases where people had their decision influenced by an authority figure, the group, time pressure or optimistic bias. 92% of in-scope employees completed the training (2019: 97%) by the year-end deadline. An extension to early 2021 was agreed with the European Works Council for employees based in Germany. 99% of managers certified their commitment to adhere to the principles set out in Our Code\n\n## 2020 Highlights\n\nIntroduced strengthened anti-bribery & corruption due diligence\n\n92% employees completed annual ethics training\n\nInitiated review of human rights policy and associated due diligence\n\nPublished Aletheia Framework\n\n(2019: 99%). We flow these principles to our suppliers through our Supplier Code of Conduct. All suppliers are contractually required to adhere to this, or a mutually agreed alternative.\n\nWe actively encourage speaking up in the event of a question or concern and provide a variety of channels through which colleagues may do so. During the year, as working patterns changed due to COVID-19, we continued to highlight the channels available to everyone if they had a concern. In addition, the ELG were prompted to be vigilant in ensuring business be conducted in line with our values and behaviours, Our Code and Group policies.\n\nWe have a zero tolerance approach to misconduct of any kind and will take disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal, in the event of a breach of Our Code. In 2020, 63 employees (2019: 85) left the business for reasons related to breaches of Our Code.\n\n## Anti-bribery and corruption\n\nOur Code and associated policies clearly set out our commitment not to tolerate bribery or corruption in any form. In 2020, we strengthened our anti-bribery and corruption due diligence, including introducing revised procedures and a new supporting system. This also involved i ntroducing further targeted training for key users of these procedures. In addition, for occasional users we made available a series of podcasts to explain the revised procedures. We conduct extensive due diligence into potential joint venture partners as well as supporting existing joint ventures in their ethics and compliance programmes.\n\n## Human rights and anti-slavery\n\nOur human rights policy sets out our commitment to protecting the human rights of our employees, and those who may be impacted by the operations, products and services in our value chain. We operate in accordance with human rights and humanitarian law through strict compliance to strategic export laws in the countries where we operate, particularly in the sale of products with dual use or defence application. Our due diligence activities to identify, assess, mitigate and prevent human rights related risks are embedded within our enterprise risk management system (see page 46) and global governance framework. Compliance is devolved to the relevant business functions and expertise, including export control, procurement and human resources.\n\nDuring 2020, we initiated a review of our human rights policy and associated due diligence procedures, including a comprehensive benchmark-\n\ning of industry practice, potential emerging legal requirements and voluntary guiding frameworks. Through this, we have identified four focus areas for future activity: rights of employees; communities local to operations; business relationships in the supply chain; and the sale and use of products and services. We expect to publish an updated human rights policy during 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Find more information on our anti-slavery and human trafficking statement; Group policies & materials stewardship page at rolls-royce.com\n- For more information on our ethics approach see the Safety, Ethics & Sustainability Committee report on page 101 or view 'At our Best: Our Approach' document available at rolls-royce.com\n\n## Building trust in artificial intelligence with our Aletheia Framework\n\nRolls-Royce has developed an ethics for artificial intelligence (AI) framework, which could help gain society's trust of AI technology and accelerate the next generation of industrialisation, known as industry 5.0. This is a method that any organisation can use to ensure the decisions it takes to use AI in critical and non-critical applications are ethical, including the first stepby-step process for ensuring the outcomes of AI algorithms can be trusted. We have made the Aletheia Framework publicly available for the benefit of other companies and organisations, including subject matter experts and not-for-profits, to support increased use and public trust in AI.",

        "page_content": "## PRINCIPAL RISKS\n\nCOVID-19 created exceptional circumstances in civil aviation in 2020. Consequently, we reviewed the principal risks and how we manage them in light of COVID-19 at both the half-year and year-end. In our 2019 Annual Report, we identified infectious disease as a root cause of our Business Continuity risk and a reduction in air travel and customer disruption as root causes of our Market and Financial Shock risk. As a result, additional actions and controls have been identified and implemented to mitigate the impact to the Group and protect our people and businesses.\n\nOur approach to emerging risks has also been dominated by COVID-19 and our response to the pandemic. We have considered many emerging risks as a result of COVID-19, with regard to the changing risk landscape and the most appropriate response.\n\n## Our risk and internal control system\n\nThe Board has established procedures to manage risk and oversee the risk management system (RMS). The Board has also established procedures to determine the nature and extent of the principal and emerging risks the Group is willing to take in order to optimise its commercial opportunities and achieve its long-term strategic objectives. The Audit Committee reviews the Group's internal financial controls which form a subset of the broader set of controls. Financial reporting controls are identified and subject to periodic review by the Group's internal control team. The Audit Committee, on behalf of the Board, performs an annual review of the RMS and its effectiveness. During the year, the Board completed a robust assessment of both our principal and emerging risks. Our RMS is designed to identify and manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss.\n\n## How we manage risk\n\nRisks are identified by individuals across all businesses and functions and at many layers of the organisation by considering what could stop us achieving our strategic, operational or compliance objectives or impact the sustainability of our business model. Risk owners assess the risks, likelihood and impact, taking into account current mitigating control activities, identifying where additional activities may be needed to bring the risk within our risk appetite. Risk owners consider the effectiveness of current mitigating control activities in their assessment, supported by different assurance providers including internal audit. These considerations are recorded using a variety of systems and tools depending on the risk area. In managing the identified risks, judgement is necessary to evaluate the risks facing the Group in achieving its objectives, determine the risks that are considered acceptable, determine the likelihood of those risks materialising, assess the Group's ability to reduce the impact of risks that do materialise and ensure the costs of operating particular controls are proportionate to the benefit provided. Risk owners bring the results of their assessment, current risk status and action plans to business, function and other management review forums as often as is required depending on the nature of the risk, for support, challenge and oversight. These forums include the monthly Executive Team and regular Board and Board committee meetings.\n\nAt least once a year the Audit Committee, on behalf of the Board conducts a review of the effectiveness of the RMS and where required identifies areas for improvement (more details of this review can be found on page 79).\n\nFor key compliance and safety risks, the Group has a set of mandatory policies and training which set out the expectations on employees and the controls in place. Every employee is required, annually, to complete training and confirm that they will comply with the mandatory policies. The consequences of non-compliance are addressed via performance management systems that are linked to remuneration.\n\nDuring the year, we simplified our policies and guidance and provided support to risk owners in assessing the effectiveness of mitigating controls and on our current risk level relative to our risk appetite. We conducted a Group-wide review into our response to COVID-19 and, as part of this review, we reassessed our risks.\n\nIn 2021, we will seek to build on our work this year and embed more of the lessons learned from COVID-19 in our business-as-usual approach. We will continue to improve the quality of our risk assessment and management activities in relation to our restructuring programmes, financial planning and critical decision-making.\n\n## COVID-19 and changes in our principal risk levels\n\nThe scale and impact of the pandemic and actions taken to control its spread have resulted in some increased risks to and uncertainty in our operations.\n\nRisk level unchanged: We have concluded no change for Product Safety or Compliance given no significant changes to our operational or regulatory landscape during 2020, supported by the output from our relevant assurance and incident reporting frameworks in these areas. We have concluded no change for Climate Change or Cyber given the priority that was already placed on mitigating these risks to our business. Our climate change risks are managed in the same way as other risks. Given the events of 2020, we have concluded that the most critical risk is the impact of our products and services on the environment and have revised our principal risk description accordingly as set out on page 48. More detail on our approach to climate change can be found on page 34. Given the criticality of protecting our business against cyber threat, additional mitigations, including the strict safeguards required to be in place to enable more of our employees to work from home, were carefully considered as part of our COVID-19 response.\n\nIncreased risks: COVID-19 itself, subsequent changes to our ways of working in our facilities and from home, and indirect changes due to our restructuring have increased our People Safety and Talent and Capability risks. Business Continuity increased as our supply chain may face difficulties in fulfilling requirements due to the pandemic. COVID-19 has caused us to reconsider the nature of our Competitive Environment and the likelihood and impact of a Financial or Market Shock. Our Political risks have increased due to changes in a various geopolitical environments across the globe both independent of and related to the pandemic. We have reset our restructuring targets as a result of COVID-19, which may be harder to meet than previously assessed.",

The Group's plans and risks to their achievement are reviewed by the Board and once approved, are used as the basis for monitoring the Group's performance, incentivising employees and providing external guidance to shareholders.\n\nThe processes for identifying and managing risk are described on pages 46 to 51. As described on these pages, the risk management process, and the going concern and viability statements, are designed to provide reasonable but not absolute assurance.\n\nGiven the economic uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic, and taking into account the recent guidance issued by the FRC, the Directors have undertaken a comprehensive going concern review over an eighteen-month period to September 2022, considering the forecast cash flows of the Group and the liquidity headroom available over that eighteen-month period. The Group has modelled two scenarios in its assessment of going concern which have been considered by the Directors, along with a likelihood assessment of these scenarios, being:\n\n- - base case, which reflects the Directors' current expectations of future trading; and\n- - severe but plausible downside scenario, which envisages a 'stress' or 'downside' situation.\n\nFurther details, including the analysis performed and conclusion reached, are set out below.\n\n## Background\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the Group, with the Civil Aerospace and ITP Aero businesses being the most significantly impacted. Uncertainty remains over the severity, extent and duration of the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and therefore the timing of recovery to pre-crisis levels. Safeguarding the health and wellbeing of our people and protecting our business have been at the heart of our decision-making from the outset of this pandemic. During 2020, we have taken decisive action to reduce cash expenditure and maintain liquidity through the following measures:\n\n- - A number of proactive steps starting in March 2020, to conserve cash, which delivered more than \u00a31.0bn in-year cash cost savings compared to our pre COVID-19 cash costs in 2020. These savings were delivered through cutting non-critical capital expenditure, minimising discretionary costs, including projects, consulting spend, professional fees and sub-contractor costs, reviewing and rephasing R&D spend, together with a temporary 10% salary\n\nreduction for our senior management, and making use of the UK Government's Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme.\n\n- - The final shareholder payment in respect of 2019 was not recommended and there will be no shareholder payment in respect of 2020.\n- - In May 2020, the Group launched a major restructuring programme to reshape and resize the Group and in particular, the Civil Aerospace business. This will remove at least 9,000 roles across the Group, with forecast annualised savings of over \u00a31.3bn by the end of 2022. At 31 December 2020, approximately 7,000 roles had been removed across the Group.\n- - In August 2020, the Group secured a \u00a32bn term-loan facility, 80% of which is guaranteed by UK Export Finance (UKEF). This is repayable in August 2025.\n- - In October 2020, the Group launched a rights issue which was completed in November 2020, raising \u00a32bn of proceeds.\n- - In October 2020, the Group completed a \u00a32bn bond issuance with maturities in 2026 and 2027 and secured a new \u00a31bn loan facility that matures in October 2022.\n\nWhilst vaccination programmes are now underway across the globe, uncertainties remain in respect of more contagious variants of the virus and the potential impact of this on the timing of recovery of demand, in particular in relation to the civil aviation industry. The actions we have taken during 2020 have been necessary to right-size the business to achieve a longer-term sustainable cost base that is fit for purpose in a post COVID-19 environment, as well as securing additional funding to provide sufficient liquidity headroom for the Group.\n\n## Going concern assessment\n\nIn assessing the adoption of the going concern basis of accounting i n the Company and Consolidated Financial Statements, the Directors have considered the FRC Company Guidance (updated 20 May 2020) (COVID-19), which has encouraged companies to assess current forecasts with more vigour, and to consider the impact of different potential scenarios along with a likelihood assessment, taking into account both the uncertainty and the likely success of any realistic mitigations. In adopting this more vigorous approach, the Directors have assessed the Group's future financial performance, cash flows and liquidity headroom available over an eighteen-month period to September 2022, taking into account a base case and a severe but plausible downside scenario. The Directors have paid attention to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Group, particularly on the Civil Aerospace and ITP Aero businesses, which have been the most significantly impacted, recognising the challenges of reliably estimating and forecasting the effects of COVID-19 on the civil",

        "page_content": "aviation industry, as well as the extent and timing of recovery to pre-crisis levels. Key areas of estimation uncertainty include:\n\n- - The magnitude of the impact on EFHs and consequently cashflows from the aftermarket business. The estimates in respect of EFHs and future recovery are influenced by assumptions in respect of:\n- \u00b7 the roll-out of vaccination programmes across the globe and their ability to deal with different variants of the COVID-19 virus;\n- \u00b7 the extent and timing of the easing of restrictions on crossborder movement, including quarantine rules; and\n- \u00b7 the recovery rate of flying hours with a potential growth in the number of people holidaying in their home country, and the increased use of video conferencing reducing the need for business travel.\n- - The extent of the impact of the pandemic on our customers, and consequently the purchase new aircraft, and/or renew of aftermarket contracts in the future.\n- - A shift towards more efficient, lower-cost aircraft as airlines look to recover post COVID-19, leading to a risk of higher aircraft retirements in the future.\n- - Right-sizing the business is underpinned by the assumed size needed to meet future demand.\n\nGiven these estimation uncertainties, the Directors believe it is appropriate to provide additional disclosure of the key COVID-19 related assumptions underpinning the base case and severe but plausible downside scenario, as set out below.\n\n## Base case scenario\n\nThe Group's base case scenario assumes a deep impact on the Civil Aerospace and ITP Aero businesses, with a slow and gradual recovery in demand in 2021. Whilst new variants of the COVID-19 virus create some uncertainty, vaccination programmes are successfully rolled out and/or mass airport testing is introduced to alleviate quarantine restrictions in place across many countries. Widebody flying hours returns to 55% of the pre-crisis baseline in 2021 and approximately 80% in 2022, with slower growth to a full recovery to 2019 levels of widebody activity by the end of 2024 based on industry data.\n\nThe Civil Aerospace and ITP Aero forecast assumes:\n\n- -flying hours of widebody aircraft are 55% of 2019 level in 2021 recovering to 80% of 2019 level in 2022 (based on year averages);\n- -flying hours of business aviation are 2% above 2019 level in 2021 and increase to 10% above the 2019 level in 2022 (based on year averages);\n- -widebody OE engine sales reduce from 450 in 2019 to 187 in 2021 (42% of 2019 level) before increasing to 204 in 2022 (45% of 2019 level);\n- -widebody spare engine sales are 80% of 2019 level in 2021 and 75% of 2019 level in 2022;\n- -business aviation engine sales are 54% of 2019 level in 2021 increasing to 88% of 2019 level in 2022;\n- -newer aircraft fleets ( A350, A330neo and 787) recover at a faster pace than older fleets due to the economics and investment value of the aircraft;\n- -older aircraft fleets (A330, A380 and 777) recover on a slower, more varied profile taking into account regional market recovery and unique market dynamics; and\n- -the pressure on the transitions market , driven by new aircraft delivery and volume of surplus assets, results in an elongation in transition time to ~24 months.\n\n## Severe but plausible downside scenario\n\nAs noted above, due to the inherent uncertainty over the extent and duration of the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and therefore the timing of recovery of civil aviation to pre-crisis levels, the Directors have also considered a severe but plausible downside scenario.\n\nThis severe but plausible downside is based in principle on a general assumption that recovery remains subdued due to ongoing infection rates and an increase in new variants of the COVID-19 virus, with a slower recovery in demand compared with the base case. Restrictions on travel between countries remain in place across many parts of the world during the first part of 2021, with a gradual recovery of the global economy and the Group taking place once those restrictions are lifted.\n\nThe resulting key underlying COVID-19 specific assumptions included in the severe but plausible downside scenario in relation to each of the Civil Aerospace and ITP Aero businesses are as follows:\n\n- -flying hours of widebody aircraft are 45% of 2019 level in 2021, recovering to 70% of 2019 level in 2022 (based on year averages);\n- -flying hours of business aviation are 1% above 2019 level in 2021 and increase to 8% above 2019 level in 2022 (based on year averages);\n- -widebody OE engine sales are 28% of 2019 level in 2021 before falling to 26% of 2019 level in 2022;\n- -widebody spare engine sales are 20% of 2019 in 2021 and remain at 20% of 2019 in 2022;\n- -business aviation engine sales are 54% of 2019 level in 2021 increasing to 80% of 2019 level in 2022;\n- -newer aircraft fleets ( A350, A330neo and 787) recover at a faster pace than older fleets due to the economics and investment value of the aircraft;\n- -older aircraft fleets (A330, A380 and 777) recover on a slower, more varied profile taking into account regional market recovery and unique market dynamics; and\n- -the pressure on the transitions market , driven by new aircraft delivery and volume of surplus assets, results in an elongation in transition time to ~24 months.",

Such mitigations include the restriction of capital and other expenditure to only committed and essential levels, reduce or eliminate discretionary spend, reinstate the implementation of pay deferrals and undertake further restructuring.\n\nOther mitigations that could be considered in more severe circumstances, which are not directly in the control of the Directors, include raising other new funding through the bond or bank markets, pursuing a \u00a31bn increase in the existing \u00a32bn UKEF-backed loan and raising further equity. The anticipated \u00a32bn proceeds from business disposals announced in August 2020 have not been included when assessing the going concern, although completion of these disposals is anticipated during 2022 and within the eighteen-month period being considered. Further potential business disposals could be considered if required.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAfter due consideration of the matters set out above, the Directors consider that the Group has sufficient liquidity headroom to continue in operational existence for a period of at least eighteen months from the date of this report and are therefore satisfied that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.",

Our downside scenario uses the same assumptions as the going concern statement and in 2023 to 2025 assumes a slower recovery back to 2019 level than assumed in our base case. The analysis excludes proceeds from disposals and additional funding which have not yet been agreed but, if and when realised, will increase liquidity at least \u00a32bn.\n\nConsistent with previous years, we have assessed our viability over a five-year period which is in line with our five-year annual target setting process. We continue to believe that this is the most appropriate time period to consider as, inevitably, the degree of certainty reduces over any longer period.\n\nIn making the assessment, we have used the same base case and severe but plausible downside scenarios and existing committed borrowing facilities as set out in the going concern assessment, with the analysis extended over five years. We have combined additional severe but plausible scenarios that estimate the potential impact of additional principal risks arising over the assessment period, for example: the loss of a key element of the supply chain, a compliance breach, a trade war between major trading blocs, failure to deliver the expected benefits from our restructuring activities, the impact of climate change or a significant product safety event. The impact on viability of some of the risks modelled, such as Business Continuity and Political risk, has reduced compared to last year due to falling OE volumes and lower EFHs.\n\nThe cash flow impacts of these scenarios were overlaid on the fiveyear forecast to assess how the Group's liquidity and solvency would be affected.\n\nThe scenarios assume an appropriate management response to the specific event which could be undertaken and also consider specific activities to improve liquidity such as raising additional funds, reducing expenditure and divesting non-core businesses.\n\nReverse stress testing has also been performed to assess the severity of scenarios that would have to occur to exceed liquidity headroom, including a scenario where existing borrowing facilities could not be refinanced as they mature.\n\nOn the basis described above, the Board confirms that it has a reasonable expectation that the Company will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the next five years. In making this statement, the Directors have made the following key assumptions:\n\n- - the Group is able to refinance maturing debt facilities and drawdown existing available facilities as required;\n- - the Group has access to global debt markets and expects to be able to refinance these debt facilities on commercially acceptable terms;\n- - the Group's medium and long-term financing plans are designed to allow for periods of adverse conditions in world capital markets but not a prolonged period (e.g. 12 months) where debt markets were effectively closed to the Group;\n- - that implausible scenarios do not occur. Implausible scenarios include either multiple risks impacting at the same time or where management actions do not mitigate an individual risk to the degree assumed; and\n- - that in the event of one or more risks occurring (which has a particularly severe effect on the Group) all potential actions (such as but not limited to, restricting capital and other expenditure to only committed and essential levels, reducing or eliminating discretionary spend, reinstating the implementation of pay deferrals, raising additional funds through debt or equity raises, executing disposals and undertaking further restructuring) would be taken on a timely basis. The Group believes that it has the early warning mechanisms to identify the need for such actions and, as demonstrated by our decisive actions in 2020, has the ability to implement them on a timely basis if necessary.",

This statement sets out the Board's approach to decision-making, its stakeholder engagement, why its stakeholders matter and some key decisions made during 2020. To give greater understanding to this, we have provided clear cross-referencing to where more detailed information can be found in this Annual Report.\n\nWhen making key strategic decisions, the Board considers for each matter the likely consequences of any decision in the long term, identifies stakeholders who may be affected, and carefully considers their interests and any potential impact as part of the decision-making process. The areas the Board focused on during the year and the key decisions made are set out on pages 70 and 71 and our report on stakeholder engagement during the year is on pages 72 to 73.\n\n## THE BOARD'S APPROACH\n\nWe remain a particularly active Board, with a heightened degree of oversight and scrutiny during the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure we are aware of the impacts on all our stakeholders.\n\n## Purpose, vision and strategy (see page 9)\n\n- - purpose refined during the year to reflect our sustainability ambitions\n- - we have a clearly articulated purpose recognising our role in society\n- - our key focus in the near term was refined in response to COVID-19\n- - corporate narrative aligned with both vision and strategy\n\n## Group policies (see page 45)\n\n- - annual review of Group policies\n- - mandatory ethics training focused on decision-making\n\n## Culture and people (see page 40)\n\n- - oversight of implementation of strict safety measures to protect against the spread of COVID-19 at our sites around the world (see pages 40 to 41)\n- - increased our focus on health and wellbeing (see pages 40 to 41)\n- - tracked progress and sought feedback on our people framework throughout the restructuring activity in 2020 through reports from the management team and the Employee Champions (see pages 41 to 44)\n- - Code of Conduct clearly communicated and enforced (see page 45)\n\n## Risk and internal control framework (see page 46)\n\n- - additional actions and controls have been identified and implemented to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the Group and to protect our people and businesses (see page 46 to 51)\n- - COVID-19 created exceptional circumstances in civil aviation in 2020.

Touching upon a wide variety of stakeholders, we aim to create trusted relationships to understand the needs of all our stakeholders so we can continue to deliver value and build a resilient business. This was important in a challenging year for our end markets and for civil aviation in particular.\n\nSee pages 72 to 73 for the Board's engagement with our stakeholders and page 12 for our business model.\n\n## Customers\n\nIn a year of significant impact, particularly in the civil aviation industry but also in other end markets, we had continuous dialogue with our customers. Focusing on the needs of our customers is critical to the success of our business. We maintain a high degree of customer intimacy in order to anticipate and understand the future power needs of our customers, building on our years of experience in delivering for our markets. We collaborate and innovate with our customers to improve product performance and value and to promote best practice in the industry to combat issues such as climate change.\n\n## Investors\n\nIt was critical that our existing and potential institutional investors, retail shareholders and bond holders understood our strategy and rationale as we sought their support for our rights issue and bond issuance in 2020. Continued access to capital is vital to long-term performance of our business. We work to ensure that our investors and investment analysts have a strong understanding of our strategy, performance, ambition and culture.\n\n## Employees\n\nEmployee engagement is critical to our success. During the fundamental restructuring in the year we continued to work to create a diverse and inclusive workplace where every employee can reach their full potential and be at their best. We engage with our people to ensure we are delivering to their expectations, supporting wellbeing and making the right business decisions. This ensures we can retain and develop the best talent.\n\n## Partners and suppliers\n\nOur external supply chain and our suppliers are vital to our performance. We engage with them to build trusting relationships from which we can mutually benefit and to ensure they are performing to our standards and conducting business to our expectations. Business continuity discussions formed a vital part of the dialogue this year.\n\n## Communities\n\nWe were challenged in our traditional activities and sought new ways to enhance engagement with young people and disadvantaged groups who have been significantly impacted by disruption to education and social activities this year. We are committed to building positive relations with the communities in which we operate. We support communities and groups, local and relevant to our operations.\n\n## Governing bodies and regulators\n\nConsiderable engagement was undertaken with governments and regulators i n this unprecedented year and we continue to work with them as we prepare for recovery in the civil aviation sector. We engage with national governments, national/transnational agencies and key politicians and regulators to ensure that we can help shape policy, have licence to operate, attract funding, enable markets and ultimately win business. We work with governments globally where we have operations or future business opportunities.\n\nWe discuss how we maintain high standards of ethics and compliance and their fundamental importance to our continued success on page 45\n\n## OUR PRINCIPAL DECISIONS IN 2020\n\nMore  discussion  on  these  decisions  can  be  found  in  the  Corporate Governance Report on Board focus on pages 70 to 71.\n\n## Redefining the strategy\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had a sudden and material impact on the Group and on our markets globally and this led the Board to refine the strategy during the year. This is further explained in the Chairman's statement and Chief Executive's review (see pages 4 to 8) and also articulated in our purpose, vision and strategy (see pages 9 to 11). The Board considered all stakeholders as part of these considerations and received reports from the Executive Directors on their discussions with and feedback from employees, customers, suppliers & partners, governments and advisers.\n\nAs part of these discussions the Board strengthened the Group's commitment to combatting climate change recognising that we have a key role to play in creating a more sustainable future.\n\n## COVID-19 and rebuilding the balance sheet\n\nThe sudden and material impact of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a sharp deterioration in the financial performance of Civil Aerospace and, to a much lesser extent, in Power Systems. The Board committed to undertake a number of significant actions to mitigate the financial and operating impact in order to strengthen the financial position of the Group and in doing so considered the long-term interests of employees, customers, suppliers & partners and future and current investors.\n\n## Fundamental restructure and cost savings\n\nThe Board had oversight of the decisions by the Executive Team to fundamentally restructure the Group and of the impact these decisions had on employees and local communities in particular - noting discussions with UK Trade Unions and the European Works Council as well as with Government Ministers and Members of Parliament. The review of the UK defined benefit pensions scheme was also noted (see page 42), the decision supported the Group's future financial position and ensured a more equal level of total reward going forward.\n\n## Strategic acquisitions\n\nThe Group made two acquisitions to accelerate the delivery of its electrification strategy. Both acquisitions remain in line with the Group's net zero emissions and post-pandemic recovery strategy.\n\n## Payments to shareholders\n\nThe Board made the difficult decision, in light of the uncertain macroeconomic outlook resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, to not recommend a final payment to shareholders nor an interim shareholder payment. Further information on this can be found on pages 5 and 211.\n\nStrategic Report signed on behalf of the Board\n\n## Warren East\n\nChief Executive\n\n11 March 2021",

As we previously reported, we committed to reduce the rates over a period of time for our existing Executive Directors to ensure alignment by 2022. However, to ensure compliance in 2021, existing and new Executive Directors will now receive a pension contribution rate aligned with the wider workforce from 1 January 2021 (see pages 82, 86 and 90).\n\n## COMPOSITION, SUCCESSION AND EVALUATION\n\n## AUDIT, RISK AND INTERNAL CONTROL\n\nWe have a clear process when considering appointments to the Board and operate effective succession planning (see pages 75 and 76).\n\nOur Board demonstrates a combination of skills, experience and knowledge (see pages 64 to 66 and 68).\n\nIn 2020, Belinda Hudson Limited carried out an annual evaluation of the Board. The methodology and progress can be found on page 74.\n\nWe recognise the importance and benefits of ensuring the internal audit function and the external auditors remain independent (see pages 79 to 80).\n\nThe Board presents a fair, balanced and understandable (FBU) assessment of the Company's position and prospects (see page 78).\n\nOur risk and control environment is reviewed by the Audit Committee. The Board considered both emerging and principal risks during the year (see page 70).\n\n## BOARD LEADERSHIP AND COMPANY PURPOSE\n\n## DIVISION OF RESPONSIBILITIES\n\nThe Board has delivered a heightened degree of oversight and scrutiny during the pandemic to ensure the long-term sustainable success of the Company. Our Governance report provides examples of our leadership and engagement with our stakeholders (see page 72).\n\nWe refined our corporate narrative as we are determined to play a fundamental role in pioneering a resilient, inclusive, net zero carbon future (see page 70).\n\nTo ensure we have the right resources and skills to execute our strategy, we have undertaken a number of significant actions to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 (see pages 7 and 8).\n\nOur Code and associated policies ensure our workforce can meet our expected values and behaviours. We encourage our people to speak up (see pages 45 and 70).\n\nWe clearly define the roles of the Chairman and the Chief Executive and fully support the separation of the two roles.\n\nThe Board believes it operates effectively with the appropriate balance of independent Non-Executive Directors (NEDs) and Executive Directors (see pages 64 to 66).\n\nThe Board regularly considers time commitments of Directors. Prior Board approval is required for Directors' external appointments to ensure there is no compromise on time commitment (see page 75).\n\nThe quality of information and resources available to the Board has enabled us to operate effectively and efficiently during a year in which we held a considerable number of additional Board and Committee meetings and calls.\n\n## REMUNERATION\n\nOur remuneration policy has been revised this year and will be put to the shareholders for approval at our 2021 AGM. Key changes are set out on page 81 and clear links to our KPIs can be found on page 84.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee, comprising only NEDs, is responsible for developing the policy and determining executive and senior management remuneration (see page 82).\n\nNo Director is involved when deciding their own remuneration outcome.",

        "page_content": "## CHAIRMAN'S INTRODUCTION\n\nAs a Board, we very quickly changed the way we worked in response to the COVID-19 environment. We still have a lot to achieve and deliver in 2021 but your Board is as committed as I am to see us through the current period.\n\nIn previous years, I have stated here that our approach is to have innovative governance that fits the needs of the business and ensures that we add value in all that we do. This stood us in good stead for 2020 as we flexed our governance structures to meet our needs as a Board and as a business and found they stood up well under pressure. As a Board we very quickly changed the way we worked as we moved to weekly Board calls and management updates on key metrics, particularly for Civil Aerospace, and impacts on our people, customers, partners & suppliers and other stakeholders. As with much of the rest of the world, all our meetings since March 2020 have been virtual, including our AGM and the General Meeting held in October to approve our rights issue.\n\nI would like to thank the Board for all the time they have given during the course of the year. As you can see on page 69, not only did we hold a high number of additional Board meetings and calls but each of the Committees also held additional meetings to ensure focus on specific areas such as product safety; wellbeing; diversity & inclusion and talent retention throughout the significant restructure; and financial resilience in a time of cost pressure and macroeconomic uncertainty. The Non-Executive Directors also reduced their fees by 10% in line with the senior management team for nine months of the year and the impact of COVID-19 on the aerospace sector led the Remuneration Committee to review our remuneration policy. A revised, bespoke policy which is tailored to our specific challenges is set out on pages 85 to 91 and will be put to shareholders at our AGM in May 2021.\n\n## Culture\n\nOur Employee Champions, Irene Dorner and Beverly Goulet, were joined by Lee Hsien Yang who was appointed this year as the Board's Employee Champion for the Asia Pacific region, and together they reached out to all our people to hear what was on their minds. The Board noted progress against our 2020 diversity & inclusion targets and agreed targets for 2025. These are detailed on page 44. We recognise that there is still significant work to do, particularly at Executive Team level. We ensured that there were females on the shortlist for the CFO role and that the succession pools for all Executive Team roles have increasing representation both from females and from non-British nationalities.\n\nWe took time to understand the impact of COVID-19 on employee resilience and noted good progress with our injury rates. We continued to receive feedback on the anti-bullying and harassment programme as well as other training.\n\n## Board developments\n\nIn February 2020, we announced extensions to the terms for both Lewis Booth and Sir Frank Chapman as Non-Executive Directors, until the 2021 AGM at the latest. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, Lewis remained as the Chair of the Audit Committee during the year with his intended replacement, Nick Luff, continuing as a NonExecutive Director and member of the Audit Committee. I would like to thank Lewis for his continuing support through a challenging time. He has continued in his role to see us through the 2020 financial year and will step down as Chair of the Audit Committee with effect from the date of this report when Nick Luff will take over as we had previously planned. Sir Frank has been a tremendous support and source of advice for our product safety team in particular during his tenure and has also been a guiding voice as we have developed our sustainability agenda to this point. Jasmin Staiblin will also stand down from the Board at the 2021 AGM, along with Lewis and Sir Frank, as she will have served nine years on the Board at that time. I would like to thank all of them for their tremendous support during their tenure. Dame Angela Strank, who joined the Board in May 2020, will take over as chair of the Safety, Ethics & Sustainability Committee following Sir Frank's departure - a role we had in mind for her when she was recruited to the Board.\n\nI would also like to welcome Paul Adams who will join the Board on 11 March 2021 and will also join the Nominations & Governance Committee, Safety, Ethics & Sustainability Committee and the Science & Technology Committee. Paul's biography can be found on page 64.\n\nI would also like to thank Stephen Daintith who has been a highly valued member of the Board and the management team. He has made a huge contribution to the business, not least in response to the pandemic by taking rapid action to strengthen our liquidity. On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank him for his hard work, resilience and energy. I am delighted to welcome Panos Kakoullis who will join the Board in May as our Chief Financial Officer.\n\n## Looking forward\n\nI will look to Sir Kevin Smith, as Senior Independent Director, to start to look for my successor during 2021 as I approach the end of my tenure as Chairman. However, we still have a lot to achieve and deliver and I know that your Board is as committed as I am to see us through the current period.\n\nSir Ian Davis Chairman",

The Chairman is responsible for the leadership and effectiveness of the Board. The Chief Executive is responsible for the running of the Group's business and leads the Executive Team which comes together to communicate, review and agree on issues and actions of Group-wide significance.\n\nNon-Executive Directors support the Chairman and provide objective and constructive challenge to management. The Senior Independent Director (SID) provides a sounding board for the Chairman and serves as an intermediary for the Chief Executive, other Directors and shareholders when required.\n\nThe Company Secretary makes sure that appropriate and timely information is provided to the Board and its Committees and is responsible for advising and supporting the Chairman and Board on all governance matters. All Directors have access to the Company Secretary and may take independent professional advice at the Company's expense in conducting their duties.\n\n## Directors' independence\n\nWe continue to monitor and note potential conflicts of interest that each Director may have and recommend to the Board whether these should be authorised and if any conditions should be attached to such authorisations. The Directors are regularly reminded of their continuing obligations in relation to conflicts and are required to review and confirm their external interests at least annually. This helps us to determine whether each of them continues to be considered independent.\n\nIn 2020, the Board considered the independence of both Lewis Booth and Sir Frank Chapman who both completed their nine years as Non-Executive Directors in May and November 2020 respectively, and recommended their re-election at the 2020 AGM. Further information can be found on page 75.\n\nFollowing due consideration, the Board determined that all NonExecutive Directors continued to be independent in both character and judgement.\n\n## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\n## THE BOARD\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## THE ROLE OF THE BOARD\n\n## KEY MATTERS RESERVED FOR THE BOARD\n\nThe Board is ultimately responsible to shareholders for the direction, management, performance and long-term sustainable success of the Company.

In doing so, the Directors comply with their duties under section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 (see pages 56 to 57).\n\nThe Board has established certain principal committees to assist it in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, providing dedicated focus on particular areas, as set out below. The chair of each committee reports to the Board on the committee's activities after each meeting.\n\nIn addition to the Board's principal committees, it has established a sub-committee of Directors who each hold an appropriate level of UK national security clearance for the purpose of receiving and considering, on behalf of the Board, any UK classified information relating to the Group's programmes and activities. Beverly Goulet, a US national and independent Non-Executive Director, also sits on the board of Rolls-Royce North America Holdings, Inc. to create a link between the Board and the Group's North American govern ance structure.\n\nThe Group's long-term objectives, strategy and risk appetite\n\nThe Group's organisation and capability\n\nStakeholder engagement\n\nOverall corporate governance arrangements including Board and Committee composition, committee terms of reference, Directors' independence and conflicts of interest\n\nInternal controls, governance and risk management frameworks\n\n## THE BOARD COMMITTEES\n\nChanges to the corporate or capital structure of the Company\n\nAnnual Report and financial and regulatory announcements\n\nSignificant changes in accounting policies or practices\n\nAnnual budgets and financial expenditure and commitments above levels set by the Board\n\nOverview of speak up programme and cases reported through the Ethics Line\n\n<!-- image -->",

The programme is tailored based on experience and background and the requirements of the role.\n\nAll Directors visit the Group's main operating sites as part of their induction and are encouraged to make at least one visit to other sites each year throughout their tenure. However, as a result of COVID-19, all visits were postponed during 2020. These will resume as soon as possible as we regard these site visits as an important part of the induction process as well as for continuing education. They help Directors understand the Group's activities through direct experience of seeing processes in operation and by having discussions with a range of employees.\n\nDame Angela Strank was appointed to the Board in May 2020 and at that time joined the Nominations & Governance, Safety, Ethics & Sustainability and Science & Technology Committees. Since her appointment, she has embarked on her induction programme and met virtually with members of the Executive Team. Angela will be visiting Civil Aerospace in Derby, UK, Defence in Bristol, UK, and Power Systems in Friedrichshafen, Germany, as soon as it is possible.\n\nIt is important that the Directors continue to develop and refresh their understanding of the Group's activities. More detail of the Board's engagement with its stakeholders is set out on pages 72 to 73.\n\nIt is also important that the Directors regularly refresh and update their skills and knowledge and receive relevant training when necessary. Members of the Board also attend relevant seminars, conferences and training events to keep up-to-date on developments in key areas.\n\n## BOARD INDUCTION PROGRAMME FOR DAME ANGELA STRANK\n\n## PEOPLE TO MEET\n\n## KEY TOPICS COVERED\n\nChairman\n\n- - Overview of the Board\n- - Nominations & Governance Committee\n\nChairs of the Committees\n\n- - Overview of Committees\n- - Plan of work for the year\n- - Current issues\n\nChief Executive\n\n- - Business model\n- - Current strategic priorities\n- - Opportunities/risks\n- - Current issues\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\n- - Finance, treasury, M&A and tax overviews\n- - Budget\n- - Accounting issues\n\nChief Governance Officer\n\n- - UK Corporate Governance Code and directors' duties\n- - UK listed company requirements\n- - Rolls-Royce framework\n- - Board arrangements and meeting dates\n\nExecutive Team members and senior management\n\nOverview of each area of responsibility and current priorities, including:\n\n- - markets and competition\n- - operational and financial performance including KPIs\n- - functional leadership\n- - employee engagement\n- - culture and diversity\n- - sustainability strategy\n\nInternal and external auditors\n\n- - Audit report and findings\n- - Financial and non-financial controls\n- - Accounting judgements\n\n## TIMING\n\nWithin first three months",

Most scheduled meetings end with a private discussion of the Non-Executive Directors led by the Chairman of the Board or Committee, without the Executive Directors or members of the Executive Team or management present.\n\nDame Angela Strank joined the Board as a Non-Executive Director in May and was appointed to the Nominations & Governance, Safety, Ethics & Sustainability and Science & Technology Committees. In February, the Company announced Nick Luff's appointment as Chair of the Audit Committee. However, in light of COVID-19, Lewis Booth resumed chairing the Audit Committee on an interim basis and provided continuity of support through 2020. Nick will resume his role as Chair of the Audit Committee from March 2021. Nick stepped down from the Safety, Ethics & Sustainability Committee after its meeting in July.\n\n## Additional meetings and sub-committee meetings\n\nTo ensure the Board's response to COVID-19 remained current and in step with the unfolding developments both in the business and globally, the Board held weekly update calls from March to June and a series of additional meetings during 2020. There was also one additional meeting of the Nominations & Governance Committee to consider Directors' external appointments. The Audit Committee held nine additional meetings to support the finance team and our external auditors in view of the heightened workload and the challenges with remote working brought about by COVID-19. Four additional meetings of the Remuneration Committee were held to consider a revised Remuneration Policy specific to the challenges facing\n\nRolls-Royce as a result of the pandemic. The Safety, Ethics & Sustainability Committee held one additional meeting to consider the impacts of the pandemic on our safety, ethics and sustainability agendas. The Science & Technology Committee held one additional meeting to review the Group's engineering technologies, capabilities and skills post-restructuring.\n\nIn addition to the meetings set out above, the Board delegated authority to a sub-committee to approve certain matters specifically in relation to the rights issue. This sub-committee met four times during September to November. A sub-committee of the Remuneration Committee was also convened in November to consider share plan adjustments in relation to the rights issue.\n\nIn support of the Committees' work, where there is a requirement for greater, in-depth discussion, we hold deep dives into specific areas of focus outside the meeting schedule. In November, the Audit Committee reviewed in detail the finance transformation programme while the Safety, Ethics & Sustainability Committee held a deep dive into the safety management system. This was the second of three sessions on the topic, the first being held as part of a scheduled meeting and the third to be held in 2021.\n\n## Non-attendance\n\nBoard members' attendance was high in 2020 and our Directors attended an unprecedented number of meetings called at short notice. However, where Directors were unable to attend, this was solely due to other business commitments and they communicated their responses to the matters for consideration via the Chairman of the Board and the Committee Chairs, where relevant.",

        "page_content": "## STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT\n\nAt Rolls-Royce, we understand that who we are and how we behave matters not only to our people but to the many stakeholders who have an interest in our business.\n\nWe believe that stakeholder engagement remains vital to building a sustainable business and we interact with many stakeholders at different levels of the organisation. Engagement is carried out by those most relevant to the stakeholder group or issue.\n\nThe table below identifies some of our stakeholders and how both the Company and the Board engage with them. There has been continuous dialogue with our stakeholders throughout the year and this has become part of our governance framework. We believe we have a clear responsibility to all our stakeholders to return the Group to strength with a sustainable and right-sized cost base, aimed at ensuring the Group's future success and the Board intends to take all appropriate actions to secure this outcome.\n\nThe Board considers the different stakeholder groups and our engagement programmes and identifies opportunities for strengthening both its relationships and understanding to facilitate the decisions and contributions made by the Board to the success of the business.\n\nCustomers\n\n## Investors\n\nEmployees\n\nThe Board recognises that the quality of the Group's customer relationships is based on mutual trust as well as its engineering expertise. We recognise that as we recover from the impact of the pandemic, we must retain and strengthen our focus on playing a leading role in the transition to a net zero carbon global economy by creating the sustainable power that our customers require. In light of COVID-19, the Company and the Board have been regularly engaged with customers. Warren East reported on his meetings with Singapore Airlines, COMAC the aircraft manufacturer in China, and the Chairman of Gulf Air as well as a number of interactions he and Stephen Daintith had with our aircraft manufacturing customers. The Board regularly receives operational updates, including customer metrics and feedback, from each of the businesses with the business presidents regularly presenting to the Board. During the challenges faced as a result of COVID-19, the Board has kept very close to our customer engagement throughout the year and received specific feedback from each of the business presidents on the issues and mitigation plans including the impacts on our customers, which greatly influenced the Board's deliberations and support for the Executive Team when considering our strategy.\n\nThe investor relations team is the key interface between the investment community and the Board, providing frequent dialogue and feedback. The Chairman and members of the Board make themselves available to meet with institutional investors and seek to understand and prioritise the issues that matter most. In addition, the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer, supported by members of the Executive Team and investor relations, interact regularly with investors, most notably after our financial results, at conferences as well as at key points throughout the year. With 2020 being an unprecedented year, and as the COVID-19 pandemic took hold, the need for clear and effective communication with our investors became more important than ever and we adapted our investor engagement to suit an online environment. In May, unable to meet in person as usual at our AGM, we provided a virtual update on the business and encouraged shareholders to submit questions to the Board. In August, our Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer communicated our half-year results in a webcast format. Crucially, in the second half of the year our Executive Team, supported by our Chairman, held a virtual roadshow with our equity and debt investors to gain the support required to successfully achieve a rights issue and bond issuance, which further supplemented the additional liquidity provided by the UK Government. We also conducted a remuneration consultation process with our largest shareholders. More than ever we recognise the importance of our investors as key stakeholders in our discussions and endeavour to ensure that we are able to create confidence in our Company through financial performance and the economic impact of our decisions, robust governance and transparency of reporting and delivering a sustainable, stable and predictable performance.\n\nThe Board recognises that it is through our people that we fulfil our potential, achieve our vision and execute our strategy. During 2020, the Board ensured that the safety and wellbeing of our employees remained at the heart of our decision-making. Our employees were provided with regular video messages on the Group's intranet from the Executive Team and were kept up to date on the rapidly changing environment and the impact of COVID-19 on our business. Following any decisions, communications were sent to all employees with FAQ sections and employees were invited to Q&A sessions held by the Executive Team via webcast. In addition to this, we took time to understand the impact of COVID-19 on employee resilience and continued to note progress with our injury rates.\n\nWe take the role of Employee Champion very seriously to ensure there is a voice of the employees in the boardroom. Irene Dorner has continued in her role as Employee Champion for a fourth year and where possible meets with employee groups and attends employee stakeholder engagement meetings. Irene also has regular dialogue with the Chief People Officer and together they review the outcomes from the employee surveys and Ethics Line reports. Irene can be contacted by any employee by email. Beverly Goulet also continued in her role as the Board's Employee Champion for our North American employees and Lee Hsien Yang has been appointed this year as the Board's Employee Champion for Asia Pacific. The Employee Champions are supported by an employee stakeholder engagement group where we discuss what we have learnt and plan future schedules. The Employee Champions provide regular feedback to the Board on employee topics of interest and/or concern.",

Our Employee Champions recorded a video message to all employees in July 2020 and invited them to complete a survey suggesting other methods of engagement of benefit to them during such uncertain times and requested information on specific topics they want to discuss. A follow-up communication from our Employee Champions was made available to all employees on our internal website. Further engagement sessions have been scheduled for 2021 as a result of the survey, with a focus on diversity & inclusion as a topic employees sought to discuss with our Employee Champions. We believe that these methods of engagement with our employees are effective in building and maintaining trust and communication. They also act as a platform for employees to influence change in relation to matters that affect them.\n\nDuring 2020, Irene attended the European Works Council Select Committee with the most senior employee representatives across Europe, chaired by our head of employee relations. In November, Irene attended a Global D&I Council meeting and, together with Beverly and Hsien Yang, a people leadership team meeting chaired by the Chief People Officer. As can be read in the People and Culture and Ethics and Compliance reports (pages 40 to 45) and the Committee reports, the Board reviews both the behaviours and statistics on safety and diversity & inclusion as well as the talent management agenda at all levels across the Group. The Board also continued to receive feedback on the anti-bullying and harassment programme and other training. Furthermore, the Employee Champions ensured that the employee voice remained at the heart of Board debate on the fundamental restructuring.\n\nMany of our employees are also our shareholders and we encourage their participation in a variety of share plans. Recognising the complexity of a rights issue, we developed bespoke, clear and simple communications to create awareness and understanding of the transaction so that our employees could make informed decisions.\n\nThe Group's global supply chain is a vital contribution to its performance, with significant investment in resources to ensure the complex global supply chain is resilient and efficient. The interests of both our suppliers and partners are considered as part of the Board's discussions on manufacturing strategy and when reviewing specific projects. The Board supports our Executive Team who work collaboratively with our suppliers and partners to continue to improve operational performance through various means. There are of course a number of critical suppliers to the Group who, like us, have been materially impacted by COVID-19. As part of the assessment of the business continuity risks, the Audit Committee has focused on business continuity and the supply chain during 2020 when reviewing the individual business' risk management programme.\n\nCOVID-19 has significantly impacted our planned community investment and education outreach activities during 2020. Many planned events were cancelled, and projects delivered with schools and other community-based partners severely disrupted. However, we have worked with our partners to sustain engagement by adapting events, programmes and activities to virtual events wherever possible. In our STEM education outreach programme, we sought new opportunities to enhance engagement with young people and disadvantaged groups who have been significantly impacted by disruption to education and social activities. For example, our digital academy shared resources to help people of all ages around the globe to digitally upskill and we partnered with Scouts in the UK to share a library of educational activities with home-schooling parents. In addition, we introduced the 2020 Armed Forces Association (AFA) National Teacher of the Year at the virtual AFA annual conference in the US and created new STEM content for virtual delivery with many partners around the globe.\n\nWe responded to a variety of the challenges presented by COVID-19 so our 2020 contributions would be enhanced by a specific and rapid response to a dynamic situation. These contributions have been largely non-financial and include: manufacturing capability, including VentilatorChallengeUK Consortium to help increase the UK's supply of ventilators; local community involvement wherever Rolls-Royce has a footprint, including donations of hand sanitisers in China, to food banks in Derby, surplus PPE to Bristol NHS, and a policy change to encourage employees, furloughed or not, to become community volunteers at test centres etc, and providing our technical expertise, for example, some of our HSE personnel were seconded into Derby & Burton Hospitals Trust to assist in strategy planning.\n\nThe Board recognises the importance of governments and regulators as stakeholders. Not only are governments across the world customers but they also support the Group's investment in infrastructure and technology. The General Counsel provides regular updates to the Board on compliance with regulators and the Safety, Ethics & Sustainability Committee reviews how the business engages with airworthiness regulators as well as receiving updates on the continuing dialogue and co-operation with prosecutors, regulators and government agencies. The Board is updated on the Group's engagement with the tax authorities and the related regulatory landscape is discussed by both the Board and the Audit Committee.\n\nIn addition, meetings with ministers and senior officials are held as relevant throughout the year. During 2020, the Chairman, Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer met senior UK Government officials to discuss the financial status of the Company. The Chairman also met with the President, European Council (representing 27 member states), to discuss competitiveness issues, as well as decarbonisation and digitalisation challenges for our industry. He participated in a call with the President of the European Commission on the COVID-19 situation and the EU green deal, and in a virtual meeting with the EU Commissioner for Jobs and Social Rights to discuss an action plan for skills. Since then, we have been involved in the EU pact for skills for the aeronautic sector. The Chief Executive met senior government ministers during the COVID-19 crisis to explain the impact of the pandemic on the Group and the restructuring of the Civil Aerospace business. He also met with groups of MPs who are local to our facilities in the UK. The Group is also involved with the Aerospace and Defence Industries Association in Europe and the European Round Table for Industry.",

BHL's appointment was based on cultural fit, the research that BHL had undertaken which highlighted the areas that needed addressing, and commercial competitiveness. BHL had no other connection with the Company nor its Directors.\n\nFollowing a comprehensive review in 2018, slightly less in-depth reviews were conducted in 2019 and 2020. As in 2018, they covered Board composition and dynamics, the Board's role and the Board at work but with particular focus on those areas identified as requiring further development during the previous years' reviews.\n\nThe effectiveness of each of the Board's Committees was taken into account as part of the evaluation.\n\n## AREA OF FOCUS\n\n## 2020 FOCUS IDENTIFIED IN 2019\n\n## PROGRESS IN 2020\n\n## FOCUS FOR 2021\n\n## Board composition and dynamics\n\nThe Board's role\n\n## The Board at work\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Board could be clearer in the communication of their priorities and expectations with the Executive Team\n\nThe impact of COVID-19 drew close alignment on the priorities to restore the Group to financial health\n\nBoard succession is important as a number of Directors and the Chairman reach their nine-year terms in 2021 and 2022\n\nContinued close scrutiny of the plans and risks relating to the transformation programme.

BHL has reviewed and agreed this disclosure of Board effectiveness.\n\nIn addition to BHL's review, during a private meeting of the NonExecutive Directors, the Senior Independent Director, led a review of the Chairman's performance without the Chairman present. The Nominations & Governance Committee also met without any management present to discuss the performance of the Chief Executive. Constructive feedback was shared with each of the Chairman and Chief Executive.",

Paul is a member of the Nominations & Governance, Safety, Ethics & Sustainability and Science & Technology Committees. His full biography can be found at rolls-royce.com.\n\nGeorge Culmer and Dame Angela Strank both joined the Board in 2020 as Non-Executive Directors. Further information on George and Dame Angela's Committee appointments can be found on page 66, and information on Dame Angela's induction programme can be found on page 67. George's induction programme was reported in the 2019 Annual Report and Accounts. You can read the full biographies for George and Dame Angela at www.rolls-royce.com.\n\nPrior to making any new appointments to the Board, the Committee considers the skills and attributes required and, together with the Chairman, agrees a profile. The Committee also provides input into a shortlist of candidates. Members of the Committee were involved in the interview process for Paul and the Committee recommended the appointment to the Board. MWM Consulting was appointed to lead the search; they have signed up to the voluntary code of conduct for executive search firms and had no other connection to the Company or its Directors during the year. The Company Secretary ensures that new Directors have a thorough and appropriate induction programme. More detail about inductions and continuing development can be found on page 67.\n\nAt the 2020 AGM, on the recommendation of the Board, shareholders approved the re-election of both Lewis Booth and Sir Frank Chapman as Non-Executive Directors for a further term, although both Directors completed nine years on the Board in 2020. The Board carefully considered the extension of their terms and acknowledged that both Lewis and Sir Frank continued to provide constructive challenge and scrutiny of Board and Committee matters. Neither Director had served simultaneously with an Executive Director for the full nine years. For this reason, the Board concluded that both Lewis and Sir Frank remained independent. Lewis and Sir Frank will step down from the Board in May 2021 and will not stand for re-election at the 2021 AGM. In addition, Jasmin Staiblin will have completed nine years on the Board in May 2021 and will not stand for re-election at the 2021 AGM.\n\n## Key areas of focus for 2021\n\n- - Board succession\n- - Culture and behaviour\n- - Diversity & inclusion through continued restructure\n\nIn June 2020, the Committee considered the reappointment of Beverly Goulet for a further three years and recommended this to the Board. This was Bev's second three-year term and the Committee considered her effectiveness and commitment together with her attendance and time allocation to Rolls-Royce matters.\n\n## Directors' conflicts of interest\n\nAs required under the Code, any additional external appointments taken up by Directors during the year are considered by the Committee and approved by the Board prior to the Directors accepting further appointments. The Committee considers any conflicts that may arise as a result of any external appointments taken up by the Directors and the Board monitors the extent of those interests and the time commitment required to fulfil them to ensure that effectiveness is not compromised. As part of the Committee's discussions, the external appointments are considered against the parameters set by ISS. The Committee has found this to be a useful gauge when discussing whether there is potentially any impact on Directors' time commitments when taking on additional external appointments.\n\nIn 2020, the Directors demonstrated a strong commitment to the Company, as shown by their almost total attendance at all our meetings, whether scheduled or additional (see page 69). During the year, the Board considered, amongst others, the external appointments of Dame Angela Strank to SSE plc as a non-executive director, George Culmer to Aviva plc as chairman and Jasmin Staiblin as a board member of Ammann Group Holding AG and Enerim OY. The Board considered Warren East's appointment to ASML Holding N.V as a significant appointment in view of his position as Chief Executive and considering that ASML is a Dutch-listed company. The Board approved this appointment and took into consideration the fact that, as part of their ongoing development, the Executive Directors may seek one external non-executive role on a non-competitor board.\n\n## Succession planning\n\nAs part of the succession planning, the Committee considers the current skills, experience and tenure of the Directors and assesses future needs against the longer-term strategy of the Group.\n\nThe Committee regularly reviews succession planning at Board, Executive Team and senior management levels. This year, the Board considered the principal risk relating to talent and capability and reviewed emergency succession in light of COVID-19 in particular focusing on crisis governance and succession across the Executive Team and business leadership teams. Sharpening our talent management strategy and process has been a priority since 2018 and we",

        "page_content": "have improved succession planning by implementing systematic talent reviews, consistently assessing potential and closely monitoring the successors' development plans and proactively looking at external talent to improve the quality and diversity of our succession plans.\n\nThe Committee plays a vital role in promoting effective Board and leadership succession, making sure it is fully aligned to the Group's strategy. Following the announcement in August 2020 that Stephen Daintith had resigned as Chief Financial Officer and an Executive Director, the Committee was regularly appraised by the Chief People Officer on progress to identify and appoint a successor. In February 2021, the Committee recommended to the Board the appointment of Panos Kakoullis as Chief Financial Officer and as an Executive Director.\n\n## Diversity & inclusion\n\nIn 2020, the Committee continued to oversee the development of a diverse pipeline for succession. D&I continues to be an area of focus for the Board and for the Group as a whole. We support and monitor Group activities to increase the percentage of senior management roles held by women and other under-represented groups across the organisation. During the year, the Committee was updated on the Group's approach to diversity & inclusion and agreed the 2025 targets.\n\nOur Board diversity policy remains unchanged and we continue to ensure it remains in line with best practice. The policy is available at www.rolls-royce.com. We continue to promote an inclusive and diverse culture and the Committee reaffirmed our aspiration to meet and exceed the recommended voluntary target of 33% of Board positions being held by women, while recognising that we will fall short of this target for a temporary period as Jasmin Staiblin steps down from the Board. We have always recognised that there may be periods of change on the Board where we may fall short of our stated aim for periods of time while the Board is refreshed.\n\nThe Parker Review, first published in 2017, made a series of recommendations aimed at improving ethnic diversity on FTSE 100 boards. Our Board has one person of colour and we are therefore compliant with the Parker Review recommendations and the Committee will continue its work to maintain a balance on the Board of individuals representing a wide cross-section of experience, cultural backgrounds and specialisms.\n\nWe fully recognise that diversity in our Executive Team needs to be improved and there is a continued focus on improving this through succession planning. The Committee continued to support and monitor Group activities to increase the percentage of women and other under-represented groups in the senior leaders population. Last year, the Group's target was to achieve 21% by 2020 and 30% by 2025 (see page 44).\n\nI mproving D&I remains a priority and we continue to track progress. We are particularly pleased to note that, despite COVID-19, we have been able to increase female representation globally and increased the number of females in the ELG year-on-year. (See People and culture on page 44).\n\nMore on our progress against our 2020 and 2025 diversity & inclusion targets can be found on page 44.\n\n## Principal risk review\n\nThe principal risk of Talent and Capability was considered throughout the 2020. The Board met in full to review Talent and Capability as development of our leaders is critical to ensuring the right culture and behaviours are embedded across the Group and to ensure we maintain the right skills and capability for future growth.\n\n## Corporate governance\n\nWe strive to take an innovative approach in all that we do and that includes our approach to governance. We have always promoted good governance at Board level and, as we addressed the challenges presented by the global pandemic, we found that our governance was indeed appropriate at a time of crisis and needed no further change. Throughout 2020 we have continued to keep up-to-date through ensuring agendas were reflective of the current issues and information provided to the Board was always current and timely. It was encouraging that our approach to governance, when tested, was able to evolve and adapt as we remained flexible in a changing and uncertain external environment.\n\nWe have kept under review the enhancements put in place in 2018 to ensure we meet both the regulation and the spirit of the revised Code. This includes the Group's governance framework which is also applied to our subsidiary companies and is our response to the Wates principles. Extracts from the framework are available on the website at rolls-royce.com. You can read more about our framework on page 63.\n\n## Engagement with shareholders\n\nTogether with the Chief Governance Officer, I have met with investors and proxy advisers during the year to discuss our governance arrangements. Conversations were largely focused on the impact of COVID-19 on our ESG agenda and succession planning.\n\n## Role of the Committee\n\nThe Committee ensures that the composition of the Board is appropriate and relevant so that the Board is in the best position to oversee operational performance and to drive the Group's strategy. The Committee also keeps the Group's corporate governance arrangements under review.\n\n## Membership of the Committee\n\nAll members of the Committee are independent Non-Executive Directors. Our biographies are on pages 64 to 66 and meeting attendance is on page 69. No Director attends discussions relating to their own appointment. In addition to the members of the Committee, the Chief Executive attends when it is considered appropriate.\n\nThe Committee's responsibilities are outlined in its terms of reference which can be found at www.rolls-royce.com. We review these annually and refer them to the Board for approval. No changes have been made in 2020.\n\n## Sir Ian Davis\n\nChair of the Nominations & Governance Committee",

In light of COVID-19, I continued chairing the Audit Committee on an interim basis and provided continuity of support through 2020. Nick Luff will assume his role as Chair of the Audit Committee from March 2021. Unfortunately, it was not possible for us to meet with our shareholders in person in 2020. However, we look forward to our 2021 AGM, where we will be able to answer any questions regarding this report.\n\nThis report sets out the work of the Committee in 2020. The Committee recognised both the heightened workload and the challenges of remote working during 2020 and, therefore, reviewed the Company's reporting timetable. We recommended to the Board that the half-year announcement be delayed by several weeks and we introduced a series of additional, shorter meetings to support the finance team and our external auditors with meeting the revised schedule. So successful was this, we have adopted the same process for the 2020 full-year results and will continue to do so through 2021.\n\nWe also supported the Board in its preparations for the rights issue, keeping under regular review the working capital report which underpinned the rights issue together with the internal financial controls review and reporting. During the year, the Committee received individual business presentations focused primarily on the governance and control framework together with a review of the risk and assurance system. Each business has its own risk and audit committee and members of the Committee are invited to attend their meetings. We also received a detailed review from the Group's tax director, setting out the main drivers of the Group's tax position including the key areas of tax risk. Towards the end of the year, we held a separate meeting to carry out a deep dive review focused on the Group's finance transformation programme.\n\nThe Committee has played an active role in the succession of the Chief Financial Officer following the resignation of Stephen Daintith. Stephen has brought significant expertise and provided strong guidance to the Committee during his tenure and we wish him every success for the future.\n\n## Membership of the Committee\n\nIn addition to myself, members of the Committee during 2020 were George Culmer, Beverly Goulet, Lee Hsien Yang and Nick Luff, all Independent Non-Executive Directors. For the purposes of the Code and DTR 7.1, George Culmer, Beverly Goulet, Nick Luff and I have recent and relevant financial experience. The Board has confirmed that it believes that the Committee as a whole has competence\n\n## AUDIT\n\n## Key areas of focus for 2021\n\n- - Impact of COVID-19 on accounting assumptions and judgements\n- - The risk management and internal control environment in relation to the restructuring programme\n- - The continuing finance transformation programme\n- - Developments with the audit reforms in the UK\n- - Changes to the internal control framework influenced by the Brydon review\n- - Impact of climate change on assumptions\n\nrelevant to the Company's sector. Our biographies are on pages 64 to 66 and our meeting attendance is shown on page 69. In addition to the members of the Committee, the Chairman, Chief Executive, Chief Financial Officer and all Non-Executive Directors may attend one or more meetings at my invitation. The Committee is supported by the General Counsel, the corporate governance director, the group financial controller, the director of risk and internal audit and the external auditors.\n\n## Role of the Committee\n\nThe Committee is responsible for recommending to the Board the financial reporting, focusing on accounting policies, judgements and estimates; disclosures; compliance with regulations; and whether the Annual Report is fair, balanced and understandable.\n\nWe monitor the effectiveness of the risk management and internal control environment and review concerns of financial fraud. The Business Continuity and Financial Shock principal risks are considered by the Committee while the Cyber principal risk is reviewed by our data security committee.\n\nIn addition, the Committee provides oversight in respect of the scope, resources, results and effectiveness of internal audit. We are responsible for the relationship with and the effectiveness of the external auditor as well as approving their terms of engagement and fees.\n\nThe Committee's responsibilities are outlined in its terms of reference, available at rolls-royce.com. We review these annually and refer them to the Board for approval. No changes have been made in 2020.\n\n## Financial reporting\n\nThe Group has complex long-term contract accounting and every year the Committee spends much of its time reviewing the accounting policies and judgements implicit in the Group's financial results. In 2020, in addition to our scheduled workload, we focused much of our time on the assumptions in respect of the recovery of civil aviation, in particular the implications of changes in Civil Aerospace engine flying hours (EFHs), and all areas impacted by this, such as going concern, impairments, long-term contract accounting, potential onerous contracts and customer losses.\n\nWe have ensured that the disclosures in respect of all key areas of judgement are appropriate and balanced. In light of the increased regulatory guidance on enhancing disclosures, we have provided additional information with regard to the sensitivity of the estimates to changes in key assumptions which are summarised in note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 116.",

        "page_content": "In November 2020, the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) concluded their review of the Group's 2019 Annual Report. Their role is to consider compliance with reporting requirements; their review does not provide assurance that the 2019 Annual Report was correct in all material aspects. The principal areas where the FRC required further information were in relation to distributable profits; provision for Trent 1000 costs; and free cash flow and the summary funds flow statement. The Committee reviewed all correspondence in this regard and in December 2020, the Company received a final letter from\n\nthe FRC confirming their satisfaction with the responses provided and the closure of their enquiries. We welcome the FRC's engagement and have incorporated improvements in our 2020 Annual Report based on their observations and extended disclosures where these have been considered material and relevant.\n\nA summary of the principal matters we considered in respect of the 2020 Consolidated Financial Statements is set out below.\n\n## Significant issues relating to the 2020 financial statements:\n\n| AREA OF FOCUS                                        | CONSIDERATIONS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Alternative Performance  Measures (APMs)             | The Committee reviewed the clarity of the definitions and the reconciliations of the APM to its statutory  equivalent. The Committee concluded that the refined definitions and full reconciliations ensured there  was not undue prominence to APMs in the Annual Report (see notes 1, 2 and 28 to the Consolidated  Financial Statements).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| Accounting for Trent  1000 in-service issues         | The Committee considered the key judgements and estimates in accounting for the Trent 1000 in-service  issues and provisions made in respect of customer loss-making contracts and expected wastage costs. We  are satisfied that the provision held in respect of the future expected wastage costs and customer claims is  appropriate and therefore the exceptional wastage credit that has been excluded from underlying (see  notes 2 and 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| Consideration of   onerous contracts                 | In light of the impact of COVID-19 on our Civil Aerospace business and the significant reduction in EFHs, the  Committee paid particular attention to the drivers of the onerous contracts. We reviewed the nature of the  costs included in the assessment of onerous contracts, the discount rates applied in calculating the charge  and the sensitivity analysis performed. We ensured the outcome was included in the underlying performance  and the disclosures were appropriate (see notes 2 and 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).                                                                                                                                                     |\n| Deferred tax assets                                  | The Committee reviewed the basis for the recognition of UK deferred tax assets and considered the  judgements and estimates necessary to assess the recoverability of the UK deferred tax assets. We  confirmed the approach adopted and the additional disclosures included in note 5 to the Consolidated  Financial Statements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| Carrying value   of intangible and   tangible assets | The Committee assessed the carrying value and the recoverability of tangible and intangible assets, with a  specific focus on programme intangible assets in Civil Aerospace and the carrying value of the investments  the Company holds in the underlying Group. We confirmed that the basis on which management assesses  the risk of impairment, the methodology for calculating the recoverable amount, including the basis for the  key assumptions, the discount rates and the long-term growth rates was appropriate. Additionally, we  reviewed the sensitivity disclosures made in respect of goodwill and programme intangible assets. (See  note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). |\n| Going concern and  viability disclosures             | In light of COVID-19, we undertook an enhanced review of the going concern and viability position of the  Group in both our 2020 half-year and full-year results, including the basis for assessing the going concern  assumption for the business and the principal risks of the Group and how these were modelled in the  viability scenarios. We confirmed our agreement with the basis of the assessments and agreed the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| US dollar hedge book                                 | appropriate disclosures. See pages 52 to 55.  The Committee focused on the Group's hedge book position, in light of the impact of COVID-19 on our                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n\n## Fair, balanced and understandable\n\nAs part of its review of the 2020 Annual Report, the Committee considered whether the report, taken as a whole, was fair, balanced and understandable and that it provided the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company's position, performance, business model and strategy. In so doing, the Committee considers\n\nthe processes and controls involved in preparing the report. There is a robust governance framework to ensure the report is critically reviewed and signed off by key business and function teams. The Committee was satisfied that the process was effective and confirmed to the Board that, when taken as a whole, the Annual Report is fair, balanced and understandable.",

        "page_content": "## Risk management and the internal control environment\n\nOur risk management and internal control framework is described on page 46. We satisfied ourselves that improvements have been made in the approach to risk management including simplifying policies and guidance which has improved the clarity of risk and control ownership and through the focus on mitigating controls and risk appetite as described on page 46. Future improvements should focus on embedding more of the lessons learned from COVID-19 and in continuing to improve the quality of our risk assessment and management activities in relation to our restructuring programmes, financial planning and critical decision-making.\n\nWe also satisfied ourselves that the processes for identifying and managing risks are appropriate and that all principal risks and mitigating actions had been subject, during the year, to a detailed review by the Board or an appropriate Board Committee. Based on this and on our other activities, including consideration of the work of internal and external audit and attendance at the Committee by business and functional risk owners, we reported to the Board that a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group had been undertaken. Details of our principal risks are set out on pages 47 to 51. The Board allocated certain principal risks to the Committee and we considered these in detail throughout the year, as described below. From our discussions, we are satisfied that all of the principal risks that we oversee have received significant management attention during the year:\n\n- - Business Continuity: the Committee received updates on the status of the continuity risk management of each business, including the impact of COVID-19, particularly on our external suppliers and internal facilities.\n- - Cyber: at each meeting of our data security committee, emerging risks as a result of COVID-19 were considered together with lesson learnt from incidents and assessment of risk management effectiveness. Changes to the cyber security strategy were reviewed.\n- - Financial Shock: separated from market shock at the half-year, this was considered extensively during 2020 by the Committee and the Board due to COVID-19 and in our preparations for the rights issue. This included reviewing the Group's policies, procedures and controls for identifying, managing and mitigating financial shock in relation to, for example, financial scenario planning, financial forecasting, hedging and interest and discount rates.\n\n## Internal financial control\n\nThe Committee specifically reviews the Group's internal financial controls (see page 46). During 2020, we reviewed the results of self-attestation and testing performed by the internal control and i nternal audit teams to confirm the effective operation of key financial controls across the Group. We reviewed the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on our financial control environment and additional mitigating activities established as a result. We considered the external auditor's observations on the financial control environment. We reviewed the progress of the programme to strengthen financial reporting and compliance controls with particular focus on the use of spreadsheets, systems access and inventory management as well as the outcome of the increased supervisory review and oversight controls over balance sheet integrity and manual processes. We continued to review progress in and changes to the scope of the finance transformation programme with respect to financial control.\n\n## Effectiveness of risk management and internal control systems\n\nWe have conducted a review of the effectiveness of the Group's risk management and internal control systems, including those relating to the financial reporting process, and concluded that it is effective, whilst recognising the need for ongoing and continuous improvement. Where opportunities for improvement were identified, action plans have been put in place and progress is monitored by the Committee. We consider that our review of the risk management and internal control systems, in place throughout 2020 and up to the date of this report, satisfies the requirements of the Code, the DTR and the FRC's guidance on risk management.\n\n## Going concern and viability statements\n\nHaving regard to the net liabilities of \u00a34,875m on the Group's 2020 balance sheet, we paid particular attention to these assessments. We reviewed the processes and assumptions underlying the statements set out on pages 52 to 55, considering in particular:\n\n- - the Group's forecast funding position over the next five years;\n- - the forecasts for material subsidiaries making up this position;\n- - an analysis of impacts of severe but plausible risk scenarios, ensuring that these included relevant principal risks and risks considered as part of the rights issue;\n- - the impact of multiple risks occurring simultaneously;\n- - additional mitigating actions that could be taken in extreme circumstances; and\n- - the current borrowing facilities in place and the availability of future facilities.\n\nAs a result, we are satisfied that the going concern and viability statements have been prepared on an appropriate basis.\n\n## Internal audit\n\nThe director of risk and internal audit regularly attends and reports to the Committee on risk and internal audit matters including:\n\n- - quarterly - a dashboard identifying key trends and headline findings from internal audit reports issued in the period and the status of related agreed actions; key themes from internal audit's work and details of any specific significant findings raised that warrant the Committee's attention, including those relating to audits conducted as part of the Group's response to the DPAs; and\n- - annually - compliance with expenses policies for the Directors and the Executive Team; and an internal audit work plan for the following year.\n\nI meet the director of risk and internal audit before each meeting and on an ad hoc basis throughout the year, as do other members of the Committee, to discuss risk matters and the nature of internal audit findings in more depth. We continue to focus on the nature of issues raised by internal audit and the timescales to complete the related actions. The future work plan is risk-based, including risks to both short and longer-term objectives and balancing focus on principal risk areas and on business-as-usual transactional activity where controls are understood to be mature and established. Internal audit also provides assurance to our restructuring activities and incorporate the activities of our second line assurance functions in their approach. We monitor changes to their plan during the course",

        "page_content": "of the year and in view of the impact of COVID-19 on the Group, during the year we noted changes to the 2020 internal audit plan. We considered and reviewed the effectiveness of the Group's internal audit function, including resources, plans and performance as well as the function's interaction with management. Based on the reports and discussion, we are satisfied that the scope, extent and effectiveness of internal audit work are appropriate for the Group and that there is an appropriate plan in place to sustain this.\n\n## External audit\n\nPwC were appointed as the Group's external auditor for the financial year commencing on 1 January 2018 following a formal tender process in 2016. The external audit contract will be put out to tender at least every ten years. Ian Chambers is the lead audit partner and has been i n post since PwC were appointed; he will be required to rotate after five years. Other key audit partners will also be required to rotate every five years. Any future audit tenders will be carried out in line with the FRC's practice aid for audit committees.\n\nOther than the services detailed below, PwC have no other connection with the Company or its Directors.\n\n## 2020 audit\n\nThe Committee reviewed the quality of the external audit throughout the year and considered the performance of PwC, taking into account the Committee's own assessment and feedback, the results of a survey of senior finance personnel across the Group focusing on a range of factors we considered relevant to audit quality, feedback from the auditors on their performance against their own objectives and the firm-wide audit quality inspection report issued by the FRC in January 2020 regarding the Group's Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2018.\n\nBased on these reviews, the Committee concluded that there had been appropriate focus and challenge by PwC on the primary areas of the audit and that they had applied robust challenge and scepticism throughout the audit. Consequently, the Committee has recommended to the Board that they be reappointed at the 2021 AGM.\n\nIn May 2020, PwC presented its audit plan, which identified its assessment of the key audit risks and the proposed scope of audit work. We agreed the approach and scope to be undertaken. Subsequently, an updated plan was agreed in November 2020, building on the work undertaken at the half-year 2020. Key risks and the audit approach to these risks are discussed in the Independent Auditor's Report (pages 190 to 203), which also highlights the other risks that PwC drew to our attention.\n\nAs part of the reporting of the half-year and full-year results, in August 2020 and March 2021, PwC reported to the Committee on its assessment of the Group's judgements and estimates in respect of these risks and the adequacy of the reporting. Where effective to do so, PwC also reported on its assessment of the Group's controls.\n\nI meet with the lead partner prior to each Committee meeting and the whole Committee has a private meeting with PwC at least once a year.\n\nDuring 2020, the Audit Quality Review Team (AQRT) of the FRC conducted a review of PwC's audit of the Group's Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2019. In December 2020, the AQRT provided their final report and I, as Chair of the Committee, have acknowledged the findings with the FRC and discussed them with the audit partner. The report concluded that there were no significant findings with only one matter requiring improvement. PwC have reported to the Audit Committee their response to the findings and how the suggested improvements have been incorporated into the current audit along with continuation of the areas identified as being of a high standard.\n\n## Non-audit services\n\nIn order to safeguard the auditor's independence and objectivity, and in accordance with the FRC's ethical standard, we do not engage PwC for any non-audit services except where it is work that they must, or are clearly best-suited to, perform. Accordingly, our policy for the engagement of the auditor to undertake non-audit services broadly l i mit these to audit-related services such as reporting to lenders and grant providers, where there is a requirement by law or regulation to perform the work. All other non-audit services are considered on a case-by-case basis in light of the requirements of the ethical standards and in compliance with our own policy.\n\nFees paid to PwC are set out in note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 137. All proposed services must be pre-approved in accordance with the policy which is reviewed and approved annually. Above defined levels, my approval is also required before PwC is engaged. Quarterly, we also review the non-audit fees charged by PwC.\n\nNon-audit related fees paid to the auditor during the year were \u00a32.7m (2019: \u00a31.1m), representing 26% (2019: 11%) of the audit fee. This included \u00a31.0m (2019: \u00a30.5m) relating to the review of the halfyear results. PwC was also engaged as reporting accountant for the rights issue and bond workstreams, with total fees of \u00a31.0m, representing 10% of the audit fee. Our annual review of the external auditor takes into account the nature and level of all services provided.\n\nBased on our review of the services provided by PwC and discussion with the lead audit partner, we concluded that neither the nature nor the scale of these services gave any concerns regarding the objectivity or independence of PwC.\n\n## Compliance\n\nDuring 2020, the Company complied with the relevant provisions of The Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender Processes and Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014, as disclosed within the external audit section.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis has been an extraordinary year and I would like to thank the management team, the finance team and the external auditors for their enthusiasm and resilience as we handled new issues compounded by the need for remote working.\n\n## Lewis Booth\n\nChair of the Audit Committee",

No Group-level bonuses will be paid for 2020 and the existing LTIP awards are not expected to vest for the next three years.\n\nLooking forward, there remains significant uncertainty over the severity, extent and duration of the pandemic and therefore the timing and shape of the recovery in our key markets, particularly in the civil aviation sector. As a Committee, we are acutely aware of the need to reward and motivate our people to deliver in a way that aligns with the interests of our shareholders.\n\nThe Committee met on eight occasions between April and December to work through what needed to be done. Initially, we considered whether we could reset the incentive targets under our current policy but concluded that the current remuneration policy does not work and will not support the necessary actions required to restructure and accelerate the Group's recovery to future growth. We gave some thought to whether restricted stock would be appropriate but concluded that it would not drive the performance that we need to deliver in the next few years. We also considered the intense workload and elevated risks faced by management and, whilst we recognise the i mpact of the pandemic on all of our stakeholders, we are increasingly concerned that we retain our key talent.\n\nWe concluded that the right course of action was to develop a new policy which is bespoke to Rolls-Royce and our unique circumstances.\n\n## What needs to happen\n\nWe need to incentivise our people to deliver our business strategy and restore our financial performance by:\n\n- - generating cash to strengthen the balance sheet and reduce net debt;\n- - improving operating margins to improve the quality of our underlying profit and cash;\n\n## Areas of focus for 2021\n\n- - Continue to review and carefully monitor the incentive measures and targets to ensure that they remain aligned with performance and strategy, including ongoing consideration of sustainability measures\n- - Implement the new remuneration policy, subject to shareholder approval\n- - Gain further insights into the remuneration of the workforce to further inform decisions on senior management reward\n- - completing an ambitious restructuring plan in the Civil Aerospace business and the central functions;\n- - growing revenue in our Power Systems and Defence businesses; and\n- - engaging our people to deliver during an unprecedented period of disruption for the organisation.\n\nOur remuneration policy must move us from where we are now to where we need to be. Accordingly, we have focused on:\n\n- - retaining our talent;\n- - emphasising short-term performance turning into longer-term growth;\n- - delivering reward in shares and requiring the long-term holding of those shares; and\n- - ensuring alignment between the Executive Directors, shareholders and the wider organisation.\n\nWe must balance the incentivisation of key short-term measures that are critical to our future success with longer-term value creation for our shareholders, whilst at the same time ensuring that our people are motivated and rewarded for delivering our recovery.\n\n## New remuneration policy\n\nThe policy comprises a new incentive plan designed to reward the key drivers for success, recognising the very different challenges for each of our businesses. It provides greater focus on shorter-term performance measures reflecting the urgency of our challenges and the importance of the actions during 2021 but includes longer-term, cumulative measures in 2022 and 2023. This is a hybrid scheme which replaces the current annual bonus and LTIP structure and removes the risk of windfall gains arising from grants issued up front in a traditional LTIP. Any awards from this plan will be deferred into shares after the end of the performance period at the share price at that time.\n\nAt the same time, we have reduced the maximum award which can be earned under the plan recognising the wider stakeholder environment and the shorter-term focus. This structure will give the Committee greater control to determine incentive outturns based on performance against strategy and we retain our usual discretion to ensure a fair result.\n\nThe shorter-term focus of the metrics is balanced by the delivery of incentive awards in shares, which will be required to be held for long periods, ensuring alignment with our shareholders. In addition, Executive Directors will take a portion of their salary in shares, deferred for two years, which further contributes to that alignment.",

        "page_content": "We have taken the opportunity to lower overall fixed reward, reducing Executive Directors' pension contributions to 12% with effect from January 2021, which fully aligns the Executive Directors' pension to the wider workforce.\n\nWe are focused on creating the right incentive structure for our business given our current circumstances. The new policy represents an intervention under extraordinary circumstances. As a Committee we will carefully monitor these arrangements in the context of the business circumstances and consider a more business-as-usual structure when and if appropriate.\n\n## Consultation with shareholders\n\nWe have consulted with our largest shareholders and the proxy agencies on the new policy. The meetings have been extremely helpful to enable us to explain the context for the bespoke approach and why it is appropriate for Rolls-Royce in these challenging circumstances. Our shareholders have given us valuable feedback to enable us to finalise the proposed policy and we have received a good level of support for both the overall approach and detailed policy.\n\n## Appointment of Chief Financial Officer\n\nI am pleased that we have appointed Panos Kakoullis as our new Chief Financial Officer, who will join us in May 2021. We intend to apply the proposed new policy in setting Panos' reward package and further details are included in the report (see page 95).\n\n## 2020 outturns\n\nWe had made good progress in 2019 on our transformation journey, reducing our cost base and improving cash generation to hit our cash flow target of \u00a31bn. However, the global pandemic has been devastating for the aerospace industry in 2020, forcing us fundamentally to reset our business targets and focus on strengthening our balance sheet to support our financial recovery.\n\nI t became clear from an early stage in 2020 that our in-year financial performance (both profit and cash) would be severely impacted and that we would not achieve the financial targets to generate a bonus. With respect to non-financial metrics, we were pleased to see a continued strong response to our engagement survey with an improved overall score despite the difficult circumstances that our employees faced with salary reductions and deferrals, furlough and significant numbers of redundancies. It is testament to the loyalty and resilience of our management team and employees that we have seen improved employee engagement against this backdrop.\n\nAs a result of our financial performance in 2020, the Committee has confirmed that no bonus will be payable at Group level. This is consistent with the experience of all our stakeholders and is entirely appropriate for our circumstances.\n\nOur long-term incentive plan targets for the 2018 plan will have a zero outturn. The severe effect of the pandemic on our financial performance in 2020 and beyond will also mean that the 2019 and 2020 LTIPs are no longer expected to vest.\n\nThe Committee feels that this is in line with the experience of our stakeholders and has chosen not to revisit these plans but rather to focus on a new remuneration policy that rewards delivery and execution of the actions that are needed in the next few years.\n\n## 2020 salary review\n\nThe Committee has reviewed the salary levels of the Executive Directors and has concluded that there will be no increases in 2021 i n line with the majority of the wider workforce. This will be the fourth year of zero increases for Executive Directors but is appropriate in the circumstances.\n\n## Wider workforce\n\nThe Committee has been kept informed of the broader reward actions taken across the workforce this year which have included furlough, reduced hours working, salary reductions and deferrals. Mindful of the difficult position that the Group faced and the experience of all stakeholders, the Executive Directors led the way, by agreeing to the deferral of 30% of their 2019 bonus, taking a 10% salary reduction plus a 10% salary deferral from April to December 2020. The Executive Directors also agreed to reduce pension allowances to 12% of salary from 1 January 2021. This reduction is sooner than previously anticipated under our policy and fully aligns the Executive Directors' pension contribution rate to the UK workforce rate.\n\nThe Committee has also been keen to ensure that as the new remuneration policy has developed, there is alignment to the wider workforce and that we are putting a plan in place that can cascade down the organisation rather than focusing only on the Executive Team. This has been front of mind in developing the metrics that will apply across the Group's bonus plans, so that the whole organisation is focused on delivering financial performance via the metrics that are applicable to each business.\n\n## Membership and operation of the Committee\n\nIn addition to myself, members of the Committee during 2020 were Lewis Booth, Beverly Goulet and Sir Kevin Smith. All Committee members are independent Non-Executive Directors. Our biographies are on pages 64 to 66 and our meeting attendance is on page 69. In addition to the members of the Committee, the Chairman, Chief Executive, Chief Financial Officer and any of the Non-Executive Directors may attend one or more meetings at the invitation of the Committee Chair. The Committee is supported by the Company Secretary, the Chief People Officer and the people director, performance and reward.\n\nNo Executive Director or Executive Team member was present during discussion of his or her own remuneration package and they were not i nvolved in the final approval of the new remuneration policy design.\n\nThe Committee's responsibilities are outlined in its terms of reference, available at rolls-royce.com. We review these annually and refer them to the Board for approval. No changes were made in 2020.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nMany hyperboles have been used to describe 2020 and I will not attempt to find more. Suffice to say that this has been an extremely difficult year for everyone, but I am confident that we have developed a remuneration policy which supports what we need to achieve over the next few years. As a Committee, we will be vigilant and mindful of our responsibilities. I appreciate the encouragement and support of our shareholders thus far and trust that they will continue to support us.\n\n## Irene Dorner\n\nChair of the Remuneration Committee",

A unique solution, specific to our circumstances, was proposed and discussed with shareholders and their feedback was incorporated into the final policy design.\n\nThe key proposed changes are as follows:\n\n- - a new incentive plan designed to reward the key drivers for success across our businesses, with focus on shorter-term metrics in 2021, with additional longer-term metrics in 2022 and 2023;\n- - no LTIPs for the duration of the policy, minimising the risk of windfall gains;\n- - a reduction in the maximum incentive level from 200% of target to 175%;\n- - a focus on share-based reward with incentives delivered fully in shares and 30% of salary deferred into shares for the Chief Executive and 20% for other Executive Directors;\n- - long deferral periods on incentive awards, increasing the average duration by one year versus existing incentives; and\n- - an immediate reduction in pension contributions to 12% of salary to align with the wider workforce.\n\nIn developing the policy, the Committee has also created alignment with the remuneration of the wider workforce though a cascade of key elements of the policy down through the organisation.",

        "page_content": "## REMUNERATION POLICY FROM 2021\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe policy will take effect from 13 May 2021, subject to shareholder approval at the AGM. The letter from the Chair of the Remuneration Committee sets out the decision-making process for recommending a new policy (see page 81).\n\n## Key policy themes\n\nAt the 2020 AGM, shareholders approved a new remuneration policy, which was broadly similar to the one that was in place previously, on the basis that at the time the Committee felt that it continued to support the business strategy; however, the devastating impact of COVID-19 on the Aerospace sector has forced the Committee to review the policy once again to ensure that it is right for the current circumstances and supports the necessary restructure and the recovery required to secure future growth over the next three years. They have concluded that a bespoke solution is needed that is tailored to the specific challenges facing Rolls-Royce and which will:\n\n- -Retain talent - Ensure that we have the right talent in our organisation to deliver the financial recovery and a return to growth. Shareholders have shared this concern during the consultation process. The changes we are proposing to our remuneration policy are designed to engage and motivate our talent and reward the behaviours that we need to succeed in the current circumstances. We also need to be able to recruit new talent into the organisation over the next few years to secure our future. Our policy needs to attract and motivate key talent to deliver and execute our strategy.\n- -Place emphasis on short-term performance turning into longerterm growth - This reflects the urgency of our challenges and the i mportance of the actions during 2021 to restore financial stability. We also recognise that we must balance the incentivisation of key short-term measures that are critical to our future success with longer-term value creation for our shareholders.\n- -Emphasise shares and long-term holding of those shares - As part of the balance of incentivising short-term performance with longer -term shareholder interests we are proposing that 100% of any incentive payment should be delivered in shares with meaningful deferral requirements. In addition, a proportion of fixed pay will be delivered in shares. This both protects cash and increases executive alignment with shareholders.\n- -Ensure alignment between Executive Directors and the wider organisatio n - It is important that our policy cascades throughout the organisation and all employees are rewarded for delivery and execution of our policy.\n\nThe Committee sees this as a temporary intervention and intends to consider a more business-as-usual policy in due course.\n\n## Changes to policy design\n\nWe have developed a policy which is specific to the challenges facing Rolls-Royce which has been carefully designed to incentivise our people to restore our financial performance through:\n\n- - cash generation to strengthen the balance sheet and reduce net debt;\n- - improved operating margins to improve the quality of our underlying profit and cash;\n- - an ambitious restructuring plan in the Civil Aerospace business and the central functions;\n- - revenue growth in our Power Systems and Defence businesses; and\n- - engaging our people to deliver during an unprecedented period of disruption for the organisation.\n\nIn creating this solution we have aimed to ensure that the focus on short-term performance is balanced with long-term value creation and whilst the overall target reward package is maintained, there is a significant reduction in the maximum, together with heavy emphasis on delivery in shares and long-term deferral of those shares.\n\nNo Executive Director or Executive Team member was present during discussion of his or her own remuneration package and they were not i nvolved in the final approval of the new remuneration policy design.\n\n## A new incentive plan\n\nThis has been designed to reward the key drivers for success across our businesses, supporting the financial recovery required in 2021 and beyond. Initially the focus will be on short-term metrics in 2021; cash, profit, cost base reduction and people. For 2022 and 2023 l onger-term metrics will be introduced including net debt reduction, cumulative profit and cash, TSR and a sustainability metric. The short-term metrics will be set annually, whereas the long-term metrics have been set by the Committee at the beginning of 2021. The structure of the incentive plan is designed to reflect the urgency of our challenges and the importance of delivery and execution in 2021. There will be no cash awards from this plan - any awards will be delivered in shares.\n\n|                          | 2021   | 2022   | 2023   |\n|--------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Financial                |        |        |        |\n| Cash                     | 37.5%  | 20.0%  | 20.0%  |\n| Profit                   | 37.5%  | 20.0%  | 20.0%  |\n| Costbase reduction       | 15.0%  | 10.0%  |        |\n| Total financial          | 90.0%  | 50.0%  | 40.0%  |\n| Non-financial            |        |        |        |\n| People                   | 10.0%  | 10.0%  | 10.0%  |\n| Total non-financial      | 10.0%  | 10.0%  | 10.0%  |\n| Long term \u00b9              |        |        |        |\n| Cumulative cash (2 year) |        | 20.0%  |        |\n| Net debt                 |        | 20.0%  |        |\n| Cumulative cash (3 year) |        |        | 20.0%  |\n| Relative TSR             |        |        | 25.0%  |\n| CO2 sustainability       |        |        | 5.0%   |\n| Total long term          |        | 40.0%  | 50.0%  |\n| Total                    | 100.0% | 100.0% | 100.0% |\n\n- 1 Long-term targets set in 2021.",

        "page_content": "This plan will be the only incentive plan in operation for the period of the policy; it will replace the current annual incentive and longterm incentive plan. This removes the risk of windfalls arising from grants issued at current share price and places greater control for the Remuneration Committee to determine incentive outturns based on performance against strategy.\n\nThe target award level for the CEO will be 220% of salary, and 190% of salary for other Executive Directors.\n\n## A reduction in maximum potential awards\n\nThis recognises the stakeholder environment and shorter-term performance periods upon which a significant proportion of the incentives over the three-year period would be based. The maximum is reduced from 200% of target to 175%. For the Chief Executive, this is from 430% to 385% and for other Executive Directors, from 375% to 333%.\n\n## Delivery of incentives and pay in shares\n\nAll awards from the incentive will be deferred into shares at the end of a performance period and will be settled as follows:\n\n- - 40% after three years\n- - 60% after four years\n\nWhen compared with the current combination of cash bonus, deferred bonus shares and LTIP (including holding periods) the actual duration of shareholdings is materially increased. In addition, 30% of salary will be deferred into shares for the Chief Executive and 20% for other Executive Directors, which will be required to be deferred for t wo years. This creates alignment with the long-term interests of our shareholders and balances the focus on shorter-term metrics, helping to ensure the longer-term balance in the reward package.\n\n## Pension reduction\n\nI n the current policy we committed to reduce pension contributions for existing Executive Directors from a maximum of 25% of salary to 17% by 2022 to align with the wider workforce rate for existing UK employees. 17% was a weighted average wider workforce rate at that time, which has now reduced to 12% of salary following the closure of the UK Defined Benefit pension plan to future accrual. As part of the new policy we have reduced pension contributions to 12% of salary with effect from 1 January 2021.\n\n## Consideration of shareholder feedback\n\nDuring the policy review we have engaged in detailed consultation with our largest shareholders and the proxy agencies to provide context for the proposed new policy and gain feedback on how it could be improved. We have been pleased that the majority of our shareholders understand the context for the new policy and support the approach of developing a bespoke solution that is unique to our circumstances. The overall feedback from this consultation was:\n\n- - an understanding of the need to place more focus on the shortterm performance metrics to deliver financial stability;\n- - support for us continuing to apply performance based incentives, rather than using restricted stock;\n- - a need to align the incentive targets with the promises made in our equity raise;\n- - support for alignment of shareholder interests through a significant proportion of the package being delivered in shares;\n- - recognition of the accelerated pension reduction to 12% of salary and the reduction in maximum incentive award to 175% of target;\n- - the importance of focusing on talent retention and attraction;\n- - the importance of aligning the wider workforce with the Executive Directors' remuneration;\n- - the approach is simple and well balanced;\n- - the trust placed in the Remuneration Committee's track record in applying discretion - as this is expected to be key to ensuring appropriate outcomes for the next three years. Setting stretching but achievable targets will be key as will the disclosure of those targets; and\n- - support for inclusion of a CO2 based sustainability metric as a long-term measure.\n\nThese views have been reflected in the final policy design for 2021.",

        "page_content": "## Performance measures and targets\n\nThe Committee will set Group financial targets for incentive awards with reference to the prior year and to forward-looking business forecasts, ensuring the targets are appropriately stretching. Metrics may include both annual and longer-term measures.\n\nThe Committee may, in the context of the underlying business strategy, use different performance measures for incentives and/or vary the weightings of the measures, including increasing the proportion based on Group measures.\n\nThe measurement of performance against performance targets is at the Committee's discretion, which may include appropriate adjustments to financial or non-financial elements and/or consideration of overall performance in the round. Adjustments may be either upwards or downwards.\n\nLong-term performance conditions may also be replaced or varied if an event occurs or circumstances arise which cause the Committee to determine that the performance conditions have ceased to be appropriate.\n\n## Policy on new appointments\n\nThe Committee will appoint new Executive Directors with a package that is in line with the remuneration policy. Base salary may be set at a higher or lower level than the previous incumbent. The maximum incentive opportunity on appointment is 385% for the Chief Executive and 333% for other Executive Directors.\n\nRemuneration forfeited on resignation from a previous employer may be compensated. This will be considered on a case-by-case basis and may comprise cash or shares. In general:\n\n- - if such remuneration was in the form of shares, compensation will be in the Company's shares;\n- - if remuneration was subject to achievement of performance conditions, compensation will, where possible, be subject to performance (either Rolls-Royce performance conditions or actual/forecast performance outturns from the previous company); and\n- - the timing of any compensation will, where practicable, match the vesting schedule of the remuneration forfeited.\n\nLegacy terms for internal appointments may be honoured, including any outstanding incentive awards. If an Executive Director is appointed following a merger or an acquisition of a company by Rolls-Royce, legacy terms and conditions may be honoured.\n\n## Wider workforce considerations\n\nWhen setting remuneration for Executive Directors and the senior management team, the Committee carefully considers wider remuneration across the Group, including salary increases, bonus awards, share plan participation and pay ratios between Executive Directors and other employees.\n\nThis has been a particular area of focus for the Committee in designing a new policy that is capable of cascade down the organisation.\n\nThere have been a number of additional areas where alignment has been created between Executive Directors and the workforce in 2020 including salary reductions and deferrals, and alignment of pension contributions at 12% of salary.\n\nAt more senior levels, remuneration is increasingly long-term and larger proportions are dependent on Group and business performance, as well as individual performance and an increasingly larger proportion is delivered in the form of shares. In terms of the management population generally, the direction of travel is to re-balance the total reward package from fixed elements to variable performancerelated elements to support cultural transformation. The Committee periodically reviews benchmarking data to ensure that they are aligned with market practice within the appropriate comparator groups, as one source of data.\n\nWe are committed to sharing business success across the organisation, with employees participating in a short-term incentive plan. There is strong alignment of business metrics between the Executive Directors bonus plan and those in which the majority of the workforce participate. In addition, the Group offers an all-employee sharesave plan to eligible employees globally every two years which aligns employee i nterests with those of our shareholders. This continues to be a popular benefit with over 40% of employees joining the most recent plan.\n\nI nput on the new remuneration policy was sought from the Company's Board apprentice cohort. Application of the policy will be influenced by the remuneration arrangements for all employees. Irene Dorner has designated responsibility for engaging with employees and bringing their voice into the boardroom, in addition to being the Chair of the Remuneration Committee, which further strengthens the link between employees and executive remuneration. See stakeholder engagement, page 72.\n\n## Share plans\n\nThe Committee retains a number of discretions consistent with the relevant share plan rules. In the event of any variation in the share capital of the Company, a demerger, special dividend, distribution or any other transaction which will materially affect the value of shares, the Committee may make an adjustment to the number or class of shares subject to award.\n\nThe treatment of leavers in our ShareSave and Share Incentive Plan is covered by the respective plan rules. Change of control provisions in respect of employee share plans are set out on page 210.\n\n## Termination\n\nThe Company is required to give Executive Directors 12 months' notice under their service contracts. Payment in lieu of notice will not exceed the value of 12 months' salary, benefits and pension contributions. Both mitigation and the timing of payments through the notice period will be considered by the Committee where appropriate, as will the funding of reasonable outplacement and other professional fees. There is no automatic entitlement to an incentive. Taking into account the circumstances, the Committee has discretion to award an incentive applying the relevant performance conditions and with appropriate time pro-rating.\n\nDeferred shares from the incentive plan will generally be retained in cases such as retirement, death, injury, ill-health, redundancy or any other reason at the discretion of the Committee and may include appropriate time pro-rating. Awards will typically vest at the normal time unless the Committee determines otherwise.",

        "page_content": "For the LTIP grants issued under the previous policy, the rules state that unvested awards may be preserved at the Committee's discretion according to the circumstances. In such cases vesting will be at the normal date, subject to the established performance conditions, and pro-rated to employment in the performance period. In cases such as death and terminal illness, the Committee also has the discretion to vest the awards immediately using an estimate of future outturn. If an individual leaves after the LTIP shares have vested but during the holding period, shares will not be forfeited but the holdi ng period will remain in force. The Committee also has the discretion to mitigate or clawback awards where an Executive Director retires and then becomes employed or engaged by another business in a non-voluntary capacity within 12 months.\n\n## Post-employment\n\nPost-employment, an Executive Director will normally be required to retain the lower of their shareholding requirement or their actual shareholding at leaving date (based on shares vesting following the introduction of the new policy) for one year after leaving, and 50% of this level for a second year. The Committee can waive or modify this requirement (for example in compassionate circumstances).\n\n## Service contracts\n\nThe service contract for Warren East includes 12 months' notice of termination from the Company and six months' notice from the Executive Director.

In particular our variable pay arrangements continue to focus on delivering an unprecedented level   of transformation.                                  |\n|                                                     | The Committee considers that our variable pay structure does not encourage inappropriate risk-taking.                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n|                                                     | The incentives are subject to the achievement of stretching performance targets, and the Committee's holistic  assessment of performance that can result in the application of discretion.                                                                                                   |\n|                                                     | The use of holding periods, the payment of fixed salary in shares with holding periods, and our shareholding requirements  (including after leaving employment with Rolls-Royce) provide a clear link to the ongoing performance of the business  and therefore alignment with shareholders. |\n|                                                     | Malus and clawback provisions also apply to the incentive plan.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n\nmonths' notice from the Executive Director. All contracts include the entitlement to paid holidays, sick pay, and other standard employment terms including reimbursement of reasonable business expenses.\n\nThe Chairman and Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment.

Service contracts and letters of appointment can be viewed at the Company's registered office.\n\n## Legacy commitments\n\nAny remuneration payments and/or payments for loss of office made under legacy arrangements prior to the approval of the Company's remuneration policy may be paid out subject to the terms of the remuneration policy in place at the time they were agreed. For these purposes, 'payments' include the Company satisfying awards of variable remuneration and, in relation to an award over shares, the terms of the payment are agreed at the time the award is granted. LTIPs granted under previous policies remain in place, consistent with the terms of that policy.\n\n## Minor amendments\n\nThe Committee may make minor amendments to the policy (for regulatory, exchange control, tax or administrative purposes or to take account of a change in legislation) without obtaining shareholder approval.",

The last increase made to Warren East was in September 2017. A 10% reduction in salary was applied from April to December 2020. In addition, a further 10% of salary was deferred. The deferred amount was repaid in December 2020.\n- 2 The 2020 long-term incentives value is based on the 2018 LTIP award due to its three-year performance period ending on 31 December 2020. The 2018 LTIP award will lapse on 8 March 2021 as the performance conditions were not met.\n- 3 The 2019 long-term incentives value is based on the 2017 LTIP award due to its three-year performance period ending on 31 December 2019. The 2017 LTIP award matured on 5 May 2020 at 53% of maximum, determined according to the achievement against the performance measures during the performance period. The 2019 long-term incentives value has been updated from the 2019 Annual Report. This value is now based on the share price on 5 May 2020 of 102.95p and has been adjusted for the rights issue.\n\n## a) Salary\n\nThe Company provides suitable competitive salaries to attract and retain individuals of the right calibre to develop and execute the business strategy. Given the significant impact of COVID-19 on the Group in 2020, Warren East and Stephen Daintith both had a temporary reduction in their salary from April to the end of 2020 and an additional 10% salary deferral (which was repaid in December 2020). The Committee reviewed the salary of Warren East as part of the remuneration policy review and agreed there would be no increases for 2021 (which is the fourth consecutive year of no pay adjustment). In addition as part of the policy review, 30% of his 2021 salary is proposed to be deferred into shares for two years.\n\n| Executive Director   | Base salary as at 1 March 2021   | Base salary as at 1 March 2020   |\n|----------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Warren East          | \u00a3943,500                         | \u00a3943,500                         |\n| Stephen Daintith     | \u00a3680,000                         | \u00a3680,000                         |\n\n## b) Executive Directors' benefits (audited)\n\nBenefits are provided to ensure that remuneration packages remain sufficiently competitive to attract and retain individuals of the right calibre to develop and execute the business strategy and to enable them to devote themselves fully to their roles.

Executive Directors receive any annual bonus awarded in March following the performance period. 60% of the bonus is paid in cash with the remaining 40% awarded in deferred shares. Deferred shares are held in trust for two years before being released, subject to the recipient still being employed by the Group and include the right to receive an amount equal in value to the C Shares issued during the deferral period. The\n\nannual maximum for the Chief Executive is 180% of salary and 150% for the other Executive Director(s):\n\n- - 80% of the award is based on Group performance\n- - 20% of the award is based on individual performance\n\nThe Committee reviewed the 2020 outturn against the performance measures.",

This approach means that each business focuses on the most meaningful customer metrics (see page 17). The customer metrics for each business are below:\n\nCivil Aerospace - OE delivery to purchase order, TotalCare engine availability, CorporateCare engine availability, Trent 1000 aircraft on ground (AOG).\n\nPower Systems - OE delivery to purchase order, spares delivery to purchase order, claims per unit, time to solve.\n\nDefence - OE delivery to purchase order, spares delivery to purchase order, engine availability, submarines composite delivery. The specific business targets are commercially sensitive.\n\nEmployee engagement - measured through our annual Gallup engagement survey. 72% of employees completed the survey and we achieved a Group score of 3.68, which showed a strong year-onyear improvement from 3.53.\n\n## Individual performance\n\nSubject to achievement of a minimum profit threshold, the Executive Directors have 20% of their bonus based on achievement of their personal objectives. Personal performance objectives are set at the beginning of the year and are aligned with the Group's internal strategic priorities.\n\nFor Executive Directors, these have included:\n\n- - Deliver Group revenue, profit and cash in line with budget with specific focus on at least \u00a31bn of free cash flow\n- - Strengthen the balance sheet with a view to regaining a Grade A credit rating\n- - Deliver Group restructuring measured by headcount reductions and run-rate cost savings of at least \u00a3400m by the end of 2020\n- - Accelerate progress on diversity and HSE against agreed plans and objectives\n- - Rebuild trust and confidence with Civil Aerospace customers\n\nThe Committee recognised that the impact of COVID-19 had rendered the majority of personal objectives set at the beginning of 2020 obsolete. In any case, as the minimum Group profit threshold had not been met, no personal element of bonus was payable.\n\nThe Committee noted the significant efforts made by the management team in addressing the severe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically initiating the largest restructure in our recent history, consolidating our global manufacturing footprint, delivering significant cost reduction measures and securing additional liquidity.\n\nThe Committee noted that in respect of HSE, despite the challenges faced in 2020, there was a continued focus on the healthy, safety and wellbeing of employees with a range of support measures being put in place for employees. There was a significant reduction in reportable injuries and the wellbeing target for all sites becoming 'LiveWell' accredited by 2020 was exceeded.\n\nOn diversity & inclusion, the 2020 target of women accounting for at least 17% of the global workforce was delivered by the end of 2020. In addition, there was a marked improvement in the attraction of diverse talent; for ELG hires in 2020, 50% were female and women now represent 30% of the Executive Team, Company Secretary and their direct reports.",

A cash allowance may be payable in lieu of pension contributions. For incumbent directors, the maximum employer contribution to a defined contribution plan (or to be taken as a cash allowance) for 2020 was 23% of salary for the Chief Executive and 21% of salary for the Chief Financial Officer.\n\nFrom 1 January 2021, all Executive Directors will be offered an employer contribution of 12% of salary into the defined contribution pension plan (or cash allowance of equivalent value). This aligns to the average rate for the UK workforce. This reflects the reduction in the wider workforce UK rate to 12%, with the closure of the legacy defined benefit plan.\n\n## LTIP awards made in March 2020\n\nThe performance targets for awards made in March 2020 are shown below.

For the Chief Executive this requirement is 250% of salary and for other Executive Directors this requirement is 200% of salary. The current shareholdings, as a percentage of salary, for Warren East and Stephen Daintith are 170% and 153% respectively.*\n\nIn addition Executive Directors are required to retain the lower of their shareholding requirement and their actual shareholding (based on shares vesting following the approval of the remuneration policy at the 2020 AGM) at the date of leaving for one year after leaving and 50% of this level for a second year. During 2021, the Committee will be formalising the structures in place to allow it to monitor and enforce postemployment shareholding requirements.\n\n- *  The percentage of the requirement was calculated by reference to the average share price, over the three months to 31 December 2020 and salary as at the date of the last grant on 9 March 2020. LTIP awards subject to the two-year holding period following the performance period are included in this calculation. LTIP awards that have not been subject to the performance adjustment and ShareSave options are not included in this calculation.",

This is the third year that we have published our CEO pay ratio and we have continued to use method A, as we believe that this is the most accurate and robust methodology. We have used the full time equivalent total remuneration of all UK employees at 31 December 2020.\n\n25th\n\n75th\n\n|   Year | Method   | percentile   | Median   | percentile   |\n|--------|----------|--------------|----------|--------------|\n|   2020 | Option A | 26:1         | 22:1     | 19:1         |\n|   2019 | Option A | 66:1         | 56:1     | 48:1         |\n|   2018 | Option A | 92:1         | 77.1     | 66:1         |\n\nFor 2020, the salary and total remuneration for the three employees identified at the 25th, median and 75th percentiles are as follows:\n\n25th\n\n75th\n\n| Year               | percentile   | Median   | percentile   |\n|--------------------|--------------|----------|--------------|\n| Salary             | \u00a337.0k       | \u00a344.4k   | \u00a354.0k       |\n| Total Remuneration | \u00a342.7k       | \u00a350.1k   | \u00a359.4k       |\n\nThe pay ratio has reduced again this year as a result of the 2020 bonus not meeting the threshold for payment and the 2018 LTIP plan not vesting.\n\nThe Chief Executive has a larger proportion of his total pay based on variable elements linked to performance than other UK employees. As outlined on page 90, the Committee has considered the wider workforce context in terms of alignment of total reward or the Executive Directors, with the pension changes being one such example from 2020.",

John Rishton retired on 2 July 2015 and Warren East was appointed as Chief Executive on 3 July 2015.\n- 2 John Rishton received a special grant of shares on joining the Company on 1 March 2011 to mirror the shares he forfeited on resigning from his previous employer. The share price had increased from 483.50p at the time this grant was made to 870p at the end of 2014. These are the main reasons why John Rishton's remuneration in 2012 and 2013 exceeded that of his predecessor.\n- 3 The remuneration for Sir John Rose does not include any pension accrual or contribution as he received his pension from 1 February 2008.\n\n## TSR performance\n\nThe Company's TSR performance over the previous ten years compared to a broad equity market index is shown in the graph below. The FTSE 100 has been chosen as the comparator because it contains a broad range of other UK-listed companies. The graph shows the growth in value of a hypothetical \u00a3100 holding in the Company's ordinary shares over ten years, relative to the FTSE 100 index.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nYear\n\n- *  Prior years have been adjusted for the rights issue.\n\n## Gender pay reporting\n\nThe Company is committed to creating a diverse and inclusive place to work where our people can be themselves and be at their best.

The review of the other Non-Executive Directors' base fees is reserved to the Executive Directors, who consider recommendations from the Chairman. No individual may be involved in setting his or her own fee. The Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors are not eligible to participate in any of the Group's share schemes, incentive arrangements or pension schemes. A facility is in place which enables Non-Executive Directors (who reside in a permitted dealing territory) to use some or all of their fees, after the appropriate statutory deductions, to make market purchases of shares in the Company on a monthly basis. Sir Ian Davis and Lee Hsien Yang use this facility.",

Under that law, the Directors have prepared the Group Financial Statements in accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. Additionally, the Financial Conduct Authority's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules require the directors to prepare the group financial statements in accordance with international financial reporting standards adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union and the parent company Financial Statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework, and applicable law).\n\nUnder company law, the Directors must not approve the Financial Statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and parent company and of the profit or loss of the Group and parent company for that period.\n\nI n preparing the Financial Statements, the Directors are required to:\n\n- - select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;\n- - state whether, for the group and company, international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, for the group, international financial reporting standards adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as i t  applies in the European Union, have been followed for the Group Financial Statements and United Kingdom Accounting Standards comprising FRS 101, have been followed for the Company Financial Statements, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the Financial Statements;\n- - make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and\n- - prepare the Financial Statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and parent company will continue in business.\n\nThe Directors are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and parent company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.\n\nThe Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group and parent company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and parent company. This enables them to ensure that the Financial Statements and the Directors' Remuneration Report comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group's Consolidated Financial Statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.\n\nThe Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the parent company's website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.\n\n## Directors' confirmations\n\nThe Directors consider that the Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group and parent company's position and performance, business model and strategy.\n\nEach of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed in the Directors' Report, confirm that to the best of his or her knowledge:\n\n- - the Group Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and loss of the Group;\n- - the parent company Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework, and applicable law), give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and result of the Company;\n- - the Strategic Report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Group and parent company, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces; and\n- - there is no relevant audit information of which the Company's auditor is unaware. The Director has taken all steps that he or she ought to have taken as a director in order to make himself or herself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Company's auditor is aware of that information.\n\nBy order of the Board Pamela Coles Company Secretary 11 March 2021",

This has been recognised within operating loss.\n- 2 Where the cost of meeting residual value guarantees is less than that previously estimated, as costs have been mitigated or liabilities waived by the lessor, the lease liability has been remeasured. Where the value of this remeasurement exceeds the value of the right-of use asset, the reduction in the lease liability is credited to cost of sales.\n- 3 Relates to penalties paid on agreements with investigating bodies.\n- 4 Includes \u00a35m adjustment of cash consideration on prior period disposal paid during the year. Further detail is provided in note 28.\n- 5 Repayment of loans includes repayment of the \u00a32.5bn revolving credit facility. Proceeds from increase in loans includes the drawdown of \u00a32.5bn revolving credit facility, proceeds of \u00a32.0bn from new unsecured loan notes and \u00a30.3bn cash received from the Covid Corporate Financing Facility (CCFF). Further detail is provided in note 18.\n- 6 The impact of COVID-19 on the aerospace industry resulted in a deterioration in net US Dollar receipts across the Group leading to a net US Dollar outflow in the period.

Net debt therefore includes the fair value of derivatives included in fair value hedges (2020 \u00a3293m, 2019 \u00a3229m) and the element of fair value relating to exchange differences on the underlying principal of derivatives in cash flow hedges (2020 \u00a3(42)m and 2019 \u00a3nil). During the year, the Group reclassified \u00a314m relating to the fair value of derivatives for which hedge accounting was not applied as these relate to the future payments of interest only.\n- 2 In 2019, the Group reclassified \u00a379m as borrowings previously included in other financial liabilities. These borrowings mature during periods up to 2029.\n- 3 Includes Trent 1000 insurance receipts of \u00a3173m.",

In Rolls-Royce Holdings plc's own Financial Statements, C Shares are issued from the merger reserve. This reserve was created by a scheme of arrangement in 2011. As this reserve is eliminated on consolidation, in the consolidated financial statements, the C Shares are shown as being issued from the capital redemption reserve.\n\nCash flow hedging reserve - Cumulative gains and losses on hedging instruments deemed effective in cash flow hedges.\n\nMerger reserve - The premium on issuing shares to acquire a business where merger relief in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 applies. Translation reserve - Gains and losses arising on retranslating the net assets of overseas operations into sterling.\n\nAccumulated losses - All other net gains and losses and transactions with owners not recognised elsewhere and ordinary shares held for the purpose of share-based payment plans.\n\nNon-controlling interests - The share of net assets or liabilities of subsidiaries held by third parties.\n\nAttributable to ordinary shareholders\n\n|                                                                 | Notes   | Share  capital \u00a3m   | Share  premium \u00a3m   | Capital redemption reserve \u00a3m   | Cash flow  hedging  reserve  \u00a3m   | Merger  reserve \u00a3m   | Translation  reserve \u00a3m   | Accum-  ulated  losses  \u00a3m   | 1 Total \u00a3m      | Non- controlling  interests  (NCI) \u00a3m   | Total equity \u00a3m   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------|\n| At 1 January 2020                                               |         | 386                 | 319                 | 159                             | (96)                              | 650                  | 397                       |                              | (5,191) (3,376) | 22                                      | (3,354)           |\n| Loss for the year                                               |         | -

        "page_content": "## 1  Accounting policies\n\n## The Company and the Group\n\nRolls-Royce Holdings plc (the 'Company') is a public company limited by shares incorporated under the Companies Act 2006 and domiciled in England in the United Kingdom. The Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2020 consist of the audited consolidation of the Financial Statements of the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group) together with the Group's interest in jointly controlled and associated entities.\n\n## Basis of preparation and statement of compliance\n\nThe Company has elected to prepare its individual Company Financial Statements under FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework . They are set out on pages 177 to 182 with the associated accounting policies from page 179.\n\nIn accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and European Union (EU) regulations, the Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and international financial reporting standards adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the EU.\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on a going concern basis as described on page 52. The historical cost basis has been used except where IFRS require the revaluation of financial instruments to fair value and certain other assets and liabilities on an alternative basis, most significantly post-retirement scheme obligations are valued on the basis required by IAS 19 Employee Benefits .\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in sterling which is the Company's functional currency.\n\nThe preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make judgements and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual future outcomes could differ from those estimates.\n\n## Going concern\n\nGiven the economic uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Directors have undertaken a comprehensive going concern review over an eighteen-month period to September 2022, considering the forecast cash flows of the Group and the liquidity headroom available over that eighteen-month period. The Group has modelled two scenarios in its assessment of going concern which have been considered by the Directors, along with a likelihood assessment of these scenarios, being:\n\n- - base case, which reflects the Directors current expectations of future trading; and\n- - severe but plausible downside scenario, which envisages a 'stress' or 'downside' situation.\n\nFurther details are given in the Going Concern Statement on pages 52 to 54. After due consideration the Directors consider that the Group has sufficient liquidity headroom to continue in operational existence for a period of at least eighteen months from the date of this report and there are no material uncertainties that may cast doubt on the Company's going concern status, accordingly they are satisfied that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the Consolidated and Company Financial Statements.\n\n## Climate change\n\nIn preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements management has considered the impact of climate change, particularly in the context of the disclosures included in the Strategic Report this year and the stated net zero targets. These considerations did not have a material impact on the financial reporting judgements and estimates, consistent with the assessment that climate change is not expected to have a significant impact on the Group's going concern assessment to September 2022 nor the viability of the Group over the next five years. The following specific points were considered:\n\n- - The Group continues to invest in new technologies including hybrid electric solutions in Power Systems, continued development of the more efficient UltraFan aero engine, testing of sustainable aviation fuels, SMRs and hybrid and fully electric propulsion.\n- - The Group continues to invest in onsite renewable energy generation solutions for our facilities and investment is included in our five year forecasts to enable us to meet our 2030 target for zero greenhouse gas emissions (scope 1 and 2) from our operations and facilities.\n- - Management has considered the impact of climate change on a number of key estimates within the financial statements, including:\n- \u00b7 the estimates of future cash flows used in impairment assessments of the carrying value of non-current assets (such as programme intangible assets and goodwill) (see note 9);\n- \u00b7 the estimates of future profitability used in our assessment of the recoverability of deferred tax assets in the UK (see note 5); and\n- \u00b7 the long-term contract accounting assumptions, such as the level of EFHs assumed, which consider our future expectations of consumer and airline customer behaviour (see note 16).\n\n## Presentation of underlying results\n\nThe Group measures financial performance on an underlying basis and discloses this information as an alternative performance measure. This is consistent with the way that financial performance is measured by management and reported to the Board in accordance with IFRS 8 Operating Segments . The Group believes this is the most appropriate basis to measure the in-year performance as underlying results reflect the substance of trading activity, including the impact of the Group's foreign exchange forward contracts, which economically hedge net foreign currency cash flows at predetermined exchange rates. In addition, underlying results exclude the accounting impact of business acquisitions and disposals, impairment charges where the reasons are outside of normal operating activities, exceptional items, and other items which are market driven and outside of the control of management. Further details are given in note 2.\n\n## Revisions to IFRS applicable in 2020\n\nNo new standards and interpretations issued by the IASB had a significant impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.",

The subsequent application of these policies requires estimates and the actual outcome may differ from that calculated. The key judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that were assessed as having a significant risk of causing material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are summarised below.

        "page_content": "## 1  Accounting policies continued\n\n## Significant accounting policies\n\nThe Group's significant accounting policies are set out below. These accounting policies have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Basis of consolidation\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the Company Financial Statements and its subsidiary undertakings together with the Group's share of the results in joint arrangements and associates made up to 31 December.\n\nA subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Company. Control exists when the Company has power over an entity, exposure to variable returns from its involvement with an entity and the ability to use its power over an entity so as to affect the Company's returns. Subsidiaries are consolidated in accordance with IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements .\n\nA joint arrangement is an entity in which the Group holds a long-term interest and which is jointly controlled by the Group and one or more other investors under a contractual arrangement. Joint arrangements may be either joint ventures or joint operations. Joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and joint operations are accounted for using proportionate accounting.\n\nAn associate is an entity that is neither a subsidiary nor a joint arrangement, in which the Group holds a long-term interest and where the Group has a significant influence. The results of associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.\n\nAll intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation. Adjustments are made to eliminate the profit or loss arising on transactions with joint arrangements and associates to the extent of the Group's interest in the entity. Transactions with non-controlling interests are recorded directly in equity.\n\nAny subsidiary undertaking, joint arrangement or associate sold or acquired during the year are included up to, or from, the date of change of control. Details of transactions in the year are set out in note 28.\n\n## Revenue recognition and contract assets and liabilities\n\nRevenue recognised comprises sales to the Group's customers after discounts and amounts payable to customers. Revenue excludes value added taxes. The transaction price of a contract is typically clearly stated within the contract, although the absolute amount may be dependent on escalation indices and long-term contracts require the key estimates highlighted below. Refund liabilities where sales are made with a right of return are not typical in the Group's contracts. Where they do exist, and consideration has been received, a portion based on an assessment of the expected refund liability is recognised within other payables. The Group has elected to use the practical expedient not to adjust revenue for the effect of financing components where the expectation is that the period between the transfer of goods and services to customers and the receipt of payment is less than a year.\n\nSales of standard OE, spare parts and time and material overhaul services are generally recognised on transfer of control to the customer. This is generally on delivery to the customer, unless the specific contractual terms indicate a different point. The Directors consider whether there is a need to constrain the amount of revenue to be recognised on delivery based on the contractual position and any relevant facts, however, this is not typically required.\n\nSales of OE and services that are specifically designed for the contract (most significantly in the Defence business) are recognised by reference to the progress towards completion of the performance obligation, using the cost method described in the key judgements, provided the outcome of contracts can be assessed with reasonable certainty.\n\nThe Group generates a significant portion of its revenue on aftermarket arrangements arising from the installed OE fleet. As a consequence, in particular in the Civil Aerospace large engine business, the Group will often agree contractual prices for OE deliveries that take into account the anticipated aftermarket arrangements. Sometimes this may result in losses being incurred on OE. As described in the key judgements, these contracts are not combined. The consideration in the OE contract is therefore allocated to OE performance obligations and the consideration in the aftermarket contract to aftermarket performance obligations.\n\nKey areas of the accounting policy are:\n\n- - Future variable revenue from long-term contracts is constrained to take account of the risk of non-recovery of resulting contract balances from reduced utilisation e.g. engine flying hours, based on historical forecasting experience and the risk of aircraft being parked by the customer.\n- - A significant amount of revenue and cost related to long-term contract accounting is denominated in currencies other than that of the relevant Group undertaking, most significantly US dollar transactions in sterling and euro denominated undertakings. These are translated at estimated long-term exchange rates.\n- - The assessment of stage of completion is generally measured for each contract. However, in certain cases, such as for CorporateCare agreements where there are many contracts covering aftermarket services each for a small number of engines, the Group accounts for a portfolio of contracts together as the effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements would not differ materially from applying the standard to the individual contracts in the portfolio. When accounting for a portfolio of long-term service arrangements the Group uses estimates and assumptions that reflect the size and composition of the portfolio.\n- - A contract asset/liability is recognised where payment is received in arrears/advance of the revenue recognised in meeting performance obligations.\n- - Where material, wastage costs (see key judgements below) are recorded as an exceptional non-underlying expense.\n\nIf the expected costs to fulfil a contract exceed the expected revenue, a contract loss provision is recognised for the excess costs.\n\nThe Group pays participation fees to airframe manufacturers, its customers for OE, on certain programmes. Amounts paid are initially treated as contract assets and subsequently charged as a reduction to the OE revenue when the engines are transferred to the customer.",

        "page_content": "## 1  Accounting policies continued\n\nThe Group has elected to use the practical expedient to expense as incurred any incremental costs of obtaining or fulfilling a contract if the amortisation period of an asset created would have been one year or less. Where costs to obtain a contract are recognised in the balance sheet, they are amortised over the performance of the related contract (average of three years).\n\n## Key judgement - Whether Civil Aerospace OE and aftermarket contracts should be combined\n\nIn the Civil Aerospace business, OE contracts for the sale of engines to be installed on new aircraft are with the airframers, while the contracts to provide spare engines and aftermarket goods and services are with the aircraft operators, although there may be interdependencies between them. IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers includes guidance on the combination of contracts, in particular that contracts with unrelated parties should not be combined. Notwithstanding the interdependencies, the Directors consider that the engine contract should be considered separately from the aftermarket contract. In making this judgement, they also took account of industry practice.\n\n## Key judgement - How performance on long-term aftermarket contracts should be measured\n\nThe Group generates a significant proportion of its revenue from aftermarket arrangements. These aftermarket contracts, such as TotalCare and CorporateCare agreements in the Civil Aerospace business, cover a range of services and generally have contractual terms covering more than one year. Under these contracts, the Group's primary obligation is to maintain customers' engines in an operational condition and this is achieved by undertaking various activities, such as maintenance, repair and overhaul, and engine monitoring over the period of the contract. Revenue on these contracts is recognised over the period of the contract and the basis for measuring progress is a matter of judgement. The Directors consider that the stage of completion of the contract is best measured by using the actual costs incurred to date compared to the estimated costs to complete the performance obligations, as this reflects the extent of completion of the activities performed.\n\n## Key judgement - Whether any costs should be treated as wastage\n\nIn rare circumstances, the Group may incur costs of wasted material, labour or other resources to fulfil a contract where the level of cost was not reflected in the contract price. The identification of such costs is a matter of judgement and would only be expected to arise where there has been a series of abnormal events which give rise to a significant level of cost of a nature that the Group would not expect to incur and hence is not reflected in the contract price. Examples include technical issues that: require resolution to meet regulatory requirements; have a wide-ranging impact across a product type; and cause significant operational disruption to customers. Similarly, in these rare circumstances, significant disruption costs to support customers resulting from the actual performance of a delivered good or service may be treated as a wastage cost. Provision is made for any costs identified as wastage when the obligation to incur them arises - see note 22.\n\n## Key judgement - Whether sales of spare engines to joint ventures are at fair value\n\nThe Civil Aerospace business maintains a pool of spare engines to support its customers. Some of these engines are sold to, and held by, joint venture companies. The assessment of whether the sales price reflects fair value is a key judgement. The Group considers that based upon the terms and conditions of the sales, and by comparison to the sales price of spare engines to other third parties, the sales made to joint ventures reflect the fair value of the goods sold.\n\n## Key estimate - Estimates of future revenue and costs on long-term contractual arrangements\n\nThe Group has long-term contracts that fall into different accounting periods and which can extend over significant periods (generally up to 25 years), the most significant of these are long-term service arrangements (LTSAs) in the Civil Aerospace business. The estimated revenue and costs are inherently imprecise and significant estimates are required to assess: engine flying hours (EFHs), time-on-wing and other operating parameters; the pattern of future maintenance activity and the costs to be incurred; lifecycle cost improvements over the term of the contracts; and escalation of revenue and costs. The estimates take account of the inherent uncertainties, constraining the expected level of revenue as appropriate. In addition, many of the revenues and costs are denominated in currencies other than that of the relevant Group undertaking. These are translated at an estimated long-term exchange rate, based on historical trends and economic forecasts. During the year, changes to the estimate resulted in catch-up adjustments to revenue of \u00a31.0bn.\n\n## Key estimate - Determination of the time period and profile over which the aerospace industry will recover\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant uncertainty across the aerospace industry. Airline customers have grounded a significant number of their aircraft in response to COVID-19 which has resulted in a reduction to EFHs in Civil Aerospace during 2020. Further details have been included in the going concern disclosure on page 52. Estimates of future LTSA revenue within Civil Aerospace are based upon future EFH forecasts, influenced by assumptions over the recovery of the aerospace industry.\n\nBased upon the stage of completion of all widebody LTSA contracts within Civil Aerospace as at 31 December 2020, the following changes in estimates would result in catch-up adjustments being recognised in the period in which the estimates change (at underlying rates):\n\n- - A further reduction in forecast EFHs of 15% over the remaining term of the contracts would decrease LTSA income and to a lesser extent costs, resulting in a catch-up adjustment of \u00a3100m - \u00a3130m. An estimated 90% of this would be expected to be a reduction in revenue with the remainder relating to onerous contracts which would be an increase in cost of sales.\n- - A 2% increase or decrease in revenue over the life of the contracts would lead to a catch-up adjustment of \u00a3200m.\n- - A 5% increase or decrease in shop visit costs over the life of the contracts would lead to a catch-up adjustment of \u00a3150m.",

        "page_content": "## 1  Accounting policies continued\n\n## Risk and revenue sharing arrangements (RRSAs)\n\nCash entry fees received are initially deferred on the balance sheet within trade payables and other liabilities. They are then recognised as a reduction in cost of sales incurred. Individual programme amounts are allocated pro rata to the estimated number of units to be produced. Amortisation commences as each unit is delivered and then charged on a 15-year straight-line basis.\n\nThe payments to suppliers of their shares of the programme cash flows for their production components are charged to cost of sales when OE sales are recognised or as LTSA costs are incurred.\n\nThe Group also has arrangements with third parties who invest in a programme and receive a return based on its performance, but do not undertake development work or supply parts. Such arrangements (financial RRSAs) are financial instruments as defined by IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentatio n and are accounted for using the amortised cost method.\n\n## Key judgement - Determination of the nature of entry fees received\n\nRRSAs with key suppliers (workshare partners) are a feature of the Civil Aerospace business. Under these contractual arrangements, the key commercial objectives are that: (i) during the development phase the workshare partner shares in the risks of developing an engine by performing its own development work, providing development parts and paying a non-refundable cash entry fee; and (ii) during the production phase it supplies components in return for a share of the programme cash flows as a 'life of type' supplier (i.e. as long as the engine remains in service).\n\nThe non-refundable cash entry fee is judged by the Group to be a contribution towards the development expenditure incurred. These receipts are deferred on the balance sheet and recognised against the cost of sales over the estimated number of units to be delivered on a similar basis to the amortisation of development costs - see 121.\n\n## Royalty payments\n\nWhere a government or similar body has previously acquired an interest in the intellectual property of a programme, royalty payments are matched to the related sales.\n\n## Government grants\n\nGovernment grants received are varied in nature and are recognised in the income statement so as to match them with the related expenses that they are intended to compensate. Where grants are received in advance of the related expenses, they are initially recognised as liabilities within trade payables and other liabilities and released to match the related expenditure. Non-monetary grants are recognised at fair value.\n\n## Interest\n\nInterest receivable/payable is credited/charged to the income statement using the effective interest method. Where borrowing costs are attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset, such costs are capitalised as part of the specific asset.\n\n## Taxation\n\nThe tax charge/credit on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax:\n\n- - Current tax is the expected tax payable for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.\n- - Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for tax purposes and is calculated using the enacted or substantively enacted rates that are expected to apply when the asset or liability is settled. In the UK, the deferred tax liability on the pension scheme surplus is recognised consistently with the basis for recognising the surplus i.e. at the rate applicable to refunds from a trust.\n\nTax is charged or credited to the income statement or OCI as appropriate, except when it relates to items credited or charged directly to equity in which case the tax is also dealt with in equity.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and joint arrangements, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax is not recognised on taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill or for temporary differences arising from the initial recognition of assets and liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit.\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the assets can be utilised. Further details on the Group's tax position can be found on page 206.\n\n## Key estimate - Estimates necessary to assess whether it is probable that sufficient suitable taxable profits will arise in the UK to utilise the deferred tax assets\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognised to the extent it is probable that future taxable profits will be available, against which the deductible temporary difference can be utilised, based on management's assumptions relating to the quantum of future taxable profits. Future taxable profits require significant estimates to be made, including the pattern of future maintenance activity and the costs to be incurred; lifecycle cost improvements over the term of the contracts; and escalation of revenue and costs. The estimates take account of the inherent uncertainties, constraining the expected level of profit as appropriate. Changes in these estimates will affect future profits and therefore the recoverability of the deferred tax assets. Further details can be found in note 5.\n\nA 5% change in margin in the main Civil Aerospace widebody programmes or a 5% change in the number of shop visits (driven by EFHs which are influenced by a number of factors including climate change) over the remaining life of the programmes, would result in an increase/decrease in the deferred tax asset by around \u00a3100m.",

        "page_content": "## 1  Accounting policies continued\n\n## Foreign currency translation\n\nTransactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting Group undertaking are translated into the functional currency at the average monthly exchange rate when the transaction occurs. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the relevant functional currency at the rate prevailing at the year end. Exchange differences arising on foreign exchange transactions and the retranslation of monetary assets and liabilities into functional currencies at the rate prevailing at the year end are included in profit/(loss) before taxation.\n\nThe trading results of Group undertakings are translated into sterling at the average exchange rates for the year. The assets and liabilities of overseas undertakings, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated at the exchange rates prevailing at the year end. Exchange adjustments arising from the retranslation of the opening net assets, and from the translation of the profits or losses at average rates, are recognised in OCI.\n\n## Financial instruments - Classification and measurement\n\nFinancial assets primarily include trade receivables, cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, derivatives (foreign exchange, commodity and interest rate contracts), and unlisted investments.\n\n- - Trade receivables are classified either as held to collect and measured at amortised cost, or as held to collect and sell and measured at fair value, with movements in fair value recognised through other comprehensive income (FVOCI). The Group may sell trade receivables due from certain customers before the due date. Any trade receivables from such customers that are not sold at the reporting date are classified as 'held to collect and sell'.\n- - Cash and cash equivalents (consisting of balances with banks and other financial institutions, money-market funds, short-term deposits) and short-term investments are subject to low market risk. Cash balances, short-term deposits and short-term investments are measured at amortised cost. Money market funds are measured at fair value, with movements in fair value recognised in the income statement as a profit or loss (FVPL).\n- - Derivatives and unlisted investments are measured at FVPL.\n\nFinancial liabilities primarily consist of trade payables, borrowings, derivatives, financial RRSAs and C Shares.\n\n- - Derivatives are classified and measured at FVPL.\n- - All other financial liabilities are classified and measured at amortised cost.\n\n## Financial instruments - Impairment of financial assets and contract assets\n\nIFRS 9 Financial Instruments sets out the basis for the accounting of expected credit losses (ECLs) on financial assets and contract assets resulting from transactions within the scope of IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers . The Group has adopted the simplified approach to provide for ECLs, measuring the loss allowance at a probability weighted amount that considers reasonable and supportable information about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions of customers. These are incorporated in the simplified model adopted by using credit ratings which are publicly available, or through internal risk assessments derived using the customer's latest available financial information. The ECLs are updated at each reporting date to reflect changes in credit risk since initial recognition. ECLs are calculated for all financial assets in scope, regardless of whether or not they are overdue.\n\n## Financial instruments - Hedge accounting\n\nForward foreign exchange contracts and commodity swaps (derivative financial instruments) are held to manage the cash flow exposures of forecast transactions denominated in foreign currencies or in commodities respectively. Derivative financial instruments qualify for hedge accounting when: (i) there is a formal designation and documentation of the hedging relationship and the Group's risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge at the inception of the hedge; and (ii) the hedge is expected to be effective.\n\nIn general, the Group has chosen to not apply hedge accounting in respect of these exposures. Prior to its acquisition in 2017, ITP Aero adopted hedge accounting for its equivalent exposures. It has continued to do so, although the value of the derivatives is not significant relative to those held by the rest of the Group.\n\nThe Group economically hedges the fair value and cash flow exposures of its borrowings. Cross-currency interest rate swaps are held to manage the fair value or cash flow exposures of borrowings denominated in foreign currencies and are designated as fair value hedges or cash flow hedges as appropriate. Interest rate swaps are held to manage the interest rate exposures of fixed and floating rate borrowings and may be designated as fair value hedges or cash flow hedges as appropriate. If the swaps are not designated as fair value or cash flow hedges, the economic effect is included in the underlying results - see note 2.\n\nChanges in the fair values of derivatives that are designated as fair value hedges are recognised directly in the income statement. The fair value changes of effective cash flow hedge derivatives are recognised in OCI and subsequently recycled in the income statement in the same period or periods during which the hedged expected future cash flows affect profit or loss. Any ineffectiveness in the hedging relationship is included in the income statement.\n\nHedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. At that time, for cash flow hedges and, if the forecast transaction remains probable, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in OCI is retained until the forecast transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss is recycled to the income statement.",

        "page_content": "## 1  Accounting policies continued\n\n## Financial instruments - Replacement of benchmark interest rates\n\nFollowing the financial crisis, the reform and replacement of benchmark interest rates such as GBP LIBOR and other interbank offered rates (IBORs) has become a priority for global regulators. There is currently uncertainty around the timing and precise nature of these changes. The Group's risk exposure that is directly affected by the interest rate benchmark reform is its portfolio of long-term borrowings of \u00a34.1bn. These borrowings are hedged, using interest rate swaps and cross-currency interest rate swaps, for changes in fair value and cash flows attributable to the relevant benchmark interest rate. However, as part of the reforms noted above, the UK Financial Conduct Authority has decided to no longer compel panel banks to participate in the IBOR submission process after the end of 2021 and to cease oversight of these benchmark interest rates. Regulatory authorities and private sector working groups have been discussing alternative benchmark rates for IBOR. It is currently anticipated that IBOR rates will be replaced with a backward-looking risk-free rate based on actual transactions.\n\nManagement is continuing to monitor developments. When the future position is clearer, a transition project to assess and implement changes to systems, processes, risk and valuation models, as well as managing related tax and accounting implications will be initiated. The Group currently anticipates that the areas of greatest change will be amendments to the contractual terms of IBOR-referenced floating-rate debt and swaps, and updating hedge designations.\n\nDue to the uncertainty around these changes the Group elected to early adopt in 2019 the Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7 Interest Rate Benchmark Reform issued in September 2019. In accordance with the transition provisions, the amendments were adopted retrospectively to hedging relationships that existed at the start of 2019 or were designated thereafter. The amendments provide temporary relief from applying specific hedge accounting requirements to hedging relationships directly affected by IBOR reform.\n\nThe reliefs have the effect that IBOR reform should not generally cause hedge accounting to terminate. However, any hedge ineffectiveness should continue to be recorded in the income statement. Furthermore, the amendments set out triggers for when the reliefs will end, which include the uncertainty arising from interest rate benchmark reform no longer being present.\n\nIn summary, the reliefs provided by the amendments that apply to the Group are:\n\n- - In assessing whether the hedge is expected to be highly effective on a forward-looking basis, the Group has assumed that the relevant IBOR interest rate on which the cash flows of the interest rate swap that hedges fixed-rate borrowings is not altered by IBOR reform.\n- - The Group has assessed whether the hedged IBOR risk component is a separately identifiable risk only when it first designates a borrowing as included in a hedging relationship and not on an ongoing basis. Any hedge ineffectiveness relating to fair value hedges is recognised immediately in the income statement.\n\n## Business combinations and goodwill\n\nGoodwill recognised represents the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration over the fair value to the Group of the net of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. On transition to IFRS on 1 January 2004, business combinations were not retrospectively adjusted to comply with IFRS and goodwill was recognised based on the carrying value under the previous accounting policies. Goodwill in respect of the acquisition of a subsidiary is recognised as an intangible asset. Goodwill arising on the acquisition of joint arrangements and associates is included in the carrying value of the investment.\n\n## Key judgement - Identification and valuation of acquired assets and liabilities\n\nIn allocating the purchase price to the acquired assets and liabilities, such as technology, patents and licences, customer relationships, trademarks and in-process development, judgement is required. The allocations are based on the Group's industry experience and the advice of third party valuers, if required. During the year the Group acquired intangible assets arising on acquisition of Kinolt Group S.A. of \u00a361m including \u00a337m of customer relationships and \u00a322m of technology intangible assets. See note 28 for details.\n\n## Customer relationships\n\nThe fair value of customer relationships recognised as a result of a business combination relate to the acquired company's established relationships with its existing customers that result in repeat purchases and customer loyalty. Amortisation is charged on a straight-line basis over its useful economic life, up to a maximum of 15 years.\n\n## Certification costs\n\nCosts incurred in respect of meeting regulatory certification requirements for new Civil Aerospace aero-engine/aircraft combinations including payments made to airframe manufacturers for this are recognised as intangible assets to the extent that they can be recovered out of future sales. They are charged to the income statement over the programme life. Individual programme assets are allocated pro rata to the estimated number of units to be produced. Amortisation commences as each unit is delivered and then charged on a 15-year straight-line basis.",

All research phase expenditure is charged to the income statement. Development expenditure is recognised as an internally generated intangible asset (programme asset) only if it meets strict criteria, relating in particular to technical feasibility and generation of future economic benefits.\n\nMore specifically, development costs are capitalised from the point at which the following conditions have been met:\n\n- - the technical feasibility of completing the programme and the intention and ability (availability of technical, financial and other resources) to complete the programme asset and use or sell it;\n- - the probability that future economic benefits will flow from the programme asset; and\n- - the ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the programme asset during its development.\n\nCapitalisation continues until the point at which the programme asset meets its originally contracted technical specification (defined internally as the point at which the asset is capable of operating in the manner intended by management).\n\nSubsequent expenditure is capitalised where it enhances the functionality of the programme asset and demonstrably generates an enhanced economic benefit to the Group.

Determining when capitalisation should commence and cease is a critical judgement, as is the determination of when subsequent expenditure on the programme assets should be capitalised. \u00a3232m of development expenditure was capitalised during the year.\n\nWithin the Group, there is an established Product Introduction and Lifecycle Management process (PILM) in place. Within this process, the technical feasibility, the commercial viability and financial assessment of the programme is assessed at certain milestones. When these are met, development expenditure is capitalised. Prior to this, expenditure is expensed as incurred.\n\nSubsequent expenditure after entry into service which enhances the performance of the engine and the economic benefits to the Group is capitalised. This expenditure is referred to as enhanced performance and is governed by the PILM process referred to above. All other development costs are expensed as incurred.\n\n## Key judgement - Determination of the basis for amortising capitalised development costs\n\nThe economic benefits of the development costs are primarily those cash inflows arising from long-term service agreements, which are expected to be relatively consistent for each engine within a programme. Amortisation of development costs is recognised on a straightline basis over the estimated period of operation of the engine by its initial operator.\n\n## Software\n\nSoftware that is not specific to an item of property, plant and equipment is classified as an intangible asset, recognised at its acquisition cost and amortised on a straight-line basis over its useful economic life, up to a maximum of five years. The cost of internally developed software includes direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads.\n\n## Other intangible assets\n\nThese principally include intangible assets arising on acquisition of businesses, such as technology, patents and licences which are amortised on a straight-line basis over a maximum of 15 years and trademarks which are not amortised.\n\n## Property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at acquisition cost less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment in value. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads and, where appropriate, interest.\n\nDepreciation is provided on a straight-line basis to write off the cost, less the estimated residual value, of property, plant and equipment over their estimated useful lives. No depreciation is recorded on assets in the course of construction. Estimated useful lives are reassessed annually and are as follows:\n\n- - Land and buildings, as advised by the Group's professional advisers:\n- \u00b7 freehold buildings - five to 50 years (average 24 years); and\n- \u00b7 no depreciation is provided on freehold land.\n- - Plant and equipment - four to 25 years (average 11 years).\n- -  Aircraft and engines - five to 20 years (average 16 years).",

        "page_content": "## 1  Accounting policies continued\n\n## Leases\n\nAssets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis.\n\nLease liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments:\n\n- - fixed payments less any lease incentive receivable;\n- - variable lease payments that are based on an index or a rate;\n- - amounts expected to be payable by the Group under residual value guarantees;\n- - the exercise price of a purchase option if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise that option; and\n- - payments of penalties for termination of the lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising that option.\n\nWhere leases commenced after the initial transition date, the lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate cannot be determined, the Group's incremental borrowing rate is used, being the rate that the Group would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value in a similar economic environment with similar terms and conditions. Where appropriate, lease liabilities are revalued at each reporting date using the spot exchange rate.\n\nRight-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the following:\n\n- - the amount of the initial measurement of lease liability or a revaluation of the liability;\n- - any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received;\n- - any initial direct costs; and\n- - restoration costs.\n\nEach right-of-use asset is depreciated over the shorter of its useful economic life and the lease term on a straight-line basis unless the lease is expected to transfer ownership of the underlying asset to the Group, in which case the asset is depreciated to the end of the useful life of the asset.\n\nShort-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Payments associated with short-term leases and low-value leases are recognised on a straight-line basis as an expense in the income statement.\n\n## Key judgement - Determination of lease term\n\nIn determining the lease term, the Group considers all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise an extension option, or not exercise a termination option. Extension options (or periods after termination) are only included in the lease term if the lease is reasonably certain to be extended (or not terminated). Certain land and building leases have renewal options with renewal dates for the most significant property leases evenly spread between 2022-2028 and in 2041. The Group reviews its judgements on lease terms annually, including the operational significance of the site, especially where utilised for manufacturing activities.\n\n## Key estimates - Estimates of the payments required to meet residual value guarantees at the end of engine leases\n\nEngine leases in the Civil Aerospace segment often include clauses that require the engines to be returned to the lessor with specific levels of useable life remaining or cash payments to the lessor. The costs of meeting these requirements are included in the lease payments. The amounts payable are calculated based upon an estimate of the utilisation of the engines over the lease term, whether the engine is restored to the required condition by performing an overhaul at our own cost or through the payments of amounts specified in the contract and any new contractual arrangements arising when the current lease contracts end. Amounts due can vary depending on the level of utilisation of the engines, overhaul activity prior to the end of the contract, and decisions taken on whether ongoing access to the assets is required at the end of the lease term. During the year, adjustments to return conditions at the end of leases resulted in a credit of \u00a3102m to the income statement. The lease liability at 31 December 2020 included \u00a3347m relating to the cost of meeting these residual value guarantees in the Civil Aerospace business. Up to \u00a319m is payable in the next 12 months, \u00a3133m is due over the following four years and the remaining balance after five years.\n\n## Impairment of non-current assets\n\nImpairment of non-current assets is considered in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets . Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent of other assets, impairment is considered for the cash-generating unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs. Goodwill, indefinite life intangible assets and intangible assets not yet available for use are tested for impairment annually. Other intangible assets (including programme-related intangible assets), property, plant and equipment and investments are assessed for any indications of impairment annually. If any indication of impairment is identified, an impairment test is performed to estimate the recoverable amount.\n\nIf the recoverable amount of an asset (or CGU) is estimated to be below the carrying value, the carrying value is reduced to the recoverable amount and the impairment loss is recognised as an expense. The recoverable amount is the higher of value in use or fair value less costs to dispose, if this is readily available. The value in use is the present value of future cash flows using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects the time value of money and the risk specific to the asset.",

        "page_content": "## 1  Accounting policies continued\n\n## Key judgement - Determination of CGUs for assessing impairment of goodwill\n\nThe Group conducts impairment reviews at the CGU level. As permitted by IAS 36 Impairment of Assets , impairment reviews for goodwill are performed at the groups of CGUs level, representing the lowest level at which the Group monitors goodwill for internal management purposes and no higher than the Group's operating segments. The main CGUs for which goodwill impairment reviews have been performed are Rolls-Royce Deutschland Ltd & Co KG, Kinolt Group S.A. and at an aggregated Rolls-Royce Power Systems AG level.\n\n## Key estimate - Estimates of cash flow forecasts and discount rates to support the carrying value of intangible assets (including programme-related intangible assets)\n\nIn accordance with IAS 36, COVID-19 is considered to be a trigger event to reassess whether an asset is impaired. The carrying value of intangible assets (including programme-related intangible assets) is dependent on the estimates of future cash flows which are influenced by assumptions over the recovery of the industries in which the Group operate and the discount rates applied. Details of the reviews performed are set out in note 12.\n\nThe carrying value of intangible assets on the balance sheet is dependent on the estimates of future cash flows arising from the Group's operations, in particular:\n\n- - The assessment of the recoverable value of certification costs, development expenditure and customer relationships recognised as intangible assets (31 December 2020: \u00a33,220m, 2019: \u00a33,612m) is dependent on estimates of cash flows generated by the relevant programme, the discount rate used to calculate a present value and assumptions on foreign exchange rates.\n- - In addition, in relation to programme intangible assets, estimates comprise: product performance related estimates (including EFHs and time-on-wing); and estimates for future market share, pricing and cost for uncontracted business.\n\nIt remains possible that a weaker than expected recovery could result in a deterioration in the future cash flow forecasts that support Civil Aerospace programme intangible assets:\n\n- - For intangible assets that have been impaired, a 5% deterioration in EFHs (and hence future cash flows) across the life of the programmes would result in these intangible assets incurring an additional impairment of \u00a350m. An increase in the discount rate of 1% would reduce the recoverable amount of the programme assets (\u00a3108m) to nil.\n- - For intangible assets where there is existing headroom in the impairment test (and thus no impairment) but where deteriorations in key assumptions over the next 12 months could lead to an impairment, any of the following individual changes in assumptions would cause the recoverable amount of the programme assets to equal the carrying value:\n- \u00b7 A reduction in engine sales that are forecast but not contracted by 14%\n- \u00b7 An increase in costs of 2%\n- \u00b7 An increase in discount rates of 1%\n\n## Joint ventures and associates\n\nWhere the Group makes sales to joint venture companies (most significantly the sale of spare engines to leasing joint ventures), the share of the profit relating to the Group's share of the investment in the joint venture is deferred and subsequently released to match the depreciation of the engines in the share of the joint ventures' retained profit. These adjustments are included in share of the results of joint ventures and associates in the income statement and investments - joint ventures and associates in the balance sheet.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories are valued on a first-in, first-out basis, at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those direct and indirect overheads, including depreciation of property, plant and equipment, that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling prices less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution. All inventories are classified as current as it is expected that they will be used in the Group's operating cycle, regardless of whether this is expected to be within 12 months of the balance sheet date.\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents include cash at bank and in hand, investments in money-market funds and short-term deposits with a maturity of three months or less on inception. The Group considers overdrafts (repayable on demand) to be an integral part of its cash management activities and these are included in cash and cash equivalents for the purposes of the cash flow statement. Where the Group operates pooled banking arrangements across multiple accounts, these are presented on a net basis when it has both a legal right and intention to settle the balances on a net basis.\n\nOn a periodic basis the Group undertakes the sale of certain trade receivables to banks. These trade receivables are factored on a nonrecourse basis (invoice discounting) and therefore are derecognised from the Group's balance sheet at the point of sale to the bank. Further details are disclosed in note 15.\n\nThe Group offers a supply chain financing (SCF) programme in partnership with banks to enable suppliers, including joint ventures, who are on our standard 75 day or more payment terms to receive their payment sooner. As the Group continues to have a contractual obligation to pay its suppliers and it does not retain any ongoing involvement in the SCF, the related payables are retained on the Group's balance sheet and classified as trade payables. Further details are disclosed in note 20.",

        "page_content": "## 1  Accounting policies continued\n\n## Provisions\n\nProvisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation. Provisions are discounted to present value where the effect is material.\n\nThe principal provisions are recognised as follows:\n\n- - Trent 1000 in-service issues when wastage costs are identified as described on page 117;\n- - contract losses based on an assessment of whether the direct costs to fulfil a contract are greater than the expected revenue;\n- - warranties and guarantees based on an assessment of future claims with reference to past experience and recognised at the earlier of when the underlying products and services are sold and when the likelihood of a future cost is identified; and\n- - restructuring when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring has either commenced or has created a valid expectation to those affected.\n\n## Key judgement - Whether any costs should be treated as wastage\n\nAs described further on page 117, in rare circumstances, the Group may incur costs of wasted material, labour or other resources to fulfil a contract where the level of cost was not reflected in the contract price. The identification of such costs is a matter of judgement and would only be expected to arise where there has been a series of abnormal events which give rise to a significant level of cost of a nature that the Group would not expect to incur and hence is not reflected in the contract price. Provision is made for any costs identified as wastage when the obligation to incur them arises.\n\nSpecifically for the Trent 1000 wastage costs, provision has been made as the Group is an owner of an engine Type Certificate under which it has a present obligation to develop appropriate design changes to address certain engine conditions that have been noted in issued Airworthiness Directives. The Group is also required to ensure engine operators can continue to safely operate engines within the terms of their LTSA agreements with the Group, and this requires the engines to be compliant with the requirements of those issued Airworthiness Directives. These requirements cannot be met without the Group incurring significant costs in the form of replacement parts and customer claims. Given the significant activities of the Group in designing and overhauling aero engines it is very experienced in making the required estimates in relation to the number and timing of shop visits, parts costs, overhaul labour costs and customer claims.\n\nKey estimates - Estimates of the time to resolve the technical issues on the Trent 1000, including the development of the modified HPT blade and estimates of the expenditure required to settle the obligation relating to Trent 1000 claims and to settle Trent 1000 long-term contracts assessed as onerous\n\nThe Group has provisions for Trent 1000 exceptional costs at 31 December 2020 of \u00a3321m (2019: \u00a31,382m). These represent the Directors' best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligations at the balance sheet date. These estimates take account of information available and different possible outcomes.\n\nThe Group considers that at 31 December 2020 the Trent 1000 contract loss provisions and the Trent 1000 exceptional cost provision are most sensitive to changes in estimates. A 12-month delay in the availability of the modified HPT blade could lead to a \u00a360-100m increase in the Trent 1000 exceptional costs provision.\n\n## Key estimates - Estimates of the future revenues and costs to fulfil onerous contracts\n\nThe Group has provisions for onerous contracts at 31 December 2020 of \u00a3791m (2019: \u00a3773m). A reduction in Civil Aerospace widebody flying hours of 15% over the remaining term of the contracts and the associated decrease in revenues and costs could lead to a \u00a310m-\u00a315m increase in the provision for contract losses across all programmes. Further details have been included in the going concern disclosure on page 52.\n\n## Post-retirement benefits\n\nPensions and similar benefits (principally healthcare) are accounted for under IAS 19 Employee Benefits\n\n.\n\nFor defined benefit plans, obligations are measured at discounted present value, using a discount rate derived from high-quality corporate bonds denominated in the currency of the plan, whilst plan assets are recorded at fair value. Surpluses in schemes are recognised as assets only if they represent economic benefits available to the Group in the future. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in OCI. The service and financing costs of such plans are recognised separately in the income statement:\n\n- - current service costs are spread systematically over the lives of employees;\n- - past-service costs and settlements are recognised immediately; and\n- -  financing costs are recognised in the periods in which they arise.\n\nIn 2018 and 2020, following clarification provided by the UK High Court judgements on the Lloyds Banking Group on 26 October 2018 and 23 November 2020, the Group recognised the estimated impact of the obligation to equalise defined benefit pensions and transfer values respectively for men and women as a past-service cost - see note 23.\n\nPayments to defined contribution schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.",

        "page_content": "## 1  Accounting policies continued\n\n## Key estimate - Estimates of the assumptions for valuing the defined benefit obligation\n\nThe Group's defined benefit pension schemes and similar arrangements are assessed annually in accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits . The valuation, which is based on assumptions determined with independent actuarial advice, resulted in a net deficit of \u00a3686m before deferred taxation being recognised on the balance sheet at 31 December 2020 (31 December 2019: deficit of \u00a3208m). The size of the net surplus/deficit is sensitive to the actuarial assumptions, which include the discount rate, price inflation, pension and salary increases, longevity and the number of plan members who take the option to transfer their pension to a lump sum on retirement or who choose to take the newly implemented Bridging Pension Option. Following consultation, the UK scheme closed to future accrual on 31 December 2020. The Group is in discussions with the employees' representatives and the Trustee regarding possible additional transitional protections that could be granted from the scheme. Based on the progress of the talks up to 31 December 2020, the Group has allowed for some reductions in the change to the obligation recognised at 31 December. The final details are expected to be agreed in 2021 when any differences will be recognised.\n\nA reduction in the discount rate from 1.45% by 0.25% could lead to an increase in the defined benefit obligations of the RR UK Pension Fund of approximately \u00a3530m. This would be expected to be broadly offset by changes in the value of scheme assets, as the scheme's investment policies are designed to mitigate this risk.\n\nA one-year increase in life expectancy from 21.8 years (male aged 65) and from 23.2 years (male aged 45) would increase the defined benefit obligations of the RR UK Pension Fund by approximately \u00a3455m.\n\nIt is assumed that 40% (31 December 2019: 45%) of members of the RR UK Pension Fund will transfer out of the fund on retirement. The reduction in this assumption is a result of the introduction of the Bridging Pension Option. An increase of 5% in this assumption would increase the defined benefit obligation by \u00a345m.\n\nFurther details and sensitivities are included in note 23.\n\n## Share-based payments\n\nThe Group provides share-based payment arrangements to certain employees. These are principally equity-settled arrangements and are measured at fair value (excluding the effect of non-market based vesting conditions) at the date of grant. The fair value is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of shares or options that will vest, except where additional shares vest as a result of the total shareholder return (TSR) performance condition in the long-term incentive plan (LTIP), where no adjustment is required as allowance for this is included in the initial fair value.\n\nCash-settled share options (grants in the International ShareSave plan) are measured at fair value at the balance sheet date. The Group recognises a liability at the balance sheet date based on these fair values, taking into account the estimated number of options that will actually vest and the relative completion of the vesting period. Changes in the value of this liability are recognised in the income statement for the year.\n\nThe cost of shares of Rolls-Royce Holdings plc held by the Group for the purpose of fulfilling obligations in respect of employee share plans is deducted from equity in the consolidated balance sheet. See note 25 for a further description of the share-based payment plans.\n\n## Customer financing support\n\nIn connection with the sale of its products the Group will, on occasion, provide financing support for its customers. These arrangements fall into two categories: credit-based guarantees and asset-value guarantees. In accordance with the requirements of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments and IFRS 4 I nsurance Contracts , credit-based guarantees are treated as insurance contracts. The Group considers asset-value guarantees to be non-financial liabilities and accordingly these are also treated as insurance contracts. As described on page 164, the Directors consider the likelihood of crystallisation in assessing whether provision is required for any contingent liabilities.\n\nThe Group's contingent liabilities relating to financing arrangements are spread over many years and relate to a number of customers and a broad product portfolio, and are reported on a discounted basis.\n\n## Costs of share issues\n\nThe costs of issuing ordinary shares are charged to the share premium account.\n\n## Revisions to IFRS not applicable in 2020\n\nStandards and interpretations issued by the IASB are only applicable if endorsed by the UK. Other than IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts described below, the Group does not consider that any standards, amendments or interpretations issued by the IASB, but not yet applicable will have a significant impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Group is not expecting to adopt the amendment to IFRS 16 Leases , effective in 2021, which provides a practical expedient to not treat COVID-19 rent concessions as lease modifications. The Group did not adopt the equivalent practical expedient during 2020.\n\n## IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts\n\nIFRS 17 is effective from 1 January 2023. The new Standard establishes the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of insurance contracts within the scope of the Standard. The objective of IFRS 17 is to ensure that an entity provides relevant information that faithfully represents those contracts. The Group is in the process of assessing whether the new standard will impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Post balance sheet events\n\nThe Group has taken the latest legal position in relation to ongoing legal proceedings and reflected these in the 2020 results as appropriate. In addition, the Group entered into an agreement to sell Bergen Engines on 1 February 2021. Further details are included in note 28. The Spring Budget 2021 announced that the UK corporation tax rate will increase to 25% from 1 April 2023. Further details are included in note 5.",

Our four divisions are set out below and referred to collectively as the core businesses.\n\nCivil Aerospace Power Systems Defence\n\ndevelopment, manufacture, marketing and sales of commercial aero engines and aftermarket services\n\ndevelopment, manufacture, marketing and sales of reciprocating engines and power systems\n\ndevelopment, manufacture, marketing and sales of military aero engines, naval engines, submarine nuclear power plants and aftermarket services\n\nITP Aero\n\ndesign, research and development, manufacture and casting, assembly and test of aeronautical engines and gas turbines, and maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) services\n\nNon-core businesses include the trading results of the Bergen Engines AS business (the Group signed a sales agreement on 1 February 2021), the results of the Civil Nuclear Instrumentation & Control business (the Group signed a sales agreement on 7 December 2020), the results of the North America Civil Nuclear business until the date of disposal on 31 January 2020, the results of the Knowledge Management System business until the date of disposal on 3 February 2020, the Commercial Marine business until the date of disposal on 1 April 2019, Rolls-Royce Power Development Limited (RRPD) until the date of disposal on 15 April 2019 and other smaller businesses including former Energy businesses not included in the disposal to Siemens in 2014 (Retained Energy). The segmental analysis for 2019 has been restated to reflect the 2020 definition of non-core.\n\nFrom 1 January 2021, all non-core businesses will be referred to as other businesses, and the reporting of core and non-core will cease.\n\n## Underlying results\n\nThe Group present the financial performance of our businesses in accordance with IFRS 8 and consistently with the basis on which performance is communicated to the Board each month.\n\nUnderlying results are presented by recording all relevant revenue and cost of sales transactions at the average exchange rate achieved on settled derivative contracts in the period that the cash flow occurs. The impact of the revaluation of monetary assets and liabilities using the exchange rate that is expected to be achieved by the use of the hedge book is recorded in underlying cost of sales. Underlying financing excludes the impact of revaluing monetary assets and liabilities to period end exchange rates. Transactions between segments are presented on the same basis as underlying results and eliminated on consolidation. Unrealised fair value gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts, which are recognised as they arise in the reported results, are excluded from underlying results. To the extent that the previously forecast transactions are no longer expected to occur, an appropriate portion of the unrealised fair value gain/(loss) on foreign exchange contracts is recorded immediately in the underlying results.\n\nAmounts receivable/(payable) on interest rate swaps which are not designated as hedge relationships for accounting purposes are reclassified from fair value movement on a reported basis to interest receivable/(payable) on an underlying basis, as if they were in an effective hedge relationship.\n\nAs a result of the reduction in Civil Aerospace US Dollar (USD) receipts, in the first half of the year the Group was a net purchaser of USD, with the consequence that the achieved exchange rate GBP:USD of 1.24 on settled contracts was similar to the average spot rate in the period. In the second half of 2020, the Group remained a net purchaser of USD with the consequence that the achieved exchange rate of GBP:USD of 1.33 on settled contracts was similar to the average spot rate in the period.\n\nEstimates of future USD cash flows have been determined using the Group's base-case forecast, significantly influenced by the estimate of future EFH forecasts. These USD cash flows have been used to establish the extent of future USD hedge requirements and determine the need to close-out any over-hedged positions. In response to the deterioration in the medium-term outlook caused by COVID-19 and the related reduction in anticipated net USD cash inflows, the Group took action to reduce the size of the USD hedge book by $11.8bn across 2020-2026. An underlying charge of \u00a31,689m relating to the total $11.8bn reduction in the size of the USD hedge book is included within underlying financing costs at 31 December 2020. Further detail on this is included within note 4.\n\nUnderlying performance excludes the following:\n\n- - the effect of acquisition accounting and business disposals;\n- - impairment of goodwill, other non-current and current assets where the reasons for the impairment are outside of normal operating activities;\n- - exceptional items; and\n- - other items which are market driven and outside of the control of management.\n\n## Acquisition accounting, business disposals and impairment\n\nThe Group excludes these from underlying results so that the current year and comparative results are directly comparable.\n\n## Exceptional items\n\nThe Group classifies items as exceptional where the Directors believe that presentation of our results in this way is more relevant to an understanding of our financial performance, as exceptional items are identified by virtue of their size, nature or incidence.\n\nIn determining whether an event or transaction is exceptional, management considers quantitative as well as qualitative factors such as the frequency or predictability of occurrence. Examples of exceptional items include one-time costs and charges in respect of aerospace programmes, costs of restructuring programmes and one-time past service charges and credits on our post-retirement schemes.\n\nA risk-free discount rate is applied to exceptional onerous contract provisions. The risk-free rate is subject to movements in US bonds. Changes in the risk-free rate are market-driven and the impact of any increase or decrease in the rate is included as a reconciling difference between underlying and reported performance.",

In addition, changes in tax rates or changes in the amount of recoverable advance corporation tax recognised are also excluded.\n\nSee page 131 for the reconciliation between underlying and reported performance.\n\nThe following analysis sets out the results of the core businesses on the basis described above and also includes a reconciliation of the underlying results to those reported in the consolidated income statement.\n\nCorporate\n\n|                                                                                                                        | Civil Aerospace \u00a3m   | Power Systems  1 \u00a3m   | Defence \u00a3m   | ITP Aero \u00a3m   | and inter-segment \u00a3m   | Core businesses \u00a3m   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|--------------|---------------|------------------------|----------------------|\n| Year ended 31 December 2020                                                                                            |                      |                       |              |               |                        |                      |\n| Underlying revenue from sale of original equipment                                                                     | 2,298                | 1,794                 | 1,436        | 537           | (293)                  | 5,772                |\n| Underlying revenue from aftermarket services                                                                           | 2,791                | 951                   | 1,930        | 168           | (96)                   | 5,744                |\n| Total underlying revenue                                                                                               | 5,089                | 2,745                 | 3,366        | 705           | (389)                  | 11,516               |\n| Gross (loss)/profit                                                                                                    | (2,005)              | 681                   | 686          | 133           | (18)                   | (523)                |\n| Commercial and administrative costs                                                                                    | (302)                | (337)                 | (151)        | (38)          | (52)                   | (880)                |\n| Research and development costs                                                                                         | (436)                | (167)                 | (96)         | (27)          | -

Underlying financing excludes the impact of revaluing monetary assets and liabilities at the period end exchange rate.\n- 2 The underlying results exclude the fair value changes on derivative contracts held for trading. These fair value changes are subsequently recognised in the underlying results when the contracts are settled.\n- 3 In response to the deterioration in the medium-term outlook caused by COVID-19 and the related reduction in anticipated net USD cash inflows, the Group has taken action to reduce the size of the USD hedge book by $11.8bn predominately by transacting offsetting foreign exchange forward contracts across 2020-2026, resulting in a \u00a31,689m charge to underlying results. The \u00a31,503m included in unrealised loss (shown above) is the net cost of closing out the over-hedged position in future years. The cost related to future years has been included within the underlying performance. It is reversed in arriving at reported performance on the basis that, the cumulative fair value changes on these derivative contracts are recognised as they arise. Further detail is provided in note 4.\n- 4 In 2020, the Group incurred cash outflows of \u00a3186m as a result of closing out $1.2bn of the $11.8bn hedge book reduction and \u00a316m to settle an over-hedged jet fuel position. The realised loss of \u00a3202 m is included in underlying financing costs.\n- 5 Includes the losses on hedge ineffectiveness in the year of \u00a311m (2019: losses \u00a313m) and net fair value losses of \u00a375m (2019: profit \u00a314m) on any interest rate swaps not designated into hedging relationships for accounting purposes.\n- 6 In 2019, abnormal wastage costs were recorded in respect of the Trent 1000, related to remediation shop visit costs, customer disruption costs and contract losses. During the year ended 31 December 2020, the total estimated Trent 1000 abnormal wastage costs have reduced by \u00a3620m as a result of COVID-19 and the work the Group have performed to reduce fleet AOG levels and improve the availability of spare engines, made up of \u00a3390m (a gross provision release of \u00a3560m, offset by the impact of expected actual exchange rates and the share of the costs borne by RRSAs) related to remediation shop visit costs and customer disruption costs, and an improvement of \u00a3230m in the position on contract losses.\n- 7 Discount rates have increased on exceptional contract loss provisions in relation to the Trent 900 and Trent 1000.\n- 8 At 31 December 2020, the Group recorded an exceptional charge of \u00a3489m following the announcement in May 2020 of a fundamental restructuring to reshape and resize the Group due to the financial and operational impact of COVID-19 (see note 22 for more detail).\n- 9 The Group has assessed the carrying value of its assets given the financial and operational impact of COVID-19 on the Group's future cash flow forecasts. Consequently, a number of impairments and write-offs have been recorded at 31 December 2020. Impairments comprise: intangible assets \u00a3567m, mainly related to programme intangibles; property, plant and equipment \u00a3318m (including \u00a3219m related to site rationalisation); right-of-use assets \u00a3384m, comprising engines of \u00a3311m, \u00a369m of site rationalisation and \u00a34m of other impairments; and \u00a324m impairment on the carrying value of investments held. Further details are provided in notes 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13.\n- 10 Other write-offs include \u00a3149m of participation fees in contract assets, \u00a32m in provisions for site rationalisation, offset by \u00a3(27)m for RRSA deferred cost contributions in payables. These write-offs are primarily a result of the impact of COVID-19.\n- 11 The effect of acquisition accounting includes the amortisation of intangible assets arising on previous acquisitions.\n- 12 The Group recorded a past service gain of \u00a3308m (of which \u00a3248m was recorded at 30 June 2020) following changes to the pension benefits under the terms of the Rolls-Royce UK Pension Fund (RRUKPF), a defined benefit scheme. Of the \u00a3308m gain, \u00a379m related to the restructuring described in footnote 8 above. The gain also comprises \u00a3134m on introduction of the Bridging Pension Option, \u00a367m as a result of the scheme closure and \u00a335m as a result of manager consultation offset by a \u00a37m past-service cost. In respect of the \u00a3248m gain recorded at 30 June 2020, \u00a3127m was subsequently recognised as actuarial losses through other comprehensive income at 31 December 2020 - see note 23.\n- 13 (Losses)/gains arising on the acquisitions and disposals of businesses includes the acquisition of Qinous GmbH (increasing the Group's shareholding from 24% to 100%), the sale of the North America Civil Nuclear business, the sale of the Knowledge Management Systems business and the sale of Trigno Energy Srl. During the year, sales proceeds received on the disposal of the L'Orange business in a prior period has been adjusted. See note 28 for further details.\n- 14 Appropriate rates of tax have been applied to adjustments made to (loss)/profit before tax in the table above. Adjustments in 2020 which impact the UK tax loss have an effective tax rate of zero. See note 5 for more details. The total underlying adjustments to loss before tax in 2020 are a charge of \u00a3220m (2019: \u00a3143m). The overall charge in 2020 includes a tax credit of \u00a3160m in respect of the change in the UK tax rate and a tax charge of \u00a3276m relating to the derecognition of some of the deferred tax asset on UK losses previously recognised.",

Underlying financing reclassifies the interest payable (2019: receivable) on these interest rates swaps from fair value movement to interest payable.\n- 3 In response to the deterioration in the medium-term outlook caused by COVID-19 and the related reduction in anticipated net US Dollar cash inflows, the Group took action during the year to reduce the size of the US Dollar hedge book by $11bn by transacting offsetting foreign exchange contracts across 2020-2026. A further $0.8bn of hedges have also been closed out in early 2021. An underlying charge of \u00a31,689m relating to the total $11.8bn reduction in the size of the US Dollar hedge book is included within underlying financing costs. These costs are already recognised in the reported results as fair value losses on foreign currency contacts.\n- 4 In 2020, the Group incurred a cash outflow of \u00a3186m as a result of closing out an over-hedged position of $1,211m and a cash outflow of \u00a316m to settle an over-hedged jet fuel position. The realised loss of \u00a3202m is included in underlying financing costs.\n\nIn response to the deterioration in the medium-term outlook caused by COVID-19 and the related reduction in anticipated net US Dollar cash inflows, the Group took action during the year to reduce the size of the US Dollar hedge book by $11.0bn by transacting offsetting foreign exchange contracts across 2020-2026. A further $0.8bn of hedges have also been closed out in early 2021. An underlying charge of \u00a31,689m relating to the total $11.8bn reduction in the size of the US Dollar hedge book is included within underlying financing costs. These costs are already recognised in the reported results as fair value losses on foreign currency contacts. The cash settlement costs of the \u00a31,689m will occur over the period 2020-2026, including \u00a3186m of cash costs incurred in 2020. The Group estimates that future cash outflows of \u00a3460m will occur in 2021, \u00a3327m in 2022, and \u00a3716m spread over 2023 to 2026. Subsequent to year-end, the Group took action to align the contractual settlement of derivatives in future periods with the forecast of net US Dollar cash inflows by extending $2bn of \u00a3/US Dollar hedging contracts from 2024-26 into 2027.\n\nAfter taking into account the actions described above the Group is forecast to be 100% hedged from 2021 to 2026 and approximately 90% hedged in 2027, based on Board approved forecasts. In the severe but plausible downside scenario forecast, the Group has modelled a further reduction in net US Dollar cash inflows. This would lead to an additional charge to underlying finance costs of \u00a3222m, with the associated cash cost unwinding across 2021-2027.",

In 2020 the impact is negative because of the loss in Germany relating to the impairment of the Business Aviation programme intangible assets.\n- 3 Tax losses not recognised mainly relate to the UK - see page 136.\n- 4 Derecognition of deferred tax assets relating to foreign exchange and commodity financial assets and liabilities and UK losses - see page 136.\n- 5 UK deferred tax was previously measured at 17%. The Spring Budget 2020 announced that the UK corporate tax rate would remain at 19% rather than reducing to 17%. The UK deferred tax balances have therefore been re-measured at 19%.",

Advance corporation tax has no expiry.\n\nDeferred tax assets of \u00a31,826m include \u00a3801m (2019: \u00a31,010m) relating to UK tax losses and \u00a3163m (2019: \u00a3163m) relating to Advance Corporation Tax (ACT). These assets have been recognised based on the expectation that the business will generate taxable profits and tax liabilities in the future against which the losses and ACT can be utilised.\n\nMost of the tax losses relate to the Civil Aerospace widebody business which makes initial losses through the investment period of a programme and then makes a profit through its contracts for services. The programme lifecycles typically range between 30 and 55 years with more of the widebody engine programmes forecast at the upper end of that range. In the past few years there have been four new engines that have entered into service (Trent 1000-TEN, Trent 7000 and Trent XWB-84 and Trent XWB-97).\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the assets can be utilised. A recoverability assessment has been undertaken, taking account of deferred tax liabilities against which the reversal can be offset and using latest UK forecasts, which are mainly driven by the Civil Aerospace widebody business, to assess the level of future taxable profits.\n\nThe recoverability of deferred tax assets relating to tax losses and ACT has been assessed in 2020 on the following basis:\n\n- - Using the most recent UK profit forecasts prepared by management, which are consistent with past experience and external sources on market conditions. These forecasts cover the next five years;\n- - the long-term forecast profit profile of certain of the major widebody engine programmes which is typically between 30 and 55 years from initial investment to retirement of the fleet, including the aftermarket revenues earned from airline customers; and\n- - the long-term forecast profit and cost profile of the other parts of the business.\n\nThe assessment takes into account UK tax laws that, in broad terms, restrict the offset of the carried forward tax losses to 50% of current year profits. Based on this assessment, the Group has recognised a deferred tax asset of \u00a3801m relating to losses and \u00a3163m relating to ACT. This reflects the conclusions that:\n\n- - It is probable that the business will generate taxable income and tax liabilities in the future against which these losses and the ACT can be utilised.\n- - Based on current forecasts and using various scenarios these losses and the ACT will be used in full within the expected widebody engine programme lifecycles.\n- - The Group has not recognised any deferred tax assets in respect of 2020 UK losses and de-recognised \u00a3327m of the deferred tax asset on the balance sheet at 31 December 2019. Of the total charge, \u00a351m is underlying with the balance of \u00a3276m non-underlying\n- - This is based on management's assumptions relating to the amounts and timing of future taxable profits and takes into account the impact of COVID-19 and climate change on existing widebody engine programmes.\n\nChanges in future profits will impact the recoverability of the deferred tax assets and as explained in note 1, the key assumptions impact contract margins. A 5% change in such margins over the remaining life of the programmes, against which the recovery of the tax losses and ACT is assessed, would result in a variance of around \u00a3100m in the related deferred tax balances recorded on the balance sheet, assuming a 19% tax rate and the 50% loss offset restriction mentioned above.\n\nThe assessment also considered the potential impact of climate change on profit forecasts, including additional taxes and levies that could arise and changes in consumer behaviour which could result in a reduction in shop visits (driven by EFHs, which are influenced by a number of factors including climate change). A 5% reduction in shop visits over the remaining life of the programmes would result in a variance of around \u00a3100m in the related deferred tax balances.\n\nThe Group has also reassessed the recovery of other deferred tax assets, including those arising on unrealised losses on derivative contracts. Any future changes in tax law or the structure of the Group could have a significant effect on the use of losses and ACT, including the period over which they can be used. In view of this and the significant judgement involved the Board continuously reassess this area.",

The total net DTA is \u00a3252m which has been recognised in full as it is considered probable that the business will generate taxable income in the future against which these assets can be utilised.\n\nThe Spring Budget 2020 announced that the UK corporation tax rate would remain at 19% rather than reducing to 17% from 1 April 2020. The new law was substantively enacted on 17 March 2020. The prior year UK deferred tax assets and liabilities were calculated at 17%, as this was the enacted rate at the 2019 balance sheet date. As the 19% rate has been substantively enacted before 31 December 2020, the UK deferred tax assets and liabilities have been re-measured at 19%.\n\nThe resulting credits and charges have been recognised in the income statement except to the extent that they relate to items previously credited or charged to equity. Accordingly, in 2020, \u00a3160m has been credited to the income statement and \u00a36m has been credited directly to equity.\n\nThe Spring Budget 2021 announced that the UK corporation tax rate will increase to 25% from 1 April 2023. The deferred tax assets and liabilities of UK companies within the Group have been calculated at 19% as this rate has been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Had the 25% rate been substantively enacted on or before 31 December 2020 it would have had the effect of increasing the net deferred tax asset by \u00a3342m.\n\nThe unrecognised deferred tax assets on UK losses, foreign exchange financial assets and liabilities and other deductible temporary differences would increase by \u00a3373m, \u00a3116m, and \u00a311m respectively if the 25% had been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.\n\nThe temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, for which a deferred tax liability has not been recognised, aggregate to \u00a3907m (2019 restated: \u00a3770m). No deferred tax liability has been recognised on the potential withholding tax due on the remittance of undistributed profits as the Group is able to control the timing of such remittances and it is probable that consent will not be given in the foreseeable future.\n\n## 6  Earnings per ordinary share\n\nBasic earnings per ordinary share (EPS) is calculated by dividing the loss attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding ordinary shares held under trust, which have been treated as if they had been cancelled. As there is a loss, the effect of potentially dilutive ordinary shares is anti-dilutive.\n\n|                                                       | 2020    | 2020                                 | 2020    | 2019 (restated)   | 2019 (restated)                      | 2019 (restated)   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------------------------|---------|-------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------|\n|                                                       | Basic   | Potentially  dilutive  share options | Diluted | Basic             | Potentially  dilutive  share options | Diluted           |\n| Loss attributable to ordinary shareholders (\u00a3m)       | (3,170) |                                      | (3,170) | (1,315)           |                                      | (1,315)           |\n| Weighted average number of ordinary shares (millions) | 5,987   | -                                    | 5,987   | 5,548             | -                                    | 5,548             |\n| EPS (pence)                                           | (52.95) | -                                    | (52.95) | (23.70)           | -                                    | (23.70)           |\n\nThe reconciliation between underlying EPS and basic EPS is as follows:\n\n|                                                                               | 2020    | 2020    | 2019 (restated)   | 2019 (restated)   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|-------------------|-------------------|\n|                                                                               | Pence   | \u00a3m      | Pence             | \u00a3m                |\n| Underlying EPS/Underlying (loss)/profit attributable to ordinary shareholders | (66.78) | (3,998) | 5.44              | 302               |\n| Total underlying adjustments to (loss)/profit before tax (note 2)             | 17.50   | 1,048   | (26.56)           | (1,474)           |\n| Related tax effects                                                           | (3.67)  | (220)   | (2.58)            | (143)             |\n| EPS/Loss attributable to ordinary shareholders                                | (52.95) | (3,170) | (23.70)           | (1,315)           |\n| Diluted underlying EPS                                                        | (66.78) |         | 5.44              |                   |\n\nBasic and diluted earnings per share figures for the comparative period have been restated and adjusted for the bonus factor of 2.91 to reflect the bonus element of the November 2020 rights issue, in accordance with IAS 33 Earnings per Share .

The North America Civil Nuclear business was classified as a disposal group held for sale on 26 September 2019, prior to this an impairment of goodwill of \u00a315m was recognised - see note 28.\n- 2 Charged to cost of sales and commercial and administrative costs except development costs, which are charged to research and development costs.\n- 3 As a result of the financial and operational impact of COVID-19 the Group has assessed the carrying value of its intangible assets. Consequently, impairments have been recorded at 31 December 2020. The impairment of development expenditure has arisen as a result of the anticipated reduction in OE volumes and future engine flying hours, and the consequential recoverability of these assets. The impairment charge of \u00a3579m includes \u00a312m charged to the income statement through underlying and \u00a3567m charged to non-underlying. See note 12 for further details.\n- 4 Includes \u00a3110m (2019: \u00a3129m) of software under course of construction which is not amortised.",

This was due to the impact of COVID-19, other market driven events and adverse foreign exchange movements reducing the recoverable amount of certain assets, as a result of reductions in the estimated OE volumes and aftermarket volumes (e.g. from lower EFHs) within the forecasts of future cash flows of each programme or CGU. These cash flow forecasts are discounted to generate the value in use of the programme intangible assets, lease engines (within property, plant and equipment), right-of-use assets and investments. The recoverable amount of other property, plant and equipment has been measured on a fair value less cost of disposal basis.\n\nThe impairment charges recognised in the year are as follows:\n\nImpairment charge in the year\n\n|                                                                          | Goodwill \u00a3m   | Other  intangible  assets \u00a3m   | Property,  plant and  equipment \u00a3m   | Right-of-use assets \u00a3m   | Investments   | Total  3 \u00a3m   | Recoverable  amount \u00a3m   | Discount rate at  31 December 2020 (31 December 2019)  1 \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------|---------------|---------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Civil Aerospace - Trent  programme assets (where  impairment recognised) | -             | 39                             | 86                                   | 311                      | -             | 436           | -                        | 11.0% (12%)                                                   |\n| Civil Aerospace - Business                                               |               |                                |                                      |                          |               |               |                          |                                                               |\n| Aviation programme assets  (where impairment recognised)                 | -             | 437                            | -                                    | -                        | -             | 437           | 108                      | 11.9% (11%)                                                   |\n| Civil Aerospace - specific assets                                        | -             | -                              | 219                                  | 69                       | 15            | 303           | 397                      | n/a  2 (n/a)                                                  |\n| Power Systems - specific assets                                          | -             | 35                             | 7                                    | 1                        | 9             | 52            | 96                       | 11.7% (n/a)                                                   |\n| ITP Aero - specific assets                                               | -             | 49                             | 11                                   | -                        | -             | 60            | 229                      | 10.6% (11%)                                                   |\n| Other                                                                    | 8             | 11                             | 9                                    | 5                        | -             | 33            | -                        | Various                                                       |\n| Total                                                                    | 8             | 571                            | 332                                  | 386                      | 24            | 1,321         |                          |                                                               |\n\n- 1 Discount rate for 31 December 2019 disclosed where an impairment test was performed.\n- 2 The impairment charge for Civil Aerospace specific assets, other than investments (10.5% discount rate), has been calculated on a fair value less cost of disposal basis.\n- 3 The impairment charge of \u00a31,321m includes \u00a328m charged to the income statement through underlying and \u00a31,293m charged to non-underlying.\n\n## b) Intangible assets (see note 9)\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill of \u00a31,074m (31 December 2019: \u00a3994m) has been tested for impairment during 2020 on the following basis:\n\n- - The carrying values of goodwill have been assessed by reference to value in use, estimated using the expected cash flow approach allowable under IAS 36 Impairment of Assets . Cash flow forecasts used to derive value in use have been prepared by management using the most recent forecasts, which are consistent with external sources of information on market conditions. These forecasts generally cover the next five years, with cash flows beyond this period based on a growth rate of 2.0% that reflects the products, industries and countries in which the relevant CGU or group of CGUs operate. Whilst these forecasts represent management's best estimate, in addition, the impact on the cash flows of (i) a severe but plausible downside scenario and (ii) various sensitivities have also been considered.\n- - The key assumptions for the impairment tests are the discount rate and, in the cash flow projections, the programme assumptions, the growth rates and the impact of foreign exchange rates on the relationship between selling prices and costs. Impairment tests are performed using prevailing exchange rates.\n\nThe principal value in use assumptions for goodwill balances considered to be individually significant are:\n\n## Rolls-Royce Power Systems AG\n\n- - Trading assumptions (e.g. volume of equipment deliveries, pricing achieved and cost escalation) that are based on current and known future programmes, estimates of market share and long-term economic forecasts;\n- - Plausible downside scenario included with a 15% weighting;\n- - Cash flows beyond the five-year forecasts that are assumed to grow at 2.0% (2019: 1.0%); and\n- - Pre-tax discount rate of 11.7% (2019: 12.0%).\n\nThe Directors do not consider that any reasonably possible changes in the key assumptions would cause the value in use of the goodwill to fall below its carrying value.\n\n## Rolls-Royce Deutschland Ltd & Co KG\n\n- - Trading assumptions (e.g. volume of engine deliveries, flying hours of installed fleet, including assumptions on the recovery of the aerospace industry, and cost escalation) that are based on current and known future programmes, estimates of market share and long-term economic forecasts;\n- - Plausible downside scenario included with a 25% weighting;\n- - Cash flows beyond the five-year forecasts that are assumed to grow at 2.0% (2019: 1.0%); and\n- - Pre-tax discount rate of 11.9% (2019: 12.0%).\n\nThe Directors do not consider that any reasonably possible changes in the key assumptions would cause the value in use of the goodwill to fall below its carrying value.\n\n## Other cash generating units\n\nGoodwill balances across the Group that are not considered to be individually significant were also tested for impairment, resulting in an impairment charge of \u00a38m being recognised at 31 December 2020 (2019: \u00a318m).",

Where there is a triggering event, and for indefinite life brand assets, impairment tests have been performed on the following basis:\n\n- - The carrying values have been assessed by reference to value in use as this represents the highest value to the Group in terms of the future cash flows that it can generate. Values in use have been estimated using the expected cash flow approach allowable under IAS 36. Cash flow forecast scenarios have been prepared by management using the most recent forecasts, which are consistent with external sources of information on market conditions over the lives of the respective programmes and incorporate management's best estimate of key assumptions utilising a stochastic analysis to allow for variation in the actual outcome where appropriate. A severe but plausible scenario was also modelled and, in order to risk adjust the cash flows, a weighting (25%/15% downside for Civil Aerospace/Power Systems respectively) was taken between the two scenarios based on management judgement.\n- - These forecasts include contracted business and management's expectation of speculative business over the life of the programme, together with the cash outflows that are necessary to maintain the current level of economic benefit expected to arise from the asset in its current condition.\n- - The key programme assumptions underlying the cash flow projections are forecast market share and pricing, programme timings, unit cost assumptions, EFHs, number of shop visits, cost of each shop visit, R&D, capital investment, discount rates and foreign exchange rates.\n- - The pre-tax cash flow projections have been discounted at 9.6%-11.9% (31 December 2019: 7.0%-15.0%), based on the weighted average cost of capital of the relevant business.\n\nIt remains possible that a weaker than expected recovery could result in a deterioration in the future cash flow forecasts that support Civil Aerospace programme intangible assets:\n\n- - For intangible assets that have been impaired, a 5% deterioration in EFHs (and hence future cash flows) across the life of the programmes would result in these intangible assets incurring an additional impairment of \u00a350m. An increase in the discount rate of 1% would reduce the recoverable amount of the programme assets (\u00a3108m) to nil.\n- - For intangible assets where there is existing headroom in the impairment test (and thus no impairment) but where deteriorations in key assumptions over the next 12 months could lead to an impairment, any of the following individual changes in assumptions would cause the recoverable amount of the programme assets to equal the carrying value:\n- - A reduction in engines sales that are forecast but not contracted by 14%;\n- - An increase in costs of 2%; or\n- - An increase in discount rates of 1%.\n\n## c)  Property, plant and equipment (see note 10)\n\nProperty, plant and equipment has been reviewed for impairment in accordance with the requirements of IAS 36. Following the announcement on the 20 May 2020 to reshape and resize the Group given the financial and operational impact of COVID-19, a strategic review of the Group's sites has been performed. Where the Group expects to exit a Civil Aerospace site, the carrying value of the land and buildings and related plant and equipment have been impaired to their recoverable amount by reference to their fair value (based on professional advice - Level 3 in the IFRS 13 heirarchy) less cost of disposal. The Group has also reviewed whether plant and equipment and assets under construction relating to these locations can be relocated to other parts of the Group for future use. Where no alternative use has been identified, the carrying value of these assets have been impaired to their recoverable amount by reference to their scrap values. An impairment charge of \u00a3219m has been recognised.\n\nImpairment tests were also considered necessary for Civil Aerospace and ITP Aero engines. An impairment charge of \u00a397m was recognised. The impairment tests were performed on the following basis:\n\n- - The carrying value of assets have been assessed by reference to their value in use, together with other assets as part of a larger CGU. These have been estimated using the expected cash flow approach allowable under IAS 36 as set out in note 12b above.\n- - The key assumptions underlying cash flow projections in relation to engines are utilisation of the asset, lease rate, condition of the engine and cost of maintaining, discount rates and foreign exchange rates.\n- - The pre-tax cash flow projections have been discounted at 10.6%-11.0% based on the weighted average cost of capital of the relevant business.\n\nOther smaller impairments totalling \u00a316m were also recognised.\n\n## d) Right-of-use assets (see note 11)\n\nRight-of-use (RoU) assets have been reviewed for impairment in accordance with the requirements of IAS 36. RoU assets have typically been assessed together with other assets as part of a larger CGU. Other than the items referred to below there have been no impairments of RoU assets.\n\nImpairment tests were considered necessary for lease engines as a result of the impact of COVID-19 on expected future EFHs, operators' fleet plans and the resultant requirement for fewer lease engines to support the aircraft fleets. An impairment charge of \u00a3311m was recognised against lease engine RoU assets.",

Assets have been written down to reflect the higher of their revised value in use (11.0% discount rate) or fair value less cost of disposal.\n\nOther smaller impairments totalling \u00a36m were also recognised.\n\n## e) Investments (see note 13)\n\nAs a result of reduced EFHs caused by COVID-19, joint venture investments in Civil Aerospace repair and overhaul facilities were tested for impairment. The value in use was estimated by discounting expected future dividends at 10.5% (cost of equity for the Civil Aerospace business). An impairment of \u00a315m was recognised.\n\nAs a result of changes in the local market due to climate regulations impacting the offered product, and the impact of COVID-19 on market demand and the liquidity of the business, a Power Systems joint venture was tested for impairment. The value in use of the investment was estimated using the expected cash flow approach. The pre-tax cash flow projections were discounted at 11.7%. An impairment of \u00a39m was recognised.\n\n## 13  Investments\n\n## Composition of the Group\n\nThe entities contributing to the Group's financial results are listed on pages 183 to 189.\n\nWhere the Group does not own 100% of the shares of a Group undertaking, there are a number of arrangements with the other shareholder(s) that give the Group the option or potential obligation to acquire the third parties' shares.

There were no impairment losses.\n- 3 Includes \u00a32m of amounts owed by the UK Government at 31 December 2020 for amounts claimed by the Group under furlough arrangements. In addition, other receivables includes unbilled recoveries relating to overhaul activity.\n- 4 During the year the presentation of trade receivables and other assets has been analysed in greater detail, without changing the total amount previously reported. As a consequence some comparative balances and currency movements have been represented in additional and more appropriate line items. Trade receivables has decreased by \u00a3184m, costs to obtain contracts with customers has increased by \u00a32m and other receivables has decreased by \u00a3903m. Receivables due on RRSAs and other taxation & social security receivable totalling \u00a31,085m are now presented as separate lines. This has also resulted in an associated re-presentation between financial and non-financial assets, with an increase of non-financial instruments of \u00a32m and a decrease in financial instruments of \u00a32m (trade receivables and similar items \u00a3(91)m and other non-derivative financial assets \u00a389m). The total amount of trade receivables and other assets from 2019 remains unchanged.",

        "page_content": "## 15  Trade receivables and other assets continued\n\nThe Group has historically undertaken the sale of trade receivables, without recourse, to banks (commonly known as invoice discounting or factoring). This activity has previously been used to normalise customer receipts as certain aerospace customers have extended their payment terms. This in turn has helped normalise Group cash flows in line with physical delivery volumes. During the year to 31 December 2020, invoice discounting has substantially reduced. At 31 December 2020, \u00a354m was drawn under factoring facilities, a decrease of \u00a31,063m compared to 2019, representing cash collected before it was contractually due from the customer. Trade receivables factored are generally due within the following quarter.\n\nThe expected credit losses for trade receivables and other assets has increased by \u00a3114m to \u00a3252m (2019: \u00a3138m). This increase is mainly driven by the impact of COVID-19 on the Civil Aerospace business of \u00a397m, of which \u00a346m relates to the deterioration of the market credit ratings of customers and \u00a351m relates to updates to the recoverability of other receivables.\n\nThe assumptions and inputs used for the estimation of the expected credit losses are disclosed in the table below:\n\n|                       | 2020                                            | 2020              | 2020                                  | 2019                                            | 2019              | 2019                                  |\n|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------|---------------------------------------|\n|                       | Trade receivables and other financial assets \u00a3m | Loss allowance \u00a3m | Average  expected credit  loss rate % | Trade receivables and other financial assets \u00a3m | Loss allowance \u00a3m | Average  expected credit  loss rate % |\n| Investment grade      | 1,611                                           | (33)              | 2%                                    | 1,230                                           | (40)              | 3%                                    |\n| Non-investment grade  | 149                                             | (7)               | 5%                                    | 271                                             | (2)               | 1%                                    |\n| Without credit rating | 2,816                                           | (212)             | 8%                                    | 2,636                                           | (96)              | 4%                                    |\n|                       | 4,576                                           | (252)             | 5%                                    | 4,137                                           | (138)             | 3%                                    |\n\nThe movements of the Group expected credit losses provision are as follows:\n\n|                                                                                | 2020 \u00a3m   | 2019  \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|------------|\n| At 1 January                                                                   | (138)     | (126)      |\n| Increases in loss allowance recognised in the income statement during the year | (119)     | (54)       |\n| Loss allowance utilised                                                        | 5         | 12         |\n| Releases of loss allowance previously provided                                 | 13        | 19         |\n| Other net movements                                                            | (13)      | 11         |\n| At 31 December                                                                 | (252)     | (138)      |\n\n## 16  Contract assets and liabilities\n\n|                                   | Current   | Current   | Non-current  1   | Non-current  1   | Total  2   | Total  2   |\n|-----------------------------------|-----------|-----------|------------------|------------------|------------|------------|\n|                                   | 2020 \u00a3m   | 2019 \u00a3m   | 2020 \u00a3m          | 2019 \u00a3m          | 2020 \u00a3m    | 2019 \u00a3m    |\n| Contract assets                   |           |           |                  |                  |            |            |\n| Contract assets with customers    | 416       | 404       | 660              | 1,092            | 1,076      | 1,496      |\n| Participation fee contract assets | 48        | 57        | 386              | 542              | 434        | 599        |\n|                                   | 464       | 461       | 1,046            | 1,634            | 1,510      | 2,095      |",

The main driver of the decrease in the Group balance is a result of revenue relating to performance obligations satisfied in previous years being adjusted by \u00a3599m in Civil Aerospace, primarily as a result of COVID-19 reducing engine flying hours (resulting in a reduction in total contract price) below the levels previously estimated over the term of the contracts with a corresponding reduction in the contract asset.\n\nParticipation fee contract assets have reduced by \u00a3(165)m (2019: reduced by \u00a3(55)m) due to the impairment of engine programme participation fees of \u00a3(149)m, amortisation exceeding additions by \u00a3(36)m and foreign exchange on consolidation of overseas entities of \u00a320m.\n\nThe absolute value of expected credit losses for contract assets has increased by \u00a31m to \u00a314m (2019: \u00a313m).\n\nNo impairment losses of contract assets (2019: none) have arisen during the year to 31 December 2020.\n\n|                                               | Current   | Current   | Non-current   | Non-current   | Total   | Total   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|---------------|---------------|---------|---------|\n|                                               | 2020 \u00a3m   | 2019 \u00a3m   | 2020 \u00a3m       | 2019 \u00a3m       | 2020 \u00a3m | 2019 \u00a3m |\n| Contract liabilities                          | 4,187     | 4,228     | 6,245         | 6,612         | 10,432  | 10,840  |\n| Contract liabilities are analysed as follows: |           |           |               |               |         |         |\n| Financial instruments (note 21)               |           |           |               |               | 186     | 131     |\n| Non-financial instruments                     |           |           |               |               | 10,246  | 10,709  |\n|                                               |           |           |               |               | 10,432  | 10,840  |\n\nDuring the year \u00a32,792m (2019: \u00a33,491m) of the opening contract liability was recognised as revenue. Contract liabilities have decreased by \u00a3408m. The main driver of the change in the Group balance is as a result of a reduction in deposits held, reflecting utilisation of amounts received in previous years as engines and aftermarket services were delivered in 2020. As a result of COVID-19 the level of new deposits received were at lower than normal levels.\n\nThe Civil Aerospace LTSA liabilities increased by \u00a358m to \u00a3 6,841m (2019: \u00a36,783m). LTSA revenue recognised as the performance obligations have been completed has exceeded cash receipts in the year due to the lower level of flying hours that drive cash receipts, decreasing the contract liability. This has been offset due to the 54% decrease in current year Civil Aerospace EFHs, together with a phased recovery, resulting in revenue relating to performance obligations satisfied in previous years being adjusted downwards by \u00a3462m which increases the contract liability.\n\n## 17  Cash and cash equivalents\n\n|                                                                | 2020 \u00a3m   | 2019 \u00a3m   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Cash at bank and in hand                                       | 940       | 825       |\n| Money-market funds                                             | 669       | 1,095     |\n| Short-term deposits                                            | 1,843     | 2,523     |\n| Cash and cash equivalents per the balance sheet                | 3,452     | 4,443     |\n| Cash and cash equivalents included within assets held for sale | 51        | -         |\n| Cash and cash equivalents per note 21                          | 3,503     | 4,443     |\n| Overdrafts (note 18)                                           | (7)       | (8)       |\n| Cash and cash equivalents per cash flow statement (page 109)   | 3,496     | 4,435     |\n\nCash and cash equivalents at 31 December 2020 includes \u00a3143m (2019: \u00a334m) that is not available for general use by the Group.

Where the value of this remeasurement exceeds the value of the right-of-use asset, the reduction in the lease liability is credited to cost of sales.\n- 5 Variable lease payments primarily arise on a small number of contracts where engine lease payments are dependent upon utilisation rather than a periodic charge.\n- 6 Included in financing costs.\n\nThe total cash outflow for leases in 2020 was \u00a3377m (2019: \u00a3383m). Of this, \u00a3358m related to leases reflected in the lease liability, \u00a318m to short-term leases where lease payments are expensed on a straight-line basis and \u00a31m for variable lease payments where obligations are only due when the assets are used. The timing difference between income statement charge and cash flow relates to costs incurred at the end of leases for residual value guarantees and restoration costs that are recognised within depreciation over the term of the lease, the most significant amounts relate to engine leases.\n\n## The Group's leasing activities as a lessee and how they are accounted for\n\nThe Group leases aero engines that are used to support customers' aircraft fleets; land and buildings used for production, administration or training purposes; and equipment used in the manufacturing process and to support commercial and administrative activities. Lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range of different terms and conditions. The lease arrangements do not impose any covenants, but leased assets may not be used as security for borrowing purposes.\n\nRight-of-use assets and lease liabilities arising over the lease term are initially measured on a present value basis. The lease term represented is the non-cancellable period of the lease together with periods covered by an option to extend the lease where the Group is reasonably certain to extend. Lease liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments where such flows exist:\n\n- - fixed payments less any lease incentive;\n- - variable lease payments that are based on an index or a rate;\n- - amounts expected to be payable by the Group under residual value guarantees;\n- - the exercise price of a purchase option if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise that option; and\n- - payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising that option.\n\nLeases for engines typically contain no specific contractual right to renew. Certain land and building leases have renewal options with renewal dates for the most significant property leases evenly spread between 2022-2028 and in 2041. Such judgements on lease terms are made each period end and consider the specific terms of the lease and the operational significance of the site, especially where utilised for manufacturing activities. Lease obligations beyond the renewal dates are included in the lease liability where the Group is reasonably certain to extend the lease.\n\nEngine leases in the Civil Aerospace business often include clauses that require the engines to be returned to the lessor with specific levels of useable life remaining. The cost of meeting these requirements are included in the estimate of the lease payments set out above. The amount payable is dependent upon the utilisation of the engines over the lease term, whether the engine is restored to the required condition by performing an overhaul at our own cost or through the payment of amounts specified in the contract and any new contractual arrangements arising when the current lease contracts end. Where estimates of payments change, an adjustment is made to the lease liability and the right-of-use asset. If the adjustment exceeds the value of the right-of use asset, the balance is credited to the income statement. Liabilities in USD and other non-functional currencies are reported at the closing spot rates with changes arising from a change in exchange rates reported within financing.\n\nOn transition to IFRS 16 Leases on 1 January 2019, finance leases continued to be recognised at their 2018 closing value and operating leases were measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments discounted using an incremental borrowing rate appropriate to the lease. For new leases, the lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or if that rate cannot be readily determined, which is generally the case for leases in the Group, the incremental borrowing rate, being the rate required to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment with similar terms, security and conditions.",

        "page_content": "## 19 Leases continued\n\nTo determine the incremental borrowing rate, the Group uses a build-up approach that starts with the risk-free interest rate which is then adjusted for credit risk to reflect the nature of the borrowing based on empirical evidence of similar external borrowings undertaken by the Group. The rate used reflects the term and currency of the lease.\n\nThe Group is exposed to potential future increases in lease payments where the amount paid is based on an index (such as LIBOR) or rate, which are not included in the lease liability until they take effect. When adjustments to lease payments based on an index or rate take effect, the lease liability is remeasured and an equivalent adjustment is made to the right-of-use asset except where the change results from a change in the floating interest rates when a revised discount rate is used that reflects changes in those rates.\n\nRight-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the following:\n\n- - the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability or revaluation of the liability;\n- - any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received;\n- - any initial direct costs; and\n- - restoration costs.\n\nEach right-of-use asset is depreciated over the shorter of its useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis unless the lease is expected to transfer ownership of the underlying asset to the Group, in which case the asset is depreciated to the end of the useful life of the asset.\n\nIncome from sub-leasing right-of-use assets is primarily generated from the use of engines by our Civil Aerospace customers. In a small number of circumstances current excess property capacity is sub-let at market rates.\n\n## Leases as lessor\n\nThe Group acts as lessor for engines to Civil Aerospace customers when they require engines to support their fleets. Lease agreements with the lessee provide protection over our assets. Usage in excess of specified limits and damage to the engine while on lease are covered by variable lease payment structures. Lessee bankruptcy risk is managed through the Cape Town Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment (including a specific protocol relating to aircraft equipment); an international treaty that creates common standards for the registration of lease contracts and establishes various legal remedies for default in financing agreements, including repossession and the effect of particular states' bankruptcy laws. Engines are only leased once the Group confirms that appropriate insurance documentation is established that covers the engine assets to pre-agreed amounts. All such contracts where we are lessor are operating leases. The Group also leases out a small number of properties, or parts of properties, where there is excess capacity under operating leases.\n\n|                                                                                  |   2020 \u00a3m |   2019 \u00a3m |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Operating lease income - credited within revenue from aftermarket services  1, 2 |       194 |       127 |\n\nNon-cancellable future operating lease rentals (undiscounted) are receivable as follows:\n\n|                              |   2020 \u00a3m |   2019 \u00a3m |\n|------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Within one year              |        13 |        13 |\n| Between one and two years    |        12 |        14 |\n| Between two and three years  |        10 |        12 |\n| Between three and four years |         6 |         8 |\n| Between four and five years  |         6 |         5 |\n| After five years             |        21 |        17 |\n|                              |        68 |        69 |\n\nIn a limited number of circumstances the Group sublets properties that are treated as finance leases when the arrangement transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset. At 31 December 2020, the total undiscounted lease payments receivable is \u00a322m on annual lease income of \u00a33m. The discounted finance lease receivable at 31 December 2020 is \u00a319m (2019: nil). There was no (2019: nil) finance income recognised during the year.",

Industry average payment terms vary between 90-120 days. The Group offers reduced payment terms for smaller suppliers, including joint ventures, so that they are paid in 30 days. In line with aerospace industry practice, we offer a supply chain financing (SCF) programme in partnership with banks to enable suppliers, including joint ventures, who are on our standard 75-day payment terms to receive their payments sooner. The SCF programme is available to suppliers at their discretion and does not change our rights and obligations with suppliers nor the timing of our payment of suppliers. At 31 December 2020 suppliers had drawn \u00a3582m under the SCF scheme (2019: \u00a3859m).",

Money market funds are valued using level 1 methodology.\n- C  Fair values of derivative financial assets and liabilities and trade receivables held to collect or sell are estimated by discounting expected future contractual cash flows using prevailing interest rate curves. For commodity derivatives forward commodity prices are used to determine expected future cash flows. Amounts denominated in foreign currencies are valued at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. These financial instruments are included on the balance sheet at fair value, derived from observable market prices (Level 2 as defined by IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement ).\n- D  Other assets are included on the balance sheet at fair value, derived from observable market prices or latest forecast (Level 2/Level 3 as defined by IFRS 13). At 31 December 2020, Level 3 assets totalled \u00a315m (2019: \u00a316m).\n- E  Borrowings are carried at amortised cost. Amounts denominated in foreign currencies are valued at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. The fair value of borrowings is estimated using quoted prices (Level 1 as defined by IFRS 13).\n- F  Borrowings are carried at amortised cost. Amounts denominated in foreign currencies are valued at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. The fair value of borrowings is estimated by discounting contractual future cash flows (Level 2 as defined by IFRS 13).\n- G  The fair value of lease liabilities are estimated by discounting future contractual cash flows using either the interest rate implicit in the lease or the Group's incremental cost of borrowing (Level 2 as defined by IFRS 13).\n- H  The fair value of RRSAs and other liabilities are estimated by discounting expected future cash flows. The contractual cash flows are based on future trading activity, which is estimated based on latest forecasts (Level 3 as defined by IFRS 13).\n\nIFRS 13 defines a three level valuation hierarchy:\n\nLevel 1 - quoted prices for similar instruments\n\n- Level 2 - directly observable market inputs other than Level 1 inputs\n- Level 3 - inputs not based on observable market data\n\n## Carrying values of other financial assets and liabilities\n\nForeign\n\n|                         | exchange  contracts \u00a3m   | Commodity  contracts \u00a3m   | Interest rate  contracts  1 \u00a3m   | Total  derivatives \u00a3m   | Financial RRSAs \u00a3m   | Other \u00a3m   | C Shares \u00a3m   | Total \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|------------|---------------|------------|\n| 2020                    |                          |                           |                                  |                         |                      |            |               |            |\n| Non-current assets      | 396                      | 18                        | 258                              | 672                     | -                    | 15         | -             | 687        |\n| Current assets          | 45                       | 7                         | 42                               | 94                      | -                    | 13         | -             | 107        |\n| Assets                  | 441                      | 25                        | 300                              | 766                     | -                    | 28         | -             | 794        |\n| Current liabilities     | (522)                    | (17)                      | (11)                             | (550)                   | (5)                  | (25)       | (28)          | (608)      |\n| Non-current liabilities | (2,790)                  | (19)                      | (113)                            | (2,922)                 | (76)                 | (48)       | -             | (3,046)    |\n| Liabilities             | (3,312)                  | (36)                      | (124)                            | (3,472)                 | (81)                 | (73)       | (28)          | (3,654)    |\n|                         | (2,871)                  | (11)                      | 176                              | (2,706)                 | (81)                 | (45)       | (28)          | (2,860)    |\n| 2019                    |                          |                           |                                  |                         |                      |            |               |            |\n| Non-current assets      | 234                      | 14                        | 203                              | 451                     | -                    | 16         | -             | 467        |\n| Current assets          | 16                       | 9                         | 49                               | 74                      | -                    | 12         | -             | 86         |\n| Assets                  | 250                      | 23                        | 252                              | 525                     | -                    | 28         | -             | 553        |\n| Current liabilities     | (394)                    | (5)                       | -                                | (399)                   | (31)                 | (32)       | (31)          | (493)      |\n| Non-current liabilities | (2,960)                  | (6)                       | (9)                              | (2,975)                 | (79)                 | (40)       | -             | (3,094)    |\n| Liabilities             | (3,354)                  | (11)                      | (9)                              | (3,374)                 | (110)                | (72)       | (31)          | (3,587)    |\n|                         | (3,104)                  | 12                        | 243                              | (2,849)                 | (110)                | (44)       | (31)          | (3,034)    |\n\n- 1 Includes the foreign exchange impact of cross-currency interest rate swaps.\n\n## Derivative financial instruments\n\nThe Group uses various financial instruments to manage its exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates. The Group uses commodity swaps to manage its exposure to movements in the price of commodities (jet fuel and base metals). To hedge the currency risk associated with a borrowing denominated in a foreign currency, the Group has currency derivatives designated as part of fair value or cash flow hedges. The Group uses interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements to manage its exposure to movements in interest rates.\n\nMovements in the fair values of derivative financial assets and liabilities were as follows:\n\n|                                             | Foreign exchange  instruments   | Foreign exchange  instruments   | Commodity instruments   | Commodity instruments   | Interest rate instruments  -  hedge accounted  2   | Interest rate instruments  -  hedge accounted  2   | Interest rate instruments  -  non-hedge accounted   | Interest rate instruments  -  non-hedge accounted   | Total   | Total   |\n|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n|                                             | 2020 \u00a3m                         | 2019 \u00a3m                         | 2020 \u00a3m                 | 2019 \u00a3m                 | 2020 \u00a3m                                            | 2019 \u00a3m                                            | 2020 \u00a3m                                             | 2019 \u00a3m                                             | 2020 \u00a3m | 2019 \u00a3m |\n| At 1 January                                | (3,104)                         | (3,764)                         | 12                      | (34)                    | 229                                                | 292                                                | 14                                                  | -                                                   | (2,849) | (3,506) |\n| Movements in fair value  hedges             | -                               | -                               | -                       | -                       | 139                                                | (27)                                               | -                                                   | -                                                   | 139     | (27)    |\n| Movements in cash flow  hedges              | 18                              | (4)                             | 6                       | 13                      | (60)                                               | -                                                  | -                                                   | -                                                   | (36)    | 9       |\n| Movements in other  derivative contracts  1 | (23)                            | (43)                            | (62)                    | 36                      | -                                                  | -                                                  | (75)                                                | 14                                                  | (160)   | 7       |\n| Contracts settled                           | 238                             | 707                             | 33                      | (3)                     | (75)                                               | (36)                                               | 4                                                   | -                                                   | 200     | 668     |\n| At 31 December                              | (2,871)                         | (3,104)                         | (11)                    | 12                      | 233                                                | 229                                                | (57)                                                | 14                                                  | (2,706) | (2,849) |\n\n- 1 Included in net financing.\n- 2 Includes the foreign exchange impact of cross-currency interest rate swaps.",

        "page_content": "## 21  Financial instruments continued\n\nThe Group has adopted the 'Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7 Interest Rate Benchmark Reform' issued in September 2019. In calculating the change in fair value attributable to the hedged risk for the fixed-rate borrowings, the Group has made the following assumptions that reflect its current expectations:\n\n- - the Group has assumed that pre-existing fallback provisions in the borrowings do not apply to IBOR reform;\n- - borrowings move to a risk-free rate during 2022, and the spread will be similar to the spread included in the interest rate swaps used as hedging instruments; and\n- - no other changes to the terms of the hedged borrowings are anticipated.\n\n## Risk management policies and hedging activities\n\nThe principal financial risks to which the Group is exposed are: foreign currency exchange rate risk; liquidity risk; credit risk; interest rate risk; and commodity price risk. The Board has approved policies for the management of these risks.\n\nForeign currency exchange rate risk - The Group has significant cash flows denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the relevant trading entity (most significantly USD, followed by the euro). To manage its exposures to changes in values of future foreign currency cash flows, so as to maintain relatively stable long-term foreign exchange rates on settled transactions, the Group enters into derivative forward foreign currency transactions.\n\nThe Group economically hedges its GBP/USD exposure by forecasting highly probable net USD receipts up to ten years forward. Hedges are taken out within prescribed maximum and minimum hedge positions set out in the Group FX Policy. The maximum and minimum policy bands decline gradually over the ten year horizon and are calculated as a percentage of forecast net income. A similar policy is operated for the Group's EUR/USD exposure. For accounting purposes, these derivative contracts are not designated in hedging relationships with the exception of those taken out by the Group's Spanish subsidiary, ITP Aero, where they are designated in cash flow hedges. ITP Aero is exposed predominantly to net USD receipts that it hedges against EUR using foreign exchange forward contracts.\n\nThe Group also has exposures to cash flows on EUR and USD denominated fixed rate borrowings. To manage its exposures to changes in values of future foreign currency cash flows, the Group has entered into fixed-to-fixed cross-currency interest rate swaps which for accounting purposes are designated as cash flow hedges. The swaps have similar critical terms to the hedged items, such as the initial exchange amounts, payment dates and maturities. Therefore there is an economic relationship and the hedge ratio is established as 1:1. Possible sources of ineffectiveness in the cash flow hedge relationship are changes in the credit risk of either party to the interest rate swap. Another possible source of ineffectiveness would be if the notional of the borrowings is less than the notional of the derivative, for example in the event of a partial repayment of hedged debt prior to its maturity.\n\nThe Group regards its interests in overseas subsidiary companies as long-term investments. The Group aims to match its translational exposures by matching the currencies of assets and liabilities.\n\nLiquidity risk - The Group's policy is to hold financial investments and maintain undrawn committed facilities at a level sufficient to ensure that the Group has available funds to meet its medium-term capital and funding obligations and to meet any unforeseen obligations and opportunities. The Group holds cash and short-term investments, which together with the undrawn committed facilities, enable the Group to manage its liquidity risk.\n\nCredit risk - The Group is exposed to credit risk to the extent of non-payment by either its customers or the counterparties of its financial instruments. The effective monitoring and controlling of credit risk is a key component of the Group's risk management activities. The Group has credit policies covering both trading and financial exposures. Credit risks arising from treasury activities are managed by a central treasury function in accordance with the Group credit policy. The objective of the policy is to diversify and minimise the Group's exposure to credit risk from its treasury activities by ensuring the Group transacts strictly with 'BBB' or higher rated financial institutions based on pre-established limits per financial institution. At the balance sheet date, there were no significant concentrations of credit risk to individual customers or counterparties. The Group's revenue is generated from customers located across multiple geographical locations (see note 2), these customers are typically: airframers and airline operators relating to Civil Aerospace; government defence departments for the UK and US; multiple smaller entities for Power Systems; and aero engine manufacturers for ITP Aero. Whilst there are a limited number of customers related to Civil Aerospace and Defence, they are spread across various geographical locations. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the balance sheet date is represented by the carrying value of each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments.\n\nInterest rate risk - The Group's interest rate risk is primarily in relation to its fixed rate borrowings (fair value risk), floating rate borrowings and cash and cash equivalents (cash flow risk). Interest rate derivatives are used to manage the overall interest rate profile of the Group. The fixed or floating interest rate decision on long-term borrowings is determined for each new agreement at the point it is entered into. The aggregate interest rate position of the Group is reviewed regularly and can be revised at any time in order to react to changes in market conditions or circumstances.\n\nThe Group also has exposures to the fair values of non-derivative financial instruments such as EUR, GBP and USD fixed rate borrowings. To manage the risk of changes in these fair values, the Group has entered into fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps and cross-currency interest rate swaps which for accounting purposes are designated as fair value hedges. The swaps have similar critical terms to the hedged items, such as the reference rate, reset dates, notional amounts, payment dates and maturities. Therefore there is an economic relationship and the hedge ratio is established as 1:1. Possible sources of ineffectiveness in the fair value hedge relationship are changes in the credit risk of either party to the interest rate swap and, for cross-currency interest rate swaps, the cross-currency basis risk as this risk is present in the hedging instrument only. Another possible source of ineffectiveness would be if the notional of the borrowings is less than the notional of the derivative, for example in the event of a partial repayment of hedged debt prior to its maturity.\n\nThe Group has exposure to changes in cash flows due to changes in interest rates. To manage this risk the Group has entered into floatingto-fixed interest rate swaps to hedge a proportion of its floating rate exposure to fixed rates. The swaps have similar critical terms to the",

For accounting purposes, these derivative contracts are generally not designated as hedging instruments.\n\nITP Aero has also entered into a floating-to-fixed interest rate swap to hedge the cash flow risk on a floating rate borrowing which for accounting purposes is designated as a cash flow hedge.\n\nCommodity risk - The Group has exposures to the price of jet fuel and base metals arising from business operations. To minimise its cash flow exposures to changes in commodity prices, the Group enters into derivative commodity transactions. The commodity hedging policy is similar to the Group FX policy, in that the Group forecasts highly probable exposures to commodities, and takes out hedges within prescribed maximum and minimum levels as set out in the policy. The maximum and minimum policy bands decline gradually over time. For accounting purposes, these derivative contracts are generally not designated in hedging relationships.\n\nOther price risk - The Group's cash equivalent balances represent investments in money-market instruments, with a term of up to three months. The Group does not consider that these are subject to significant price risk.\n\n## Derivative financial instruments\n\nThe nominal amounts, analysed by year of expected maturity, and fair values of derivative financial instruments are as follows:\n\n|                             | Expected maturity   | Expected maturity   | Expected maturity             | Expected maturity             | Expected maturity   | Fair value   | Fair value     |\n|-----------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------|--------------|----------------|\n|                             | Nominal amount \u00a3m   | Within one year \u00a3m  | Between  one and two years \u00a3m | Between two and five years \u00a3m | After five years \u00a3m | Assets \u00a3m    | Liabilities \u00a3m |\n| At 31 December 2020         |                     |                     |                               |                               |                     |              |                |\n| Foreign exchange contracts: |                     |                     |                               |                               |                     |              |                |\n| Cash flow hedges            | 544                 | 206                 | 187                           | 151                           | -

If the Group fails to meet its obligations these arrangements give rights to the lenders, upon agreement, to accelerate repayment of the facilities. At 31 December 2020 none of these were in breach (2019: none). There are no rating triggers contained in any of the Group's facilities that could require the Group to accelerate or repay any facility for a given movement in the Group's credit rating.\n\n\u00a3166m of the Group's lease liabilities include a customary loan-to-value covenant. The Group has several contractual cures available in the event the stipulated loan-to-value ratio is exceeded. Failure by the Group to satisfy its contractual obligations under the covenant gives rights to the lessor to terminate its lease and claim termination amounts for the outstanding lease balance. At 31 December 2020 the Group had not breached its contractual obligations under the covenant on any lease (2019: none).\n\n## Sensitivity analysis\n\n| Sensitivities at 31 December (all other variables held constant) - impact on profit after tax and equity   | 2020 \u00a3m   | 2019 \u00a3m   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Sterling 10% weaker against the US dollar                                                                  | (1,992)   | (2,557)   |\n| Sterling 10% stronger against the US dollar                                                                | 1,642     | 2,105     |\n| Euro 10% weaker against the US dollar                                                                      | (315)     | (376)     |\n| Euro 10% stronger against the US dollar                                                                    | 258       | 307       |\n| Sterling 10% weaker against the Euro                                                                       | (14)      | (32)      |\n| Sterling 10% stronger against the Euro                                                                     | 12        | 26        |\n| Commodity prices 10% lower                                                                                 | (20)      | (32)      |\n| Commodity prices 10% higher                                                                                | 20        | 32        |\n| Interest rates 50 basis points lower                                                                       | (77)      | (82)      |\n| Interest rates 50 basis points higher                                                                      | 82        | 85        |",

The Company has the option to compulsorily redeem the C Shares, at any time, if the aggregate number of C Shares in issue is less than 10% of the aggregate number of C Shares issued, or on the acquisition or capital restructuring of the Company.\n\nMovements in issued and fully paid C Shares during the year were as follows:\n\n|                | 2020     | 2020             | 2019      | 2019             |\n|----------------|----------|------------------|-----------|------------------|\n|                | Millions | Nominal value \u00a3m | Millions  | Nominal value \u00a3m |\n| At 1 January   | 30,608   | 31               | 29,071    | 29               |\n| Issued         | 88,825   | 89               | 221,954   | 222              |\n| Redeemed       | (91,893) | (92)             | (220,417) | (220)            |\n| At 31 December | 27,540   | 28               | 30,608    | 31               |\n\nPayments to shareholders in respect of the year represent the value of C Shares to be issued in respect of the results for the year.

An exceptional charge of \u00a31,361m (at underlying exchange rates) was recorded in 2019, \u00a31,531m at prevailing exchange rates and net of \u00a3203m reflecting insurance receipts and contract accounting adjustments. Of the charge, \u00a31,275m was recorded in relation to Trent 1000 exceptional costs, and \u00a3459m in relation to contract losses (see below). During the year ended 31 December 2020, and reflecting the impact of COVID-19 and the work the Group has performed to reduce fleet AOG levels and improve the availability of spare engines, the total estimated Trent 1000 cash costs relating to remediation shop visits and customer disruption reduced the provision by \u00a3560m , taking into account the expected underlying exchange rates and a share of the costs borne by the RRSAs the income statement impact was \u00a3390m (see note 2). In the year the Group has utilised \u00a3541m of the Trent 1000 exceptional costs provision. This represents customer disruption costs settled in cash and credit notes, and remediation shop visit costs. The remaining provision is expected to be utilised over the period 2021 to 2023.\n\nA 12-month delay in the availability of the modified HP turbine blade could lead to a \u00a360m-\u00a3100m increase in the Trent 1000 provision.",

        "page_content": "## 22  Provisions for liabilities and charges continued\n\n## Contract losses\n\nProvisions for contract losses are recorded when the direct costs to fulfil a contract are assessed as being greater than the expected revenue. Provisions for contract losses are expected to be utilised over the term of the customer contracts, typically within 10-15 years.\n\nDuring 2019, contract losses of \u00a3459m (at prevailing exchange rates) were recognised relating to the upfront recognition of future losses on a small number of contracts which became loss making as a result of the margin impact of the updated HP turbine durability expectations on the Trent 1000 TEN. During the year, these Trent 1000 TEN loss-making contracts have improved by \u00a3230m (see note 2). For these contracts, a reduction in EFHs resulting from COVID-19 has allowed for a reassessment of shop visits required and the cost savings identified have more than offset the reduction in future revenue leading to an improvement in the overall position of these contracts.\n\nEFHs have reduced as a result of the impact of COVID-19. For certain Civil Aerospace contracts, the impact of this reduction across the contract term has been to significantly reduce revenue without an associated reduction in shop visit costs. Consequently, during the year there have been an increased number of contracts that have become loss-making. A reduction in Civil Aerospace widebody engine flying hours of 15% and the associated decrease in revenues and costs could lead to a \u00a310m-\u00a315m increase in the onerous contract provision.\n\nAdditional contract losses for the Group of \u00a3406m have been recognised in the year, together with \u00a336m relating to changes in foreign exchange and the effect of discounting.\n\n## Warranties and guarantees\n\nProvisions for warranties and guarantees primarily relate to products sold and generally cover a period of up to three years.\n\n## Restructuring\n\nIn May 2020, the Group announced a fundamental restructuring programme in response to the financial and operational impact caused by COVID-19. This activity will reshape and resize the Group with an anticipated headcount reduction of at least 9,000. As a consequence of this announcement, and based on the detailed plans communicated during 2020, a provision (net of reversals) of \u00a3 373m has been recorded and recognised in cost of sales and commercial and administrative costs. During the year, \u00a3206m has been utilised as part of these plans. At 31 December 2020, the provision of \u00a3236m is expected to be utilised over the period 2021-2022. Included within the exceptional charge of \u00a3489m are costs of \u00a3116m associated with other initiatives to enable the restructuring which have been charged directly to the income statement.\n\n## Customer financing\n\nCustomer financing provisions have been made to cover guarantees provided for asset value and/or financing where it is probable that a payment will be made.\n\nIn addition to the provisions recognised, where it is not probable that a payment will be made the Group has contingent liabilities for customer financing arrangements as described below.\n\nIn connection with the sale of its products the Group will, on some occasions, provide financing support for its customers, generally in respect of civil aircraft. The Group's commitments relating to these financing arrangements are spread over many years, relate to a number of customers and a broad product portfolio, and are generally secured on the asset subject to the financing. These include commitments of $1.9bn (2019: $2.8bn) (on a discounted basis) to provide facilities to enable customers to purchase aircraft (of which approximately $630m could be called during 2021). These facilities may only be used if the customer is unable to obtain financing elsewhere and are priced at a premium to the market rate. Significant events impacting the international aircraft financing market, including the COVID-19 pandemic, the failure by customers to meet their obligations under such financing agreements, or inadequate provisions for customer financing liabilities may adversely affect the Group's financial position.\n\nCommitments on delivered aircraft in excess of the amounts provided are shown in the table below. These are reported on a discounted basis at the Group's borrowing rate to better reflect the time span over which these exposures could arise. These amounts do not represent values that are expected to crystallise. The commitments are denominated in USD. As the Group does not generally adopt cash flow hedge accounting for future foreign exchange transactions, this amount is reported together with the sterling equivalent at the reporting date spot rate. The values of aircraft providing security are based on advice from a specialist aircraft appraiser.\n\n|                                                 | 2020   | 2020   | 2019   | 2019   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n|                                                 | \u00a3m     | $m     | \u00a3m     | $m     |\n| Gross commitments                               | 38     | 52     | 60     | 79     |\n| Value of security                               | (14)   | (19)   | (9)    | (11)   |\n| Indemnities                                     | (5)    | (6)    | (8)    | (11)   |\n| Net commitments                                 | 19     | 27     | 43     | 57     |\n| Net commitments with security reduced by 20%  1 | 22     | 30     | 43     | 57     |\n\n- 1 Although sensitivity calculations are complex, the reduction of relevant security by 20% illustrates the sensitivity of the contingent liability to changes in this assumption.",

        "page_content": "## 22  Provisions for liabilities and charges continued\n\n## Insurance\n\nThe Group's captive insurance company retains a portion of the exposures it insures on behalf of the remainder of the Group. Significant delays occur in the notification and settlement of claims and judgement is involved in assessing outstanding liabilities, the ultimate cost and timing of which cannot be known with certainty at the balance sheet date. The insurance provisions are based on information currently available, however it is inherent in the nature of the business that ultimate liabilities may vary. Provisions for outstanding claims are established to cover the outstanding expected liability as well as claims incurred but not yet reported.\n\n## Tax-related interest and penalties\n\nProvisions for tax-related interest and penalties relate to uncertain tax positions in some of the jurisdictions in which the Group operates. Utilisation of the provisions will depend on the timing of resolution of the issues with the relevant tax authorities.\n\n## Employer liability claims\n\nThe provision relating to employer healthcare liability claims is as a result of an historical insolvency of the previous provider and is expected to be utilised over the next 30 years.\n\n## Other\n\nOther provisions comprise a number of liabilities with varying expected utilisation rates.\n\n## 23  Post-retirement benefits\n\nThe Group operates a number of defined benefit and defined contribution schemes:\n\n- - The UK defined benefit scheme is funded, with the assets held in a separate trustee administered fund. Employees are entitled to retirement benefits based on either their final or career average salaries and length of service. On 31 December 2020, the scheme was closed to future accrual.\n- - Overseas defined benefit schemes are a mixture of funded and unfunded plans and provide benefits in line with local practice. Additionally in the US, and to a lesser extent in some other countries, the Group's employment practices include the provision of healthcare and life insurance benefits for retired employees. These schemes are unfunded.\n\nThe valuations of the defined benefit schemes are based on the results of the most recent funding valuation, where relevant, updated by the scheme actuaries to 31 December 2020. In the UK, although the 31 March 2020 valuation is not yet finalised; the initial results have been used.\n\n## Changes to the UK defined benefit scheme\n\nThe defined benefit schemes expose the Group to actuarial risks such as longevity, interest rate, inflation and investment risks. In the UK, and in the principal US and Canadian pension schemes, the Group has adopted investment policies to mitigate some of these risks. This involves investing a significant proportion of the schemes' assets in liability driven investment (LDI) portfolios, which hold investments designed to offset interest rate and inflation rate risks. In addition during 2019, the scheme completed a partial buy-in/buy-out of UK pensioner liabilities.\n\nOn 5 June 2019, the Group entered into a partial buy-in with Legal and General Assurance Society Limited covering the benefits of circa 33,000 in-payment pensioners. The buy-in was in anticipation of a buy-out, the final 10% of which concluded on 1 February 2020. Pension assets and liabilities of \u00a3422m were derecognised from the Group's balance sheet on this date and this had no impact on the income statement or OCI in the current period. In relation to this transaction, at 31 December 2019, an asset remeasurement net loss estimated at \u00a3600m was recognised within Actuarial gains/(losses) recognised in OCI.\n\nA consultation with active managers in the UK scheme was concluded in January 2020. The consultation process agreed certain changes for the relevant manager group which would mitigate future funding cost increases. The changes gave rise to a past service gain of \u00a335m which has been recognised as a non-underlying profit (see note 2).\n\nOn the 20 May 2020, the Group announced its intention to reshape and resize the Group due to the financial and operational impact of COVID-19. As part of this restructuring programme, a voluntary severance programme was offered to certain UK employees and pension liabilities were remeasured as at 30 June 2020 to reflect the number of members who were expected to leave the scheme. In addition, the Group agreed with the Trustee of the RRUKPF to offer a new Bridging Pension Option (BPO) to both active members and also those members leaving on severance. This option allows members to take a larger proportion of their pension prior to reaching the state retirement age and a lower amount thereafter. The accounting impact of these changes gave rise to a past service gain of \u00a3213m which was been recognised as a non-underlying profit in the period to 30 June 2020 (see note 2). The assumptions for members remaining employed have subsequently been updated to reflect actual experience, resulting in a demographic loss of \u00a380m , which is included in Actuarial gains/(losses) recognised in OCI. In addition, for members leaving on severance, an experience loss of \u00a347m is also included in Actuarial gains/(losses) recognised in OCI.\n\nOn the 29 July 2020, the Group announced a consultation with the active members of the UK scheme on a proposal to close the scheme to future accrual on 31 December 2020. Following the conclusion of this consultation, the closure of the scheme was confirmed, which gave rise to a non-underlying past-service credit of \u00a367m . This primarily arises from the breakage of the link between accrued pensions and salaries for non-manager members (this link had already been largely broken for manager members as a result of the January 2020 consultation described below). Following the confirmation of the scheme closure, the Group is in discussions with the employees' representatives regarding possible additional transitional protections that could be granted from the scheme. Based on the progress of the talks up to 31 December 2020, the Group has allowed for some reductions in the change to the obligation recognised at 31 December. The final details are expected to be agreed in 2021 when any differences will be recognised.",

The rate is determined by using the profile of forecast benefit payments to derive a weighted average discount rate from the yield curve.\n\nThe inflation assumption is determined by the market-implied assumption based on the yields on long-term index-linked government securities and increases in salaries are based on actual experience, allowing for promotion, of the real increase above inflation.\n\nThe mortality assumptions adopted for the UK pension schemes are derived from the SAPS S3 'All' actuarial tables, with future improvements in line with the CMI 2019 core projections updated to reflect use of an 'A' parameter of 0.25% for future improvements and long-term improvements of 1.25%. Where appropriate, these are adjusted to take account of the scheme's actual experience.\n\nThe assumption for transfers and the BPO is based on actual experience and actuarial advice. The reduction in the transfer assumption is a result of the introduction of the BPO, and assumes that 15% of retiring members opt for the BPO rather than transfer.\n\nOther assumptions have been set on advice from the actuary, having regard to the latest trends in scheme experience and the assumptions used in the most recent funding valuation. The rate of increase of pensions in payment is based on the rules of the scheme, combined with the inflation assumption where the increase is capped.",

The scheme assets do not directly include any of the Group's own financial instruments, nor any property occupied by, or other assets used by, the Group. At 31 December 2020, there was no indirect holding of the Group's financial instruments (2019: \u00a30.1m).\n\n## Future contributions\n\nThe Group expects to contribute approximately \u00a3160m to its defined benefit schemes in 2021 (2020: \u00a3170m): UK: \u00a3100m, Overseas: \u00a360m (2019: UK: \u00a3100m, Overseas: \u00a370m).\n\nIn the UK, the funding is based on a statutory triennial funding valuation process. This includes a negotiation between the Group and the Trustee on actuarial assumptions used to value obligations (Technical Provisions) which may differ from those used for accounting set out above. The assumptions used to value Technical Provisions must be prudent rather than a best estimate of the liability. Most notably, the Technical Provision discount rate is currently based upon UK Government yields plus a margin (0.5% at the 31 March 2017 valuation) rather than being based on yields of AA corporate bonds. Following the triennial valuation process, a Schedule of Contributions (SoC) must be agreed which sets out the agreed rate of cash contributions and any contributions from the employer to eliminate a deficit. The most recent valuation, as at 31 March 2017, agreed by the Trustee in December 2017, showed that the UK scheme was estimated to be 112% funded on the Technical Provisions basis. Following the closure of the scheme to future accrual on 31 December 2020, no contributions will be made in respect of future accrual and there are no deficit reduction contributions. The 2021 contributions included above are in respect of 2020 accrual, payment of some of which was deferred in agreement with the Trustee as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The current SoC (amended in 2020) includes an arrangement for potential contributions during 2024 to 2027 (capped at \u00a348.3m a year) if the Technical Provisions funding position is below 107% at 31 March 2023. As at 31 December 2020 discussions on the 31 March 2020 triennial valuation were ongoing and the Technical Provisions funding position cannot be estimated until these discussions are concluded in the first half of 2021.",

        "page_content": "## 23  Post-retirement benefits continued\n\n## Sensitivities\n\nThe calculations of the defined benefit obligations are sensitive to the assumptions set out above. The following table summarises how the estimated impact of a change in a significant assumption would affect the UK defined benefit obligation at 31 December 2020, while holding all other assumptions constant. This sensitivity analysis may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligation as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated.\n\nFor the most significant funded schemes, the investment strategies hedge the risks from interest rates and inflation measured on a proxy solvency basis.\n\nFor  the  UK  scheme,  the  interest  rate  and  inflation  hedging  is  currently  based  on  UK  Government  bond  yields  without  any adjustment for any credit spread. The sensitivity analysis set out below have been determined based on a method that estimates the impact on the defined benefit obligation as a result of reasonable changes in key assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period.\n\n|                                                |                             | 2020 \u00a3m   | 2019 \u00a3m   |\n|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Reduction in the discount rate of 0.25%  1     | Obligation                  | (530)     | (495)     |\n|                                                | Plan assets (LDI portfolio) | 602       | 502       |\n| Increase in inflation of 0.25%  1              | Obligation                  | (290)     | (290)     |\n|                                                | Plan assets (LDI portfolio) | 267       | 235       |\n| Increase in real increase in salaries of 0.25% | Obligations                 | n/a       | (80)      |\n| Increase of 1% in transfer value assumption    | Obligations                 | (67)      | (64)      |\n| Increase of 5% of transfers instead of BPO     | Obligations                 | (45)      | n/a       |\n| One year increase in life expectancy           | Obligations                 | (455)     | (408)     |\n\n## 24  Share capital\n\n|                                                          | Non-equity          | Non-equity       | Equity                                | Equity           |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------|\n|                                                          | Special Share of \u00a31 | Nominal value \u00a3m | Ordinary  shares of 20p each Millions | Nominal value \u00a3m |\n| Issued and fully paid                                    |                     |                  |                                       |                  |\n| At 1 January 2019                                        | 1                   | -                | 1,896                                 | 379              |\n| Shares issued to employee share trust                    | -                   | -                | 6                                     | 1                |\n| Shares issued in relation to the acquisition of ITP Aero | -                   | -                | 29                                    | 6                |\n| At 31 December 2019                                      | 1                   | -                | 1,931                                 | 386              |\n| Shares issued on rights issue                            | -                   | -                | 6,437                                 | 1,288            |\n| At 31 December 2020                                      | 1                   | -                | 8,368                                 | 1,674            |\n\nThe rights attaching to each class of share are set out on page 208.\n\nIn accordance with IAS 32 Financial Instruments : Presentation , the Company's non-cumulative redeemable preference shares (C Shares) are classified as financial liabilities.

The closing price at 31 December 2020 was 111p (2019 adjusted: 234p). The number of shares and, where relevant, the exercise prices have been adjusted to reflect the impact of the rights issue which completed on 12 November 2020.\n\nThe weighted average remaining contractual life for the share options as at 31 December 2020 was two years (2019: one year).\n\n## Fair values of share-based payment plans\n\nThe weighted average fair value per share of equity-settled share-based payment plans granted during the year, estimated at the date of grant, are as follows:\n\n|                              | 2020   | 2019   |\n|------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| LTIP                         | 388p   | 851p   |\n| LTIP (ELT & Board)           | 354p   | 774p   |\n| ShareSave - three year grant | n/a    | 165p   |\n| ShareSave - five year grant  | n/a    | 176p   |\n| APRA                         | 490p   | 892p   |\n\n## LTIP\n\nThe fair value of shares awarded is calculated using a pricing model that takes account of the non-entitlement to dividends (or equivalent) during the vesting period and the market-based performance condition based on expectations about volatility and the correlation of share price returns in the group of FTSE 100 companies and which incorporates into the valuation the interdependency between share price performance and TSR vesting. This adjustment decreases the fair value of the award relative to the share price at the date of grant.\n\n## ShareSave\n\nThe fair value of the options granted is calculated using a pricing model that assumes that participants will exercise their options at the beginning of the six-month window if the share price is greater than the exercise price. Otherwise it assumes that options are held until the expiration of their contractual term. This results in an expected life that falls somewhere between the start and end of the exercise window.\n\n## APRA\n\nThe fair value of shares awarded under APRA is calculated as the share price on the date of the award, excluding expected dividends (or equivalent).\n\n## 26  Contingent liabilities\n\nContingent liabilities in respect of customer financing commitments are described in note 22.\n\nIn January 2017, after full cooperation, the Company concluded deferred prosecution agreements (DPA) with the SFO and the US Department of Justice (DoJ) and a leniency agreement with the MPF, the Brazilian federal prosecutors. Following the expiry of its term the DPA with the DoJ was dismissed by the US District Court on 19 May 2020. Certain authorities are investigating members of the Group for matters relating to misconduct in relation to historical matters. The Group is responding appropriately. Action may be taken by further authorities against the Company or individuals. In addition, the Group could still be affected by actions from customers and customers' financiers. The Directors are not currently aware of any matters that are likely to lead to a material financial loss over and above the penalties imposed to date, but cannot anticipate all the possible actions that may be taken or their potential consequences.",

The Group has, in the normal course of business, entered into arrangements in respect of export finance, performance bonds, countertrade obligations and minor miscellaneous items. Various Group undertakings are parties to legal actions and claims which arise in the ordinary course of business, some of which are for substantial amounts. As a consequence of the insolvency of an insurer as previously reported, the Group is no longer fully insured against known and potential claims from employees who worked for certain of the Group's UK based businesses for a period prior to the acquisition of those businesses by the Group. While the outcome of some of these matters cannot precisely be foreseen, the Directors do not expect any of these arrangements, legal actions or claims, after allowing for provisions already made, to result in significant loss to the Group.\n\nThe Group's share of equity accounted entities' contingent liabilities is nil (2019: nil).\n\n## 27  Related party transactions\n\n|                                                                      | 2020 \u00a3m   | 2019 \u00a3m   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Sales of goods and services to joint ventures and associates \u00b9       | 3,760     | 3,776     |\n| Purchases of goods and services from joint ventures and associates \u00b9 | (4,288)   | (3,685)   |\n| Lease payments to joint ventures and associates                      | (226)     | (210)     |\n| Guarantees of joint arrangements' and associates' borrowings         | 3         | 1         |\n| Guarantees of non-wholly owned subsidiaries' borrowings              | 3         | 3         |\n| Dividends received from joint ventures and associates                | 60        | 92        |\n| Other income received from joint ventures and associates             | 3         | 1         |\n\nIncluded in sales of goods and services to joint ventures and associates are sales of spare engines amounting to \u00a3102m (2019: \u00a3277m).

On an underlying basis (at actual achieved rates on settled derivative transactions), the amounts were \u00a390m (2019: \u00a378m). Cash receipts relating to the sale of spare engines amounted to \u00a3193m (2019: \u00a3414m).\n\nThe aggregated balances with joint ventures are shown in notes 15 and 20.

A further \u20ac2m is payable in September 2021 and \u20ac3m in September 2023. Under the sale agreement, the cash consideration may be adjusted up by \u20ac3m to \u20ac18m based on a revenue target being achieved by 31 December 2023. In accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations the pre-acquisition shareholding of 24% has been re-measured to fair value of \u20ac5m and a revaluation gain of \u20ac2m has been recognised in the income statement.\n\nOn the 7 March 2020, the Group signed an agreement to acquire 100% of the shares of Kinolt Group S.A., a Belgian company which designs and manufactures uninterruptible power supply systems. The transaction was completed on 1 July 2020 for net proceeds of \u20ac115m. The acquisition of Kinolt Group S.A. completes the Group's power supply product offering, accelerates its strategy of offering integrated solutions and enables the Group to strengthen its market position in safety critical applications with a leader in dynamic uninterruptible power supply. Fair values are determined on the basis of an assessment performed by an independent professional expert, using measurement techniques and estimation of future cash flows to assess the values of identifiable assets and liabilities at the date of acquisition. The total fair value of acquired identifiable assets and liabilities was \u20ac65m, primarily related to technology and customer relationships. Goodwill of \u20ac50m was recognised on acquisition in relation to workforce, future products, synergies and access to new customers and markets.\n\nOn 18 May 2020, the Group entered into an agreement to increase its shareholding in Reaction Engines Ltd from 2.0% to 10.1% for a cash consideration of \u00a320m. The consideration is payable (and the associated shares acquired) in four instalments that will be made between July 2020 and January 2022. Reaction Engines is accounted for as an investment.",

The Group has performed a final assessment to determine the fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired in accordance with IFRS 3 and has identified intangible assets amounting to \u00a35m and \u00a3(4)m of other assets and liabilities. Goodwill of \u00a34m was recognised on acquisition in relation to workforce and synergies.\n\n## Recognised amounts of assets acquired and liabilities assumed\n\n|                                           | Qinous \u00a3m   | Kinolt \u00a3m   | Servowatch \u00a3m   | Total \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|------------|\n| Intangible assets                         | 14          | 61          | 5               | 80         |\n| Property, plant and equipment             | -           | 17          | -               | 17         |\n| Right-of-use assets                       | -           | 1           | -               | 1          |\n| Inventory                                 | 3           | 42          | 1               | 46         |\n| Trade receivables and other assets        | 1           | 17          | 1               | 19         |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                 | -           | 11          | -               | 11         |\n| Trade and other payables                  | (5)         | (47)        | (5)             | (57)       |\n| Provisions                                | -           | (4)         | -               | (4)        |\n| Borrowings and lease liabilities          | -           | (24)        | -               | (24)       |\n| Deferred tax                              | (3)         | (16)        | (1)             | (20)       |\n| Total identifiable assets and liabilities | 10          | 58          | 1               | 69         |\n| Goodwill arising                          | 7           | 46          | 4               | 57         |\n| Total consideration                       | 17          | 104         | 5               | 126        |\n| Consideration satisfied by:               |             |             |                 |            |\n| Existing shareholding                     | 4           | -           | -               | 4          |\n| Cash                                      | 8           | 104         | 5               | 117        |\n| Deferred consideration                    | 5           | -           | -               | 5          |\n|                                           | 17          | 104         | 5               | 126        |\n| Net cash outflow arising on acquisition:  |             |             |                 |            |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                 | 8           | 104         | 5               | 117        |\n| Less: Cash and cash equivalents acquired  | -           | (11)        | -               | (11)       |\n|                                           | 8           | 93          | 5               | 106        |\n| Identifiable intangible assets comprise:  |             |             |                 |            |\n| Customer relationships                    | -           | 37          | 4               | 41         |\n| Technology assets                         | 14          | 22          | -               | 36         |\n| Development expenditure                   | -           | 2           | 1               | 3          |\n|                                           | 14          | 61          | 5               | 80         |\n\nThe gross contractual value of trade receivables acquired was \u00a315m. At the acquisition dates, it was estimated that contractual cash flows of \u00a31m would not be collected.\n\nThe acquisitions of Qinous and Kinolt contributed \u00a35m and \u00a350m to revenue respectively and Qinous contributed \u00a3(10)m to loss before tax (including amortisation of the acquisition accounting adjustments) for the period between the date of acquisition and the 31 December 2020. If the acquisitions had been completed on 1 January 2020, the contribution to the Group's revenues and loss before tax due to Qinous would have been \u00a35m and \u00a3(10)m respectively and due to Kinolt would have been \u00a368m and \u00a3(4)m respectively.\n\nTransaction costs of \u00a33m have been expensed during the year relating to the acquisitions of Qinous, Kinolt and Servowatch.\n\n## Disposals\n\nOn the 31 January 2020, the Group completed the sale of its North America Civil Nuclear (NACN) business to Westinghouse Electric Company LLC. for $25m. The business was disclosed as a disposal group held for sale at 31 December 2019. In the 2019 financial statements, the Group reported an impairment charge of \u00a325m as a result of the decision to classify NACN as a business held for sale. Upon the disposal of NACN on 31 January 2020, and in accordance with IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates , the Group has recycled the cumulative currency translation reserve through the income statement in 2020. This has resulted in a cumulative currency translation loss of \u00a37m.\n\nOn the 3 February 2020, the Group sold its Knowledge Management Systems (KMS) business to Valsoft Corp. for a cash consideration of $3m. Upon the disposal of KMS, and in accordance with IAS 21 the Group has recycled the cumulative currency translation reserve through the income statement in 2020. This has resulted in a cumulative currency translation gain of \u00a33m.\n\nOn the 7 May 2020, the Group sold Trigno Energy Srl (Trigno) to Pilkington Italia S.p.A. for a cash consideration of \u20ac6m. Upon the disposal of Trigno, and in accordance with IAS 21 the Group has recycled the cumulative currency translation reserve through the income statement in 2020. This has resulted in a cumulative currency translation gain of \u00a31m.",

Under the sale agreement, the cash consideration may be adjusted by up to +/-\u20ac44m, based on L'Orange aftermarket sales over the five-year period to 31 May 2023. This is reviewed at each reporting date over the adjustment period, based on actual sales. During the year, a liability of \u20ac29m has been recognised for amounts that are now expected to be payable in relation to the years 2020-2023 as a result of a reduction in aftermarket sales as a consequence of the impact of COVID-19. This \u20ac29m liability has been reflected as an adjustment to sales proceeds. Cash consideration has been adjusted by \u00a35m which has been paid during the year.\n\n| Reconciliation of loss on acquisition & disposal of businesses per the income statement   | \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|\n| Profit on disposal of businesses                                                          | 10   |\n| Gain on revaluation of Qinous                                                             | 1    |\n| Adjustment to L'Orange sales proceeds                                                     | (25) |\n| Loss on acquisition & disposal of businesses (income statement - non-underlying)          | (14) |\n\n## Businesses held for sale\n\nOn 28 February 2020, the Group announced the decision to carry out a strategic review of Bergen, our medium-speed gas and diesel engine business. Bergen formed part of the Power Systems business and from 2020 it has been reclassified as non-core following the announcement of the strategic review. On 1 February 2021, the Group signed an agreement for the sale of Bergen to TMH Group for a cash consideration of approximately \u20ac150m (subject to closing adjustments) which is expected to complete in the second half of 2021. Consequently, in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, Bergen has been classified as held for sale at 31 December 2020. As at 31 December 2020, Bergen had an additional \u00a325m of cash which, as part of bank pooling arrangements, was held by another Group company and consequently is not included in the disposal group as the resulting intra-group balances are eliminated on consolidation. On completion, such cash will be included in the disposal group.\n\nOn 7 December 2020, the Group signed an agreement for the sale of Civil Nuclear Instrumentation & Control business to Framatome. Consequently, in accordance with IFRS 5, the business has been classified as held for sale at 31 December 2020 and its carrying value assessed against the anticipated proceeds and disposal costs.\n\nThe table below summarises the categories of assets and liabilities classified as held for sale:\n\n|                                                  | Bergen \u00a3m   | Civil Nuclear \u00a3m   | Total \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|-------------|--------------------|------------|\n| Intangible assets                                | -           | 16                 | 16         |\n| Property, plant and equipment                    | 3           | 4                  | 7          |\n| Right-of-use assets                              | 2           | 7                  | 9          |\n| Deferred tax assets                              | 2           | 4                  | 6          |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                        | 25          | 26                 | 51         |\n| Inventory                                        | 97          | 14                 | 111        |\n| Trade receivables and other assets               | 50          | 38                 | 88         |\n| Assets held for sale                             | 179         | 109                | 288        |\n| Trade payables and other liabilities             | (100)       | (84)               | (184)      |\n| Provisions for liabilities and charges           | (11)        | (7)                | (18)       |\n| Borrowings and lease liabilities                 | (4)         | (7)                | (11)       |\n| Deferred tax liabilities                         | (2)         | -                  | (2)        |\n| Post-retirement scheme deficits                  | -           | (13)               | (13)       |\n| Liabilities associated with assets held for sale | (117)       | (111)              | (228)      |\n| Net assets held for sale                         | 62          | (2)                | 60         |\n\nDuring the year, the Group announced its intention to sell ITP Aero. At 31 December 2020, ITP Aero was not available for immediate sale in its present condition and therefore, in line with IFRS 5 has not been classified as a disposal group. The assets of ITP Aero have been assessed for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 on a value in use basis which assumes the value will be realised over the long-term.",

There is no change to trading or group free cash flow. In summary: (i) cash flows on financial instruments net of realised losses included in operating profit previously included in other within trading cash flow, have been shown separately; (ii) differences in fair values of derivative contracts held for financing previously included in other below free cash flow have been shown separately; and (iii) foreign exchange transactions have been re-presented within line items to be consistent with presentation throughout the financial statements.\n\nFree cash flow is a measure of financial performance of the Group's cash flow to see what is available for distribution among those stakeholders funding the Group (including debt holders and shareholders). Free cash flow is the movement in net debt from cash flows excluding: transactions with ordinary shareholders; M&A activity; financial penalties paid; exceptional restructuring payments; and the capital element of lease payments. The Board considers that free cash flow reflects cash generated from the Group's underlying trading.\n\nThe table below shows a reconciliation of free cash flow to the change in cash and cash equivalents presented in the condensed consolidated cash flow statement on page 109.\n\n|                                                                              | 2020    | 2020     | 2019 \u00a3m Source   | 2019 \u00a3m Source   |                                                                                                                                                       |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|----------|------------------|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                                              | \u00a3m      | \u00a3m       | \u00a3m               |                  |                                                                                                                                                       |\n| Change in cash and cash equivalents                                          | (995)   |          | (413)            |                  | CFS                                                                                                                                                   |\n| Net cash flow from changes in borrowings and lease liabilities               | (1,630) |          | 1,385            |                  | CFS excluding repayment of debt acquired.

Further guidance is given in the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales technical release 02/17BL in relation to what profits can be treated as distributable. At 31 December 2020, all the Company's retained earnings are distributable, however, the available amount may be different at the point any future distributions are made.\n- 4 On 12 November 2020, the Company completed a rights issue to existing shareholders on the basis of ten ordinary shares for every three fully paid ordinary shares held. As a result, 6,436,601,676 ordinary shares with an aggregate nominal value of \u00a31,288m were issued for cash consideration of \u00a32,060m. Transaction costs of \u00a379m were incurred and deducted from share premium.\n- 5 At 31 December 2020, 39,866,717 ordinary shares with a net book value of \u00a389m (2019:12,476,576 ordinary shares with a net book value of \u00a3108m) were held for the purpose of share-based payment plans and included in accumulated losses. During the year, 3,458,865 ordinary shares with a net book value of \u00a329m (2019: 8,984,219 ordinary shares with a net book value of \u00a382m) vested in share-based payment plans. During the year, the Company acquired 85,724 (2019: 118,831) of its ordinary shares via reinvestment of dividends received on its own shares and purchased 30,763,282 (2019: 1,673,143) of its ordinary shares through purchases on the London Stock Exchange. During the year, the Company issued no new ordinary shares (2019: 7,803,043) to the Group's share trust for its employee share-based payment plans with a net book value of nil (2019: \u00a366m).",

        "page_content": "## 1  Accounting policies\n\n## Basis of accounting\n\nRolls-Royce Holdings plc (the Company) is a public company limited by shares incorporated and domiciled in England in the United Kingdom. These Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework on the historical cost basis.\n\nThese financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. Further details are given in the Going Concern Statement on pages 52 to 54. After due consideration the Directors consider that the Group has sufficient liquidity headroom to continue in operational existence for a period of at least eighteen months from the date of this report and there are no material uncertainties that may cast doubt on the Company's going concern status, accordingly they are satisfied that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the Company Financial Statements.\n\nIn accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and EU regulations, the Company Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and international financial reporting standards adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the EU.\n\nIn these Financial Statements the Company has applied the exemptions available under FRS 101 in respect of the following disclosures:\n\n- - a cash flow statement and related notes;\n- - comparative period reconciliations for share capital;\n- - the effects of new, but not yet effective accounting standards; and\n- - the requirements of IAS 24 Related Party Transactions and has, therefore, not disclosed transactions between the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.\n\nThe accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these Financial Statements.\n\nThere were no changes to accounting standards that had a material impact on these Financial Statements.\n\nThe Company's Financial Statements are presented in sterling, which is the Company's functional currency.\n\nAs permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, a separate income statement for the Company has not been included in these Financial Statements. As permitted by the audit fee disclosure regulations, disclosure of non-audit fees information is not included in respect of the Company.\n\n## Key areas of judgement and sources of estimation uncertainty\n\nThe carrying value of the investment in subsidiary undertakings is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis. The recoverable amount is determined based on value in use which requires the determination of appropriate assumptions (which are sources of estimation uncertainty) in relation to the cash flow forecasts (including the impact of climate change), the long-term growth rate to be applied and the risk-adjusted discount rate used to discount the estimated cash flows to present value.\n\nEstimation uncertainty arises due to changing economic and market factors, most particularly as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The recoverable amount of the investments in Rolls-Royce Group Limited and Rolls-Royce plc of \u00a314.7bn has been assessed for impairment based on a value in use calculation using cash flow projections from the Group's latest forecasts which have regard to the current market and the Group's views on the future achievable growth. Discount rates used reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the rate of return a market participant would require. The rate used to discount the forecast cash flows reflect the individual businesses in the Group and is 9% post-tax. The Directors have determined that no impairment charge is required. An increase in the rate from 9% to 10% would cause the carrying amount of the Company's investment to equal its recoverable amount. This sensitivity does not assign value to the new programmes that the Company expects to bring to market as part of its sustainability initiatives.\n\n## Significant accounting policies\n\nThe Company's significant accounting policies are set out below. These accounting policies have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these Financial Statements.\n\n## Investments in subsidiary undertakings\n\nInvestments included in fixed assets are investments in subsidiary companies. These are held at historical cost and are considered for impairment annually by the Directors.\n\n## Trade receivables\n\nTrade receivables are recognised initially at the transaction price. They are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment. A provision for the impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Company will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. The Company applies the IFRS 9 Financial Instruments simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses which uses a lifetime expected loss allowance for all trade receivables.\n\n## Trade payables\n\nTrade payables are recognised initially at the transaction price and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\n\n## Equity\n\nOrdinary shares are classified as equity. Equity instruments are measured at the fair value of the cash or other resources received or receivable, net of the direct costs of issuing the equity instruments.",

        "page_content": "## 1  Accounting policies continued\n\n## Share-based payments\n\nAs described in the Directors' Remuneration Report on pages 81 to 100, the Company grants awards of its own shares to employees of its subsidiary undertakings (see note 25 of the Consolidated Financial Statements). The costs of share-based payments in respect of these awards are accounted for, by the Company, as an additional investment in its subsidiary undertakings. The costs are determined in accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based Payment . Any payments made by the subsidiary undertakings in respect of these arrangements are treated as a return of this investment.\n\n## Financial instruments\n\nIn accordance with IAS 32 Financial Instruments : Presentation , the Company's C Shares are classified as financial liabilities and held at amortised cost from the date of issue until redeemed.\n\n## Costs of share issues\n\nThe cost of issuing ordinary shares are charged to the share premium account.\n\n## 2  Investments - subsidiary undertakings\n\n|                                                                                                                                                | \u00a3m     |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Cost:                                                                                                                                          |        |\n| At 1 January 2020                                                                                                                              | 12,801 |\n| Additions  1                                                                                                                                   | 1,860  |\n| Cost of share-based payments in respect of employees of subsidiary undertakings less receipts from subsidiaries   in respect of those payments | 27     |\n| At 31 December 2020                                                                                                                            | 14,688 |\n\nDetails of the Company's subsidiary undertakings and joint venture and associates undertakings are listed on pages 183 and 189.\n\n## Assessment of carrying value of investments in subsidiary undertakings\n\nThe carrying value of the Company's investments in subsidiary undertakings has been tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets . The carrying value is compared to the asset's recoverable amount and has been assessed by reference to value in use. The value in use has been calculated based upon a discounted cash flow methodology using the most recent forecasts prepared by management of the Rolls-Royce Holdings plc group. These forecasts:\n\n- - are consistent with past experience and external sources on market conditions;\n- - cover the next five years for the Power Systems, Defence and Central businesses together with a terminal value. Cash flows are assumed to grow at 2.0% which is based on inflation forecasts by recognised bodies;\n- - utilise long-term cash flow forecasts for the Civil and ITP Aero businesses to reflect the best estimate of the impact and subsequent recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, together with the estimated cash flows from its significant growth programmes such as the Trent XWB and Trent 7000. These forecasts extend to 2035 after which a negative growth rate is applied to reflect the remaining flows to the end of our current product portfolio;\n- - reflect estimation uncertainty through the use of a probability weighted downside scenario for the Civil business where the uncertainty is most significant. The assumptions are consistent with those set out in the Going Concern Statement on pages 52 to 54. The weighting applied is 75% to a base case and 25% to a downside scenario;\n- - include ongoing capital expenditure required to maintain the current programmes but excludes any growth from the new programmes that the Company expects to bring to market as part of its sustainability initiatives.\n\nThe key assumptions for the value in use calculation are assumed market share, programme timings, unit cost assumptions, discount rates and foreign exchange. Management estimates discount rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the rate of return a market participant would require. The rate used to discount the forecast cash flows reflects the individual businesses in the Group and is c.9% post-tax. As a result of this analysis, the Directors have determined that no impairment charge is required.\n\nAn increase in the post-tax discount rate from 9% to 10% would cause the carrying amount of the Company's investment to equal its recoverable amount. This sensitivity does not assign value to the new programmes that the Company expects to bring to market as part of its sustainability initiatives. As a stress test, the potential impact of the full downside scenario (referred to above) occurring has also been evaluated. It is estimated that this would result in an impairment of the investment in subsidiary undertakings of around \u00a30.5bn.",

        "page_content": "## 7  Reconciliation of net assets between Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Group and Company\n\nAs at 31 December 2020, Rolls-Royce Holdings plc consolidated group had net liabilities of \u00a34.9bn (2019: \u00a33.4bn) compared to \u00a314.3bn (2019: \u00a312.4bn) of net assets of the Company. The Company is a holding company and does not trade in its own right. The Company was incorporated in 2011 and became the Rolls-Royce holding company through a Scheme of Arrangement. On becoming the Rolls-Royce holding company, the value of the Company's investment in subsidiaries was based on the market capitalisation of the Rolls-Royce group at that time. There was an increase in the investment as a result of a capital injection to Rolls-Royce Group Limited during the year. As set out in note 2, management has assessed the recoverable amount of the Company's investment in subsidiaries, which supports the carrying value of those investments. The Group's consolidated financial statements are prepared on a historical cost basis except where IFRS requires a valuation basis to be applied (see page 114 for further details). As different principles are applied in preparing the Company and consolidated group balance sheets there is a difference in the financial position reported. Examples of such differences include the following items that are in the Consolidated balance sheet but not reflected in the Company's balance sheet: liabilities of \u00a38,922m as a result of adopting IFRS 15 in 2017; and financial liabilities of \u00a32,871m arising from the recognition at fair value of foreign exchange derivatives held to manage exposure on the Group's future trading.\n\n## 8  Contingent liabilities & commitments\n\nWhere the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements, and accounts for them as such. In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.\n\nAt 31 December 2020, these guarantees amounted to \u00a310,522m (2019: \u00a35,585m) of which total drawn amounted to \u00a35,022m (2019: \u00a33,085m).\n\n## 9  Other information\n\n## Employees\n\nThe Company had no employees in 2020 (2019: none).\n\n## Share-based payments\n\nShares in the Company have been granted to employees of the Group as part of share-based payment plans, and are charged in the employing company.\n\n## Emoluments of Directors\n\nThe remuneration of the Directors of the Company is shown below, further information is in the Directors' Remuneration Report on pages 81 to 100.\n\n2020\n\n2019\n\n|                             | Highest paid director \u00a3000   | Other directors \u00a3000   | Total \u00a3000   | Highest paid director \u00a3000   | Other directors \u00a3000   | Total \u00a3000   |\n|-----------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------|--------------|------------------------------|------------------------|--------------|\n| Remuneration                | 1,110                        | 1,946                  | 3,056        | 2,080                        | 2,754                  | 4,834        |\n| Gains made on share options | 530                          | 318                    | 848          | 1,079                        | 714                    | 1,793        |\n|                             | 1,640                        | 2,264                  | 3,904        | 3,159                        | 3,468                  | 6,627        |\n\nNo Director accrued any retirement benefits in the year (2019: none).",

Our responsibilities under ISAs (UK) are further described in the Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe remained independent of the group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, which includes the FRC's Ethical Standard, as applicable to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge and belief, we declare that non-audit services prohibited by the FRC's Ethical Standard were not provided to the group.\n\nOther than those disclosed in note 7 to the financial statements, we have provided no non-audit services to the group in the period under audit.\n\n## Our audit approach\n\n## Overview\n\n## Audit scope\n\n- - Overall group materiality: \u00a370m, based on 0.5% of the three year average of underlying revenue (2019: \u00a375m, based on 0.5% of underlying revenue).\n- - Overall company materiality: \u00a3147m (2019: \u00a3126m), based on 1.0% of total assets. This exceeds group materiality as it is determined on a different basis given the nature of the company's operations. For the purposes of the audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements, our procedures on the company's balances and transactions that do not eliminate on consolidation were undertaken with reference to group materiality.",

In addition eight components performed targeted specified procedures.\n- - In addition, the group engagement team audited the company and other centralised functions including those covering the group treasury operations, corporate costs, corporate taxation, post-retirement benefits, certain goodwill and intangible asset impairment assessments. The group engagement team performed audit procedures over the group consolidation and financial statements disclosures and performed group level analytical procedures over out of scope components.\n- - The components on which full scope audits, targeted specified procedures and centralised work was performed accounted for 93% of revenue, 89% of loss before tax and 90% of total assets.\n- - Central audit testing was performed where appropriate for reporting components in group audit scope who are supported by the group's Finance Service Centres (FSCs).\n- - As part of the supervision process, the group engagement team has performed 13 virtual file reviews, which included meetings on approach and conclusions with the component teams and review of their audit files and final deliverables.\n\n## Key audit matters\n\n- - Long-term contract accounting and associated provisions (group)\n- - Deferred tax asset recognition and recoverability (group)\n- - Translation of foreign-currency denominated transactions and balances (group)\n- - Presentation and accuracy of underlying results and disclosure of other one-off items (including exceptional items) (group)\n- - Recoverability of accounts receivable and contract assets (group)\n- - Recoverability of intangible programme assets (group)\n- - Ability of the group and company to continue as a going concern (group and company)\n- - Recoverability of the company's investment in subsidiary undertakings (company)\n- - Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic (group and company).\n\n## Materiality\n\n- - Overall group materiality: \u00a370m (2019: \u00a375m) based on 0.5% of three year average underlying revenues.\n- - Overall company materiality: \u00a3147m (2019: \u00a3126m) based on 1% of total assets.\n- - Performance materiality: \u00a353m (group) and \u00a3110m (company).\n\n## The scope of our audit\n\nAs part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements.\n\n## Capability of the audit in detecting irregularities, including fraud\n\nIrregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined in the Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud, is detailed below.\n\nBased on our understanding of the group and industry, we identified that the principal risks of non-compliance with laws and regulations related to the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Listing Rules of the UK Financial Conduct Authority, applicable Generally Accepted Accounting Practices, tax compliance legislation, the regulations of country aviation authorities such as the Civil Aviation Authority, import and export restrictions (including International Traffic in Arms Regulations), and the UK Bribery Act, and we considered the extent to which non-compliance might have a material effect on the financial statements. We also considered those laws and regulations that have a direct impact on the preparation of the financial statements such as the Companies Act 2006. We evaluated management's incentives and opportunities for fraudulent manipulation of the financial statements (including the risk of override of controls), and determined that the principal risks were related to: (1) posting inappropriate journal entries to manipulate financial results; (2) management bias in accounting estimates such as long-term contract accounting and associated provisions, the recoverability of intangible programme assets, and deferred tax asset recognition; (3) the sale of engines to joint ventures for no clear commercial purpose or above market prices; and (4) inappropriately including or excluding transactions from the group's underlying or free cash flow alternative performance metrics. The group engagement team shared this risk assessment with the component auditors so that they could include appropriate audit procedures in response to such risks in their work. Audit procedures performed by the group engagement team and/or component auditors included:\n\n- - Discussions throughout the year with management, internal audit, the group's internal and external legal counsel, and the head of ethics and compliance, including consideration of known or suspected instances of non-compliance with laws and regulation and fraud;\n- - Reading the minutes of the group's Safety, Ethics & Sustainability committee and assessment of 'speak-up' matters reported through the group's Ethics Line and the results of management's investigation of such matters;",

        "page_content": "- - Challenging assumptions and judgements made by management in determining significant accounting estimates (because of the risk of management bias), in particular in relation to long-term contract accounting and associated provisions, the recoverability of programme assets, and the recognition and recoverability of deferred tax assets (see related key audit matters below);\n- - Understanding and evaluating changes in processes and controls as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n- - Identifying and testing unusual journal entries, in particular journal entries posted with unusual account combinations, and testing all material consolidation journals; and .\n- - Challenging why certain items are excluded or included from underlying profit or free cash flow and review of disclosures included in the Annual Report explaining and reconciling alternative performance measures to statutory metrics.\n\nThere are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above. We are less likely to become aware of instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations that are not closely related to events and transactions reflected in the financial statements. Also, the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion.\n\n## Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors' professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by the auditors, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures thereon, were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\nThis is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.\n\nWe have presented the key audit matters and the other risks subject to audit focus in the chart and table below excluding items from last year that are no longer key audit matters or other audit risks for the 2020 audit. This is based on our risk assessment at the start of the audit cycle used to plan our audit approach. Recoverability of intangible programme assets, recoverability of accounts receivable and contract assets and the ability of the group and company to continue as a going concern are new key audit matters this year. The implementation of IFRS 16: Leases and response to deferred prosecution and leniency agreements in connection with alleged bribery and corruption in overseas markets, which were key audit matters last year, are no longer included because of the fact that the risk associated with IFRS 16 was in relation to 2019 being the first year of adoption of this accounting standard. We now consider the risks associated with IFRS 16 to be normal. The potential exposures to known uncertain tax positions have reduced and accordingly we now consider this as a normal risk. During 2020, the deferred prosecution agreement reached with the Department of Justice expired and was dismissed and the formal reporting obligations for the UK deferred prosecution agreement came to an end. Given this and the positive evolution in the group's compliance environment, we did not assess there to be a heightened risk. Otherwise, the key audit matters below are consistent with last year.\n\nOur risk assessment at the start of the audit cycle used to plan our audit approach\n\n| Risks                       |                                                                                                                     | Change  from   prior year   |\n|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Key audit matters - group   | Key audit matters - group                                                                                           | Key audit matters - group   |\n| 1                           | Long-term contract accounting and associated provisions                                                             |                             |\n| 2                           | Deferred tax asset recognition and recoverability                                                                   |                             |\n| 3                           | Presentation of accuracy of underlying results and disclosure  of other one-off items (including exceptional items) |                             |\n| 4                           | Translation of foreign currency denominated transactions  and balances                                              |                             |\n| 5                           | Recoverability of intangible programme assets                                                                       |                             |\n| 6                           | Recoverability of accounts receivable and contract assets                                                           | new                         |\n| 7                           | Ability of group and company to continue as a going concern                                                         | new                         |\n| Other audit risks - group   | Other audit risks - group                                                                                           |                             |\n| 8                           | Accounting for complex treasury instruments                                                                         |                             |\n| 9                           | Measurement of post-retirement benefits                                                                             |                             |\n| 1 0                         | Consolidation process and joint venture accounting                                                                  |                             |\n| Key audit matters - company | Key audit matters - company                                                                                         | Key audit matters - company |\n| 11                          | Recoverability of the company's investments  in subsidiary undertakings                                             |                             |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe impact of COVID-19 is also reported as a key audit matter as it impacted a number of the risks noted above and other areas of our audit.",

In addition, changes to the operating condition of engines such as changes in route structure can result in different performance assumptions and hence cost profiles which impact the expected profitability of a contract.\n\nFor Defence, long term contracts tend to be for a fixed price or based on a cost plus or target cost reimbursement for qualifying costs and there are also some flying hours arrangements. For Civil Aerospace aftermarket contracts, cash is earned based on engine flying hours, which requires management to estimate future engine flying hours in order to arrive at the total income expected over the life of a contract. As a result of COVID-19, engine flying hours have reduced significantly in 2020. Slow and gradual recovery in engine flying hours is expected which will impact forecast income on aftermarket contracts in the short and medium term. There is much estimation uncertainty over the speed and shape of the recovery in flying hours. An adjustment of \u00a31,061m was recognised in the year, reversing revenue recognised in previous periods largely because of lower engine flying hour forecasts.\n\nIn  addition,  the  profitability  of  aftermarket  contracts  typically assumes that there will be significant cost improvements over the lifetime (15-25 years) of the contracts. Significant judgement needs to be applied in determining time-on-wing, whether incremental costs should be treated as wastage or are part of the ongoing cost of servicing a contract, future exchange rates used to translate foreign currency income and costs and other operating parameters used to calculate the projected life cycle. These future costs are also risk adjusted to take into account forecasting accuracy which represents an additional judgement.\n\nThe expected costs from in-service issues on the Trent 1000 programme have decreased in the year resulting in the release of \u00a3560m of  the  associated  provision.  This  is  largely  driven  by  lower  than expected  customer  disruption  costs  from  the  in-service  issues because of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in reducing the number of aircraft on ground as a result of in-service issues. The assessment of the total cost of delivering this programme, the cost of the proposed engineering solutions, changes in the shop visit profile, speed of implementation of design, manufacture and installation of improved parts and the level of customer disruption which was not expected at the inception of the contract are all significant judgements which impact the value and timing of revenue and profit recognition. In addition, certain contracts may become onerous as a result and require immediate recognition of the loss.\n\nWe focused our work on a number of contracts where we consider there to be the highest degree of management judgement or estimation and designed specific procedures over the long-term contract accounting targeted at the associated risks. We also sample tested the remaining population of contracts. This approach was applied in the Civil Aerospace and Defence businesses and was substantive in nature. The audit procedures performed included:\n\n- - We attended meetings with Civil Aerospace and Defence engine programme and customer contract managers in order to understand the operational matters impacting the performance of specific contracts and any amendments to contractual arrangements required by changes to underlying expectations of performance;\n- - We obtained and read the relevant sections of a sample of contracts to understand the key terms including performance obligations and pricing structures;\n- - We assessed how management had forecast the speed and shape of the recovery of engine flying hours including by considering the downside scenarios modelled and comparing the assumptions to industry data;\n- - We challenged management's judgments and associated risk adjustments relating to the risk of customer default and insolvency, the risk of airlines parking more mature aircraft as a result of COVID-19 and the ability for contractual protection clauses to be enforced across the customer portfolio;\n- - We re-performed the calculations used to determine the degree of completion for a sample of contracts and this was also used in assessing the magnitude of any catch-up adjustments;\n- - We compared the previously forecast results of a sample of contracts with the actual results to assess the performance of the contract and the historical accuracy of forecasting;\n- - We verified a sample of costs incurred to third party documentation in order to assess the validity of the forecast costs to complete;\n- - We challenged management's judgement around whether incremental contract costs arising from in-service issues should be accounted for over the expected duration of the underlying contract or recognised immediately;\n- - Where the disruption has resulted in payments to customers we have validated the settlement to contractual agreements, considered the terms of previous settlements, correspondence with customers, the forecast period of further aircraft being on the ground and the completeness of the liability;\n- - We assessed the assumptions relating to life cycle cost reductions to determine the likelihood of realisation and where relevant the speed at which they would be achieved, including the impact on the number of shop visits, validating these assumptions directly with the senior programme engineers;\n- - We obtained support for the risk adjustments made in respect of future costs and challenged management's assumptions through assessment against historical performance, known technical issues and the stage of completion of the programme;\n- - We challenged the assessment of provisions for loss making or onerous contracts to determine the completeness of the unavoidable costs to fulfil the contractual obligations;",

        "page_content": "## Key audit matter\n\n## How our audit addressed the key audit matter\n\n## Long-term contract accounting and associated provisions continued\n\nAt the development stage of a programme, agreements are entered into with certain Civil suppliers to share in the risk and rewards of the contracts (Risk and Revenue Sharing Partners - 'RRSP'). This can involve upfront participation fees from the RRSP that are amortised over the engine production phase. In addition, specified revenue and costs are recorded in the Consolidated Income Statement net of the RRSP's share.\n\nThe nature of the Civil Aerospace business gives rise to a number of contractual  guarantees,  warranties  and  potential  claims.  The accounting for these can be complex and judgemental and may impact the Consolidated Income Statement immediately or over the life of the contract. The valuation of provisions for the associated amounts may be judgemental and needs to be considered on a contract by contract basis.\n\n## Deferred tax asset recognition and recoverability\n\n(relevant to the Consolidated Financial Statements)\n\nPage 78 (Audit Committee report), page 118 (note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements - Accounting policies - Taxation), and pages 134 to 137 (note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements - Taxation)\n\nThe recognition and recoverability of deferred tax assets in Rolls-Royce plc is a significant judgement. Rolls-Royce plc has recognised significant deferred tax assets on the basis of expected future levels of profitability. The magnitude of the assets recognised necessitates the need for significant judgement in assessing the future levels of profitability in the UK over an extended period.\n\nThe additional loss reported for 2020, along with the existence of tax losses brought forward and other deductible temporary differences in Rolls-Royce plc, combined with the impact of COVID 19 and climate change on future forecasts, presents a heightened risk that deferred tax assets previously recognised may not be recoverable. Further there is an inherent increased level of uncertainty in the future level of forecast profits.\n\n- - We assessed the sensitivity of the Trent 1000 provision to reasonable changes in estimates, particularly in respect of the repair and overhaul facility capacity, technical cost creep on the known issues and cost outturns against previous provisions, in determining whether the provision was sufficient;\n- - We read and understood the key terms of a sample of RRSP contracts to assess whether revenue and costs had been appropriately reflected, net of the share attributable to the RRSP in the Consolidated Income Statement;\n- - We considered whether there were any indicators of management override of controls or bias in arriving at their reported position; and\n- - We also assessed the adequacy of disclosures in note 1 of the key judgements and estimates involved in long-term contract accounting.\n\nMisstatements identified from our work were largely corrected by management leaving an immaterial uncorrected position. Overall we concluded that the key estimates and judgements used by management for long-term contract accounting were supportable and no material exceptions arose from our work.\n\nWe evaluated management's methodology for assessing the recognition and recoverability of deferred tax assets, including the ability to offset certain deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets. Where recognition is supported by the availability of sufficient probable taxable profits in future periods against which the asset can be utilised in future periods, our evaluation of these future profits considered both the business model and the tax jurisdiction.\n\nWe  assessed  the  future  profit  forecasts  and  the  underpinning assumptions including management's risk weighting of particular profit streams in Rolls-Royce plc and tested that the assumptions and forecasts for periods beyond the normal five year forecasting horizon were reasonable. The right of offset of certain deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets was also assessed.\n\nWhere applicable we assessed the consistency of the forecasts used to justify the recognition of deferred tax assets to those used elsewhere in the business, including for long-term contract accounting, impairment assessments, or for the Directors' viability and going concern statements. We also assessed the risk adjustments applied by management to these profit forecasts to future periods that are significantly further in time than the group's normal five year forecasting process and considered whether these appropriately reflect the potential impact of climate change on the group's mix of results.\n\nWe assessed the treatment of the losses that are realised or unrealised on the group's hedge book and whether they were treated appropriately and how they are recovered using the same profit forecasts.\n\nWe also assessed the adequacy of disclosures over this area, particularly the derecognition of a portion of the deferred tax asset and impact of changes in key estimates of the asset recognised and this has been disclosed in notes 1 and 5.\n\nWe did not identify any material uncorrected exceptions from our audit work.\n\n## I N D E P E N D E N T   A U D I T O R S '   R E P O R T",

One of the group's primary accounting systems that is used by a number of its subsidiaries translates transactions and balances denominated in foreign currencies at a fixed budget rate for management information purposes.\n\nForeign currency denominated transactions and balances are then re-translated to actual average and closing spot rates through manual adjustments. Due to the manual nature of the process and significance of the recurring adjustments needed there is a risk that transactions and balances denominated in foreign currencies are incorrectly translated in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Presentation and accuracy of underlying results and disclosure of other one-off items (including exceptional items) (relevant to the Consolidated Financial Statements)\n\nPage 114 (note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements - Accounting policies - Presentation of underlying results), page 126 (Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements - Segmental analysis) and page 175 (note 29 to the Consolidated Financial Statements - Derivation of summary of funds flow statement)\n\nIn addition to the performance measures prescribed by International Financial Reporting Standards, the group also presents its results on an 'underlying' basis, as the Directors believe this better reflects the performance of the group during the year. The group also presents a free cash flow metric which the Directors believe reflects the cash generated from underlying trading; this differs from the cash flows presented in the Consolidated cash flow statement.\n\nA key adjustment between the statutory results and the underlying results relates to the foreign exchange rates used to translate foreign currency transactions and balances. The underlying results reflect the achieved rate on foreign currency derivative contracts settled in the period and retranslates assets and liabilities at the foreign currency rates at which they are expected to be realised or settled in the future. As the group can influence which derivative contracts are settled in each reporting period it has the ability to influence the achieved rate and hence the underlying results. This risk is more limited for free cash flow as there are a small number of items that are excluded from free cash flows, however, there may be judgement to determine whether an item meets the definition for being excluded from free cash flow.\n\nIn addition to our testing in other areas of the various financial statement line items, we performed the following specific audit procedures over this area:\n\n- - Obtained an understanding of the process employed by management to correctly report the translation of foreign currency balances and transactions;\n- - Tested system reports identifying transactions and balances in source currency by agreeing these to general ledger balances;\n- - Tested on a sample basis the manual calculations of the adjustment needed to correctly report the translation of the foreign currency denominated transactions and balances;\n- - We sample tested the balances and transactions requiring adjustment by source currency to source data and assessed the completeness of these balances and transactions;\n- - We agreed the exchange rates used in management's translation adjustments to an independent source; and\n- - For each adjustment sampled we assessed whether the foreign currency denominated balance or transaction was translated at the appropriate exchange rate depending on its nature.\n\nThere are no material uncorrected exceptions from our audit work.\n\nWe have considered the judgements taken by management to determine what should be treated as a one-off or exceptional item and the translation of foreign currency amounts and obtained corroborative evidence for these.\n\nWe also considered whether there were items that were recorded within underlying profit that are exceptional in nature and should be reported as an exceptional item. No such material items were identified. As part of this assessment we challenged management's rationale for the  designation  of  certain  items  as  exceptional  or  one-off  and assessed such items against the group's accounting policy, considering the nature and value of those items.\n\nWithin underlying results, foreign currency transactions are presented at rates achieved on derivative contracts hedging the net operating cash flows of the group. In the current year the group experienced a net US Dollar outflow rather than inflow as had been anticipated prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. The impact on trading also resulted in a reduction in the levels of future net US Dollar inflows compared to the forecast position prior to the start of the pandemic resulting in an overhedge position in 2020 as well as a forecast overhedge position in subsequent years to 2026. As a result the achieved rate in 2020 was similar to the average spot rate for the year. To address the overhedge position the group entered into a number of offsetting derivative contracts for a notional value equal to the deficit between its pre-pandemic expectation of net US Dollar cash inflows and its current forecasts. Some of these contracts were used in 2020 to purchase US Dollars to close out derivative positions that could not be met from cash generation in 2020 and the remainder are being used to offset similar forecast positions in the short and medium term.",

        "page_content": "Key audit matter\n\n## How our audit addressed the key audit matter\n\n## Presentation of underlying results and disclosure of other one-off items (including exceptional items)\n\ncontinued\n\nDuring the year, the group recognised a finance charge of \u00a31,689m to underlying profit before tax arising from the impact of closing out derivatives that were to hedge $11.8bn of actual and forecast net US Dollar inflows which are no longer expected. This was transacted primarily by entering into offsetting forward foreign currency derivatives. In addition, the group has excluded \u00a31,293m of impairment charges, \u00a3584m of exceptional credits and pension past service credits of \u00a3308m in arriving at underlying profit before tax.\n\nThe underlying results differ significantly from the reported statutory results and are used extensively to explain performance to the shareholders. Alternative performance measures can provide investors with a better understanding of the group's performance if consistently calculated, properly used and presented. However, when improperly used and presented, these non-GAAP measures can mislead investors and may mask the real financial performance and position.\n\n## Recoverability of accounts receivable and contract assets\n\n(relevant to the Consolidated Financial Statements)\n\nPage 147 (note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements - Trade receivables and other assets) and page 148 (note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements - Contract assets and liabilities)\n\nAt 31 December 2020, the group holds trade receivables and other financial assets of \u00a34,576m (2019: \u00a34,137m) and contract assets of \u00a31,076m (2019: \u00a31,496m). Management is required to assess the recoverability of these balances and recorded a provision against future expected  credit  losses.  At  31  December  2020  this  provision  was \u00a3252m (2019: \u00a3138m). Given the impact of COVID-19 we assess there to be a heightened risk of the recoverability of the group's trade receivables and contract assets within the Civil Aerospace business.\n\nManagement estimates the expected credit loss provision by assessing the credit grade of its customers and determining the expected credit loss based on rates provided by rating agencies. The recognition of provisions for credit losses generally occurs earlier under IFRS 9 than the previous accounting standard and so there is a heightened risk that additional provisions should be recognised over these balances.\n\nThe net overhedge position in 2020 was addressed by entering into and closing out offsetting derivative contracts. A charge was recognised within underlying financing to reflect cost associated with those closed out in 2020 and the expected future cash cost of settlement relating to the over hedged position. This cash cost was partially incurred in 2020, with the balance falling between 2021 and 2026. We have agreed key terms of the offsetting derivative contracts to confirmations or cash settlement, and have recalculated the overhedged charge presented within underlying finance costs.\n\nWithin underlying results, monetary assets and liabilities are also retranslated at rates forecast to be achieved on derivative contracts when the associated cash flows occur. We have agreed these forecast rates to the profile of the derivatives that are expected to mature in the future and tested their application to the relevant monetary assets and liabilities.\n\nWe audited the reconciling items between the underlying loss before tax and free cash flow disclosed in note 29 including verifying that the items adjusted for are consistent with the prior period. We also considered whether free cash flow contains material one-off items which require further disclosure.\n\nWe also assessed the appropriateness and completeness of the disclosures of the impact of one-off or non-underlying items primarily in notes 1, 2, 4 and 29 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and found them to be appropriate. This included assessing the explanations management has provided on the reconciling items between underlying performance and statutory performance in note 2 and disclosure of the impact of a further deterioration of forecast US Dollar cash inflows to the overhedge position within note 4.\n\nOverall we found that the classification judgements made by management were in line with their policy for underlying results and exceptional items, had been consistently applied and there are no material uncorrected misstatements resulting from our testing. Given the size of the net hedge book against future projected cash flows, future results are sensitive to further charges if net cash inflows fall below those projected, this sensitivity is disclosed in note 4.\n\nWe obtained management's calculation of the expected credit loss provision. For a sample of customers we verified the credit rating issued by the rating agencies and recalculated the resulting expected credit loss provision required to compare against management's estimate.\n\nWe performed sensitivity analysis in order to quantify changes to the expected credit loss rate that would be required in order to result in a material change in the provision.\n\nWhere customer balances are subject to specific provisions, we considered the reasonableness of the provision after discussions with management to understand their rationale for the provision, reviewing customer correspondence, payment history and our knowledge of the financial condition of the customers. We also considered what balances were settled subsequent to the year end.\n\nOverall we found management's estimate of the expected credit loss provision to be appropriate and found no material exceptions from our testing.",

In addition, the group has recognised customer relationship intangible assets of \u00a3925m (2019: \u00a3949m) most significantly  in  relation  to  ITP  Aero.  Intangible  assets  are  tested  for impairment if an indicator exists and the fall in forecast cash flows as a result of COVID-19 was identified by management as such an indicator.\n\nThe recoverable value of intangible assets is dependent on a number of  significant  judgements  including  the  shape  and  speed  of  the expected recovery in engine flying hours, which drives a significant proportion of the programme's cash flows, the timing and amount of engine sales, the rate at which costs will grow and discount rates. Management has reflected the increased uncertainty from COVID-19 by probability weighting a base case and downside scenario in order to arrive at expected future cash flows.\n\nFollowing the impairment reviews, management has recorded an impairment charge of \u00a3571m.\n\n## Ability of the group and company to continue as a going concern\n\n(relevant to the Consolidated and Company Financial Statements)\n\nPage  52  (Going  Concern  Statement),  page  114  (note  1  to  the Consolidated Financial Statements - Accounting policies), page 179 (Note 1 to the Company Financial Statements - Accounting policies).\n\nCOVID-19 and the impact of lockdowns on global aviation has had a significant impact on the group's cash generation. While the Defence sector remains robust, and the Power Systems sector has been moderately impacted by the pandemic, the group's core Civil Aerospace business has experienced a significant deterioration in cash generation. The unprecedented decline in air travel, particularly long haul, which is the focus market for a large proportion of the Civil Aerospace business has meant engine flying hour receipts in 2020 and forecasts for 2021/22 have been severely impacted as has cash generated from OE sales to Boeing and Airbus that have been impacted by airline order  deferrals,  cancellations  and  reduced  production  levels. Overall the group experienced a \u00a34.2bn free cash outflow in 2020, which after excluding the impact of largely discontinuing its use of invoice discounting was a \u00a33.1bn free cash outflow.\n\nAt the half year management disclosed two material uncertainties, being the timing of recovery in the commercial aviation market to pre-crisis levels and the availability of sufficient funding. Since the half year management has improved available liquidity by \u00a33.1bn with a \u00a32bn rights issue, \u00a32bn of new bonds, a \u00a31bn new term loan, offset by the expiry of a \u00a31.9bn revolving credit facility that was mandatorily cancelled with the rights issue. As a result overall liquidity at 31 December 2020 increased to \u00a39bn.\n\nWe obtained management's impairment model and tested its logic and mathematical accuracy. We also tested the reasonableness of key assumptions, including the cash inflows from original equipment and aftermarket sales, cost of sales and operating cash flows and the selection of discount rates. We also assessed the reasonableness of the two scenarios used by management and the associated probability given to each.\n\nWe agreed projections to management approved budgets and forecasts and assessed how these projections are compiled.\n\nDeploying our valuations experts, we assessed the terminal growth rate and discount rate applied to the programmes with third party information, past performance, the group's cost of capital and relevant risk factors.\n\nWe performed our own risk assessment by considering historical performance and management's forecasting accuracy to highlight the programmes with either lower headroom or which are more sensitive to changes in key assumptions. We also performed our own independent sensitivity analysis to understand the impact of reasonably possible changes in management's assumptions on the available headroom. We challenged the significant assumptions, specifically relating to revenue and cash flow growth in light of the individual programme's past performance to assess whether the forecasts are achievable.\n\nAs a result of our work, we determined that the impairment charge recognised in 2020 for intangible assets was appropriate. We have assessed management's disclosures in light of the impairment testing we performed, and we consider the disclosures made to be reasonable. For those intangible assets where management has determined there is a risk of future impairments, we found that suitable disclosure has been given showing the impairment charge that would result from reasonably possible changes in the underlying key assumptions.\n\nOur procedures and conclusions in respect of going concern are set out below in the 'Conclusions relating to going concern' section on page 201.",

        "page_content": "Key audit matter\n\nHow our audit addressed the key audit matter\n\n## Ability of the group to continue as a going concern\n\ncontinued\n\nThere is on-going and significant uncertainty over the shape and speed of potential recovery and the impact of new variants of the COVID-19 virus. The group's free cash flow forecasts for 2021 and 2022 have been significantly downgraded as a result by analysts. Given this uncertainty management has modelled a base and downside liquidity headroom position for its going concern assessment. The group's debt facilities do not contain financial covenants. The Directors have concluded that there is sufficient liquidity available for at least the 18 month period of its going concern assessment to September 2022.\n\nAs the going concern assessment is dependent on management's future cash flow forecasts there is significant judgement involved in determining these and concluding that there is not a material uncertainty.\n\n## Recoverability of the company's investments in subsidiary undertakings\n\n(relevant to the Company Financial Statements)\n\nPage 180 (note 2 to the Company Financial Statements - Investments - Subsidiary Undertakings)\n\nInvestments  in  subsidiaries  of  \u00a314,688m  (2019:  \u00a312,801m)  are accounted for at cost less provision for impairment in the Company balance sheet at 31 December 2020. The increase in the year principally relates to a capital injection to the company's subsidiary, RollsRoyce Group Limited.\n\nInvestments are tested for impairment if impairment indicators exist. If such indicators exist, the recoverable amounts of the investments in subsidiaries are estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss, if any. Any such impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.\n\nManagement has identified the impact of COVID-19 on future cash flows of the group as an indicator of potential impairment. In addition, the carrying value significantly exceeded the market capitalisation  of  the  group  at  31  December  2020.  These  necessitated  an impairment assessment to be performed, for which management engaged a third party expert.\n\nJudgement  is  required  in  this  area,  particularly  in  assessing:  (1) whether an event has occurred that may indicate that the related asset values may not be recoverable; (2) whether the carrying value of an asset can be supported by the recoverable value, being the higher of fair value less cost of disposal or the net present value of future cash flows which are estimated based on the continued use of the asset in the business; and (3) key assumptions to be applied in preparing cash flow projections including whether these cash flow projections are discounted using an appropriate rate. Changing the assumptions selected by management to determine the level of any impairment, including the discount rates or the growth rate assumptions in the cash flow projections, could materially affect the recoverable value determined by the impairment test and as a result affect the company's financial condition and results.\n\nWe evaluated management's determination of whether any indicators of impairment existed by comparing the carrying value of investments in subsidiary undertakings to the market capitalisation of the group at 31 December 2020 and post year-end and by comparing the performance of the group in the year  to  previous  budgets  and agreed that an impairment assessment is necessary.\n\nThe recoverable value of the group was determined from the discounted future cash flows of the group. We have tested the reasonableness of the key assumptions used, including revenue, profit and cash flow growth rates, terminal growth rates and the discount rate that management has applied. We tested that the underlying assumptions were consistent with other forecasts such as those used to assess the recoverability of the deferred tax asset. We also assessed whether management's probability weighted cash flow forecasts appropriately reflects the estimation uncertainty over the group's forecast cash flows especially within Civil Aerospace.\n\nDeploying our valuations experts, we assessed the methodology applied by management's expert as well as certain key assumptions such as the discount rate. We also considered other estimates of the group's valuation such as third party analyst reports and considered the potential reasons why the market capitalisation of the group was lower than the carrying value and valuation produced by management's expert.\n\nWe performed our own independent sensitivity analysis to understand if reasonable possible changes in management's assumptions would result in an impairment.\n\nAs a result of our work, we did not identify any material impairment and consider the carrying value of the investments in subsidiary undertakings  to  be  supportable  in  the  context  of  the  Company Financial Statements taken as a whole. We have assessed the disclosures provided, including the sensitivity disclosures and consider them to be appropriate given the estimation uncertainty inherent in the analysis.",

The pandemic has brought significant estimation uncertainty over future performance in the Civil Aerospace business in particular, given the shape and speed of recovery is uncertain particularly with new variants of the virus. Further this may impact consumer behaviour in the short and longer term.\n\nManagement  has  considered  the  impact  of  COVID-19  on  the Consolidated  and  Company  Financial  Statements  particularly  in connection with long term contract accounting, deferred tax asset recognition and the recoverability of tangible and intangible fixed assets, the treatment of the group's derivative financial instruments, the  company's  investment  in  subsidiary  undertakings  and  the Directors' going concern and viability assessments.\n\nThere is a risk that the assessment of the financial impact made by management may be inappropriate. Accordingly we have focused on areas where the financial impact is likely to manifest in the financial statements. Many of these are risks that are the subject of separate key audit matters set out above. In addition we have identified the following:\n\n- - The group announced a fundamental restructuring programme during the year. This resulted in a provision of \u00a3373m, representing management's best estimate of the related severance costs. In addition, the group has decided to exit certain sites and has therefore written down the related assets at those sites to their fair value less cost of disposal. This resulted in an impairment charge of \u00a3288m;\n- - The group received \u00a347m from the UK Government as part of the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS) and issued \u00a3300m of commercial paper under the Covid Corporate Financing Facility (CCFF). In addition it obtained a \u00a32bn term loan that is 80% guaranteed by UK Export Finance; and\n- - Management's way of working, including the operation of controls, has been impacted by COVID-19 as a result of a large number of staff working remotely. There is inevitably an increase in risk due to the remote accessing of IT systems and potentially heightened cyber risk.\n\nCOVID-19 has impacted a number of areas of the financial statements that are described in the key audit matters above. We have held regular meetings with management during the year to understand the impacts of the pandemic on the business and how it has impacted the significant estimates and judgements used in the preparation of the Consolidated and Company Financial Statements.\n\nTo test group's restructuring provision, we assessed whether a legal or constructive obligation was present to carry out the restructuring by reference to the communications that the group has made externally and internally and the actions it had taken by 31 December 2020. We validated the assumptions used to quantify the expected costs of restructuring including by comparing those costs against the experience of past restructuring exercises and leavers in the year.\n\nIn respect to the CJRS, we tested a sample of employees for which a claim has been submitted and recalculated the claim amount based on payroll data and the rules of the scheme. We also verified that the other conditions of the scheme, such as the requirement to inform the impacted employees in writing, were met.\n\nWe assessed  the  accounting  treatment  of  the  \u00a3300m  financing under the CCFF and the \u00a32bn UKEF loan to consider whether they were sufficiently close in pricing and terms to equivalent debt that may be raised by the group without any Government involvement. We considered the timing of the issues, the terms of the UKEF loan and compared the rates payable on this debt to indicative quotes received  from  other  financing  options  and  found  the  resultant accounting treatment to be appropriate.\n\nOur audit places only limited reliance on the group's IT and control environment. However, in response to any incremental risk from remote working, we understood key changes to the group's IT controls and processes as part of our assessment of audit risks to consider where additional testing might be required. We also met with senior management responsible for cyber security and considered whether there were developments in the year that warranted further procedures to be performed.\n\nWe  have  assessed  the  adequacy  of  the  disclosures  in  the Consolidated Financial statements explaining the impact of COVID-19 and the disclosure management has given to explain and quantify key judgements and sources of estimation uncertainty and found these to be appropriate.\n\n## How we tailored the audit scope\n\nWe tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the group and the company, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which they operate.\n\nOur scoping is based on the group's consolidation structure. We define a component as a single reporting unit which feeds into the group consolidation. Of the group's 468 reporting components, 32 individual components (including three joint ventures) were subject to full scope audits for group purposes, which following an element of consolidation, equates to 16 group reporting opinions; and eight components performed targeted specified procedures.\n\nIn order to achieve audit coverage over the financial statements, under our audit methodology, we test both the design and operation of relevant business process controls and perform substantive testing over each financial statement line item.\n\nThe group operates Finance Service Centres (FSCs) to bulk process financial transactions in Derby (UK), Indianapolis (US) and Bangalore (India). Based on our assessment with management it is not possible to fully test revenue and profit centrally as certain key processes, such as long-term contracting, remain within the business due to their nature and are not handled by the FSCs.",

All entities that contribute in excess of 3% of the group's revenue were included in full scope.\n\nFurther specific audit procedures over central functions, the group consolidation and areas of significant judgement (including corporate costs, taxation, certain goodwill balances, intangible assets, treasury and post-retirement benefits) were directly led by the group audit team.\n\nWhere work was performed by component auditors, we determined the level of involvement we needed to have in the audit work at those reporting units to be able to conclude whether sufficient appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nWe issued formal written instructions to all component auditors setting out the audit work to be performed by each of them and maintained regular communication with the component auditors throughout the audit cycle. These interactions included attending certain component clearance meetings and holding regular conference calls, as well as reviewing and assessing any matters reported. The group engagement team also reviewed selected audit working papers for certain component teams.\n\nIn addition, senior members of the group engagement team have virtually visited component teams across all group segments in the United Kingdom, United States of America, Germany, Spain and Saudi Arabia. These visits included meetings with the component auditor and attendance at segment clearance meetings.\n\n## Materiality\n\nThe scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole.\n\nBased on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows::\n\nFinancial statements - group\n\nFinancial statements - company\n\n| Overall materiality               | \u00a370m (2019: \u00a375m).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | \u00a3147m (2019: \u00a3126m).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| How we   determined it            | 0.5% of three year average underlying revenues.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | 1% of total assets                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| Rationale for   benchmark applied | We have consistently used underlying revenue to deter- mine materiality as opposed to a profit based benchmark.  This is because there is considerable volatility in profit/ loss before tax as a result of revenue recognition under  IFRS 15 and from the fair value movement in the group's  derivatives. Underlying revenue continues to be a key  performance metric for the group and is much less volatile  than  the  profit  metric.  However,  for  2020  COVID-19   introduced additional volatility that impacted benchmarks.  To mitigate this we have used a three year average under- | We determined  our  materiality  based  on  total  assets,  which  is  more  applicable  than  a  performance-related  measure as the company is an investment holding company  for the group. Where there were balances and transac- tions within the Company Financial Statements that were  within the scope of the audit of the Consolidated Financial  Statements, our procedures were undertaken using the  lower materiality level applying to the group audit. The  higher company materiality level was used for the pur- poses of testing balances not relevant to the group audit, |\n\nFor each component in the scope of our group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall group materiality. The range of materiality allocated across components was between \u00a35m and \u00a363m. Certain components were audited to a local statutory audit materiality that was also less than our overall group materiality.\n\nWe use performance materiality to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds overall materiality. Specifically, we use performance materiality in determining the scope of our audit and the nature and extent of our testing of account balances, classes of transactions and disclosures, for example in determining sample sizes. Our performance materiality was 75% of overall materiality, amounting to \u00a353m for the Consolidated Financial Statements and \u00a3110m for the Company Financial Statements.\n\nIn determining the performance materiality, we considered a number of factors - the history of misstatements, risk assessment and aggregation risk and the effectiveness of controls - and concluded that an amount at the upper end of our normal range was appropriate.\n\nWe agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above \u00a33m (group audit) (2019: \u00a33m) and \u00a37m (company audit) (2019: \u00a36m) as well as misstatements below those amounts that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.",

        "page_content": "## Conclusions relating to going concern\n\nOur evaluation of the directors' assessment of the group's and the company's ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included:\n\n- - Testing the model used for management's going concern assessment which is primarily a liquidity assessment given there are no significant financial covenants in its committed debt facilities. Management's assessment covered the 18 months to September 2022. We focussed on this period and also considered the subsequent three months to the end of 2022 given the group's \u00a31bn term loan expires in October 2022.\n- - Management's base case forecasts are based on its normal budget and forecasting process for each of its businesses for the next five years. We understood and assessed this process by business including the assumptions used for 2021 and 2022 and assessed whether there was adequate support for these assumptions. We also considered the reasonableness of the monthly phasing of cash flows. A similar assessment was performed of the downside cash flows, including understanding of the scenarios modelled by management, how they were quantified and the resultant monthly phasing of the downside cash flow forecasts.\n- - Comparison of the going concern base case forecasts to Board approved forecasts and where applicable, we compared these forecasts for consistency to those used elsewhere in the business, including for long-term contract accounting and impairment assessments.\n- - We have read and understood the key terms of all committed debt facilities to understand any terms, covenants or undertakings that may impact the availability of the facility.\n- - Using our knowledge from the audit and assessment of previous forecasting accuracy we calculated our own sensitivities to apply to management's cash flow forecasts. We overlaid these on management's forecasts to arrive at our own view of management's downside forecasts. This included considering the three month period after September 2022 to assess the impact on liquidity headroom of the \u00a31bn term loan expiring in the downside case together with our sensitivities.\n- - We considered the potential mitigating actions that management may have available to it to reduce costs, manage cash flows or raise additional financing and assessed whether these were within the control of management and possible in the period of the assessment.\n- - We assessed the adequacy of disclosures in the Going Concern statement on pages 52 to 54 and statements in note 1 of the Consolidated and Company Financial Statements and found these appropriately reflect the key areas of uncertainty identified.\n\nBased on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the group's and the company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.\n\nIn auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.\n\nHowever, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this conclusion is not a guarantee as to the group's and the company's ability to continue as a going concern.\n\nIn relation to the company's reporting on how they have applied the UK Corporate Governance Code, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to the directors' statement in the financial statements about whether the directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nOur responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report.\n\n## Reporting on other information\n\nThe other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and our auditors' report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, any form of assurance thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, we are required to perform procedures to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report based on these responsibilities.\n\nWith respect to the Strategic report and Statement of the Directors' responsibilities in respect of the Financial Statements, we also considered whether the disclosures required by the UK Companies Act 2006 have been included.\n\nBased on our work undertaken in the course of the audit, the Companies Act 2006 requires us also to report certain opinions and matters as described below.",

Our additional responsibilities with respect to the corporate governance statement as other information are described in the Reporting on other information section of this report.\n\nBased on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded that each of the following elements of the corporate governance statement is materially consistent with the financial statements and our knowledge obtained during the audit, and we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to:\n\n- - The directors' confirmation that they have carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks;\n- - The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those principal risks, what procedures are in place to identify emerging risks and an explanation of how these are being managed or mitigated;\n- - The directors' statement in the financial statements about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing them, and their identification of any material uncertainties to the group's and company's ability to continue to do so over a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements;\n- - The directors' explanation as to their assessment of the group's and company's prospects, the period this assessment covers and why the period is appropriate; and\n- - The directors' statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the group and company will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of its assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.\n\nOur review of the directors' statement regarding the longer-term viability of the group was substantially less in scope than an audit and only consisted of making inquiries and considering the directors' process supporting their statement; checking that the statement is in alignment with the relevant provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code; and considering whether the statement is consistent with the financial statements and our knowledge and understanding of the group and company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit.\n\nIn addition, based on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded that each of the following elements of the corporate governance statement is materially consistent with the financial statements and our knowledge obtained during the audit:\n\n- - The directors' statement that they consider the Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable, and provides the information necessary for the members to assess the group's and company's position, performance, business model and strategy;\n- - The section of the Annual Report that describes the review of effectiveness of risk management and internal control systems; and\n- - The section of the Annual Report describing the work of the Audit Committee.\n\nWe have nothing to report in respect of our responsibility to report when the directors' statement relating to the company's compliance with the Code does not properly disclose a departure from a relevant provision of the Code specified under the Listing Rules for review by the auditors.\n\n## Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit\n\n## Responsibilities of the directors for the financial statements\n\nAs explained more fully in the Statement of the Directors' responsibilities in respect of the Financial Statements, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the applicable framework and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. The directors are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group's and the company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or the company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.",

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nOur audit testing might include testing complete populations of certain transactions and balances, possibly using data auditing techniques. However, it typically involves selecting a limited number of items for testing, rather than testing complete populations. We will often seek to target particular items for testing based on their size or risk characteristics. In other cases, we will use audit sampling to enable us to draw a conclusion about the population from which the sample is selected.\n\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC's website at: www.frc.org.uk/ auditorsresponsibilities.

This Assurance Statement applies to the related information included within the scope of work described below.\n\n## Scope of work\n\nThe scope of our work was limited to assurance over the following information i ncluded within Rolls-Royce's 2020 Annual Report ('the Report') for the period 1st of January to the 31st of December 2020 (the 'Selected Information'):\n\n- - Total Energy consumption;\n- - Total Scope 1 & 2 greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions;\n- - Total waste;\n- - Total Reportable Injuries;\n- - Number of people reached through the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education outreach programmes; and\n- - Employee engagement score - 'grand mean' and increase compared to 2019.\n\n## Reporting criteria\n\nThe Selected Information are reported according to the Rolls-Royce 'Basis of Reporting', a copy of which is available from http://rolls-royce. com/sustainability.\n\n## Limitations and exclusions\n\nExcluded from the scope of our work is verification of any information relating to:\n\n- - Activities outside the defined verification period;\n- - Financial data taken from the Report which are audited by an external financial auditor;\n- - The appropriateness of the reporting criteria; and\n- - Other information included in Rolls-Royce's Report;\n\nThis limited assurance engagement relies on a risk based selected sample of sustainability data and the associated limitations that this entails. The scope of a limited assurance engagement is substantially less than for reasonable assurance both in terms of the risk assessment procedures and in performing the procedures to address the identified risks. This independent statement should not be relied upon to detect all errors, omissions or misstatements that may exist.\n\n## Responsibilities\n\nThis preparation and presentation of the Selected Information in the Report are the sole responsibility of the management of Rolls-Royce.\n\nBureau Veritas was not involved in the drafting of the Report or of the Reporting Criteria. Our responsibilities were to:\n\n- - obtain limited assurance about whether the Selected Information has been prepared in accordance with the Reporting Criteria;\n- - form an independent conclusion based on the assurance procedures performed and evidence obtained; and\n- - report our conclusions to the management of Rolls-Royce.\n\n## Assessment Standard\n\nWe performed our work to a limited level of assurance in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 Revised, Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information (effective for assurance reports dated on or after December 15, 2015), and in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3410 - 'Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statements' ('ISAE 3410'), issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board.\n\n## Summary of work performed\n\nAs part of its independent verification, Bureau Veritas undertook the following activities remotely:\n\n- 1.  Conducted interviews with relevant personnel of Rolls-Royce;\n- 2. Carried out nine virtual site audits, selected employing a risk-based approach, in the United Kingdom, United States, Norway, Mexico, and Singapore;\n- 3. Reviewed the data collection and consolidation processes used to compile the Selected Information, including assessing assumptions made, the data scope and reporting boundaries;\n- 4. Reviewed documentary evidence produced by Rolls-Royce;\n- 5. Agreed a sample of the Selected Information to the corresponding source documentation;\n- 6. Re-performed aggregation calculations of the Selected Information; and\n- 7.  Report our conclusions and recommendation in a formal Management Report to Rolls-Royce.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nOn the basis of our methodology and the activities described above, nothing has come to our attention to indicate that the Selected Information has not been properly prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Reporting Criteria.\n\n## Statement of Independence, Integrity and Competence\n\nBureau Veritas is an independent professional services company that specialises in quality, environmental, health, safety and social accountability with over 185 years history. Its assurance team has extensive experience in conducting verification over environmental, social, ethical and health and safety information, systems and processes.\n\nBureau Veritas operates a certified Quality Management System which complies with the requirements of ISO 9001:2015, and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.\n\nBureau Veritas has implemented and applies a Code of Ethics, which meets the requirements of the International Federation of Inspections Agencies (IFIA) across the business to ensure that its employees maintain integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality, professional behaviour and high ethical standards in their day-to-day business activities.\n\nThe assurance team for this work does not have any involvement in any other Bureau Veritas projects with Rolls-Royce.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBureau Veritas UK Limited London\n\n03 March 2021\n\n- 1 Certificate of Registration can be provided on request\n- 2 International Federation of Inspection Agencies - Compliance Code - Third Edition",

This energy is used by the majority of our facilities in the UK and Germany. The source in the UK includes a proportion of electricity that was generated by the combustion of biofuel. The associated emissions are included above under the location-based Scope 2 emissions (using grid average emission factors). They are also reported separately as market-based Scope 2 emissions (covering the emissions of nitrous oxide and methane) and Outside of Scopes (covering the emissions of carbon dioxide). This has resulted in a net reduction of 31,000 tonnes from our total GHG emissions. In addition, the above figures include 8,811,000 kWh of electricity and heat generated on-site from renewable energy sources, including solar panels and ground source heat pumps.\n\nThe figures for 2016 through to 2019 have been restated to remove emissions associated with the North American Civil Nuclear business sold on 3 February 2020 and Trigno Energy S.r.l. sold in April 2020. We include the reporting of fugitive emissions of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), associated with air conditioning equipment, into our GHG emissions figures. These include emissions from our facilities in the\n\nUS and Canada only. We do not anticipate that emissions from other facilities will have a significant impact on the above figures.\n\nWith the exceptions noted above, we have reported on the underlying energy use and emission sources required under the Companies (Directors' Report) and Limited Liability Partnerships (Energy and Carbon Report) Regulations 2018. All these sources fall within the scope of our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nWe have used the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (revised edition) as of 31 December 2014 utilising the operational control approach, supplemented by the GHG Reporting Guidance for the Aerospace Industry (version 3) and emission factors from the UK Government's GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting 2020. We report our emissions of: carbon dioxide; methane; nitrous oxide; hydrofluorocarbons and perfluorocarbons on a carbon dioxide equivalent basis. We had no emissions of sulphur hexafluoride or nitrogen trioxide.\n\nFurther details on our methodology for reporting and the criteria used can be found within our basis of reporting, available to download at rolls-royce.com.",

        "page_content": "## Foreign exchange\n\nForeign exchange rate movements influence the reported income statement, the cash flow and closing net funds balance. The average and spot rates for the principal trading currencies of the Group are shown in the table below:\n\n|             |                    |   2020 |   2019 | Change   |\n|-------------|--------------------|--------|--------|----------|\n| USD per GBP | Year-end spot rate |   1.36 |   1.32 | +3%      |\n|             | Average spot rate  |   1.28 |   1.28 | -        |\n| EUR per GBP | Year-end spot rate |   1.11 |   1.18 | -6%      |\n|             | Average spot rate  |   1.13 |   1.14 | -1%      |\n\n## The Group's global corporate income tax contribution\n\nThe Group's total corporation tax payments in 2020 were \u00a3231m. Around 85% of this was paid in the US, Germany, UK and Singapore which reflects the fact that the majority of the Group's business is undertaken, and employees are based, in these countries. The balance was paid in around 40 other countries.\n\nIn common with most multinational groups, the total of all profits in respect of which corporate income tax is paid is not the same as the consolidated loss before tax reported on page 106. The main reasons for this are:\n\n- (i) the consolidated income statement is prepared under IFRS, whereas tax is paid on the profits of each Group company, which are determined by local accounting rules;\n- (ii) accounting rules require certain income and costs relating to our commercial activities to be eliminated from, or added to, the aggregate of all the profits of the Group companies when preparing the consolidated income statement (consolidation adjustments); and\n- (iii)  specific tax rules including exemptions or incentives as determined by the tax laws in each country.\n\nThe level of tax paid in each country is impacted by the above. In most cases, (i) and (ii) are only a matter of timing and therefore tax will be paid in an earlier or later year. As a result they only have a negligible impact on the Group's underlying tax rate. The underlying tax rate can be found on page 20. This is due to deferred tax accounting, details of which can be found in note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The impact of (iii) will often be permanent depending on the relevant tax law. Further information on the tax position of the Group can be found as follows:\n\n- - Audit Committee Report (page 77) - The group tax director gave a presentation to the Audit Committee during the year which covered various matters including tax risks and how they are managed and key sources of estimation uncertainty (in particular the recognition of deferred tax assets and provisions for uncertain tax positions);\n- - note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements (page 114) - Details of key areas of uncertainty and accounting policies for tax; and\n\n## OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION\n\n- - note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements (page 134) Details of the tax balances in the Consolidated Financial Statements together with a tax reconciliation. This explains the main drivers of the tax rate and the impact of our assessment on the recovery of UK deferred tax assets.\n\nAt this stage we expect these items to continue to influence the underlying tax rate. The reported tax rate is more difficult to forecast due to the impact of significant adjustments to reported profits, in particular the net unrealised fair value changes to derivative contracts and the recognition of losses and advance corporation tax.\n\nInformation on the Group's approach to managing its tax affairs can be found at www.rolls-royce.com.\n\n## Investments and capital expenditure\n\nThe Group subjects all major investments and capital expenditure to a rigorous examination of risks and future cash flows to ensure that they create shareholder value. All major investments, including the launch of major programmes, require Board approval.\n\nThe Group has a portfolio of projects at different stages of their lifecycles. All of our major investments and projects are assessed using a range of financial metrics, including discounted cash flow and return on investment.\n\n## Financial risk management\n\nThe Board has established a structured approach to financial risk management. The Financial risk committee (Frc) is accountable for managing, reporting and mitigating the Group's financial risks and exposures. These risks include the Group's principal counterparty, currency, interest rate, commodity price, liquidity and credit rating risks outlined in more depth in note 21. The Frc is chaired by the Chief Financial Officer or group controller. The Group has a comprehensive financial risk policy that advocates the use of financial instruments to manage and hedge business operations risks that arise from movements in financial, commodities, credit or money markets. The Group's policy is not to engage in speculative financial transactions. The Frc sits quarterly to review and assess the key risks and agree any mitigating actions required.\n\n## Capital structure\n\n| \u00a3m                                      | 2020    | 2019    |\n|-----------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Total equity                            | (4,875) | (3,354) |\n| Cash flow hedges                        | 94      | 96      |\n| Group capital                           | (4,781) | (3,258) |\n| Net funds (excluding lease liabilities) | (1,533) | 1,361   |\n\nOperations are funded through various shareholders' funds, bank borrowings, bonds and notes. The capital structure of the Group reflects the judgement of the Board as to the appropriate balance of funding required. Funding is secured by the Group's continued access to the global debt markets. Borrowings are funded in various currencies using derivatives where appropriate to achieve a required",

        "page_content": "currency and interest rate profile. The Board's objective is to retain sufficient financial investments and undrawn facilities to ensure that the Group can both meet its medium-term operational commitments and cope with unforeseen obligations and opportunities.\n\nThe Group holds cash and short-term investments which, together with the undrawn committed facilities, enable it to manage its liquidity risk.\n\nDuring the year, the Group issued $1,000m, \u20ac750m and \u00a3545m of bond notes, $1,000m and \u00a3545m of which mature in 2027 and \u20ac750m in 2026. The Group issued \u00a3300m of commercial paper under the Covid Commercial Finance Facility made available by the Bank of England in response to COVID-19. The Group also entered into a new committed \u00a32,000m loan maturing 2025 (supported by an 80% guarantee from UK Export Finance) and a new \u00a31,000m bank loan maturing 2022. Also during 2020 the Group extended the maturity of the \u00a32,500m committed revolving credit facility from 2024 to 2025. The \u00a32,500m revolving credit facility, the \u00a32,000m loan and \u00a31,000m loan were undrawn at the period end. The Group also repaid a $500m bond during the year. At the year end, the Group retained aggregate liquidity of \u00a39.0bn, including cash and cash equivalents of \u00a33.5bn and undrawn borrowing facilities of \u00a35.5bn.\n\nCirca \u00a31.0bn of drawn borrowings mature in 2021 (\u00a31.3bn including lease liabilities).\n\nThe maturity profile of the borrowing facilities is regularly reviewed to ensure that refinancing levels are manageable in the context of the business and market conditions. There are no rating triggers in any borrowing facility that would require the facility to be accelerated or repaid due to an adverse movement in the Group's credit rating. The Group conducts some of its business through a number of joint ventures. A major proportion of the debt of these joint ven-tures is secured on the assets of the respective companies and is nonrecourse to the Group. This debt is further outlined in note 12.\n\n## Credit rating\n\n| \u00a3m                        | Rating   | Outlook   |\n|---------------------------|----------|-----------|\n| Moody's Investors Service | Ba3-     | Negative  |\n| Standard & Poor's         | BB-      | Negative  |\n| Fitch                     | BB-      | Negative  |\n\nThe Group subscribes to Moody's, Standard & Poor's and Fitch for independent long-term credit ratings with the ratings in the table above being applicable at the date of this report.\n\n## Accounting\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as adopted by the UK.\n\nNo new accounting standards had a material impact in 2020, or are expected to have a material impact in 2021.\n\n## Additional commentary on key performance indicators\n\nOrder backlog , also known as unrecognised revenue, is the amount of revenue on current contracts that is expected to be recognised in future periods. Civil Aerospace OE orders where the customer has retained the right to cancel (for deliveries in the next 7-12 months) are excluded. Further details are included in note 2 on page 130.\n\nUnderlying revenue is used as it reflects the impact of our foreign exchange (FX) hedging policy by valuing foreign currency revenue at the actual exchange rates achieved as a result of settling FX contracts in the year. This provides a clearer measure of our yearon-year performance. Further details and reconciliation to reported revenue are included in note 2 on page 131.\n\nSelf-funded R&D as a proportion of underlying revenue - We expect to spend approximately 5% of underlying revenue on R&D although this proportion will fluctuate depending on the stage of development of current programmes. We expect this proportion will reduce modestly over the medium term. Further details are included in note 3 on page 132.\n\nCapital expenditure as a proportion of underlying revenue - All proposed investments are subject to rigorous review to ensure that they are consistent with forecast activity and will provide value for money. We measure annual capital expenditure as the cash purchases of property, plant and equipment acquired during the period; over the medium-term we expect a proportion of around 4%. Further details are included in note 10 on page 140.\n\nUnderlying operating profit includes: (a) revenue and costs denominated in US dollars and euros on the basis of the exchange rates achieved based on our FX hedge book; (b) similar adjustments in respect of commodity derivatives; (c) consequential adjustments to reflect the impact of exchange rates on trading assets and liabilities, and long-term contracts, on a consistent basis; and (d) items of a one-off nature. Further details and reconciliation to reported operating profit are included in note 2 on page 131.\n\nFree cash flow is the movement in net debt from cash flows excluding: transactions with ordinary shareholders; M&A activity; financial penalties paid; exceptional restructuring payments; and the capital element of lease payments. Further details and reconciliation to reported cash flow are included in note 29 on page 176 .\n\nCash flow per share is calculated using free cash flow (as defined above) and the average number of shares in issue during the year, consistent with the EPS calculations in note 6 on page 137.\n\nCash return on invested capital (CROIC) is calculated as cash flow divided by invested capital. Cash flow is the free cash flow (as defined above), adjusted to remove R&D, PPE and software capital expenditure, certification costs, other intangibles, and working capital (excluding change in the net LTSA balance in Civil Aerospace). Invested capital i s defined as the sum of 15 years net R&D investment, PPE and software at cost, certification costs, other intangibles (excluding M&A and goodwill), and working capital (excluding net LTSA balance in Civil Aerospace) and ten times current year lease payments.",

In addition, the Directors have been granted a qualifying third-party indemnity provision which was in force throughout the financial year and remains in force. Also, throughout the year, the Company purchased and maintained Directors' and Officers' liability insurance in respect of the Company and for its Directors and Officers.\n\n## Share price\n\nDuring the year, the share price reduced by 53% from 234p* to 111p, compared to a 27% decrease in the FTSE aerospace and defence sector and a 14% decrease in the FTSE 100. The Company's share price ranged from 35p in October 2020 to 242p* in February 2020.\n\n- *  Share price adjusted to reflect the rights issue.\n\n## Share capital\n\nOn 31 December 2020, the Company's issued share capital comprised:\n\n| 8,367,596,989   | Ordinary shares   | 20p each   |\n|-----------------|-------------------|------------|\n| 27,540,015,227  | C Shares          | 0.1p each  |\n| 1               | Special Share     | \u00a31         |\n\nThe ordinary shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange.\n\nThe Company issues non-cumulative redeemable preference shares (C Shares) as an alternative to paying a cash dividend. Further information on payments to shareholders is on page 211.\n\n## Share class rights\n\nThe full share class rights are set out in the Company's Articles, which are available at rolls-royce.com. The rights are summarised below.\n\n## Ordinary shares\n\nEach member has one vote for each ordinary share held. Holders of ordinary shares are entitled to: receive the Company's Annual Report; attend and speak at general meetings of the Company; appoint one or more proxies or, if they are corporations, corporate representatives; and exercise voting rights. Holders of ordinary shares may receive a bonus issue of C Shares or a dividend and on liquidation may share in the assets of the Company.\n\n## C Shares\n\nC Shares have limited voting rights and attract a preferential dividend of 75% of LIBOR on the 0.1p nominal value of each share, paid on a twice-yearly basis. The Company has the option to redeem the C Shares compulsorily, at any time if: the aggregate number of C Shares in issue is less than 10% of the aggregate number of all C Shares i ssued on or prior to that time or the event of a capital restructuring of the Company; the introduction of a new holding company; the acquisition of the Company by another company; or a demerger from the Group.\n\nOn a return of capital on a winding-up, the holders of C Shares shall be entitled, in priority to any payment to the holders of ordinary shares, to the repayment of the nominal capital paid-up or credited as paid-up on the C Shares held by them, together with a sum equal to the outstanding preferential dividend which will have been accrued but not paid until the date of return of capital.\n\nThe holders of C Shares are only entitled to attend, speak and vote at a general meeting if a resolution to wind up the Company is to be considered, in which case they may vote only on that resolution.\n\n## Special Share\n\nCertain rights attach to the special rights non-voting share (Special Share) issued to the UK Secretary of State for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (Special Shareholder). These rights are set out in the Articles. Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 (the Act), the Treasury Solicitor may redeem the Special Share at par value at any time. The Special Share confers no rights to dividends but in the event of a winding-up it shall be repaid at its nominal value in priority to any other shares.",

        "page_content": "Certain provisions of the Articles (in particular those relating to the foreign shareholding limit, disposals and the nationality of the Company's Directors) that relate to the rights attached to the Special Share may only be altered with the consent of the Special Shareholder. The Special Shareholder is not entitled to vote at any general meeting or any other meeting of any class of shareholders.\n\n## Restrictions on transfer of shares and limitations on holdings\n\nThere are no restrictions on transfer or limitations on the holding of the ordinary shares or C Shares other than under the Articles (as described here), under restrictions imposed by law or regulation (for example, insider trading laws) or pursuant to the Company's share dealing code. The Articles provide that the Company should be and remain under UK control. As such, an individual foreign shareholding limit is set at 15% of the aggregate votes attaching to the share capital of all classes (taken as a whole) and capable of being cast on a poll and to all other shares that the Directors determine are to be included in the calculation of that holding. The Special Share may only be issued to, held by and transferred to the Special Shareholder or their successor or nominee.\n\n## Shareholder agreements and consent requirements\n\nNo disposal may be made to a non-Group member which, alone or when aggregated with the same or a connected transaction, constitutes a disposal of the whole or a material part of either the nuclear propulsion business or the assets of the Group as a whole, without the consent of the Special Shareholder.\n\n## Authority to issue shares\n\nAt the 2020 AGM, authority was given to the Directors to allot new C Shares up to a nominal value of \u00a3500m as an alternative to a cash dividend.\n\nIn addition, an ordinary resolution was passed authorising the Directors to allot new ordinary shares up to a nominal value of \u00a3128,733,021 equivalent to one-third of the issued share capital of the Company. This resolution also authorised the Directors to allot up to two-thirds of the total issued share capital of the Company, but only in the case of a rights issue.\n\nA further special resolution was passed to effect a disapplication of pre-emption rights for a maximum of 5% of the issued share capital of the Company.\n\nThese authorities are valid until the 2021 AGM or 30 June 2021, whichever is earlier, and the Directors propose to renew each of them at the 2021 AGM. The Board believes that these authorities will allow the Company to retain flexibility to respond to circumstances and opportunities as they arise.\n\n## Rights issue\n\nA rights issue was approved by shareholders at a general meeting on 27 October 2020, resulting in the issue of a total of 6,436,651,043 new ordinary shares. The majority of these shares were subscribed for by existing shareholders before the rights issue closed at 11:00am on 11 November 2020 and the remaining shares were issued in the rump placing.\n\n| No. of ordinary shares   |   Price per share (p) | Date of issue    |\n|--------------------------|-----------------------|------------------|\n| 6,061,504,884            |                    32 | 12 November 2020 |\n| 375,096,792              |                    90 | 13 November 2020 |\n\n## Authority to purchase own shares\n\nAt the 2020 AGM, the Company was authorised by shareholders to purchase up to 193,099,531 of its own ordinary shares representing 10% of its issued ordinary share capital.\n\nThe authority for the Company to purchase its own shares expires at the conclusion of the 2021 AGM or 30 June 2021, whichever is the earlier. A resolution to renew the authority will be proposed at the 2021 meeting.\n\nThe Company did not purchase any of its own ordinary shares under this authority during 2020.\n\n## Deadlines for exercising voting rights\n\nElectronic and paper proxy appointments, and voting instructions, must be received by the Registrar not less than 48 hours before a general meeting.\n\n## Voting rights for employee share plan shares\n\nShares are held in an employee benefit trust for the purpose of satisfying awards made under the various employee share plans. For shares held in a nominee capacity or if plan/trust rules provide the participant with the right to vote in respect of specifically allocated shares, the trustee votes in line with the participants' instructions. For shares that are not held absolutely on behalf of specific individuals, the general policy of the trustees, in accordance with investor protection guidelines, is to abstain from voting in respect of those shares.\n\n## Major shareholdings\n\nAt 31 December 2020, the following shareholders had notified an interest in the issued ordinary share capital of the Company in accordance with section 5.1.2 of the Disclosure and Transparency Rules:\n\n| Shareholder                        | Date of change in interest   |   % of issued ordinary share capital * |\n|------------------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Causeway Capital  Management LLC   | 21 December 2020             |                                   6.98 |\n| Harris Associates L.P.             | 16 November 2020             |                                   4.99 |\n| Blackrock, Inc.                    | 12 November 2020             |                                   5.99 |\n| The Capital Group  Companies, Inc. | 10 November 2020             |                                   8.69 |\n\nAs at 11 March 2021, the following changes had been notified:\n\n- - Causeway Capital Management LLC notified the Company that on 25 January 2021 their holding had increased to 7.02% of issued ordinary share capital.",

        "page_content": "## Changes to the Articles of Association\n\nThe Articles may be altered or added to or new articles may be adopted by a special resolution of the shareholders of the Company, subject to the provisions of the Act.\n\n## Change of control\n\n## Contracts and joint venture agreements\n\nThere are a number of contracts and joint venture agreements which would allow the counterparties to terminate or alter those arrangements in the event of a change of control of the Company. These arrangements are commercially confidential and their disclosure could be seriously prejudicial to the Company.\n\n## Borrowings and other financial instruments\n\nThe Group has a number of borrowing facilities provided by various banks. These facilities generally include provisions which may require any outstanding borrowings to be repaid or the alteration or termination of the facility upon the occurrence of a change of control of the Company. At 31 December 2020, these facilities were 26% drawn (2019: less than 2%).\n\nThe Group has entered into a series of financial instruments to hedge i t s currency, interest rate and commodity exposures. These contracts provide for termination or alteration in the event that a change of control of the Company materially weakens the creditworthiness of the Group.\n\n## Employee share plans\n\nIn the event of a change of control of the Company, the effect on the employee share plans would be as follows:\n\n- - Incentive Plan - deferred share awards will normally vest immediately, and may be time pro-rated. The new controlling company might offer an award in exchange instead (normally on substantially equivalent terms to the existing award).\n- - ShareSave - options would become exercisable immediately. The new controlling company might offer an equivalent option in exchange for cancellation of the existing option.\n- - Share Incentive Plan (SIP) - consideration received as shares would be held within the SIP, if possible, otherwise the consideration would be treated as a disposal from the SIP.\n- - LTIP - awards would vest on the change of control, subject to the Remuneration Committee's judgement of performance and may be reduced pro rata to service in the vesting period. Any applicable holding period will cease in the event of a change in control.\n\n## Political donations\n\nThe Company's policy is that it does not, directly or through any subsidiary, make what are commonly regarded as donations to any political party. However, the Act defines political donations very broadly and so it is possible that normal business activities, such as sponsorship, subscriptions, payment of expenses, paid leave for employees fulfilling certain public duties and support for bodies representing the business community in policy review or reform,\n\nwhich might not be thought of as political expenditure in the usual sense, could be captured. Activities of this nature would not be thought of as political donations in the ordinary sense of those words. The resolution to be proposed at the 2021 AGM, authorising political donations and expenditure, is to ensure that the Group does not commit any technical breach of the Act.\n\nDuring the year, expenses incurred by Rolls-Royce North America, Inc. in providing administrative support for the Rolls-Royce North America political action committee (PAC) was US$68,100 (2019: US$81,866). PACs are a common feature of the US political system and are governed by the Federal Election Campaign Act.\n\nThe PAC is independent of the Group and independent of any political party. The PAC funds are contributed voluntarily by employees and the Group cannot affect how they are applied, although under US law, the business expenses are paid by the employee's company. Such contributions do not count towards the limits for political donations and expenditure for which shareholder approval will be sought at this year's AGM to renew the authority given at the 2020 AGM.\n\n## Disclosures in the Strategic Report\n\nThe Board has taken advantage of section 414C(11) of the Act to include disclosures in the Strategic Report including:\n\n- - employee involvement;\n- - the employment of disabled people;\n- - the future development, performance and position of the Group; and\n- - research and development activities.\n\n## Information required by UK Listing Rule (LR) 9.8.4\n\nThere are no disclosures to be made under LR 9.8.4.\n\n## Management report\n\nThe Strategic Report and the Directors' Report together are the management report for the purposes of Rule 4.1.8R of the DTR.\n\nBy order of the Board Pamela Coles Company Secretary 11 March 2021",

        "page_content": "## Managing your shareholding\n\nYour shareholding is managed by Computershare Investor Services plc (the Registrar). When making contact with the Registrar please quote your Shareholder Reference Number (SRN). This is a 10-digit number prefixed with the letter 'C' that can be found on the right-hand side of your share certificate or in any other shareholder correspondence.\n\nYou can manage your shareholding at www.investorcentre.co.uk, speak to the Registrar on +44 (0)370 703 0162 (8.30am to 5.30pm Monday to Friday) or you can write to the Registrar at Computershare Investor Services plc, The Pavilions, Bridgwater Road, Bristol BS13 8AE.\n\nI f  you hold your shares in a share dealing account (sometimes referred to as a nominee account) then you must contact your account provider with any questions about your shareholding.\n\n## Payments to shareholders\n\nThe Company makes payments to shareholders by issuing redeemable C Shares of 0.1p each. You can redeem C Shares for cash and either take the cash or reinvest the proceeds in the C Share Reinvestment Plan (CRIP) to purchase additional ordinary shares providing you complete a payment instruction form, which is available from the Registrar. Once you have submitted your payment instruction form, you will receive cash or additional ordinary shares each time the Company issues C Shares. If you choose to receive cash we strongly recommend that you include your bank details on the payment instruction form and have payments credited directly to your bank account. This removes the risk of a cheque going astray and means that cleared payments will be credited to your bank account on the payment date.\n\nThe Board decided in 2020 that, given the uncertain macro outlook, they would not recommend a final shareholder payment for 2019 or make an interim shareholder payment for 2020. In addition, under the terms of certain of its recent loan facilities, the Company is restricted from declaring, making or paying distributions to shareholders on or prior to 31 December 2022 and from declaring, making or paying distributions to shareholders from 1 January 2023 unless certain conditions are satisfied. The restrictions on distributions do not prevent shareholders from redeeming C Shares issued in January 2020 or prior to that.\n\nShareholders wishing to redeem their existing C Shares, or participate in the CRIP must lodge instructions with the Registrar to arrive no later than 5.00pm on 1 June 2021 (CREST holders must submit their election in CREST by 2.55pm). The payment of C Share redemption monies will be made on 5 July 2021 and the CRIP purchase will begin as soon as practicable after 5 July 2021.\n\n## SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION\n\n## Share dealing\n\nThe Registrar offers shareholders an internet dealing service at www.computershare.co.uk and a telephone dealing service (+44 (0)370 703 0084). Real-time dealing is available during market hours, 8.00am to 4.30pm, Monday to Friday excluding bank holidays. Orders can still be placed outside of market hours. The fee for internet dealing is 1% of the transaction value subject to a minimum fee of \u00a330. The fee for telephone dealing is 1% of the transaction value plus \u00a350. Stamp duty of 0.5% is payable on all purchases. This service is only available to shareholders resident in certain jurisdictions. Before you can trade you must register to use the service. Other share dealing facilities are available but you should always use a firm regulated by the FCA (see www.fca.org.uk/register).\n\n## Your share certificate\n\nYour share certificate is an important document. If you sell or transfer your shares you must make sure that you have a valid share certificate in the name of Rolls-Royce Holdings plc. If you place an instruction to sell your shares and cannot provide a valid share certificate, the transaction cannot be completed and you may be liable for any costs i ncurred by the broker. If you are unable to find your share certificate, please inform the Registrar immediately.\n\n## American Depositary Receipts (ADR)\n\nADR holders should contact the depositary, JP Morgan, by calling +1 (800) 990 1135 (toll free within the US) or +1 (651) 453 2128 (outside the US) or via www.adr.com/contact/jpmorgan.\n\n## Warning to shareholders - investment scams\n\nWe are aware that some of our shareholders have received unsolicited telephone calls or correspondence, offering to buy or sell their shares at very favourable terms. The callers can be very persuasive and extremely persistent and often have professional websites and telephone numbers to support their activities.\n\nThese callers will sometimes imply a connection to Rolls-Royce and provide incorrect or misleading information. This type of call should be treated as an investment scam - the safest thing to do is hang up.\n\nYou should always check that any firm contacting you about potential investment opportunities is properly authorised by the FCA. If you deal with an unauthorised firm you will not be eligible for compensation under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. You can find out more about protecting yourself from investment scams by visiting the FCA's website at www.fca.org.uk/consumers, or by calling the FCA's consumer helpline on 0800 111 6768 (overseas callers dial +44 20 7066 1000). If you have already paid money to share fraudsters contact Action Fraud immediately on 0300 123 2040, whose website is www.actionfraud.police.uk.\n\nRemember: if it sounds too good to be true it probably is.",
