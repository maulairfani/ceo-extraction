'Building for the long term' is the course we set 45 years ago, when Paul Ricard and Jean H\u00e9mard, followed by Patrick Ricard, established the founding principle of creating long-term value for all our stakeholders. This requires our being the /uniFB01rst to seize and capitalise on every\n\ngrowth opportunity, wherever it presents itself. At a time when many companies have been compelled to hastily adapt their organisation to face the new context imposed by the Covid-19 crisis, we were already two years into our major business transformation strategy, 'Transform & Accelerate', with its 21 concrete actions to accelerate growth - a process we have been undertaking relentlessly as illustrated by the creation this year of Pernod Ricard France.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "This strategy is a crucial asset. In this uncertain period, it has helped us to both gain precious time and to concentrate on the essentials: building a smarter, sharper organisation based on solid fundamentals, underpinned by our culture and our ethos of sharing and conviviality. In 2015, we embraced a new resolutely consumer-centric approach, and in 2017 we reorganised our segmentation by product category to adopt a strategy structured around moments of consumption, or 'conviviality experiences'.  These strategies have allowed us to successfully adapt to the constantly changing consumer landscape, a reality that the pandemic has only accelerated. Our latest annual results demonstrated the resilience of our business model and our agility in adapting quickly, con/uniFB01rming the merit of our approach even in the midst of the storm. Digital acceleration, marketing transformation, acquisition of \"gem\" brands, pooling of expertise: we will continue pursuing these strategies and more in the months and years to come.\n\nYet these results are equally due to two other key factors: the /uniFB01rst is the outstanding dedication of our teams. Over the past months, they have played a decisive role, driven by their commitment to our values and their strong attachment to the company and to their craft. I was truly touched by the exceptional level of their engagement - it is thanks to them that Pernod Ricard was able to react to unprecedented disruption, by reinventing new ways of working and collaborating effectively together. This same involvement also spurred our employees around the world to put their energy into supporting the severely affected caf\u00e9, hotel and restaurant sector and our local communities: for example, by supplying millions of litres of pure alcohol and producing hand sanitiser.\n\nThe second crucial factor is the support of our investors. Their belief in the success of our strategy to create long-term value is what allows us to build for the future and work with con/uniFB01dence, staying true to the course we have set, strengthened by the unity of purpose demonstrated by our Board of Directors, whom I wholeheartedly salute for their work during the crisis.\n\nFrom our employees to our directors, backed by our investors, we have an unbeatable team to face the challenges of the post-Covid world.\n\nIn fact, this crisis brought the focus back to what is essential, showing the relevance of our vision 'Cr\u00e9ateurs de convivialit\u00e9'. More than ever, the pandemic has proved our vital need to be together, to share meaningful moments with our loved ones. Physical distancing (and not social distancing, an expression I utterly reject) is contrary to human nature. Yet we must comply. For the time being at least, we must wear masks and respect safe physical distancing in order to protect our communities. Our goal is to work every day to create the conditions that allow the moments of conviviality so vital to humanity to once again be possible in the most optimal way, beginning with the responsible consumption of our products. Equally, this crisis can be seen as a tremendous opportunity to invent innovative ways of interacting and it's been good to see new moments of conviviality appear in the shape of virtual happy hours or live stream events. Nonetheless, we will never lose sight of the fact that one day we will certainly be meeting again in our favourite bars and restaurants to celebrate our reconnection in person. It's what we do. It's our purpose. It's our nature.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Doing business with the same requirement of integrity is crucial for us wherever we are in the world. In September 2019, we successfully launched a mandatory MOOC (4) for all employees (92% completion rate so far) to ensure proper ownership of our new Code of Business Conduct which de/uniFB01nes our responsibilities in ten key areas, from the /uniFB01ght against corruption and money laundering to the protection of personal data and our brands.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## An attitude: conviviality, which defines our purpose\n\nLast but not least, conviviality is probably the most important element of our Mindset. First of all, because it gives a meaning to our three cardinal values: there can be no mutual trust or initiative without conviviality, that is to say without simple, informal, non-hierarchical, direct and transparent relationships. Secondly, because conviviality is our purpose and our m\u00e9tier . Our corporate signature 'Cr\u00e9ateurs de convivialit\u00e9' is about turning every social interaction into a genuine, friendly and responsible experience of sharing. Finally, in these uncertain times in which we need to act faster and be ever more agile, conviviality is a performance accelerator because it encourages more collaborative working. 83% of our employees believe that conviviality is what makes Pernod Ricard unique (1) .\n\n4\n\n- (1) I say survey, July 2019, Willis Towers Watson.\n\n(3) 500 Meilleurs Employeurs en France,\n\nCapital\n\nmagazine, 2020.\n\n- (4) Massive Open Online Course.",

They are our worldwide top priorities and the reference brands in each category;\n\nPrestige Brands, our portfolio of highly desirable global luxury brands, target our most affluent consumers in leading and iconic outlets all over the world. It is the industry's most comprehensive portfolio, spanning all major luxury categories and moments of conviviality;\n\nStrategic Wines cover a wide range of origins and tastes.

They bene/uniFB01t from  very strong local consumer value and loyalty, irreplaceable for some local occasions. This part of our portfolio is often a booster of our route-to-market.\n\n## PRIORITISING OUR INVESTMENTS\n\nUsing the House of Brands and in-depth consumer insight, our local Market Companies identify the potential of each brand in each market and determine their strategy based on three types of investment priorities:\n\nStars - our leading brands sold internationally or locally bene/uniFB01t from signi/uniFB01cant investment to enable them to continue leading the way in different categories and actively contribute to the Group's growth;\n\nGrowth Relays also bene/uniFB01t from increased resources as they serve to capture different moments of conviviality in highly attractive categories and, at the same time, offer a promising growth outlook in the medium and long term;\n\nBastions, which are brands that are mature or in very competitive sales categories, receive enough investment to ensure that we protect their market share, sales and pro/uniFB01ts;\n\nThe House of Brands affords us the agility to make investment choices that strike the right balance between short-, mediumand long-term goals, while continuing to build brands that win throughout our must-win geographies.",

Integrated into all Pernod Ricard activities and addressing the business from grain to glass, it's a key business driver and central to the 'Transform & Accelerate' strategic plan.\n\nResponding to major environmental and social shifts, the S&R strategy allows the Group to focus corporate priorities on what matters most to consumers. By boosting responsible innovation and building purposeful brands, Pernod Ricard is bringing to life its vision of a more convivial world without excess.\n\nA collaborative strategy. Developed through extensive consultation and collaboration between internal teams, external partners and experts, the S&R roadmap was launched in 2019 with a focus on four key pillars: Nurturing Terroir , Valuing People, Circular Making, Responsible Hosting. Each pillar has defined  commitments,  actions  and measurable targets to monitor progress. Projects are driven by multidisciplinary teams  involving  people  across  our value chain, from employees to farmers, partners and suppliers.\n\nSHAPING A MORE SUSTAINABLE AND RESPONSIBLE STYLE OF CONVIVIALITY\n\nCommitments and progress. S&R commitments address consumer needs and material risks facing the world and the Group today, such as climate change, human rights and waste. By directly supporting the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), Pernod Ricard is aligning itself with the collective effort to build sustainable prosperity by 2030. Already the Group has made strong progress in several areas,\n\nOne year into its 2030 Sustainability and Responsibility (S&R) roadmap - 'Good Times from a Good Place', Pernod Ricard is progressing strongly. A strategy that is proving an important lever to accelerate transformation and highly relevant to our consumer concerns in  the new context of Covid-19 as we move towards a greener and more inclusive economy.\n\nfor example all sites in France are now powered by 100% renewable electricity and single-use plastic  point-of-sale items will be eliminated by 2021 - four years ahead of schedule.\n\nGuiding  short  and  long-term priorities. A  structured  roadmap gives clear future direction as well as strengthening business resilience in the face of immediate challenges. It has empowered the Group to navigate\n\nthrough the Covid-19 crisis, which signi/uniFB01cantly impacted the drinks and hospitality sectors, while continuing to support employees and business partners.\n\n'Good Times from a Good Place' is a long-term strategy that is right, relevant and ready for the future: to shape a more sustainable and responsible style of conviviality.",

To create shared value for all our stakeholders, we are continuously reinforcing our commitments to human rights, diversity and inclusion across our leadership, health and safety, responsible procurement, training and sustainable bartending.\n\n## CIRCULAR MAKING\n\nThe world is made of /uniFB01nite resources that are under huge pressure. By contributing to 'Responsible Consumption & Production' (SDG 12) and protecting 'Life Below Water' (SDG 14) our goal is to help preserve natural resources.

To ensure we maintain healthy and resilient ecosystems that allow us to continue producing quality products for the generations to come, we are committed to nurturing every terroir and its biodiversity. To address our agricultural footprint across the 250,000 hectares from which we source our ingredients, we are developing sustainable and regenerative agricultural practices to be implemented across our business.\n\n## RESPONSIBLE HOSTING\n\nWe believe that we have an important part to play in combating alcohol misuse and supporting 'Health and Well-being' (SDG 3), through our responsible drinking programmes and campaigns, and our commitment to responsible marketing and consumer information. To that end, we will continue building 'Partnerships for Goals' (SDG 17) at a local and global level.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It's\n\ncreated a library of online training resources enabling employees to build up their skills. For our bartending community, we developed in partnership with Trash Tiki 'an anti-waste bartending duo', and the Sustainable Restaurant Association, a free sustainability and responsibility hospitality e-learning module, which was uploaded on the United Nations' Educate All platform to promote the Bar World of Tomorrow.\n\nDiversity and inclusion actions have helped us close the gap (currently 2.3%) towards equal pay across our business, by 2022.

The Board members, who bring together complementary skills and experience, ensure that the Group pursues its business strategy with the primary goal of increasing the value of the Group.\n\n## ORGANISATION\n\nIn accordance with the AFEP-MEDEF Code of Corporate Governance for listed companies, Pernod Ricard respects the independence criteria established in the Code. The Board is comprised of 14 members, eight of whom are independent and two of whom represent Group employees. Following the recommendation of the Nominations, Governance and CSR Committee, as of 23 January 2019, the Board appointed a Lead Independent Director.\n\nThe Internal Regulations stipulate that the Board members must meet at least six times per year for meetings that are presided by the Chairman of the Board, who is also Pernod Ricard's Chief Executive Officer. The Chairman reports on the Board's progress at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting. The Chairman is tasked with ensuring that the Group's bodies run smoothly, which includes providing the Directors with the information and the resources they need to ful/uniFB01l their duties. The role of the Lead Independent Director is notably to convene and chair the meetings of the Board of Directors in the absence of the Chairman and CEO, conduct the annual assessment of the functioning of the Board of Directors on the basis of individual interviews with each Director, prevent the occurrence of con/uniFB02ict of interest situations, ensure compliance with the rules of the AFEP-MEDEF Code and the Board's Internal Rules and Regulations, convene and chair the Executive Session, review shareholders' requests for corporate governance and ensure that they are answered and meet with the Company's investors. In order to further root its work in the Group's daily business operations, the Board holds one meeting per year in an operating affiliate.\n\n## FY20 ACTIVITY\n\nOver the course of FY20, the Board met nine times, with an attendance rate of 100%.

The Strategic Committee - created and presided by Alexandre Ricard since 2015 - reviews key subjects for the Group, issues recommendations on acquisitions, divestitures and partnership projects and studies all strategic matters of interest to the Group. The Audit Committee notably reviews the half-year and annual draft /uniFB01nancial statements, monitors the Group's cash /uniFB02ow and debt situation and assesses the Group's risk management and internal control systems. The Nominations, Governance & CSR Committee notably proposes new Directors and reviews the composition and operation of the Board, CSR issues and the Group's performance and talent-management policy.

In  addition,  in  order  to  provide  the  checks  and balances  necessary  in  the  exercise  of  such  powers,  as  well  as  good governance, the Company sought to establish guarantees, notably:\n\n- as part of the Group's General Management, the Chairman and CEO \u0097 relies on two management bodies: the Executive Board, which endorses all major decisions relating  to  the  Group's  strategy, and the Executive Committee, which ensures coordination between the  Headquarters  and  its  affiliates,  in  accordance  with  the  Group's decentralised model;\n\n## Powers of the Chairman and CEO 2.4.2\n\nAs Chairman of the Board of Directors, the Chairman and CEO organises and  leads  the  Board's  work,  on  which  he  reports  to  the  Shareholders' Meeting. He oversees the proper operation of the Company's managing bodies and ensures, in particular, that the Directors are in a position to fulfil  their  duties.  He  can  also  request  any  document  or  information which can be used to help the Board in preparing its meetings.\n\nAs Chief Executive Officer, the Chairman and CEO is granted full powers to  act  in  the  name  of  the  Company  under  any  circumstances. He exercises  these  powers  within  the  limits  of  the  corporate  purpose and subject to the powers expressly granted by law to the Shareholders' Meetings and to the Board, and within the internal limits as defined by the Board of Directors and its Internal Regulations (2) .\n\n## Limitation on the powers of the Chairman and CEO 2.4.3\n\nFor  internal  purposes,  following  the  decision  made  by  the  Board  of Directors  on  11 February  2015  and  in  accordance  with  article 2  of  the Board's Internal Regulations (2) , prior to making a commitment on behalf of the Company, the Chairman and CEO must obtain prior authorisation from  the  Board  of  Directors  for  any  significant  transactions  that  fall outside  the  strategy  announced  by  the  Company,  as  well  as  the following transactions:\n\n- carrying out acquisitions, transfers of ownership or disposals of assets \u0097 and property rights and making investments for an amount exceeding \u20ac100 million per transaction;\n- signing any agreements to make investments in, or participate in joint \u0097 ventures  with,  any  other  French  or  non-French  companies,  except with an affiliate of Pernod Ricard (as defined in article L. 233-1 of the French Commercial Code);\n- making any investments or taking any shareholding in any company, \u0097 partnership or investment vehicle, whether established or yet to be established, through subscription or contribution in cash or in kind, through the purchase of shares, ownership rights or other securities, and  more  generally  in  any  form  whatsoever,  for  an  amount  above \u20ac100 million per transaction;\n- granting  loans,  credits  and  advances  in  excess  of  \u20ac100 million  per \u0097 borrower, except when the borrower is an affiliate of Pernod Ricard (as  defined  in  article L. 233-1  of  the  French  Commercial  Code) and with the exception of loans granted for less than one year;\n- borrowing, with or without granting a guarantee on corporate assets, \u0097 in  excess  of  \u20ac200 million  in  the  same  financial  year,  except  from affiliates of Pernod Ricard (as defined in article L. 233-1 of the French Commercial Code), for which there is no limit;\n- granting  pledges,  sureties  or  guarantees,  except  with  express \u0097 delegation of authority from the Board of Directors, within the limits provided  for  by  articles L. 225-35  and  R. 225-28  of  the  French Commercial Code; and\n- selling shareholdings  with  an  enterprise  value  in  excess  of \u0097 \u20ac100 million.\n\nOn 8 November 2019, the Board of Directors authorised the Chairman and  CEO,  for  a  period  of  one  year,  to  grant  pledges,  sureties  or guarantees  in  the  name  of  the  Company  up  to  an  overall  limit  of \u20ac100 million,  and  for  an  unlimited  amount  to  tax  and  customs authorities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- limitations on the powers of the Chairman and CEO by the Board of \u0097 Directors: prior authorisation by the Board of Directors is necessary in particular  for  external  growth  transactions  or  disinvestments  for amounts  greater  than  \u20ac100 million  and  for  loans  exceeding \u20ac200 million  (see  the  subsection  'Limitation  on  the  powers  of  the Chairman and CEO' hereinafter); and\n- four  specialised  Committees,  responsible  for  preparing  the  work  of \u0097 the Board of Directors relating to the following topics: compensation; audit; nominations, governance and CSR; and strategy.

She  has  also  met  a  large  part  of  the  teams  of Pernod  Ricard  and  some  of  its  affiliates.  Furthermore,  she  conducted the annual assessment of the functioning of the Board of Directors on the  basis  of  individual  interviews  with  each  Director  as  described  in paragraph 2.6.4 below.\n\nThe Lead Independent Director reports to the Board of Directors once a year  on  the  performance  of  her  duties.  At  Shareholders'  Meetings, she may be invited by the Chairman and CEO to report on her activities. It is specified  that  the  loss  of  independent  status  would  immediately terminate the functions of the Lead Independent Director.\n\n## Reference Corporate Governance Code: AFEP-MEDEF Code 2.4.5\n\nOn 12 February 2009, the Board of Directors of Pernod Ricard confirmed that the AFEP-MEDEF  Corporate  Governance  Code  of  listed corporations published in December 2008 and last revised in June 2020 (the 'AFEP-MEDEF Code'), available on the AFEP and MEDEF websites, was the Code to which Pernod Ricard refers in order notably to prepare the report required by article L. 225-37 of the French Commercial Code.\n\nIn accordance  with  the  'Comply  or  Explain'  rule  set  forth  in article L. 225-37-4  of  the  French  Commercial  Code  and  referred  to  in article 27.1  of  the  AFEP-MEDEF  Code,  the  Company  considers  that  its practices comply with the recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF Code.\n\n## Composition of the Board of Directors 2.5\n\n## General rules concerning the composition of the Board of Directors 2.5.1 and the appointment of Directors\n\nThe members of the Board of Directors are listed above.\n\nThe  legal  and  statutory  rules  set  out  in  articles 16 et  seq. of  the Company's bylaws govern the appointment and dismissal of members of the Board of Directors and are described below. The Board of Directors of  the  Company  comprises  no  fewer  than  three  and  no  more  than 18 members, unless otherwise authorised by law. In accordance with the Company's bylaws, each Director must own at least 50 Company shares in registered form. However, the Board's Internal Regulations recommend that, during their term of office and no later than two years following  their  appointment,  Directors  acquire  a  minimum  number  of Company  shares  equivalent  to  one  year's  worth  of  compensation (fixed and variable portions) payable to a Director who has attended all meetings of the Board of Directors (excluding compensation related to participation in Committees) (1) .\n\nThe members of the Board of Directors are appointed by the Ordinary Shareholders'  Meeting  and  are  proposed  by  the  Board  of  Directors following  the  recommendations  of  the  Nominations,  Governance and CSR Committee. They can be dismissed at any time by decision of the Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  law  of  22 May  2019  on  business  growth  and transformation (PACTE law) and the Company's bylaws, the number of Directors  representing  the  employees  who  are  members  of  the  Board depends on the number of Directors of the Board. Following the General Meeting of 9 November 2017, one Director representing employees was appointed by the Group Committee (France) on 13 December 2017 to sit on  the  Board  of  Directors  for  four  years.  As  the  Company's  Board  of Directors  comprises  12 members,  a  second  Director  representing  the employees  was  appointed  by  the  European  Group  Committee  on 5 December 2018.\n\nA  representative  of  the  Company's  Economic  and  Social  Committee attends the meetings of the Board of Directors in an advisory role.\n\nThe Board of Directors may, upon a proposal from its Chairman, appoint one  or  more  censors,  who  may  be  either  individuals  or  legal  entities and who may or may not be shareholders.\n\nThe  term  of  office  of  each  Director  is  four  years.  However,  on  an exceptional basis, the Shareholders' Meeting may, following the Board of Directors' proposal, appoint Directors or renew their term of office for a period of two years so as to enable a staggered renewal of the Board of Directors.",

However,  the Nominations,  Governance  and  CSR  Committee  and  the Board of Directors wish to propose the renewal of his directorship as a non-Independent Director, so that Mr Wolfgang Colberg can continue to  contribute  his  expertise,  and  financial  expertise  in  particular, and in-depth knowledge of the Pernod Ricard Group to the Board.\n\nIn  addition,  Mr Gilles  Samyn has informed the Board of Directors of his decision  to  resign  from  his  position  as  Director  at  the  close  of  the Shareholders' Meeting of 27 November 2020.\n\nThus, at the close of the Shareholders' Meeting of 27 November 2020, the  Board  of  Directors  would  comprise  13  members  (including  two Directors  representing  the  employees),  of  which  six  Independent Directors  (54.5%)  and  five  women  (45%),  in  accordance  with  the recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF Code and the law on balanced representation  of  women  and  men  within  Boards  of  Directors  and professional  equality.  Additionally,  five  Directors  would  be  of  foreign nationality.\n\nTherefore, the Board of Directors and the Nominations, Governance and CSR Committee use the following criteria to assess the independence of Directors in their annual review as well as in the event of a co-option, an appointment or a renewal.",

Please  note that  Mr Ian  Gallienne's  experience  in  finance  as  well  as  his  in-depth knowledge  of  the  Group  are  an  asset  to  the  Board  of  Directors  of Pernod Ricard.\n\nAccording  to  the  AFEP-MEDEF  Code,  Directors  representing  major shareholders of the Company  may  be  considered  as  being independent, provided that these shareholders do not take part in the control of the Company (criterion 8). At each crossing of a threshold of 10%  of  share  capital  or  voting  rights,  the  Board  of  Directors,  on  the recommendation of the Nominations, Governance and CSR Committee, is  required  to  systematically  review  a  Director's  independence  in  the light  of  the  composition  of  the  Company's  share  capital  and  the existence of a potential conflict of interest.\n\nAccordingly, it has been established that GBL does not participate in the control of Pernod Ricard and does not intend to do so as stated in the  notification  of  threshold  crossing  published  by  the  AMF  on 23 February 2017:\n\n- GBL has no relation with any other shareholder or the Ricard family, \u0097 the Group's reference shareholder; and\n- Mr Ian Gallienne does not chair any of the Board Committees and is \u0097 not a member of the Nominations, Governance and CSR Committee.\n\nThe Nominations, Governance and CSR Committee and the Board of Directors also noted the absence of conflicts of interest, since:\n\n- there  is  no  significant  business  relationship  between  GBL  and \u0097 Pernod Ricard or its Group that could create a situation of conflict of interest and which could compromise Mr Ian Gallienne's freedom of judgement;\n- GBL's capital entry was made independently of any agreement with \u0097 Pernod Ricard or the Ricard family;\n- given the composition of Pernod Ricard's share capital, \u0097 which includes  shareholders  with  a  larger  equity  stake,  GBL  is  not the dominant shareholder;\n- there is no agreement between GBL and Pernod Ricard or the Ricard \u0097 family  relating  to  the  presence  of  Mr Ian  Gallienne  or  one  or  more GBL  representatives  on  the  Board  of  Directors.  The  presence  of Mr Ian  Gallienne  is  justified  by  his  experience  and  his  judgement, which are beneficial to the Board of Directors; and\n- Mr Ian Gallienne is not in a position to impose his view on the Board \u0097 of Directors, which  has  14 members  (including  the  Directors representing the employees).\n\nThus,  these  elements  demonstrate  freedom  of  judgement  and  an absence of an actual or potential conflict of interest. In addition, it should be noted that there is no new element likely to call into question the qualification of independent retained in the past.\n\nGiven these facts, the Nominations, Governance and CSR Committee and the Board of Directors considered that Mr Ian Gallienne fully met the  'specific'  independence  criteria  linked  to  the  crossing  of  the threshold of 10% in share capital or voting rights.\n\nAfter  consideration  and  review  of  the  AFEP-MEDEF  Code  criteria recalled above, the Board of Directors' meeting held on 22 July 2020, following  the  recommendation  of  the  Nominations,  Governance  and\n\nCSR  Committee,  confirmed  that  eight  out  of  12  Board  members (excluding  the  Directors  representing  the  employees)  are  deemed  to be  independent:  Ms Patricia  Barbizet,  Ms Esther  Berrozpe  Galindo, Ms Anne Lange and Ms Kory Sorenson and Messrs Wolfgang Colberg, Ian Gallienne, Gilles Samyn and Philippe Petitcolin, representing more than  half  of  the  Board  of  Directors  (66.66%),  as  required  by  the AFEP-MEDEF Code.\n\n## Succession plan 2.5.4\n\nThe Nominations, Governance and CSR Committee, at the initiative of its Chairwoman,  Lead  Independent  Director  of  the  Board,  periodically reviews  the  Group's  succession  plan.  This  allows  her  to  establish  and update a succession plan covering several time horizons:\n\n- short term: unexpected succession (resignation, incapacity, death); \u0097\n- medium  term:  accelerated  succession  (poor  performance,  lack  of \u0097 management); and\n- long term: planned succession (retirement, end of the term of office). \u0097\n\nThe  Nominations,  Governance  and  CSR  Committee  favours  close collaboration  with  General  Management  in  order  to  ensure  overall consistency of the succession plan and to ensure a continuity in the key  positions.  In  order  to  ensure  the  optimal  development  of  the succession plan for the governing bodies and to meet the Company's strategic ambitions, a regular assessment of potential candidates, their careers  and  developments  is  carried  out  with  the  assistance  of  an independent firm.\n\nIn  addition,  the  Nominations,  Governance  and  CSR  Committee  works closely with the Board of Directors on this subject, and is particularly vigilant in maintaining the confidentiality of this information.\n\n## Directors' Code of Conduct 2.5.5\n\nArticle 5 of the Internal Regulations, adopted by the Board of Directors on  17 December  2002,  most  recently  amended  on  8 August  2019, and article 16 of the bylaws stipulate the rules of conduct that apply to Directors and their permanent representatives. Each Director acknowledges that he/she has read and understood these undertakings prior to accepting the office. The Internal Regulations also outline the various  rules  in  force  with  regard  to  the  conditions  for  trading  in  the Company's  shares  on  the  stock  market  and  the  notification  and publication requirements relating thereto.\n\nMoreover, the Board of Directors' meeting of 16 February 2011 adopted a  Code  of  Conduct  to  prevent  insider  trading  and  misconduct  in compliance  with  new  legal  undertakings.  This  Code  was  updated  on 3 January 2019 to comply with European regulations on market abuse.\n\nAs  the  Directors  have  sensitive  information  on  a  regular  basis, they must refrain from using this information to buy or sell shares of the Company and from carrying out transactions involving Pernod Ricard's shares or any related financial instruments in the forty-five days prior to the  publication  of  the  full-year  results,  the  thirty  days  prior  to  the publication  of  the  half-year  results  and  the  fifteen  days  prior  to  the publication of  quarterly  net  sales.  This  period  is  extended  to  the  day after the announcement when it is made after the close of the markets (5.30pm,  Paris  time)  and  to  the  day  of  the  announcement  when  it  is made  before  the  opening  of  the  markets  (9.00am,  Paris  time). In addition, the Code of Conduct states that they must seek the advice of  the  Ethics  Committee  before  making  any  transactions  involving the Company's shares or any related financial instrument.",

The  Charter  is  available  on  the  Company's  website. It is specified  that  this  Charter  formalises  the  process  implemented  to identify  the  regulated  agreements  and  that  such  process  is  followed prior to concluding, amending, renewing or terminating any agreements which would potentially be qualified as regulated, it being specified that the process applies to agreements considered as 'free' at the time of conclusion.\n\n## Shareholders' agreements\n\nOn  8 February  2006,  Pernod  Ricard  was  notified  that  a  shareholders' agreement had been signed between Mr Rafa\u00ebl Gonzalez-Gallarza and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Paul Ricard. Pursuant to this agreement, Mr Rafa\u00ebl Gonzalez-Gallarza  undertakes  to  consult  Soci\u00e9t\u00e9  Paul  Ricard  prior  to any Pernod Ricard Shareholders' Meeting in order for them to vote the same way. Furthermore, Mr Rafa\u00ebl Gonzalez-Gallarza undertook to notify\n\nSoci\u00e9t\u00e9 Paul Ricard of any additional purchase of Pernod Ricard shares and/or  voting  rights,  and  also  undertook  not  to  purchase  any Pernod Ricard  shares  if  such  a  transaction  would  force  Soci\u00e9t\u00e9  Paul Ricard  and  the  parties  acting  in  concert  to  launch  a  public  offer  for Pernod Ricard. Finally, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Paul Ricard has a pre-emption right with regard to any Pernod Ricard shares of which Mr Rafa\u00ebl Gonzalez-Gallarza may wish to dispose.\n\n## Absence of conviction for fraud, association with bankruptcy or any offence and/or official public sanction\n\nTo Pernod Ricard's knowledge and at the date hereof:\n\n- no conviction for fraud has been issued against any members of the \u0097 Company's Board of Directors or General Management over the last five years;\n- none  of  the  members  of  the  Board  of  Directors  or  General \u0097 Management has been associated, over the last five years, with any bankruptcy, compulsory administration or liquidation as a member of a Board of Directors, Management Board or Supervisory Board or as a Chief Executive Officer;\n- no conviction and/or official public sanction has been issued over the \u0097 last  five  years  against  any  members  of  the  Company's  Board  of Directors  or  General  Management  by  statutory  or  regulatory authorities (including designated professional organisations); and\n- no Director or member of the General Management has, over the last \u0097 five  years,  been  prohibited  by  a  court  of  law  from  serving  as  a member of a Board of Directors, a Management Board or Supervisory Board or from being involved in the management or the running of an issuer's business affairs.\n\n## Services agreements\n\nNo  member  of  the  Board  of  Directors  or  member  of  the  General Management has any service agreement with Pernod Ricard or any of its affiliates.\n\n## Employee representatives\n\nThe appointment of Directors representing the employees to the Board of Directors was introduced in late 2013. As a result, the employees of Pernod Ricard SA are now represented on the Board of Directors by a single person, currently Mr Herv\u00e9 Jouanno.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Internal Regulations of the Board of Directors specify the rules and operations of the Board, and supplement the relevant laws, regulations and bylaws. In particular, they remind the Directors of the rules on diligence, confidentiality and disclosure of possible conflicts of interest.\n\n## Meetings of the Board of Directors 2.6.1\n\nIt is the responsibility of the Chairman to call meetings of the Board of Directors  regularly,  or  at  times  that  he  or  she  considers  appropriate. In order to enable the Board to review and discuss in detail the matters falling  within  their  area  of  responsibility,  the  Internal  Regulations provide  that  Board  meetings  must  be  held  at  least  six  times  a  year. In particular, the Chairman of the Board of Directors ensures that Board meetings are held to close the interim and annual financial statements and to convene the Shareholders' Meeting in charge of approving said statements.\n\nBoard  meetings  are  called  by  the  Chairman.  The  notice  of  the  Board meeting, sent to the Directors at least eight days before the date of the\n\nmeeting  except  in  the  event  of  a  duly  substantiated  emergency, must set the agenda and state where the meeting will take place, which will be, in principle, the Company's registered office. Board meetings may also  be  held  by  video  conference  or  teleconference,  under  the conditions  provided  for  in  the  applicable  regulations  and  the  Internal Regulations.\n\nSince FY17, the Directors hold a session at least once a year without the Directors  from  the  Group  Top  Management  (Executive  Sessions). The purpose of these Executive Sessions is to assess the operation of the Board of Directors. One Executive Session was held in FY20.\n\n## Information provided to the Directors 2.6.2\n\nThe  Directors  receive  the  information  they  require  to  fulfil  their  duty. In accordance with the Internal Regulations, the supporting documents pertaining  to  matters  on  the  agenda  are  provided  far  enough  in advance,  generally,  eight  days  before  the  meetings  of  the  Board, to enable them to prepare effectively for each meeting.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA  Director  may  ask  for  explanations  or  for  additional  information  and, more  generally,  submit  to  the  Chairman  or  the  Lead  Independent Director any request for information or access to information which he or she deems appropriate.",

(3)\n- During FY20, and since the appointments of Ms Esther Berrozpe Galindo and Mr Philippe Petitcolin as Directors, five meetings of the Board of Directors were held. (4)\n- One meeting of the Audit Committee has been held since 22 April 2020, when Mr Philippe Petitcolin was appointed by the Board of Directors as a member of the Audit (5) Committee on the proposal of the Nominations, Governance and CSR Committee.\n\n## Board of Directors' review 2.6.4\n\nThe Board of Directors includes on its agenda a regular discussion on its operation at least once a year and focuses in particular on the following areas:\n\n- a review of its composition, operation and structure; and \u0097\n- a  check  that  significant  issues  are  adequately  prepared  and \u0097 discussed.\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  AFEP-MEDEF  Code  and  with  its  Internal Regulations, the Nominations, Governance and CSR Committee and the Board have carried out an annual assessment of their operations.\n\nThe  last  triennial  external  and  formalised  review  of  the  functioning  of the Board of Directors and its Committees was performed during FY18 with  the  help  of  an  external  consulting  firm  specialised  in  corporate governance  issues,  which  conducted  individual  interviews  with  each Director using a formalised interview guide.\n\nThis  year,  Ms Patricia  Barbizet,  Lead  Independent  Director,  conducted the  internal  review  of  the  Board's  operations  through  individual interviews with each Director. She reported on the results to both the Nominations,  Governance  and  CSR  Committee  and  the  Board  of Directors.\n\nThis review highlights that, as previously mentioned, the members of the Board of Directors are satisfied with the Board operations and mention notably the continuation this year of the premiumisation, with the addition of new profiles at the last Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nAs part of an ongoing drive for improvement, the Directors called for a more intense focus on areas such as talent management, the impact of the  geopolitical  context  on  the  spirits  industry,  and  the  impact  of innovation and technology on products and business lines.\n\nFurthermore, they emphasised the increasing importance of CSR issues for  the  Group  and  the  corresponding  place  that  these  subjects  have taken  in  the  debates  of  the  Board  and  the  Nominations,  Governance and CSR Committee.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Market practice is also a reference that is taken into account. Studies are regularly conducted with the assistance of  consulting  firms  to  measure  compensation  levels  and  structures  in relation to panels of comparable companies (in terms of both size and scope).\n\n## Comprehensiveness and balance\n\nAll  components  of  the  compensation  and  other  benefits  are  analysed exhaustively  each  year  using  an  element-by-element  approach  and then  an  analysis  of  overall  consistency  to  achieve  the  best  balance between  fixed  and  variable,  individual  and  collective  and  short-  and long-term compensation.\n\n## Coherence\n\nThe  Compensation  Committee  is  informed  annually  of  the  terms  and conditions of compensation and employment of the Group's employees. It  is  therefore  able  to  propose  to  the  Board  of  Directors  a  coherent compensation policy for the Executive Director, in particular in relation to that of the Group's Senior Managers.\n\n## Motivation and performance\n\nIn  its  recommendations  to  the  Board  of  Directors,  the  Compensation Committee seeks to propose a compensation policy commensurate with the  responsibilities  of  the  recipients  and  in  line  with  the  practices  of comparable  large  international  corporations  and  seeks  to  maintain  a good balance between fixed compensation, variable annual compensation and long-term compensation. Lastly, with regard to the Executive  Director  specifically,  the  variable  compensation  policy (in particular  the  criteria  for  the  annual  variable  portion  and  the performance  conditions  for  stock  options  and  performance-based shares)  is kept  under  regular  review,  based  on  the  Group's  strategic priorities and in a way that is aligned with shareholders' interests.\n\n## Intelligibility of the rules\n\nThe  Group  ensures  that  the  compensation  policy  is  simple  and  that each of the rules set out in this document is clear enough for everyone to understand.\n\n## Measurement\n\nThe  Group  endeavours  to  strike  the  right  balance  when  setting  the compensation policy, taking into account the interests of the Company, market practices, management performance and stakeholders.\n\n## Review\n\nThe Group's compensation policy is reviewed at least once a year by the Board of Directors on the proposal of the Compensation Committee to take into account changes in laws and regulations, best practices and recommendations,  codes  of  corporate  governance  and  shareholder votes  and,  where  applicable,  the  opinions  expressed  at  Shareholders' Meetings.\n\n## Implementation\n\nOn the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, the Board of Directors ensures that the policy is applied in accordance with the rules approved by the Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nThe Group works to ensure that the compensation system is coherent and that payment of employees is fair.\n\n## Governance\n\nThe determination, review and implementation of compensation policies for corporate officers are established by the Board of Directors, on the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, and then submitted to  the  Shareholders'  Meeting.  The  Compensation  Committee  ensures the  strict  application  of  all  of  those  policies  in  accordance  with  the above-mentioned principles.\n\n## Conflicts of interest\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  and  the  Compensation  Committee  ensure  the prevention and management of any conflicts of interest that may arise in  this  decision-making  process.  As  a  result,  the  Chairman  &  CEO refrains  from  taking  part  in  deliberations  and  voting  on  policies  that concern  him.  In  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  the  AFEP-MEDEF Code, an independent Director is a non-executive corporate officer of the Company or its Group and has no special ties with them.\n\n## Compliance with the corporate interest and relationship to strategy\n\nThe  compensation  policy  adopted  by  the  Board  of  Directors  includes incentives  that  reflect  the  Group's  strategy  of  long-term  profitable growth through responsible actions and compliance with the interests of the Company and its shareholders, both in terms of the correlation of compensation  with  the  Company's  short-  and  long-term  performance and in terms of the policy of giving the executive a share of the capital and the associated share of risk.\n\nThis compensation policy, which reflects the interests of the Company, helps to secure the Group's long-term future and is part of its business strategy.  The  performance  conditions  of  the  compensation  policy  for corporate  officers  are  directly  linked  to  the  Group's  performance metrics.\n\nThus, the compensation policy of corporate cfficers:\n\n- reinforces  the  alignment  of  the  interests  of  the  Executive  Director \u0097 with the Company's corporate interest insofar as it is in line with and supports the Company's strategy; and\n- contributes to the Company's sustainability thanks in particular to its \u0097 long-term compensation policy and its loyalty-building effects as well as its incentives for sustainable performance.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  Chairman  of  the  Audit  Committee  receives  an additional sum of \u20ac14,000, while the Chairwomen of the Compensation Committee and the Nominations, Governance and CSR Committee each receive an additional \u20ac8,500.\n\nThe Lead Independent Director receives additional annual compensation of \u20ac40,000.\n\nDirectors are also eligible for a variable portion, calculated on the basis of  their  attendance  at  Board  and  Committee  meetings.  The  variable portion is \u20ac4,000 per meeting.\n\nFurthermore,  in  order  to  take  account  of  distance  constraints, an additional premium of \u20ac1,500 is paid to Directors who are not French tax  residents,  when  they  attend  Board  and/or  Committee  meetings. Directors  who  take  part  in  Board  meetings  by  video  conference  or conference call are not eligible for this additional amount.\n\nAs  compensation,  the  Directors  representing  the  employees  receive  a fixed annual payment of \u20ac15,000 in respect of Directors' fees for their attendance at meetings of the Board of Directors and, as appropriate, those  of  the  Board  of  Directors'  Committee(s)  of  which  they  are members.\n\nThe Chairman and CEO does not receive compensation in respect of his office as a Director.\n\nOf  the  \u20ac1,250,000  allocated  by  the  Shareholders'  Meeting  of 8 November  2019,  total  compensation  of  \u20ac1,118,083  was  paid  to Directors in FY20, in accordance with the rules set out above.\n\nFor FY21, no change will be made to the amount and allocation of the budget applied for FY20.\n\n## Compensation policy for the Chairman 2.8.1.3 & CEO (12 th resolution)\n\nPresented below,  in  accordance  with  article L. 225-37-2  of  the  French Commercial  Code,  is  the  report  of  the  Board  of  Directors  on  the compensation  policy  for  the  Chairman  and  CEO  (hereinafter  the 'Executive Director'), which will be submitted to shareholders for their approval.\n\nAccordingly, the Shareholders' Meeting of 27 November 2020 (in its 12 th resolution  appearing  in  Section  8  'Combined  Shareholders' Meeting'  of  this  universal  registration  document)  will  be  asked  to approve  the  following  elements  of  the  compensation  policy  of  the Executive Director.\n\nThis  report  was  prepared  under  the  supervision  of  the  Compensation Committee  and  makes  no  substantial  changes  to  the  compensation policy  previously  approved  by  94.63%  of  the  shareholders  at  the Shareholders' Meeting of 8 November 2019.\n\n## Compensation structure\n\nThe structure of the Executive Director's compensation consists mainly of:\n\n- cash compensation comprising a fixed portion and an annual variable \u0097 portion  directly  related  to  his  or  her  individual  performance  and contribution to the Group's performance; and\n- capital  compensation  in  the  form  of  an  allocation  of  shares  whose \u0097 vesting is  subject  to  the  achievement  of  performance conditions in line with shareholders' interests.\n\nThis  compensation  structure  is  consistent  with  that  offered  to  the Group's  senior  executives.  Each  of  the  compensation  component  is complementary and meets different objectives.\n\nThe components of the compensation structure are balanced and are allocated as follows:\n\n- 60/40 between cash compensation and share-based compensation; \u0097\n- 60/40  between  fixed  compensation  and  annual  variable  and \u0097 long-term compensation;\n- 75/25 between performance-based compensation and \u0097 non-performance-based compensation.\n\n## Fixed annual compensation\n\nThe  fixed  portion  of  the  compensation  of  the  Executive  Director  is determined based on:\n\n- the level and complexity of their responsibilities; \u0097\n- their experience  and  their  career  history,  particularly  within \u0097 the Group;\n- his/her individual performance; and \u0097\n- market analyses for comparable functions. \u0097",

However, an early review might occur in the event of significant changes to their scope of responsibilities or a major deviation compared to the market positioning. In these specific situations, the adjustment of the fixed compensation and the reasons for it will be made public.\n\nFinally,  the  Board  of  Directors  has  decided  that,  in  the  event  of  the appointment of a new Chairman and CEO, a new Chief Executive Officer or  new  Deputy  Chief  Executive  Officer(s),  these  same  principles  will apply.\n\nOn 28 August 2018, on a proposal from the Compensation Committee, the Board  of  Directors  decided  to  increase  the  fixed  annual compensation of Mr Alexandre Ricard to \u20ac1,100,000 until the end of his term  of  office.  In  light  of  the  exceptional  circumstances,  on  the recommendation  of  the  Compensation  Committee,  the  Board  of Directors  decided,  on  1  September  2020,  to  postpone  the  review  of Mr Alexandre Ricard's compensation to next year, despite the exceedingly high quality of his performance and the renewal of his term of office. The gross annual fixed compensation of Mr Alexandre Ricard will be maintained at \u20ac1,100,000 for FY21.\n\n## Compensation as Chairman of the Board\n\nThe Executive Director does not receive compensation for offices he or she holds in the Company or in Group companies.\n\n## Variable annual portion\n\nThe  purpose  of  variable  annual  compensation  is  to  compensate  the performance  achieved  during  the  financial  year  by  the  Executive Director in terms of the annual performance objectives set by the Board of Directors in accordance with the corporate strategy. Pursuant to the provisions  of  article L. 225-37-2  of  the  French  Commercial  Code, the payment  of  variable  annual  compensation  is  conditional  upon  its prior approval by the Ordinary Shareholders' Meeting (voting 'ex post').\n\nMore specifically,  this  variable  portion  is  based  on  performance  levels applying  to  financial  and  non-financial  parameters,  representative  of expected overall performance.\n\nThis  variable  portion  is  expressed  as  a  percentage  of  the  annual  fixed portion.  It  may  vary  between  0%  and  110%  if  the  quantitative  and qualitative  objectives  are  achieved  (target  level)  and  may  rise  to  a maximum  of  180%  if  the  Group  records  exceptional  financial  and non-financial performance in relation to the objectives.\n\n## PERFORMANCE CRITERIA\n\nThe criteria  are  reviewed  regularly  to  ensure  they  are  in  line  with  the Company  long-term  strategy  and  may  be  modified  on  an  occasional basis.  For  FY21,  the  Board  of  Directors,  on  the  recommendation  of  the Compensation  Committee,  proposes  the  application  of  the  following criteria:\n\n- achievement of the target for profit from recurring operations, \u0097 restated  for  foreign  exchange  and  scope  effects:  target  20%  and maximum 37.5% if significantly exceeded. This criterion, intended to provide  an  incentive  to  exceed  the  target  for  Profit  from  recurring operations, is one of the key elements of the Group's decentralised structure. This concept of commitment to the budgeted Profit from recurring  operations  helps  to  bring  together  all  of  the  structures, which are rewarded according to the extent to which they meet their own targets for Profit from recurring operations.\n\nThis criterion rewards the management performance of the Executive Director;\n\n- achievement of the target  for  Group  net  profit  from  recurring \u0097 operations, restated for foreign exchange and scope effects: target 20% and maximum 37.5% if significantly exceeded. This criterion takes into  account  all  of  the  Group's  financial  data  that  fall  under  the Executive  Director's  responsibility  for  the  financial  year  and  thus makes  it  possible  for  his  compensation  to  be  aligned  as  closely  as possible with that of the shareholders;\n- achievement  of  the  target  for  recurring  free  cash  flow, \u0097 restated for  foreign  exchange  and  scope  effects:  target  20%  and maximum 37.5% if significantly exceeded. This criterion measures the Group's financial performance and value creation;\n- cash conversion, restated for foreign exchange and scope effects: \u0097 target 20% and maximum  37.5% if significantly exceeded. The inclusion of this criterion in the calculation of the variable portion of  the  Executive Director's compensation is in line with the Group's strategy in that it rewards good cash management, regardless of the level of achievement of profit from recurring operations; and\n- non-financial  criteria: these  criteria  vary  between  0%  and  30%  of \u0097 fixed annual compensation if the objectives are achieved and up to 45% for  an  exceptional  performance.  The  individual  performance  of the Executive Director is assessed annually by the Board of Directors on the recommendation of the Compensation Committee. The qualitative criteria assessed are reviewed annually, based on the Group's strategic priorities, knowing that the Board of Directors will strive  to  always  include  a  CSR  criterion.  For  confidentiality  reasons regarding the Group's strategy, details of qualitative objectives may only  be  made  public  after  the  event  and  after  assessment  by  the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors.\n\nIn  any  event,  variable  compensation  (quantitative  and  qualitative criteria) may not exceed 180% of the annual fixed compensation.\n\n## PERFORMANCE LEVELS\n\nThe performance achievement level shall be communicated, criterion by criterion, once the performance assessment has been prepared.\n\n## TERMINATION OF OFFICE\n\nIf the Executive Director leaves during the financial year, the amount of the variable portion of their compensation for the current year will be determined  prorata  to  attendance  time  for  the  year  in  question, depending  on  the  performance  level  observed  and  assessed  by  the Board  of  Directors  for  each  of  the  criteria  initially  adopted.  However, it should be noted that no compensation shall be paid if the Executive Director is dismissed for gross negligence or with good cause.\n\n## PAYMENT METHOD\n\nIn accordance  with  the  law,  the  payment  of  variable  annual compensation will be conditional upon prior approval by the Ordinary Shareholders' Meeting.\n\n## Multi-year compensation\n\nThe Board of Directors  has  decided  not  to  use  this  type  of  long-term cash  compensation  mechanism,  preferring  to  favour  a  share-based instrument more closely aligned with shareholders' interests.\n\nHowever, such a mechanism might be envisaged if regulatory changes or  any  other  circumstance  were  to  make  the  use  of  a  share-based instrument  restrictive  or  impossible.  In  this  event,  the  principles  and criteria  for  the  determination,  distribution  and  maximum  allocation  of shares stipulated in the policy relating to share plans will be used in the structuring  of  such  variable  multi-year  compensation  using  the  most similar appropriate procedures possible.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This compensation may not exceed the amount lost by the person in question.\n\nIn  all  cases,  the  payment  of  such  compensation  may  only  be  made subject  to  the  prior  approval  of  the  Ordinary  Shareholders'  Meeting pursuant to article L. 225-37-2 of the French Commercial Code.\n\n## Stock option and performance-based share allocation policy\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  considers  that  share-based  compensation mechanisms,  which  also  benefit  other  key  functions  of  the  Company, are particularly appropriate for the Executive Director, given the level of responsibility of this function and his or her ability to contribute directly to  long-term  corporate  performance  in  a  way  that  is  aligned  with shareholders' interests.\n\nDuring  FY20,  the  Board  of  Directors  reaffirmed  its  desire  to  give  key personnel  an  interest  in  the  performance  of  Pernod  Ricard  shares, and during its  meeting of 8 November 2019, it decided to introduce a combined  allocation  plan  made  up  of  stock  options  and  performance shares.\n\nThe  Board's  aim  is  therefore  to  continue  to  align  the  interests  of Pernod Ricard employees with those of the shareholders, by encouraging  them  to  hold  shares  of  the  Company.  Just  over  800 employees  were  rewarded,  making  it  possible  to  target  not  only executives  in  management  positions,  but  also  to  retain  young high-potential  Managers  (Talents)  in all  of  the  Group's  subsidiaries around the world.\n\nUnder  the  authorisations  granted  by  the  Shareholders'  Meeting  of 8 November  2019  (resolutions  20  and  21),  the  Shareholders'  Meeting authorised the following external and internal performance conditions:\n\n## ALLOCATION OF STOCK OPTIONS\n\nAll stock options under the plan are subject to an external performance condition  and  may  be  exercised  depending  on  the  positioning  of  the overall  performance  of  the  Pernod  Ricard  share  (Total  Shareholder Return)  compared  to  the  overall  performance  of  a  Panel  of  12 comparable companies (see below). This condition will be assessed over a period of three years following allocation of the plan, and this three-year  minimum  performance  assessment  period  will  be maintained for all options allocated to the Executive Director during the term of his or her current mandate.\n\nThe number of options that may be exercised will be determined by the positioning  of  the  overall  performance  of  the  Pernod  Ricard  share compared to that of the Panel over a period of three years, as follows:\n\n- below the median (8 th to 13 th position), no options will be exercisable; \u0097\n- at the median (7 th position), 66% of the options will be exercisable; \u0097\n- if in 6 th , 5 th or 4 th position, 83% of the stock options can be exercised; and \u0097\n- if in 3 rd , 2 nd or 1 st position, 100% of the stock options can be exercised. \u0097\n\nThe Board of Directors has decided that, in addition to Pernod Ricard, the  Panel  shall  comprise  the  following  12  companies:  AB  InBev, Brown Forman,  Campari,  Carlsberg,  Coca-Cola,  Constellation  Brands, Danone, Diageo, Heineken, LVMH, PepsiCo and R\u00e9my Cointreau.\n\nThe composition of the Panel may be modified depending on changes in the  companies,  particularly  in  the  event  of  acquisition,  absorption, dissolution, spin-off, merger or change of activity, subject to maintaining the  overall  consistency  of  the  sample  and  enabling  application  of  the external  performance  condition  in  accordance  with  the  performance objective set on allocation.\n\nProvided  that  the  conditions  are  fulfilled,  stock  options  may  be exercised four years after their allocation and for a period of four years.\n\n## ALLOCATION OF PERFORMANCE-BASED SHARES\n\nPerformance-based shares allocated have a vesting period of four years and  are  subject  in  their  entirety  and  over  a  period  of  three  financial years to:\n\n- an internal performance condition representing, in value, 50% of the \u0097 allocation of performance-based shares; and\n- an external performance condition representing, in value, 50% of the \u0097 allocation of performance-based shares.\n\nAs  in  the  case  of  stock  options,  this  three-year  minimum  performance assessment period will be maintained for all performance-based shares allocated  to  the  Executive  Director  during  his  or  her  current  term  of office.\n\n## Internal condition\n\nThe  number  of  performance-based  shares  finally  vested  will  be determined  according  to  the  ratio  of  achieved  Group  profit  from recurring operations, restated for currency effects and changes in the scope  of  consolidation,  as  compared  to  Group  budgeted  profit  from recurring operations over three consecutive financial years.\n\nThe number of performance-based shares will be determined according to the following conditions:\n\n- if the average level of achievement is 0.95 or below: \u0097 no performance-based shares will vest;\n- if the  average  level  of  achievement  is  between  0.95  and  1: \u0097 the number of performance-based shares vesting will be determined on  a  straight-line  basis  according  to  the  percentage  achievement between 0% and 100%; and\n- if the  average  level  of  achievement  is  1  or  more:  100%  of \u0097 performance-based shares will be vested.\n\nFurthermore,  the  Board  of  Directors,  on  the  recommendation  of  the Compensation  Committee,  decided  to  exclude  the  Executive  Director from  the  benefit  of  the  adjustment  of  the  internal  performance condition of the 2017, 2018 and 2019 performance share plans to take into account the exceptional impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the Group's results for FY20 (this adjustment is described in the subsection \"Allocation of performance-based shares with internal condition\" in 2.8.4 below).\n\n## External condition\n\nThe  number  of  performance-based  shares  vesting  will  be  determined according  to  the  external  performance  condition  applicable  to  stock options, as described opposite \"Allocation of stock options\".",

This maximum allocation has been determined by taking into account:\n\n- the practices of beverage sector companies (external benchmarking \u0097 panel) and the practices of CAC 40 companies; and\n- the demanding nature of the performance conditions of plans. \u0097\n\nFurthermore, the maximum amount of stock options and performance-based shares allocated to the Executive Director may not represent more  than  5%  of  the  plan's  total  economic  value (the plan's total  economic  value  comprises  all  distributed  elements). Lastly,  and  as  indicated  in  the  context  of  resolutions  submitted  for approval by the Shareholders' Meeting of 8 November 2019, the maximum amount of stock options and performance-based shares allocated to the Executive Director may not represent more than:\n\n- 0.21%  of  the  share  capital  on  the  date  of  allocation  of  the  stock \u0097 options (in accordance with the 21 st resolution);\n- 0.06%  of  the  share  capital  on  the  date  of  allocation  of  the \u0097 performance-based shares (in accordance with the 20 th resolution).\n\n## LOCK-IN PERIOD\n\nThe Board of Directors requires the Executive Director:\n\n- to  retain  in  registered  form  until  the  end  of  their  term  of  office  a \u0097 quantity of shares corresponding to:\n- in  respect  of  stock  options:  30%  of  the  capital  gain  since \u0097 acquisition, net  of  social  security  contributions  and  taxes, resulting from the exercise of the stock options, and\n- in  respect  of  performance-based  shares:  20%  of  the  volume  of \u0097 performance-based shares that will actually be vested;\n- to undertake to buy a number of additional shares equal to 10% of the \u0097 performance-based shares vested at the time that the performance-based shares actually vest; and\n- once the Executive Director holds a number of registered Company \u0097 shares  that  correspond  to  more  than  three  times  his  gross  fixed annual  compensation  at  that  time,  the  above-mentioned  lock-in obligation  will  be  reduced  to  10%  for  both  stock  options  and performance-based shares and the Executive Director concerned will no longer be required to acquire additional shares. If, in the future, their registered holdings fall below the three-times ratio, the lock-in and acquisition requirements cited above will again apply.\n\n## PRESENCE CONDITION AND TERMINATION OF OFFICE\n\nThe definitive allocation is subject to a presence condition (at the date on  which  the  options  are  exercised  or  the  shares  vest)  for  all beneficiaries  including  the  Executive  Director,  with  the  exceptions specified in the plan regulations (notably in cases of death or disability) or decided by the Board of Directors. In case of the Executive Director, the  Board  of  Directors  may  decide  to  remove  the  presence  condition pro  rata  temporis where  appropriate,  issuing  a  notification  of  and justification for any such decision. The stock options and performance-based  shares  held  shall  remain  subject  to  all  applicable plan regulations, particularly with regard  to  the  calendar  and performance conditions.\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  Code  of  Conduct,  the  latest  version  of  which was adopted by the Board of Directors on 20 July 2017, and the AFEP-MEDEF Code, the Executive Director has formally agreed to  refrain  from  using  hedging  mechanisms  for  any  stock  options  and performance-based shares received from the Company.\n\n## Policy on deferred commitments\n\n## IMPOSED DEPARTURE CLAUSE\n\nA  maximum  allowance  of  12 months'  compensation  (last  fixed  and variable  annual  compensation  determined  by  the  Board  of  Directors) would be paid under performance conditions in the event of imposed departure  as  a  result  of  a  change  in  the  Group's  control  or  strategy. However, there would be no payment in the event of i) non-renewal of the term of office, ii) departure initiated by the Director, iii) a change of functions  within  the  Group  or  iv)  if  he  or  she  is  able  to  benefit  in  the near future from their pension rights.\n\nThe  imposed  departure  clause  is  subject  to  the  following  three performance criteria:\n\n- 1 st criterion: bonus rates achieved over the term(s) of office: criterion \u0097 number 1 will  be  considered  as  met  if  the  average  bonus  paid  over the entire length of the term(s) of office is no less than 90% of the target variable compensation;\n- 2 nd criterion: growth rate of profit from recurring operations over the \u0097 term(s) of office: criterion number 2 will be considered as met if the average growth rate of profit from recurring operations vs. budget of each year over the entire length of the term(s) of office is more than 95% (adjusted for foreign exchange and scope impacts); and\n- 3 rd criterion:  average  growth  in  net  sales  over  the  term(s)  of  office: \u0097 criterion number 3 will be considered as met if the average growth in net sales over the entire length of the term(s) of office is greater than or equal to 3% (adjusted for foreign exchange and scope impacts).\n\nThe  amount  of  compensation  that  may  be  received  under  the  forced departure clause shall be calculated according to the following scale:\n\n- if all three criteria are met, payment of 12 months' compensation (1) ; \u0097\n- two of the three criteria are satisfied: eight months' compensation (1) ; \u0097\n- if  one  of  the  three criteria is satisfied: four months' compensation (1) ; \u0097 and\n- if no criterion is satisfied: no compensation will be paid. \u0097\n\n## NON-COMPETE CLAUSE\n\nThe  signing  of  this  non-compete  clause  for  a  period  of  one  year  is intended  to  protect  the  Group  by  preventing  the  Executive  Director from  performing  duties  for  a  competitor,  in  return  for  an  allowance  of 12 months' compensation (last fixed and variable annual compensation, determined by the Board of Directors).\n\nIn accordance with the AFEP-MEDEF Code:\n\n- the indemnity will be paid monthly during its term; \u0097\n- it is provided in this clause that the Board of Directors may waive the \u0097 application of this clause when the Executive Director leaves;\n- the  indemnity  will  not  be  paid  if  the  Executive  Director  leaves  the \u0097 Group to take retirement or if the Executive Director is over 65 years old; and\n- the  maximum  amount  of  the  indemnity  under  the  non-compete \u0097 clause and the imposed departure clause (sum of both) is capped at 24 months' compensation (last fixed and variable annual compensation approved by the Board of Directors).\n\n<!-- image -->",

It  may  reach  70%  of  his  gross  fixed  compensation  if  the quantitative and qualitative targets are achieved (target level) and can rise  to  a  maximum  of  105%  if  the  Group  records  exceptional  financial performance  in  relation  to  the  targets.  The  criteria  are  reviewed regularly and may be modified on an occasional basis.\n\nIn this respect, during FY20, he received gross variable compensation in October 2019  of  \u20ac438,299  relating  to  FY19, i.e. 92.40%  of  his  fixed compensation for FY19.\n\n## SPECIAL BONUS\n\nNo special bonuses were awarded or paid in respect of FY20.\n\n## STOCK OPTION AND PERFORMANCE-BASED SHARE ALLOCATION\n\nOn  8 November  2019,  the  Board  of  Directors  authorised  a  combined stock option and performance-based share allocation plan.\n\nUnder this plan, Mr C\u00e9sar Giron received the following allocation:\n\n- 6,286 stock options with an external performance condition \u0097 (\u20ac153,347 at IFRS value); and\n- 1,996  performance-based  shares  with  an  internal  performance \u0097 condition (\u20ac306,179 at IFRS value).\n\nThe  details  of  the  overall  stock  option  and  performance-based  share allocation  policy  are  shown  below  (pages 73-74  of  this  universal registration document).\n\n## SEVERANCE BENEFITS\n\nMr C\u00e9sar Giron receives no compensation for termination of service.\n\n## SUPPLEMENTARY PENSION SCHEME\n\nMr C\u00e9sar  Giron  has  a  conditional  defined-benefit  supplementary pension  scheme  (article 39)  under  article L. 137-11  of  the  French Employment Code, provided that recipients:\n\n- have at least 10 years' seniority within the Group when they leave or \u0097 retire;\n- are at least 60 years of age on the date of leaving or retirement; \u0097\n- have wound up the basic and complementary French social security \u0097 pension schemes (ARRCO, AGIRC);\n- permanently put an end to their professional career; and \u0097\n- end  their  professional  career  within  the  Group.  In  accordance  with \u0097 regulations,  employees  aged  over  55  whose  contract  is  terminated and  who  do  not  take  up  another  job  are  deemed  to  have  retired. The aim  of  the  scheme  is  to  make  it  possible  to  supplement  the pension provided by France's mandatory state-run pension scheme. It offers retired beneficiaries a life annuity that can be passed on to their spouse and/or ex-spouse in the event of death.\n\nPensions are proportionate to the beneficiary's length of service, with an upper  limit  of  20 years.  Pensions  are  calculated  on  the  basis  of  the beneficiary's average compensation (fixed and variable) over the three years preceding his or her retirement.\n\nThe amount of the supplementary annuity is calculated by applying the following coefficients to the basis of calculation:\n\n- for  the  portion  of  the  compensation  between  eight  and  12 times \u0097 France's annual social security ceiling, the coefficient is 2% multiplied by the number of years' service (capped at 20 years, i.e. 40%);\n- between  12  and  16 times  France's  annual  social  security  ceiling, \u0097 the coefficient  is  1.5%  per  year  of  service  (capped  at  20 years, i.e. 30%); and\n- in excess  of  16 times  France's  annual  social  security  ceiling, \u0097 the coefficient is 1% per year of service (capped at 20 years, i.e. 20%).\n\nThe supplementary pension equals the sum of the three amounts above.\n\nIn addition, the rights granted under this plan, added to those of other pensions, cannot exceed two-thirds of the amount of the beneficiary's most recent fixed annual compensation.\n\nA provision is entered on the balance sheet during the build-up phase and,  when  the  beneficiary  claims  his  or  her  pension,  the  capital  is transferred to an insurer and thus entirely outsourced.\n\nFunding  for  this  scheme  is  the  responsibility  of  Pernod  Ricard,  which pays  premiums  to  a  third-party  insurance  agency  to  which  it  has entrusted management of this pension scheme.\n\nPursuant to the provisions of French Decree no. 2016-182 of 23 February 2016,  at  30 June  2020,  the  estimated  gross  amount  of  the  annuity potentially  paid  under  the  supplementary  defined-benefit  pension scheme for Mr C\u00e9sar Giron would be \u20ac159,845 per year.\n\nThe relevant social security contributions falling due to Pernod Ricard stood at 24% of the contributions transferred to the insurer.\n\nFurthermore, in accordance with the government decree of 3 July 2019:\n\n- the scheme has been closed since 2016; \u0097\n- no  additional  rights  may  vest  in  respect  of  periods  of  employment \u0097 after 1 January 2020.\n\n## COLLECTIVE HEALTHCARE AND WELFARE SCHEMES\n\nMr C\u00e9sar  Giron  qualifies  for  the  collective  healthcare  and  welfare schemes offered by Martell Mumm Perrier-Jou\u00ebt under the same terms as those applicable for the category of employees to which he belongs for  the  determination  of  his  employee  benefits  and  other  additional components of his compensation.\n\n## OTHER BENEFITS\n\nFor FY20, Mr C\u00e9sar Giron was provided with a company car.",

Just  over 800 employees  were  rewarded,  making  it  possible  to  target  not  only executives  in  management  positions,  but  also  to  retain  young high-potential  Managers  (Talents)  in all  of  the  Group's  subsidiaries around the world.\n\nThe  8 November  2019  allocation  plan  consists  of  stock  options  with performance conditions and performance-based shares.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  confirmed  the  following  plan  features  on  the recommendation of the Compensation Committee:\n\n- subject all allocations (stock options and performance-based shares) \u0097 to performance criteria;\n- retain the external performance criterion applicable to stock options \u0097 and  a  portion  of  the  performance-based  shares  allocated  to  the Executive  Director:  positioning  of  the  overall  performance  of Pernod Ricard  shares  compared  with  the  overall  performance  of  a panel of 12 comparable companies over three years, only considering positioning on the median or higher;\n- maintain the internal performance criterion applicable to \u0097 performance shares, i.e. the  average  achievement of annual targets for profit from recurring operations, assessed over three consecutive financial years;\n- maintain a balanced  allocation between  stock  options  and \u0097 performance-based  shares  for  the  members  of  the  Executive Committee,  including  the  Executive  Director,  thus  allowing  fair compensation  based  on  the  achievement  of  internal  and  external criteria; and\n- maintain allocations of performance-based shares for all \u0097 beneficiaries, with the volume varying according to the classification of their position within the Group.\n\n## Allocation of stock options with external performance conditions\n\nThe volume of performance-based stock options allocated by the Board of Directors' meeting of 8 November 2019 stood at 131,864 stock options.\n\nAll  of  the  stock  options  under  the  plan  are  subject  to  an  external performance condition and will become exercisable from November 2023 depending on the positioning of the overall performance  of  Pernod  Ricard  shares  compared  to  the  overall performance of a panel of 12 comparable companies. This condition will be evaluated over a three-year period following the plan allocation.\n\nThe number of shares that will ultimately be granted will be determined by comparing the overall performance of the Pernod Ricard share and the  overall  performance  of  a  Panel  from  8 November  2019  to 8 November 2022  inclusive  (three  years).  Accordingly,  if  the  total performance of the Pernod Ricard shares (TSR) is:\n\n- below the median (8 th to 13 th position), no options will be exercisable; \u0097\n- at the median (7 th position), 66% of the options will be exercisable; \u0097\n- if in 6 th ,  5 th or 4 th position, 83% of the stock options can be exercised; \u0097 and\n- if in 3 rd , 2 nd or 1 st position, 100% of the stock options can be exercised. \u0097\n\nAt the grant date, the Board of Directors decided that the Panel shall comprise,  in  addition  to  Pernod  Ricard,  the  following  12  companies: AB InBev, Brown Forman, Campari, Carlsberg, Coca-Cola, Constellation Brands, Danone, Diageo, Heineken, LVMH, PepsiCo and R\u00e9my Cointreau.\n\nThe  Panel's  composition  is  subject  to  change,  based  on  the above-mentioned  companies'  development.  The  Board  of  Directors shall, with a duly reasoned decision and following the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, exclude a company from or add a new company  to  the  Panel,  for  example,  in  the  case  of  an  acquisition, absorption, dissolution, spin-off, merger or change of business of one or more  of  the  Panel's  members,  subject  to  maintaining  the  overall consistency  of  the  Panel  and  enabling  the  application  of  the  external performance condition in line with the performance objective set upon allocation.\n\nThe vesting period for the options is four years followed by an exercise period of four years.\n\n## Allocation of performance-based shares with an external performance condition\n\nAt its meeting of 8 November 2019, the Board of Directors granted 5,780 performance-based  shares  with  an  external  performance  condition (excluding shares related to the supplementary pension scheme).\n\nAll  of  the  performance-based  shares  under  the  plan  are  subject  to internal  and  external  performance  conditions  and  will  vest  from November 2023 based on the positioning of the overall performance of Pernod Ricard share compared to the overall performance of a Panel of 12  comparable  companies  (see  above).  This  external  condition  will  be assessed  over  a  period  of  three  years  following  the  allocation  of  the plan, i.e. from 8 November 2019 to 8 November 2022 inclusive.\n\nThe  final  volumes  will  be  determined  at  the  end  of  the  external condition  evaluation  period  in  accordance  with  subsection  \"Allocation of stock options\".\n\n## Allocation of performance-based shares with internal condition\n\nA total of 262,483 performance-based shares (excluding shares related to the supplementary pension scheme) were awarded by the Board of Directors at its meeting of 8 November 2019, all subject to the internal performance condition described below.\n\nThe  number  of  performance-based  shares  that  will  ultimately  be granted will be determined based on the ratios of achievement of the Group's profit  from  recurring  operations,  adjusted  for  currency  effects and  changes  in  the  scope  of  consolidation  as  compared  with  the Group's budgeted  profit from recurring operations over three consecutive financial years (FY20, FY21 and FY22).\n\nThe number of performance-based shares is determined according to the following conditions:\n\n- if the average  level  of  achievement  is  0.95  or  below:  no \u0097 performance-based shares will be acquired;\n- if the average level of achievement is between 0.95 and 1: the number \u0097 of performance-based shares acquired is determined by applying the percentage of linear progression between 0 and 100%; and\n- if the  average  level  of  achievement  is  1  or  more:  100%  of \u0097 performance-based shares will be vested.\n\nPerformance-based  shares  allocated  to  all  beneficiaries  have  a four-year vesting period, without a lock-in period.\n\nIn addition, beneficiaries must still be part of the Group on the vesting date, except in the case of retirement, death or invalidity.",

To  prevent  the  impact  of  the Covid-19  crisis  wiping  out  the  awards  under  these  three  plans, which would  be  disproportionate  in  view  of  the  objectives  of profit-sharing  and  of  attracting  and  retaining  talent,  the  Board  of Directors  decided  to  limit  the  impact  of  this  unprecedented  health crisis.  For  each  of  these  three  plans,  the  FY20  profit  from  recurring operations prior to the health crisis will be taken into account, applying a discount on the number of shares that can vest of at least 34% of the amount  initially awarded.  This  reflects  the  fact  that  to  date,\n\nthe Covid-19 pandemic  has  impacted  only  one  of  the  three  financial years in question.\n\nAs a result, the Board of Directors adopted the following adjustments:\n\n- for  the  2017  plan,  the  internal  performance condition assessed with \u0097 respect  to  profit  from  recurring  operations  in  FY18,  FY19  and  FY20 was 66% met;\n- for  the  2018  and  2019  plans,  the  final  achievement  of  the  internal \u0097 performance condition will be determined at the close of the coming financial years, but may under no circumstances allow the vesting of more than 66% of the shares granted under each of the two plans.\n\nThese  adjustments  affect  all  beneficiaries  with  the  exception  of  the Executive Director.\n\n## History of allocations of stock options - Situation at 30 June 2020 (Table 8 AMF nomenclature)\n\n|                                                             | Plan dated 06.11.2015   | Plan dated 17.11.2016   | Plan dated 09.11.2017   | Plan dated 21.11.2018   | Plan dated 08.11.2019   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Date of authorisation by Shareholders' Meeting              | 06.11.2015              | 06.11.2015              | 06.11.2015              | 06.11.2015              | 08.11.2019              |\n| Date of Board of Directors' meeting                         | 06.11.2015              | 17.11.2016              | 09.11.2017              | 21.11.2018              | 08.11.2019              |\n| Type of options                                             | Purchase                | Purchase                | Purchase                | Purchase                | Purchase                |\n| Total number of options that can be subscribed or purchased | 278,575                 | 150,008                 | 124,050                 | 109,492                 | 131,864                 |\n| of which by the corporate officers of Pernod Ricard SA      | 28,200                  | 39,445                  | 39,445                  | 32,006                  | 28,831                  |\n| of which by Mr Alexandre Ricard                             | 20,700                  | 31,400                  | 25,050                  | 26,143                  | 22,545                  |\n| of which by Mr C\u00e9sar Giron                                  | 7,500                   | 8,045                   | 7,000                   | 5,863                   | 6,286                   |\n| Commencement date for exercise of options                   | 07.11.2019              | 18.11.2020              | 10.11.2021              | 22.11.2022              | 09.11.2023              |\n| Expiry date                                                 | 06.11.2023              | 17.11.2024              | 09.11.2025              | 21.11.2026              | 08.11.2027              |\n| Subscription or purchase price  (\u20ac) (1)                     | 102.80                  | 105.81                  | 126.53                  | 137.78                  | 162.79                  |\n| Number of shares subscribed or purchased                    | 67,614                  | 0                       | 0                       | 0                       | 0                       |\n| Total number of stock options cancelled or lapsed  (2)      | 96,068                  | 25,506                  | 0                       | 0                       | 0                       |\n| of which allocated to Mr Alexandre Ricard                   | 7,038                   | 5,338                   | 0                       | 0                       | 0                       |\n| of which allocated to Mr C\u00e9sar Giron                        | 2,550                   | 1,368                   | 0                       | 0                       | 0                       |\n| Subscription or purchase options remaining                  | 114,893                 | 124,502                 | 124,050                 | 109,492                 | 131,864                 |\n\nN/A: not applicable.\n\n- The purchase price of the shares by the beneficiaries corresponds to the average of the closing prices recorded during the 20 trading sessions preceding the day on (1) which the options were granted.\n- Options cancelled after the beneficiaries failed to meet the continuous service and/or performance conditions.

No cancellation of performance shares under the 2018 and 2019 plans has been recorded to date for Mr Alexandre Ricard.\n- Allocated shares that vested and were transferred to the beneficiaries. Shares relating to plans in the process of vesting were transferred in advance to the beneficiaries (3) following the death of several beneficiaries.\n- For the 2015, 2016 and 2017 plans, the performance condition was evaluated in full. For the 2018 and 2019 plans, it will only be evaluated at the close of FY21 and FY22 (4) respectively. The capping at 66% of the achievement of the performance condition due to the Covid-19 pandemic has been taken into account (excluding the Executive Director).\n\n## Performance-based shares granted to the top 10 employees other than corporate officers and shares definitively vested by the latter during FY20\n\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Number of shares allocated / vested   | Value of the shares (1) (in euros)   | Plans                   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Options allocated during the financial year by the issuer  and any companies within its Group granting options to the top 10  employees of the issuer and any such Group company,  receiving the highest number of options | 15,935                                | \u20ac153.67                              | 08.11.2019              |\n| Options vested during the financial year by the top 10 employees  of the issuer and any companies within its Group, receiving the highest  number of shares.                                                               | 33,428                                | \u20ac98.07                               | 06.11.2015 / 17.11.2016 |\n\n- Value of shares according to the method used for the consolidated financial statements (IFRS).

Qualitative criteria to evaluate individual performance are also applied to this variable financial portion.\n\nThe Chairmen of the Group's direct affiliates, who are members of the Executive  Committee,  also  receive  compensation  comprising  a  fixed portion, which is set in proportion to individual responsibilities, plus a variable  portion,  for  which  the  quantitative  criteria  depend  firstly  on the financial performance of the entity they manage and secondly on the  Group's  results,  with  a  view  to  strengthening  solidarity  and collegiality. The  Chairmen  are  also  evaluated  using  individual qualitative criteria.\n\nThe same performance indicators thus apply to the key players in the Group's  business  development,  through  the  structure  of  and  the method  for evaluating the variable portion of their annual compensation.\n\nFor  a  number  of  years,  all  members  of  the  Executive  Committee, including  the  Chairman  and  CEO,  have  also  been  evaluated  on  the basis  of  their  employee  development  and  management  performance and  the  implementation  of  Sustainability  &  Responsibility  (S&R) projects.\n\nThe total  amount  of  fixed  compensation  awarded  to  the  members  of the Executive Committee, including the Executive Director, amounted to  \u20ac7.7 million  for  FY20  (unchanged  from  FY19).  In  addition  to  this, variable compensation  (relating  to  FY19)  of  \u20ac7.1 million  was  paid (compared with \u20ac6.5 million in FY19).\n\nThe  total  recurring  expense  in  respect  of  pension  commitments  for members  of  the  Executive  Committee,  including  the  Executive Director, was \u20ac4.8 million in the financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2020 (compared with \u20ac5 million as at 30 June 2019).\n\n## Summary of transactions involving Pernod Ricard shares made 2.8.5 by corporate officers in FY20 (article 223-26 of the AMF General Regulation)\n\n| First name, surname, Company name   | Title                                       | Financial instrument          | Type of transaction           | Date       |   Price (\u20ac) | Amount of transaction (\u20ac)   |\n|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------|-------------|-----------------------------|\n| Mr Alexandre Ricard                 | Chairman and CEO                            | Call options                  | Exercise of stock options     | 07.11.2019 |     102.8   | 1,404,454                   |\n|                                     |                                             | Shares                        | Acquisition                   | 07.11.2019 |     165.6   | 601,128                     |\n|                                     |                                             | Shares                        | Acquisition                   | 07.11.2019 |     165.6   | 496,800                     |\n|                                     |                                             | Shares                        | Acquisition                   | 18.11.2019 |     170.45  | 1,532,346                   |\n| Ms Esther Berrozpe Galindo          | Director                                    | Shares                        | Acquisition                   | 16.12.2019 |     162.2   | 8,110                       |\n| Mr C\u00e9sar Giron                      | Director                                    | Shares                        | Disposal                      | 04.09.2019 |     179.35  | 779,814                     |\n|                                     |                                             | Shares                        | Acquisition                   | 07.11.2019 |     165.6   | 356,040                     |\n| Mr Philippe Petitcolin              | Director                                    | Shares                        | Acquisition                   | 17.12.2019 |     160.647 | 49,801                      |\n| Ms Veronica Vargas                  | Director                                    | Shares                        | Acquisition                   | 05.11.2019 |     162.5   | 203,125                     |\n| Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Paul Ricard                 | Director                                    | Shares                        | Acquisition                   | 21.10.2019 |     158.856 | 14,513,365                  |\n|                                     |                                             | Shares                        | Acquisition                   | 21.10.2019 |     158.838 | 2,586,986                   |\n|                                     |                                             | Shares                        | Acquisition                   | 21.10.2019 |     158.767 | 3,097,376                   |\n|                                     |                                             | Shares                        | Acquisition                   | 21.10.2019 |     158.811 | 2,802,227                   |\n|                                     |                                             | Transfer of stock put options | Transfer of stock put options | 28.02.2020 |       4.76  | 429,447                     |\n| Rigivar SL                          | Corporate Entity, Paul Ricard concert party | Shares                        | Acquisition                   | 25.10.2019 |     158.55  | 57,078                      |\n\n<!-- image -->",

However, during a public offer period,  the  repurchases  would  only  be  carried  out  subject  to  the conditions that they:\n\n- enable  the  Company  to  comply  with  its  prior  commitments \u0097 undertaken before the launch of the public offer;\n- are  undertaken  in  connection  with  the  pursuit  of  a  share  buyback \u0097 programme that was already in progress;\n- fall  within  the  scope  of  the  objectives  referred  to  in  items  (i) and \u0097 (iii) above; and\n- cannot cause the offer to fail. \u0097\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  may  also  carry  out,  in  accordance  with applicable legal and regulatory provisions, the reassignment to another objective of previously repurchased shares (including under a previous authorisation) and their sale (on- or off-market).\n\nThis  authorisation  would  be  valid  for  a  period  of  18 months  from  the Shareholders' Meeting of 27 November 2020 and would cancel, as from this same date, for any unused portion, the authorisation granted to the Board of Directors to trade in the Company's shares by the Combined Shareholders' Meeting of 8 November 2019 in its 11 th resolution.\n\n## Items liable to have an impact in the event 2.11 of a public offer\n\nIn accordance with article L. 225-37-5 of the French Commercial Code, the items liable to have an impact on the Company's securities in the event of a public offer are set out below.\n\n## The Company's share capital structure 2.11.1\n\nThe Company's share capital structure is shown in the table 'Allocation of share capital and voting rights on 30 June 2020' in Section 9 'About the  Company  and  its  share  capital',  in  the  subsection  'Information about the share capital'.\n\nThreshold  crossings  declared  during  FY20  are  also  indicated  in  the table  entitled  'Allocation  of  share  capital  and  voting  rights  on 30 June 2020' in Section 9 'About the Company and its share capital' of  this  universal  registration  document,  in  the  subsection  'Information about the share capital'.\n\n## Statutory restrictions on the exercise of voting rights 2.11.2 and double voting rights\n\nThe Company's  bylaws  provide  for  a  limit on voting rights.

The shareholders meet every year at a Shareholders' Meeting.\n\n## Notice to attend meetings 2.12.1\n\nBoth  Ordinary  and  Extraordinary  Shareholders'  Meetings  are  called, held and  vote  in  accordance  with  the  conditions  provided  for  by  law. They are held at the Company's registered office or at any other place stated in the notice of meeting.\n\nDecisions  by  the  shareholders  are  taken  at  Ordinary,  Extraordinary  or Combined  Shareholders'  Meetings  depending  on  the  nature  of  the resolutions they are being asked to adopt.\n\n## Participation in Shareholders' Meetings 2.12.2\n\nAll  shareholders  have  the  right  to  attend  the  Company's  Shareholders' Meetings and to participate in the deliberations, either in person or by proxy, regardless of the number of shares they hold. In order for a shareholder to have  the  right  to  participate  in  Ordinary  or  Extraordinary  Shareholders' Meetings, the shares must be registered in the name of the shareholder or in the name of the financial intermediary acting on the shareholder's behalf at 00.00  (Paris  time)  two  business  days  prior  to  the  Shareholders'  Meeting, either in the registered share accounts kept by the Company or in the bearer share accounts kept by the authorised financial intermediary.\n\nThe entry or recording of the shares in bearer share accounts kept by the  authorised  financial  intermediary  are  acknowledged via a  share certificate  issued  by  the  financial  intermediary  and  attached  as  an appendix  to  the  postal  voting  form,  proxy  form  or  application  for  an admission card made out in the name of the shareholder or on behalf of the  shareholder  represented  by  the  registered  financial  intermediary. Any shareholder wishing to attend the Shareholders' Meeting in person who  has  not  received  their  admission  card  by  00.00  (Paris  time) two business  days  before  the  Shareholders'  Meeting  may  also  ask  for such a certificate to be issued.\n\nIf  a  shareholder  does  not  attend  the  Shareholders'  Meeting  in  person, he or she may choose one of the following options:\n\n- give a proxy to the Chairman of the Shareholders' Meeting; \u0097\n- give a proxy to a spouse or partner with whom he or she has entered \u0097 into a civil union agreement, or to any other person; or\n- vote by post or via the Internet. \u0097\n\nA shareholder who has already cast a postal or Internet vote, sent in a proxy form  or  applied  for  an  admission  card  or  a  share  certificate  may  sell  all or some of  his  or  her  shares  at  any  time.  However,  if  the  sale  takes  place before  00.00  (Paris  time)  on  the  second  business  day  prior  to  the Shareholders' Meeting, the Company will invalidate or modify accordingly, as appropriate, the postal or Internet vote cast, proxy form, admission card\n\n## Voting conditions 2.12.3\n\nThe  voting  right  attached  to  the  shares  is  proportional  to  the  share capital they represent. Each share grants the right to at least one vote (article L. 225-122 of the French Commercial Code).\n\n## Restriction on voting rights\n\nHowever, each member of the Shareholders' Meeting has as many votes as  shares  he  or  she  possesses  and  represents,  up  to  30%  of  the  total voting rights.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nor share certificate. For this purpose, the authorised financial intermediary in charge of the shareholder's account will inform the Company or its duly authorised  agent  of  the  sale  and  will  provide  it  with  the  necessary information.\n\nNo sale or other form of transaction carried out after 00.00 (Paris time) on  the  second  business  day  prior  to  the  Shareholders'  Meeting, regardless of the means used, will be notified by the authorised financial intermediary or taken into consideration by the Company, notwithstanding any agreement to the contrary.\n\nGiven  the  evolving  situation  with  regard  to  the  Covid-19  epidemic, Pernod Ricard may have to change the attendance procedures for the Shareholders' Meeting on 27 November 2020.\n\nWe  would  therefore  ask  you  to  regularly  check  the  Shareholders' Meeting section on the Pernod Ricard website, which will confirm the final arrangements for attending this Shareholders' Meeting depending on the health and/or legal requirements.\n\nFurthermore, in view of the circulation of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the government's recommendations to avoid public gatherings, the Board of Directors  calls  for  the  utmost  caution  in  this  context  and recommends that each shareholder gives preference to voting by mail or by giving proxy to the Chairman rather than being physically present, in order to limit the risk of spread of the virus during the Shareholders' Meeting. The Company, concerned with limiting as much as possible the risks  of  contact  between  shareholders  who  choose  to  attend  our Shareholders'  Meeting,  has  already  decided  that  no  coffee  reception will  be  held  and  announces  that  no  gifts  will  be  distributed  this  year. The Company will  thus  make  its  best  efforts  to  ensure  that  the  social distancing  measures  are  respected  during  the  Shareholders'  Meeting, but  the  Company  will  not  incur  any  liability  for  any  contamination  of persons  who  decide,  under  their  sole  responsibility,  to  physically participate in the Shareholders' Meeting.\n\n## Double voting rights\n\nA double voting right is granted to other shares (in light of the fraction of the authorised share capital they represent) to all fully paid-up shares that can be shown to have been registered for at least ten years in the name of the same shareholder, from 12 May 1986 inclusive (article L. 225-123 of the French Commercial Code).",

Nevertheless,  transfer  following  the division of an estate or the liquidation of assets between spouses and inter vivos donation to a spouse or relation close enough to inherit will not  result  in  the  loss  of  the  acquired  right  and  will  not  interrupt  the aforementioned ten-year period.\n\n## Declaration of statutory thresholds\n\nAny individual or corporate body acquiring a shareholding greater than 0.5% of the share capital must inform the Company of the total number of  shares  held  by  registered  letter,  with  return  receipt  requested, within a  period  of  15 days  from  the  date  on  which  this  threshold  is exceeded.  This  notification  must  be  repeated,  under  the  same conditions, each time the threshold is exceeded by an additional 0.5%, up to and including 4.5%.\n\nIn  the  event  of  non-compliance  with  the  notification  obligation mentioned  in  the  previous  paragraph,  shares  in  excess  of  the undeclared  amount  shall  be  stripped  of  their  voting  rights,  at  the request,  as  set  forth  in  the  minutes  of  the  Shareholders'  Meeting, of one or  more  shareholders  holding  at  least  5%  of  the  share  capital, for any Shareholders'  Meeting  held  until  the  expiry  of  the  period stipulated in article L. 233-14 of the French Commercial Code following the date when the notification is made.\n\n## Modification of shareholders' rights 2.12.4\n\nThe Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting has the power to modify shareholders' rights, under the conditions defined by law.\n\n## Management structure 2.13\n\n## General Management 2.13.1\n\nOn 30 June 2020, the General Management of the Group was carried out by the Chairman  and  CEO  and  the  Managing  Director, Global Business  Development.

Under the authority of General Management, the Executive Committee ensures that Group business is carried out and that its main policies are applied.\n\nIn this capacity, the Executive Committee:\n\n- examines  the  Group's  activity  and  how  it  varies  from  the \u0097 development plan;\n- gives its opinion regarding the establishment of objectives \u0097 (earnings, debt and qualitative objectives);\n- periodically reviews the brands' strategies; \u0097\n- analyses  the  performance  of  the  Group's  network  of  Market \u0097 Companies  and  Brand  Companies  and  recommends  any  necessary organisational adjustments; and\n\n- C\u00e9dric  Ramat, EVP  Group  Human  Resources,  Sustainability \u0097 & Responsibility.\n\nThe  Executive  Board  prepares,  examines  and  approves  all  decisions relating to the functioning of the Group and submits these decisions to the Board of Directors when the latter's approval is required. It organises the Executive Committee's work.\n\nIn  addition,  the  Group Communications Department, the Public Affairs Department and the Internal Audit Department report to the Chairman and CEO.\n\nThe  Executive  Board  meets  on  a  weekly  basis.  However,  this  year, given the  Covid-19  crisis,  the  Executive  Board  met  daily  during  the lockdown period.\n\n- approves  and  enforces  adherence  to  the  Group's  main  policies \u0097 (Human  Resources, best marketing and business practices, Quality, Safety and Environment (QSE) policies, corporate responsibility, etc.).\n\nThe Executive Committee meets between eight and 11 times a year.\n\nHowever, this year, given the Covid-19 crisis, the Executive Committee met once a week during the lockdown period.\n\nComposition of the Executive Committee on 30 June 2020:\n\n- the Executive Board; \u0097\n- the Chairmen/Chairwomen of the Brand Companies: \u0097\n- Chivas Brothers, Jean-Christophe Coutures, Chairman and CEO, \u0097\n- Martell Mumm Perrier-Jou\u00ebt, C\u00e9sar Giron, Chairman and CEO, \u0097\n- Pernod Ricard Winemakers, Bryan Fry (1) , Chairman and CEO, \u0097\n- Irish Distillers Group, Conor McQuaid, Chairman and CEO, \u0097\n- The Absolut Company, Anna Malmhake, Chairwoman & CEO; \u0097\n\n<!-- image -->",

Considerable effort has been made in recent years to ensure the quality and objectivity of the assessment. This resulted in the implementation last  year  of  the  'Let's  Talk  Talent'  assessment  and  calibration  process powered  by  the  Workday  platform,  deployed  globally,  and which ensures the greatest possible consistency in the personal development and career advancement process for all our employees.\n\nIn  addition,  on  the  heels  of  the  global  'Better  Balance'  initiative conducted from 2017 to 2019 on the two main dimensions of the Group's diversity challenges (gender and nationality), the General Management and  the  Human  Resources  Department  have  been  encouraged  to identify measures specific to their own diversity challenges on at least these two dimensions and to make them objectives for the members of\n\nthe  affiliates' Management  Committees.  Each  year,  the  General Management  presents  these  diversity  targets  and  the  ways  in  which they  are  implemented  to  the  Board  of  Directors.  The  General Management also informs the Board of Directors annually of the results obtained.\n\nTogether, these initiatives have served to make the processes resulting in  the  selection  of  candidates  and  their  assignment  to  the  highest positions  of  responsibility  in  the  Company  more  equitable,  producing the following results over the recent period:\n\n- on  our  'Top  500\" (2) , the  share  of  women  rose  from  19%  to  26% \u0097 between 2015 and 2020; for the Executive Committee, the increase was from 7% to 27%;\n- our S&R roadmap has a target of gender balance by 2030 (3) . \u0097",

We partner with local  farmers  and  respect  local  communities  to  benefit  our  planet, our consumers and business.\n\nWe  bring  good  times  from  a  good  place,  to  create  a  more  convivial world, a world without excess.'\n\n## Addressing stakeholder expectations 3.1.1.2 across the business, from grain to glass\n\nIn  line  with  the  Pernod  Ricard  consumer-centric  model,  the  Group's Sustainability  &  Responsibility  strategy  is  centred  around  a  robust framework  with  four  pillars:  Nurturing Terroir ,  Valuing  People,  Circular Making  and  Responsible  Hosting.  All  of  these  directly  support  the United  Nations  Sustainable  Development  Goals  (SDGs) to  help achieve prosperity for the planet and its people. In 2018 and reaffirmed in  2019,  the  Group  received  LEAD (1) status  for  its  work  with  the  UN Global Compact - recognising its high engagement in this organisation and to advance the implementation of the SDGs.\n\nEach  pillar  includes  ambitious  targets  for  2030  designed  to  drive innovation, brand differentiation and employee attraction. All pillars are based on a 2030 timeline with 2022 and 2025 milestones, in line with the schedule set out by the SDGs.\n\nThe strategy is primarily built around contributing to the eight UN SDGs on which the Group has the greatest impact. However, its sustainable approach to  business  means  that  it  contributes  to  14  SDGs  across  its value chain.\n\nPernod Ricard's Sustainability & Responsibility strategy was built on the material  risks  of  its  business,  consumer  concerns  and  the  world's agenda.  The  strategy  is  the  result  of  a  long  process  from  qualitative interviews  to  the  consultation  of  over  300  colleagues  globally  and external  experts.  Over  20 workshops  were  held  with  representatives from  Brand  Companies,  Market  Companies,  Regions,  HQ  and  the  Top Management  team.  This  all  fed  into  ambitious  targets  that  were  set against where Pernod Ricard could have the greatest impact.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  crisis  was  an  opportunity  to accelerate the implementation of the S&R roadmap in certain areas and reaffirm its relevance in others while supporting local communities and driving positive impact:\n\n- end  of  single-use  plastic  point-of-sale  (POS)  materials  by  2021, \u0097 four years ahead of schedule;\n- launch of free online sustainable and responsible bartending training \u0097 module in partnership with the anti-waste bartending duo TrashTiki and  the  Sustainable  Restaurant  Association  housed  on  the EducateAll    digital  learning  platform,  created  by  EdApp  and sponsored by the United Nations Institute for Training and Research.\n\nIn  addition  to  the  Group's  S&R  commitments,  Pernod  Ricard  and  its affiliates were engaged in a number of initiatives, notably:\n\n- hand  sanitiser  production:  4 million  liters  of  pure  alcohol  delivered \u0097 worldwide to combat the hand sanitiser shortage and 1 million liters of hand sanitiser produced;\n- medical equipment: 475,000+ surgical masks & other medical items \u0097 donated to external stakeholders such as hospitals, local communities and public authorities;\n- suppliers  &  customer  actions:  financial  support  when  requested  by \u0097 suppliers and customers, such as early payment to ensure suppliers' cashflow,  authorised  delayed  invoice  payments  for  commercial customers.\n\n## A robust governance structure 3.1.2\n\nThe Sustainability & Responsibility strategy will be implemented throughout the Group with the following Governance structure:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nISSUE TASKFORCES",

This Statement requires the Group to publish its business model and information on key non-financial risks. These include risks relating to the environment, employment, society, Human Rights, tax evasion [pursuant to Act no. 2018-898 on combatting fraud] and corruption. For more information on Pernod Ricard's business model, please refer to Section 1 'Extracts from the integrated annual report' and for more information on the Group's key non-financial risks please see subsections 3.2.1 and 3.2.2 below.\n\n## Presentation of the methodology 3.2.1\n\nPernod Ricard adopted the following methodology:\n\n- last  year,  the  Group's  risk  mapping  served  as  reference  point  when \u0097 identifying  the  main  non-financial  risks  for  the  'Non-Financial Statement'. Every three years, the main risks facing Pernod Ricard are mapped by affiliate and function and then consolidated at HQ level by the Group's Risk Mdepartment. Updated in 2018, the Group's risk mapping presents and classifies the risks according to their potential impact and occurrence across the Group's activities. Some of these risks are specific to sustainability issues. The Group's major risks and the  process  for  identifying  them  are  discussed  in  Section 4  of  this document;\n- these  sustainability  risks  were  the  subject  of  further  analysis  and \u0097 development through research and internal and external stakeholder expectations and engagement when developing the 2030 Sustainability & Responsibility strategy (see subsection 3.1.1.2 'Addressing  stakeholder  expectations  across  the  entire  business, from grain to glass');\n- led by the Sustainability & Responsibility department, other key HQ \u0097 experts  including  operations,  legal,  HR,  public  affairs  and  finance were  also  involved  through  a  dedicated  workshop  to  reaffirm  and, where necessary, redefine the top eight risks and opportunities;\n- the  resulting  eight  non-financial  risks  and  opportunities  were \u0097 subsequently presented to and signed off on by the Executive Board.\n\n## The eight risks and opportunities identified 3.2.2\n\nThe definitions of the eight main risks and opportunities can be found in the  table  below.  Targets,  policies,  due  diligence  procedures,  and  key performance  indicators  are  presented  in  detail  in  subsections 3.3 'The four pillars of the Good Times from a Good Place Roadmap' and 3.4 'Ethics and compliance'. In the interest of transparency, other indicators  have  been  presented  alongside  the  policies  applied, depending on the issues addressed.\n\nGiven  the  nature  of  our  activities,  we  consider  that  the  'tax  evasion' referred to in article L. 225-102-1 of French Commercial Code does not constitute a major non-financial risk for the Group. It was therefore not felt necessary  to  explore  it  in  this  'Non-Financial  Statement'. Nevertheless, 'tax evasion' is discussed in Subsection 3.4.1.4 'Tax policy'.",

Below are some examples of practices designed to reduce the use of synthetic crop protection products:\n\n- having grass or cover crops between vine rows rather than bare soil; \u0097\n- using  pheromones  instead  of  agrochemicals  to  combat  insects \u0097 (sexual confusion);\n- using  mineral  fungicides  (152.2 tonnes  of  sulphur  and  5.2 tonnes  of \u0097 copper used in FY20).\n\n| Consumption per hectare of active ingredient  (kg ai/ha)   |   FY13 |   FY19 |   FY20 | FY13 - FY20   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|---------------|\n| Synthetic fungicides                                       |  10.45 |   4.45 |   3.84 | -63%          |\n| Herbicides                                                 |   2.68 |   2.46 |   2.98 | +12%          |\n| Insecticides                                               |   0.34 |   0.1  |   0.12 | -65%          |\n| TOTAL                                                      |  13.47 |   7    |   6.95 | -49%          |\n\n## Water and energy consumption in the vineyards\n\nIn FY20, the vineyards operated by the Group used:\n\n- 10.5 million  m 3 of  water,  mainly  for  irrigation.  This  is  done  using  the \u0097 drip  irrigation  technique,  which  is  now  used  at  all  of  the  Group's irrigated vineyards. This reduces the water supplied to the absolute minimum necessary;\n- 14,900 MWh  (less  than  1%  of  the  consumption  of  the  Group's \u0097 production sites).\n\n## Promote and develop resilient agricultural supply chains 3.3.1.2\n\nPernod  Ricard's  business  is  dependent  on  agriculture.  The  Group commits to implementing resilient agricultural practices in partnership with  supporting  suppliers  that  respect  the  land  and  neighbouring ecosystems. More specifically, Pernod Ricard will:\n\n- support  its  suppliers  in  improving  the  sustainability  of  their \u0097 production;\n\n- adapt and build resilience faced with climate change, while reducing \u0097 greenhouse gas emissions;\n- help maintain ecosystems by progressively improving land and water \u0097 quality.\n\nIn  addition,  specific  work  is  being  carried  out  to  reduce  the  use  of herbicides.  Four  of  our  vineyards  have  therefore  chosen  to  no  longer use them (Cognac, Champagne, Spain and China).\n\n335 hectares of our vineyards, representing 6% of the total managed by the  Group,  are  managed  to  organic  agriculture  standards  that  do  not use any synthetic crop protection products.",

It covers cereals and malted cereals, grapes and wines, agave, cane and beet products, (1) and five key flavouring ingredients.\n\nThere are two aspects to the Group's efforts in relation to agricultural product procurement:\n\n- responsible procurement process, Blue Source \u0097 (see Subsection 3.3.2.5 'Responsible Supply Chain') allows Pernod Ricard to identify and evaluate direct suppliers at risk in order to develop mitigation action plans;\n- identification  of  environmental  and  social  risks  in  our terroir \u0097 (agricultural activities) based on a study of the production of farm raw  materials  used  by  the  Group's  Brand  Companies  to  rank agricultural practices in terms of their environmental and social risks levels.  For  crops representing a high sustainability risk, action plans must be implemented by the affiliates, and alternatives examined to secure sustainable supplies.\n\nThe direct purchasing of agricultural products by affiliates has given rise to various partnership initiatives including:\n\n- in  Scotland,  100%  of  the  barley  purchased  by  Chivas  Brothers  is \u0097 certified to 'Scottish Quality Cereals' or 'Red Tractor' standards;\n- in Mexico, Kahl\u00faa worked with the Fondo Para La Paz and Ocotempa \u0097 NGO, a Mexican coffee community, to develop a sustainable model for  coffee  production. This 'Coffee for Good' programme comprises social,  economic  and  environmental  criteria.  This  year,  we  sourced 28 t of coffee from these communities and within the next four years, 100% of the coffee sourced by Kahl\u00faa will be sustainably grown;\n- the Group has made sugar cane a priority. This is because it is often \u0097 grown  in  lesser  developed  countries  where  social  protection, working conditions,  and  respect  for  social  rights  or  environmental protection  are  not  guaranteed.  In  2015,  Pernod  Ricard  joined  the Bonsucro  association, which aims to develop internationally recognised responsible practices for the sugar cane industry.\n\nTo meet its 2030 ambitions, this year the Group started to assess risks and opportunities related to the terroirs in its agricultural supply chains using a dedicated Terroir Risk mapping Tool. The objective is to map the origins  of  agricultural  raw  materials  and  to  identify  social  and environmental issues in the local environment where they are grown.\n\nAt the same time, the Group is also working on defining its Sustainable Agriculture Key Principles, which lay the foundations for a journey aimed at combating climate change and preserving biodiversity. This strategy will be implemented using two main levers:\n\n- the  selection  and  then  the  implementation  of  the  best  standards \u0097 aimed  at  sustainably  certifying  100%  of  our  key  raw  materials (certification by a third party or internal verification according to our own framework);\n- the  exploration  of  initiatives  and  partnerships,  the  setting  up  of \u0097 projects and then the sharing of practices with positive impacts.\n\n## Preserve and enhance biodiversity 3.3.1.3\n\nPernod  Ricard  is  committed  to  protecting  and  developing  the  biodiversity  of  ecosystems  everywhere  it  operates  and  distributes  its  products. All affiliates, Brand Companies with raw agricultural supply chains or Market Companies with purely distribution activities, will be part of this global effort.\n\n| Policies         | Objectives                                                              |\n|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 2030 S&R Roadmap | 100% of affiliates will be engaged in a strategic biodiversity project. |\n\n<!-- image -->",

It  is  monitoring  these  closely. These areas are mainly located in Scotland, Ireland, France and Sweden.\n\nTo  meet  its  2030  goals,  in  FY20,  Headquarters  have  defined  a framework  for  affiliates  in  relation  to  strategic  biodiversity  projects (selection of projects, global partners, identification of key performance indicators). Equipped with this framework, each affiliate will identify and implement or contribute to a biodiversity project. Brand Companies will focus  on  restoring  or  preserving  ecosystems  relating  to  production activities for the agricultural raw materials that they use, while Market Companies  will  develop  collaborative  projects  at  a  regional  level  to tackle local biodiversity issues.\n\n## Valuing People 3.3.2\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPeople have been and always will be at the heart of Pernod  Ricard  and  the  foundation  of  its  collective spirit - 'Cr\u00e9ateurs de convivialit\u00e9' - sharing, warmth, care  and  respect  for  all  whilst  offering  them challenging and fulfilling careers. The Group promotes  diversity  and  inclusion  throughout  its business. It works with its suppliers to create shared values in its supply chain.\n\nThis  pillar  is  all  about  respect:  for  everyone  in  our marketing, for everyone the Group works with across its supply  chain  and  for  its  19,094 employees (FY20 average)  worldwide.  This  means  increasing\n\nemployee  loyalty  and  engagement,  lowering  supply  chain  risks  and meeting rising consumer expectations around transparency. Due to the seasonal nature of its activities, especially during harvest periods, 5.4% of the annual average headcount is on fixed-term contracts. Rather than using  contractors,  Pernod  Ricard  prefers  to  hire  this  temporary workforce so that they can also benefit from its development and health & safety policies.\n\n## Talent management 3.3.2.1\n\n## Policies and objectives\n\nTalent management: a core business process.\n\nWe have an inclusive approach that enables all employees to have the opportunity  to  identify  their  skills,  knowledge,  abilities  and  potential through Let's Talk Talent, a consistent process throughout all affiliates.\n\nTo support the Pernod Ricard HR strategy, linked to the Pernod Ricard Global Strategic Framework, last year we rolled out the new leadership attributes developed  to  support  the  Group  in  achieving  its  goal  of becoming  Industry  Leader.  These  attributes  guide  all  Pernod  Ricard\n\nemployees  in  developing  their  leadership  skills  and  being  better prepared to deliver in the face of challenges. It will also help them drive change while being aligned with the Group strategy.\n\nThe leadership attributes represent the leadership behaviour Pernod Ricard  needs  to  ensure  its  future  success.  They  have  become embedded  in  our  Global  Talent  Management  practices  through  our annual  year-end  review  process,  360  feedback  process,  assessment centers and leadership development programs.\n\n2030  S&R  Roadmap :  Pernod  Ricard  is  committed  to  developing  the employability  of  all  its  employees  throughout  their  working  lives. This means offering all employees at least one future-fit training session every three years to ensure their employability.\n\n## Action plans and next steps\n\nTransfoHRm:  reviewing  the  Group  HR  strategy  and  processes as well as introducing a single, Group-wide HR Information System\n\nIn  line  with  its  three-year  strategic  Plan  'Transform  &  Accelerate', the Group  launched  its  HR  strategy  named  'TransfoHRm'  last  year. This sets the goal of making Convivialit\u00e9 a true performance driver by:\n\n- putting the employee experience at the core; \u0097\n- deploying  diverse  teams  to  improve  both  individual  and  collective \u0097 performance; and\n- introducing  a  culture  of  performance  and  success  based  on \u0097 empowerment and accountability, all supported by digital technology.\n\n## Workday HR management system\n\nOver  the  last  15 months,  the  Group  has  been  using  the  new employee-centric  tool,  Workday,  to  manage  almost  all  Group  HR processes with great success. We have been able to measure the value of the  investment  done  having  streamlined  business  processes, set a common  language,  created  unified  and  reliable  information worldwide.  It  has  significantly  improved  HR  efficiency,  facilitating decision-making to have the right talents in the right position with the right  skills  at  the  right  time  of  their  career.  Employees  and  Managers, at the core of Workday and the HR Strategy more broadly, now have the perfect  tool  to  access  information  about  their  position,  career  path, compensation and evaluation at any time, from any place. They are fully empowered to promote themselves and be proactive with their career development.  Workday  has  also  allowed  us  to  equip  HR  and  Top Management with powerful dashboards.\n\nWhile  the  adoption  of  TransfoHRm  and  Workday  is  still  in  progress, we have decided to revisit  on  regular  basis  what  we  have  done  using agile  ways  of  working  and  a  'Test,  Learn  and  Optimize'  approach. We have therefore greatly improved the annual year-end performance process for this second year of the process run by Workday. In addition, to not lose momentum and to move forward with the digitization of HR, we  have  been  deploying  new  functionalities  for  our  affiliates  such  as Learn module, Absence and Time Tracking, Onboarding.\n\nIt is without a doubt that TransforHRm has contributed to the upskilling of the HR function at Group level, increased the professional credibility of HR as business partners and boosted engagement and pride within the function ('iSay' results).",

The plan involved the upskilling of the HR function globally, implementation  of  new  global  practices  and  processes,  empowering Managers and employees to co-create their experience at Pernod Ricard.  The  plan  will  reach  full  deployment  by  December 2021 cascaded  to  HR  professionals  throughout  Pernod  Ricard  in  order  to bring a consistent experience for all employees.\n\n## 'Let's Talk Talent' our Performance Management & Development Planning process\n\nPernod Ricard employees and their performance are the foundation of the  company's  success.  Building  on  the  process  launched  last  year 'Let's Talk Talent', we implemented the 'How' of performance into the annual performance review process. How you do things is as important as  what  you  do.  Employees  are  evaluated  not  only  on  what  they achieved  but  also  on  how  they  achieved  it  through  the  leadership attributes. Let's Talk Talent is intended to provide a systematic process, which is comprehensive, fair and developmentally focused. It enables Pernod Ricard to identify skills and competencies required to support  its  strategic  plans  and  encourages  a  diverse  high  performing culture.  This process,  together  with  the  assessment  of  individuals' potential to grow through their Learning Agility, forms the basis for how we  identify  and  develop  talents  in  the  organization  for  career development  and  succession  planning.  It  cultivates  a  learning organization enabling us to develop our employees to progress within the organization.\n\nTo  achieve  this,  we  encourage  employee  ownership  of  their  career development. For development to make an impact, employees must be clear on what skill or behaviour needs to improve, be willing to make the change and know what steps to take. This is an important aspect of the feedback process, encouraged throughout the year between Manager and Employee.\n\nWe  offer  our  employees  resources  that  provide  them  with  ideas  and strategies  on  how  to  improve  so  that  they  can  be  as  effective  as possible and empowered to take the development steps to grow their career.\n\n## Pernod Ricard University\n\nPernod  Ricard  University  collaborates  with  the  business  and  HR Departments  to  identify  Learning  &  Development  needs  and  then design  programs  with  high-end  institutions,  consultants  and  internal experts.  Formats  are  often  a  blend  of  e-learning,  classroom  and experiential  sessions  assembled  in  a  fine  balance  to  deliver  the  best impact.\n\nL&D  programs  are  rolled  out  and  delivered  online,  locally  or  at  the historical  Domaine  de  la  Voisine  near  Paris,  a  place  acquired  by Paul Ricard in 1957, and transformed into a state-of-the-art campus in 2017.  Participants  will  always  find  themselves  in  a  cohort  comprising colleagues  from  different  parts  of  the  world  who  might  come  from  all types of functions, depending on the training, or from different cultures. This is critical to create that special bond that ties the group together and that we call 'convivialit\u00e9'.\n\nSince 2016, with the iGrow program, Pernod Ricard has engaged in an ambitious  plan  to  train  teams  at  scale  on  functional  skills.  In  2019, over 300 Managers  and  senior  experts  were  trained  as  facilitators  to\n\ndeploy  global  programs  locally  to  over  2,000  participants  as  of June 2020. Combined with microlearning, these sessions result in a very high  engagement  rates  and  great  impact,  all  while  significantly reducting  deployment  costs.  During  the  Covid-19  crisis,  all  iGrow programs were adapted to be delivered remotely, allowing to maintain Pernod  Ricard's  effort  on  Learning  &  Development,  and  PR  University team has kept working closely with functions to design new key training programs to be deployed in 2020.\n\nIn  the  spirit  of  the  Group  Leadership  Attributes,  Pernod  Ricard University  introduced  the  Leadership  Curriculum  to  support  the development  of  individual  leadership  competencies.  A  very  rewarding multicultural  experience,  it  invites  an  open-minded  reflection  on personal change and the role of leaders. The programme is organised into  two  modules  that  participants  can  attend  over  time:  Mixers, for young  aspiring  leaders,  Shakers  for  confirmed  leaders  willing  to  be taken  outside  their  comfort  zone.  Since  the  implementation  of  these programmes,  652 employees  have  benefitted  from  the  'Mixers' programme and 229 from the 'Shakers' programme.\n\nBlenders  is  a  two-phase  global  Leadership  Programme  designed  in response to Pernod Ricard business challenges. The Group uses this to help  top  leaders  become  more  agile,  digitally  savvy,  innovative  and consumer  centric  talent  developers.  The  Group  commits  to  better preparing  its  top  leaders,  improving  succession  planning  and  career planning.\n\n- Phase 1: 139 of the Top Management team were assessed against the \u0097 newly developed Group Leadership Model. This reflects the skills and behaviors  required  to  lead  teams  and  provides  participants  with  a benchmark for their professional development;\n- Following  the  assessments,  Individualized  Development  Plans  were drawn up based on each person's needs.\n- Phase 2:  in  January 2019,  participants  started  their  development \u0097 journeys with various external activities designed to build their skills (trainings, seminars, etc.).\n\nIn  March 2020,  PR  University  launched  a  daily  newsletter  under  the banner of 'Learn a New Thing Every Day'. Its aim is to encourage and nurture employees' thirst for knowledge, while promoting PR University's offer  of  training  resources,  and  curating  internal  and  external  content focusing  on  people  development.  With  over  1,600  subscribers, it is established as a new learning ritual for many employees.\n\nTo  take  advantage  of  the  new  employee-centric  tool,  Workday, Pernod Ricard  University  launched Workday  Learning in  June 2019. Pernod Ricard employees can use this new Learning platform to enrol and  access  all  Pernod  Ricard  University  training,  do  online  modules and view their learning history.\n\n## Leadership Assessment and Development Centre LeAD UP Programme\n\nThe Group continues to deliver Leadership Assessment and Development  Centres,  through  an  external  provider,  to  i)  assess capabilities and  leadership  potential, ii) identify strengths and competencies to be developed, iii) empower high potential individuals, iv)  better  prepare  them  for  future  leadership  roles,  and v)  encourage individual  ownership  of  careers  by  all  employees.  The LeAD  UP programme offers two-day sessions at which participants do individual interviews  and  case  studies.  They  also  receive  an  extensive  feedback session on site and one month after the workshop.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Seen as a source of richness and a real performance driver for the Company, Pernod  Ricard  has  made  diversity  a  focus  for  its  leaders  through  the 'Better Balance for Better Business' initiative. This program aims to raise\n\nawareness  on  the  value  of  Diversity  throughout  the  business  with  a focus on Gender and Nationality and laid the foundation to address any other dimension of Diversity, as may be relevant in the various parts of the  Group.  Major  global  targets  were  set  following  the  campaign  and became part of the 2030 S&R roadmap.\n\n| Policies         | Targets   |\n|------------------|-----------|\n| 2030 S&R Roadmap | By 2022, ensure equal pay across the business (gender pay equity). \u0097 By 2030, Top Management team  (1)  will be gender balanced  (2) . \u0097           |\n\n- Internal definition: Band C and above. (1)\n- Balanced teams considered achieved with a range of 40-60% of women and men. (2)\n\nLocal  affiliates'  leadership  teams  set  up  their  own  Better  Balance  for Better  Business  agenda,  supported  by  the  Global  Initiative.  Between 2015 and 2020, the proportion of women in the Group 'Top 500' rose from 19% to 26%.\n\nThe new HR Strategy, TransfoHRm, announced in 2018, is an inherently Diversity friendly strategy. In particular, TransfoHRm looked at ensuring that  key  processes  like  talent  development  and  management  are  fair and equitable, For example 'Let's Talk Talent', the new Performance and Talent Assessment cycle. Supported by Workday, the Group HRIS global platform, Let's Talk Talent is a consistent process, based on an objective assessment  of  performance  and  potential,  which gives  all  employees equal  chances  to  develop  a  successful  and  fulfilling  career  at  Pernod Ricard. With the 'How' of performance now as important as its 'What', with Managers better trained in performance evaluation and calibration the  process  is  designed  to  overcome  the  traditional  pitfalls  of  talent management to make Pernod Ricard a system more open to diversity.\n\nThe Group has also become more visible on the Diversity challenge with an active participation in the main event of the last two editions of the Women's  Forum  in  Paris  (10  delegates,  participation  to  the  CEOs' workshop and event sponsorship).\n\nFinally, at the end of FY 2020, and fully consistent with the fundamental objectives  of  TransfoHRm,  the  Group  Global  Talent  Management\n\nDirector  formally  took  on  the  additional  responsibilities  of  Diversity  & Inclusion to shift the focus of 'Better Balance for Better Business' from the creation of more Diversity to focusing on Inclusion as a catalyst to accelerate Pernod Ricard performance.\n\nRegarding  gender  pay  equity,  the  Company  has  launched  a  global project in the first half of FY20, partnering with an external independent specialist  on  pay  equity.  This  global  initiative  has  entailed  an  audit  of over 70 countries. The idea was to identify the behavioral drivers and roots of pay gaps between male and female employees. First results are encouraging  vs.  market  practice  (currently  2.3%)  and  Pernod  Ricard wants  to  strive  towards  equal  pay  across  its  business  by  2022. This project  will  be  part  of  a  long-term  systematic  review  of  our compensation  and  talent  practices  to  ensure  strict  pay  equity  across the Group.\n\nThe Group strives to bring in young people through different types of contracts  (apprenticeships,  training,  etc.).  The  Group  also  recruits  and develops  young  graduates  through VIE  (international  volunteers  in business) and international young graduate programmes. These include the  Jameson  International  Graduate  Programme,  Pernod  Ricard  Asia Regional  Management  Trainee  Programme  and  the  Martell  Mumm Perrier-Jou\u00ebt  Ambassadors  programme.  Furthermore,  Pernod  Ricard University supports the work of the Youth Action Council (YAC) (1) .",

In  FY20,  45  affiliates  worked  on  adapting  premises  and investing  in  appropriate  equipment,  providing  training  and  raising employee  awareness,  conducting  joint  projects  with  specialised establishments,  participating  in  dedicated  forums,  recruiting  workers with disabilities, etc.\n\n## Key Performance Indicators\n\n## Representation of women at 30 June (permanent contracts)\n\n| Number and %                        | FY19        | FY20        |\n|-------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Group employees                     | 6,609 (37%) | 6,658 (37%) |\n| Non-managers                        | 3,878 (34%) | 3,871 (35%) |\n| Managers                            | 2,731 (41%) | 2,787 (42%) |\n| Top management                      | 131 (26%)   | 135 (27%)   |\n| Management Committees of affiliates | 24%         | 26%         |\n\nThis breakdown can be explained by the Group's significant presence in countries where the labour market is male-dominated, such as in India, where men make up more than 92% of the workforce.

To  monitor  the  drivers  of  engagement, Pernod Ricard  conducted  the  fifth  edition  of  its  bi-annual  employee opinion  survey  'iSay'  in  June 2019  in  partnership  with  Willis  Towers Watson.\n\nthe previous ones to measure progress. The 2019 edition indicated an engagement level of 88%, far above other businesses in the Fast-Moving Consumer  Goods  sector.  Pernod  Ricard  affiliates  are  responsible  for addressing the areas most relevant to them and action planning against them.\n\nIn this edition, 85%  of  employees  completed  a  questionnaire (97% online) of over 100  questions  available  in  35  languages, a consistently very high response rate.

Each  affiliate  manages  its  policy  locally while  upholding  a  set  of  common  rules.  These  include  developing  a performance  culture  and  offering  compensation  that  is  competitive locally.  This  also  involves  setting  up  straightforward,  meaningful  and motivating compensation packages.\n\nTotal  payroll  is  included  in  Note 3.5  Expenses by type to  Section 6 'Consolidated  financial  statements'.  This  year,  payroll  represented 14.4% of net sales.\n\n## Signature of labour agreements\n\nEach year, the affiliates sign roughly 100 agreements with the various social  partners  worldwide,  thereby  encouraging  improved  social dialogue.  The  number  of  agreements  signed  depends  on  changes  to local legislation.\n\nThe  agreements  signed  by  affiliates  during  the  past  year  mainly covered compensation and profit-sharing, group welfare schemes and occupational health and safety.\n\n## Performance culture: profit-sharing and incentive policies\n\nPerformance  is  encouraged  through  favourable  profit-sharing  and incentive policies. The total gross amount paid under profit-sharing and incentive plans to over 5,807 employees  amounted  to  nearly \u20ac42 million. This was matched by contributions (additional sum paid to employees for investments in the Company savings plan) amounting to over \u20ac5 million. Moreover, long-term profit-sharing policies (such as allocating  performance-based  shares)  have  once  again  been implemented in FY20 for over 800 employees worldwide.\n\nIn 2019, the Group launched Accelerate , its very first Employee Share Ownership  Plan.  This  first  version  of  the  Plan  has  been  rolled  out  in 18 countries,  covering  75%  of  Group  employees.  The  clear  goal  is  to give employees a share in the Group's future development and growth. The initiative proved highly successful, with an overall subscription rate of 41.5%. Such a level is rarely achieved when structured offerings are launched.  The  subscription  rate  exceeded  60%  in  a  number  of countries, such as India (76.4%) and Hong Kong (60.4%). In France, the subscription rate was 56.9%.\n\n## ACTION PLANS AND NEXT STEPS\n\n## Welfare protection and health insurance\n\nIn accordance with the Group's commitment, all employees are offered a  welfare  protection  plan  covering  major  risks  (death  and  invalidity). Some  chose  not  to  be  covered  or  are  covered  by  their  spouse's employer.\n\n## Social dialogue\n\nThe  Group  has  a  long  tradition  of  social  dialogue  and  promotes freedom  of  association  in  all  the  countries  in  which  it  operates. In addition, it firmly believes in the importance of providing a working environment with optimal working conditions.\n\n- European  Works  Council : with  over  50%  of  its  staff  based  in \u0097 Europe,  the  Group  has  mainly  focused  its  efforts  on  European employee  representatives,  through  the  European  Works  Council. This council brings together one or more representatives from every affiliate  within  the  EU  with  over  50 people.  It  had  a  total  of  24 representatives in FY20. The European Works Council meets at least once a year. A Select Committee, elected by their peers, comprising five  members  from  five  different  countries,  meets  at  least  once  a year  too.  The  Select  Committee  may  act  on  its  own  initiative  in response  to  any  social  measure  that  might  be  taken  in  Europe involving  at  least  two  countries  in  which  Pernod Ricard  has  local teams.\n\nTo  share  information,  an  Intranet  site  publishes  content  each  year co-written by delegates and the HR Department.\n\nThe France  Group  Committee meets  once  a  year.  It  brings together  employee  representatives  appointed  by  the  largest  trade unions  in  the  French  affiliates.  At  these  meetings,  the  Group's business  activities  are  reviewed,  together  with  an  analysis  of employment trends and forecast changes during the year ahead.\n\nThe Group Committee and the European Works Council are chaired by the Group Chairman & CEO, Alexandre Ricard, and moderated by the HR Department;\n\n- The  Global  Deal :  Pernod  Ricard  has  officially  signed  up  to  the \u0097 Global  Deal,  a  multi-stakeholder  partnership  intended  to  address challenges  in  the  global  labour  market  and  enable  everyone  to benefit  from  globalisation.  It  aims  to  encourage  governments, businesses, unions and other organisations to make commitments to enhance  social  dialogue  and  promote  joint  solutions.  The  deal entails exchanges of ideas, joint projects, lessons learned and policy advice.  It  will  also  promote  concrete  initiatives  and  voluntary commitments.

Pernod Ricard's approach to Health & Safety (H&S) is underpinned by the 'Cr\u00e9ateurs de convivialit\u00e9' vision. The Group is thus committed to developing a culture where everyone has a role to play and  where  employees take  ownership of safety by  sharing  responsibility  for  their  safety  and  that  of  their co-workers.\n\n| Policies         | Targets   |\n|------------------|-----------|\n| 2030 S&R Roadmap | By 2020: employee accident frequency rate reduced for all sites to < 8.0 and the employee  \u0097 accident severity rate to < 0.25.           |\n|                  | By 2025: become 'best in class' in the Wines & Spirits industry by achieving the target  \u0097 of zero operational injuries (employees and sub-contractors) at Pernod Ricard.           |\n\nThis  policy  has  been  approved  by  Pernod  Ricard's  Chairman,  Chief Executive Officer, and its Executive Committee. It has been presented to the Board of Directors. The Executive Vice President, Human Resources, Sustainability & Responsibility oversees the implementation  of  the  Group's  Health  &  Safety  Policy.  Affiliates  Vice Presidents, and each Management Director at local level are in charge of implementing the Pernod Ricard Global Health & Safety Policy.\n\n## ACTION PLANS AND NEXT STEPS\n\nThe strategic priorities to achieve Pernod Ricard's goal are to:\n\n- develop a Culture where safety is at the heart of Convivialit\u00e9 ; \u0097\n- develop leadership through engagement, motivation and \u0097 empowerment;\n- improve business performance through excellence in Health & Safety. \u0097\n\nAchieving this goal also requires management systems, in that respect, the  Group's  active  production  sites  are  required  to  be  ISO 45001 certified.  Pernod  Ricard  is  also  committed  to  and  actively  works  on  a health & safety culture in which everyone is involved in taking care of each other through a culture of interdependence .\n\nIn  2017,  Pernod  Ricard  identified  a  need  for  change  in  terms  of  H&S. A tiered  and  focused  approach  has  been  launched  targeting  specific affiliates with the greatest potential for improvement. Third-party audits have been undertaken (10 sites) to develop a 3-year action plan linking culture and performance.\n\nIn  2018,  the  Group  defined  its H&S  Ambition by  aligning  leadership around a common vision. Senior leaders collaborated on developing the drivers of success, strategy and associated roadmap.\n\nIn 2019,  Pernod  Ricard  developed  a H&S  Roadmap  and  key performance  indicators for short-term and  long-term  actions. It also agreed upon a governance model.\n\nFrom  2020  to  2025,  the  Group  will communicate  &  roll  out  the roadmap to measure and share progress.\n\n## KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS\n\n| Workplace accidents and % of sites certified           | FY19   | FY20   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Number of workplace accidents with lost-time  (1)      | 161    | 106    |\n| Frequency rate  (1) (2)                                | 4.61   | 2.95   |\n| Severity rate  (1) (3)                                 | 0.08   | 0.07   |\n| Number of fatalities  (1)                              | 0      | 0      |\n| % of production sites ISO 45001 or ISO 18001 certified | 82.6%  | 91%    |\n\n- Interim, fixed-term and permanent contracts.

(2)\n- Severity rate = number of sick days for workplace accident x 1,000/total number of hours worked during the year by employee and interim staff. (3)\n\n## Human Rights 3.3.2.4\n\nOperating  in  over  73 countries  and  mindful  of  the  new  challenges  caused  by  globalisation,  Pernod  Ricard  values  its  employees,  suppliers  and communities. It also recognises that it is its responsibility and ethical duty to ensure Human Rights are respected across the Group's global operations and value chain. This implies adhering to internationally recognised standards and addressing gaps.\n\n| Policies         | Targets                                                                                                         |\n|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 2030 S&R Roadmap | By 2025, align with the United Nations Guiding Principles (UNGPs) on Human Rights  \u0097                                                                                                                 |\n| 2030 S&R Roadmap | including due diligence across the Group's operations and strengthening our responsible  procurement processes. |\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  Pernod  Ricard  Code  of  Business Conduct, updated  in FY19, now  includes Human  Rights  and Fundamental Freedoms. The Supplier Standards has been updated with additional commitments on this front.\n\nThe  Executive  Vice  President,  Human  Resources,  Sustainability  & Responsibility  oversees  the  implementation  of  the  Group's  Human Rights  Policy.  HR  Directors  and  each  Managing  Director  at  local  level are in charge of implementing the Pernod Ricard Global Human Rights Policy. As a decentralised organisation, Pernod Ricard gives responsibility to its affiliates for adopting, respecting and promoting the policy. Visits to affiliates by cross-functional internal audit teams include some  labour  evaluation.  Managing  Directors'  performance  evaluations cover  labour  matters  as  well  as  societal  and  financial  performance. Any targets are specific to each affiliate.\n\n## Action plans and next steps\n\nIn FY18, Pernod Ricard joined the UN Global Compact's Decent Work in Global  Supply  Chains  Action  platform,  an  alliance  of  companies committed to respecting Human Rights and fundamental principles and rights  at  work.  This  involves  working  through  their  supply  chains  and taking collective action to address decent work.\n\nIn FY19, a study based on the UNGPs and Human Rights was conducted on  the  Group's  supply  chain  to  identify  gaps  and  improve  its  due diligence on Human Rights over the long term.\n\nIn FY20, to embed a UNGPs approach, Pernod Ricard decided to focus on its  own employees with the assistance of a third-party. The goal is firstly  to  assess current operations and to raise awareness. In addition, a country  level  study  will  be  conducted  scanning  and  mapping potential Human Rights risks based on a selection of criteria key to the Group's operations and activities. These tools will help affiliates identify gaps  and  appropriate  action  plans.  The  Group  will  also  explore  other areas  such  as  capacity  building  and  impact  assessment  to  identify salient Human Rights issues and prioritise action.\n\n## Responsible supply chain 3.3.2.5\n\nDue  to  the  wide  range  of  its  procurement  and  supplies,  Pernod  Ricard  relies  on  many  suppliers  across  its  supply  chain.  From  farming  and manufacturing through distribution and merchandising, some of the Group's impact on society and the environment is managed by its suppliers. Pernod Ricard believes in creating strong business relationships and encourages suppliers to improve their practices and assists them in doing so.\n\n| Policies         | Targets   |\n|------------------|-----------|\n| 2030 S&R Roadmap | By 2025, Pernod Ricard sets out to have no direct supplier of products and services  \u0097 with high or medium risks  (1) .           |\n\n- According to the risk mapping tool used internally.

It is available in English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, and Mandarin;\n- Pernod  Ricard  Procurement  Code  of  Ethics ,  embedded  in  the \u0097 Code  of  Business  Conduct,  establishes  rules  for  balanced  and healthy relationships with suppliers as well as the basic sustainability principles. It is available in French, English and Spanish;\n- Sustainability model clauses for contracts, it is available in French, \u0097 English, Mandarin, Spanish, and Portuguese.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe  Responsible  Procurement  process  applies  throughout  the  Group and  is  supported  by  General  Management.  Each  affiliate  selects  and monitors  its  suppliers  and  subcontractors  identified  as  risky,  and  is therefore responsible for its application.\n\n## ACTION PLANS AND NEXT STEPS\n\nImplemented  throughout  the  Group,  the Blue  Source process  allows affiliates  to  apply  the  Responsible  Procurement  strategy  locally  with their suppliers and subcontractors:\n\n- Supplier Standards : to be signed by all suppliers on platform Partner \u0097 Up with the aim of increasing awareness around Human Rights and labour  law,  health  &  safety,  environmental  impact,  responsible drinking,  integrity  and  fair  business  practices.  This document  has been updated in 2019 and includes commitments such as 'Respect Land  and  water  rights  of  communities',  'Environmental  regulation', 'Animal  welfare'  and  'Tax  evasion'.  Moreover,  the  Group  took  this opportunity to raise awareness among its suppliers and invite them to do the same. Both direct suppliers (Wet and Dry Goods) and the main indirect  suppliers  (POS/VAPs) who do not sign the updated version will see their business relations with Pernod Ricard suspended;",

For  example, Pernod Ricard offers an online learning module covering merchandising. It  is  designed  for  Marketing  and  Communications  employees  and highlights  the  risks  related  to  the  development  and  purchasing  of promotional products. In addition, training is offered in various formats throughout the year, including telephone calls, workshops and seminars.\n\nThe Group will take the following steps:\n\n- request  all  suppliers,  from  all  categories,  to  sign  the  Supplier \u0097 Standards on Partner Up;\n- complete analysis of direct suppliers (Dry and Wet Goods) and key \u0097 indirect suppliers (POS/VAPs);\n- explore partnership plans to engage  in  a  multi-stakeholder \u0097 programme. Pernod Ricard is already working with Bonsucro, a global multi-stakeholder  non-profit  organisation  to  promote  sustainable sugarcane production, processing and trade worldwide. The Group is also part of Aim-Progress, a forum of leading Fast Moving Consumer Goods  manufacturers  and  common  suppliers,  assembled  to  enable and promote responsible sourcing practices and sustainable supply chains;\n- train procurement  Managers  and/or  functions  on  Responsible \u0097 Procurement  processes  including  labour  rights  and  Human  Rights considerations;\n- expand  Responsible  Procurement  processes  to  other  key  indirect \u0097 categories (1) .\n\n## Circular Making 3.3.3\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe  world  is  under  huge  pressure  with  finite resources.  Pernod  Ricard  intends  to  do  its  part  in decreasing the natural resources used and minimising  waste  at  every  step  of  the  value  chain. This will involve imagining new production ways that optimise and help preserve natural resources.\n\nThe  traditional  single-use  consumption  model  has now reached its limits and new circular models must emerge to protect our planet and natural resources. Circularity  is  one  of  the  Group's  key  priorities. To become more circular, Pernod Ricard is committed to  moving  its  business  towards  a  circular  making\n\nmodel that fosters reduction, reuse and recycling. Such a shift will allow fewer  resources  to  be  consumed,  waste  disposed  of  and  ultimately reduce Pernod Ricard's environmental impact.\n\n## Environmental management 3.3.3.1\n\nPernod Ricard strives to implement strong environmental management systems  throughout  the  business.  They  are  the  cornerstones  of  the Group'  strategy,  helping  it  tackle  long-term  environmental  risks, reduce its environmental impact and seize opportunities at every level. Environmental  management  systems  look  to  disseminate  the  Group's environmental  standards  throughout  the  business  and  incorporate environmental considerations into its management practices. This helps manage risks and transform the business into a more circular model.\n\n| Policies                   | Targets   | Achievements   |\n|----------------------------|-----------|----------------|\n| 2020 Environmental Roadmap | 100% of Group employees at administrative  \u0097 sites work in offices conforming to the internal           | 72%  \u0097                |\n|                            | 100% of major production sites certified  \u0097 ISO 14001.           | 93% covering 99.9% of production \u0097                |\n\n- (1) Indirect advertising and promotional investments: all expenses related to the advertising and promotion of our brands (such as expenses relating to media, POS articles and value added packaging (VAP), content production, events, research and research reports).

Environmental management systems are implemented based on the following principles:\n\n- the  Headquarters'  Sustainable  Performance  Division  oversees  and \u0097 coordinates  measures  at  Group  level  by  setting  shared  goals, monitoring performance, circulating guidelines with minimum requirements  and  sharing  best  practices.  Each  Brand  Company  is required  to  evaluate  its  performance  against  these  requirements annually.  Where  necessary,  compliance  action  plans  should  be implemented;\n- Pernod  Ricard's  activities,  both  for  the  Brand  Companies  and  the \u0097 Market Companies, must comply with the environmental requirements outlined in the Group environmental guidelines:\n- affiliates are accountable for complying with local legal \u0097 requirements.  They  must  also  report  to  Headquarters  any  local incidents or non-compliance,\n- affiliates  are  accountable  for  assessing  their  long-term  risks. \u0097 They must thus identify  ways  to  reduce  their  own  environmental impact and apply the Group's policy locally,\n- major  production  sites  are  required  to  be  ISO 14001  certified.  In \u0097 FY20, 93.3% of production sites were  ISO 14001  certified (covering 99.9% of production),\n- Group employees and administrative sites are required to meet the \u0097 requirements of the 'Green Office' guidelines regarding different topics such as green offices governance, energy, water, waste and business travel.\n\nThis year, one environmental incident was reported to local authorities and  nine  complaints  received  from  third  parties.  This  includes  all possible  potential  impact  of  an  industrial  site,  in  particular  smells  and noise. The events are described below:\n\n- one accidental spillage of a chemical product in Scotland; \u0097\n- five  noise  complaints  in  Australia  and  four  odour  complaints  in \u0097 Scotland.\n\nA root cause analysis was conducted for all these events and corrective actions plans drawn up.\n\nAs of 30 June 2020, no provisions have been funded for environmental risks.  Some  affiliates  had  to  provide  guarantees  when  applying  for operating  permits.  These  are  not  for  specific  amounts  but  ensure  the affiliates'  solvency  to  deal  with  any  pollution  or  other  environmental accident.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Climate change: reduction 3.3.3.2 and adaptation\n\n## Alignment with TCFD recommendations\n\nClimate  change  is  one  of  the  most  urgent  challenges  facing  this generation.  Combatting  it  is  a  major  focus  of  Pernod  Ricard's environmental  policy.  The  Group  plans  to  reduce  the  CO2  equivalent emissions generated throughout its supply chain and adapt its business to ensure it is resilient. For greater transparency, Pernod Ricard follows the  recommendations  of  the  Task  Force  on  Climate-related  Financial Disclosure (TCFD).\n\n## GOVERNANCE\n\nPernod Ricard has a dedicated governance and organisational structure to  ensure  that  climate  change  issues  are  fully  incorporated  into  its strategy. That is why the Sustainability & Responsibility Senior Steering Committee (S&R Senior Steering Committee), chaired by Pernod Ricard's  Chairman  and  CEO,  was  created.  Pernod  Ricard  also has a dedicated Sustainable Performance team at HQ, responsible for implementing its climate change strategy.\n\nBoard supervision: the Board of Directors evaluates the appropriateness  of  Pernod  Ricard's  S&R  commitments.  It  also  ensures that  climate-related  issues  are  incorporated  into  the  Group'  strategy through  two  annual  meetings.  The  Board  relies  on  Pernod  Ricard's Operations  Department  to  incorporate  climate-related  issues  into  the Group's three-year strategic plans and budgets, in compliance with its strategic  guidelines.  The  Executive  Committee,  which  meets  twice  a year  on  S&R  topics,  prepares,  examines  and  approves  all  decisions relating to sustainability and climate change and submits its decisions to the Board of Directors. The Committee is also tasked with reviewing climate change  risks and  opportunities  assessed  by  the  S&R Department and HQ experts.\n\nRole  of  management: the  S&R  Senior  Steering  Committee  shapes Pernod Ricard's approach to climate change, among other sustainability issues.  For  its  part,  the  S&R  HQ  Team  ensures  that  the  strategy  is effectively  embedded  into  processes  and  practices.  The  S&R  Senior Steering  Committee,  considered  as  a  Top  Management  governance body, has nine members. They represent all the Group's functions at the highest  level:  CEO,  Managing  Director  GBD,  EVP  Human  Resources  & Sustainability  &  Responsibility,  EVP  Finance,  IT  and  Operations, Group VP Sustainability & Responsibility, VP Global Government Affairs, Group Operations Director, Global Marketing & Commercial Director and Group Communications Director. The Committee assesses and manages climate-related  risks  and  opportunities.  It  creates  action  plans  and oversees  the  implementation  of  the  strategy  by  the  operations  teams and the Global Business Development functions.",

This team reports to the Chairman  and  CEO.  It  also  presents  its  results  to  the  Executive Committee  and  the  Audit  Committee.  The Group's  major  risks  are monitored annually;\n- environmental risk mapping is based on a multi-criteria mapping tool. \u0097 Affiliates  input  the  data,  which  is  then  monitored  at  Group  level. Affiliates identify and rate environmental risks throughout a product's life  cycle  based  on  two  criteria:  i)  severity  (including  potential financial impact - scored from 1 to 7) and ii) probability (scored from 1 to 5).\n\nIn  terms  of  managing  these  risks,  each  major  risk  identified  is  placed under  the  responsibility  of  a  Group  Director.  Environmental  risks  and their  mitigation  plans  are  under  the  responsibility  of  the  Group Operations Director. The Group's environmental roadmap also draws up environmental action plans for the main environmental risks.\n\n## Help reduce climate change\n\n| Policies                   | Objectives   | Achievements and next steps   |\n|----------------------------|--------------|-------------------------------|\n| 2020 Environmental Roadmap | Focus on reducing the impact of production sites  (Scopes 1 and 2): 30% reduction in carbon emissions per unit produced  \u0097 at production sites, as between FY10 and FY20.              | Since FY10, carbon emissions per unit at production  \u0097 sites have fallen by 32.9%.                               |\n| 2030 S&R Strategy          | Through the new S&R strategy, the Group has set itself  ambitious new goals to speed up progress and extend  its actions (Scopes 1, 2 and 3), as follows: by 2030: 30% reduction in absolute carbon emissions  \u0097 at production sites (Scopes 1 and 2) (base year 2018).  The SBT initiative confirmed it was in line with the well  below 2\u00b0C scenario; by 2030: 50% reduction in the intensity of the Scope 3  \u0097 carbon footprint (base year 2018).

This  is  mainly  due  to packaging  materials  reduction  as  well  as  change  in  calculation methodology.\n\n## BREAKDOWN OF GROUP CARBON FOOTPRINT BY CATEGORY\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## PACKAGING AND POS MATERIALS\n\nPackaging and POS materials are the most carbon-intensive activity in Pernod Ricard's value chain. To reduce their carbon impact, the Group focuses on enhancing the eco-design of packaging, reducing its weight and optimising the materials used (see subsection 3.3.3.4 'Circular packaging and distribution').\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## AGRICULTURE PRACTICES\n\nAgriculture is the second most carbon-intensive activity in Pernod Ricard's value chain. Pernod Ricard's products inherently rely on agriculture.  Establishing  and  helping  improve  agricultural  practices  is therefore a strategic priority for the Group.\n\nOn  its  own  land,  the  Group  promotes  regenerative  agriculture, which can help capture carbon in the soil. Moreover, the Group works with  agricultural  suppliers  to  establish  preferred  standards  for  each crop.  The goal  is  to  identify  the  best  way  of  reducing  greenhouse  gas emissions for each crop.\n\n## TRANSPORT\n\nPernod  Ricard  seeks  to  optimise  land  transport  by  improving  vehicle loading, adjusting  schedules  and  using  more  efficient  vehicles. In the US,  the  Group  is  also  a  member  of  Smartways  Association, which aims  to  reduce  land  transportation  emissions.  In  Europe, the Absolut Company is a member of the Clean Shipping Project.\n\n## PRODUCTION SITES\n\nAt  production  sites,  the  Group  is  working  on  two  fronts:  i)  improving energy efficiency and ii) increasingly using less carbon-intensive energy. To  encourage  such  transitions,  the  Group  has  introduced  an  internal carbon price of \u20ac50 per ton of CO2 equivalent for investments.\n\nOperationally, production sites must improve energy efficiency through continuous  monitoring  of  energy  consumption  and  in-depth  energy assessments.  The  idea  is  to  set  energy-efficiency  targets  and  launch consumption  reduction  programmes  ( i.e. : renewal of processes, technologies,  etc.).  Several  large  sites  have  implemented  ISO 50001 certified energy management systems.\n\nMoreover,  the  Group  is  working  to  replace  heavy  fuel  oil  and  coal  with cleaner energy sources such as natural gas. It plans to only use renewable electricity  by  2025.  This  year,  Scope 1  (direct  CO2  equivalent  emissions) declined  by  4.2%  in  line  with  the  5.5%  decrease  in  production  volumes. Scope 2  (indirect  CO2  equivalent  emissions)  fell  sharply  from  35,151  to 29,557 tonnes due to a decrease in electricity consumption by 5.8% and an increase  in  renewable  electricity  sourcing.  In  terms  of  carbon  intensity, this represents a 1.4% rise per unit between FY19 and FY20 for Scopes 1 and 2 carbon emissions. This is due to a loss in energy efficiency of our bottling activities with the Covid-19 crisis.",

Some  of  these  gases  also  increase  the  greenhouse  effect. A programme  to  eliminate  the  most  environmentally  harmful refrigerant gases has been ongoing for numerous years. This has resulted  in  the  complete  elimination  of  CFCs.  HCFC  have also been progressively eliminated to reach a minimum level of 500kg this year.\n- Nitrogen  and  sulphur  oxide  emissions  (NOx  and  SOx)  contributing \u0097 indirectly  to  the  greenhouse effect and environmental acidification. These  compounds  are  produced  by  fossil  fuel  combustion. As emissions of these atmospheric pollutants are low in the alcoholic beverages  sector  compared  to  worldwide  emissions,  they  seem  to have  no  material  impact  on  Pernod  Ricard.  The  Group  does  not therefore feel it needs to monitor such emissions on an annual basis. The major distilleries nevertheless ensure that they comply with legal limits on the discharge of such pollutants.\n\n## Preserve water resources 3.3.3.3\n\nWater  is  an  essential  component  of  the  products  manufactured  by Pernod  Ricard.  From  irrigating  crops  to  processing  raw  materials, distilling,  blending eaux-de-vie and  formulating  products,  water  is involved in every stage of the product's life cycle.\n\nThe  Group  thus  faces  several  challenges.  It  must  i)  reduce  water consumption,  particularly  in  areas  with  shortages,  ii)  preserve  water quality by monitoring pollutants released by production  sites, and iii) fully comply with evolving environmental regulations. Pernod Ricard has been a member of the UN CEO Water Mandate since September 2010. This reaffirmed its commitment to protect the planet's water resources.\n\n| Policies                   | Objectives   | Achievements and next steps   |\n|----------------------------|--------------|-------------------------------|\n| 2020 Environmental Roadmap | At production site: 20% reduction in water consumption per unit produced  \u0097 between FY10 and FY20.              | Water consumption per unit produced has been  \u0097 reduced by 23.5%, exceeding targets.                               |\n| 2030 S&R Strategy          | Further reduction in water use by 20% from FY18  \u0097 to FY30. 100% of water replenished in same watershed  \u0097 for our production sites and dedicated copackers  located in high risk areas. Exploring innovative ways to reuse organic waste. \u0097              | In FY20, production sites have identified water  \u0097 reduction opportunities based on best available  technologies per activity (distillation, wineries,  bottling\u2026). This will feed into defining water use  excellence targets for each site. This year, 23.4% of the total water used in high risk  \u0097 locations has been replenished in the same watershed.                               |\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Water consumption and performance\n\n## ORIGIN OF THE WATER CONSUMPTION BY INDUSTRIAL SITES (M 3 )\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTo  reduce  direct  water  consumption  at  production  sites,  the  Group focuses its efforts on two main drivers: i) setting up systems to measure and monitor water use, and ii) identifying measures to save, reuse and recycle  water.  This  year,  continuous  improvements  in  water  efficiency measures  led  to  a  reduction  of  water  use  per  litre  of  pure  alcohol produced in distilleries, down by 1.36% compared to last year.\n\nThroughout the value chain, the drip irrigation technique is used in all irrigated vineyards operated by the Group. This reduces the water used to  what  is  strictly  necessary.  Moreover,  given  the  predominance  of agricultural raw materials in Pernod Ricard's water footprint (1) , the Group works  locally  with  the  affiliates'  suppliers  to  establish  sustainable agriculture standards that minimise water consumption (see subsection 3.3.1.2  'Promote  and  develop  resilient  agricultural supply chains').\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Water resource preservation strategy tailored to meet local challenges\n\nBecause  water  resources  are  unevenly  distributed,  risk  levels  vary depending  on  the  location  of  the  Group's  production  sites  and dedicaded  co-packing  activities.  To  better  understand  and  identify priorities,  sites  have  been  categorised  as  extremely  high  risk,  high  risk and low-medium risk, using an internal Water Risk Index. The Group aims to  replenish  the  water  used  by  its  sites  located  in  high-risk  areas through  local  projects  to  preserve  the  water  ecosystems.  This  led  to support watershed management by improving access to safe water and sanitation,  promoting  sustainable  water  use  and  integrated  water resources management among communities.\n\n| Area's risk level   | Pernod Ricard situation   |\n|---------------------|---------------------------|\n| Extremely high risk | 8 sites (India, Armenia, Mexico and China). \u0097 5.6% of the Group's total water consumption. \u0097                           |\n| High risk           | 7 sites (Armenia, Australia, Spain and France). \u0097 5.3% of the Group's total water consumption. \u0097                           |\n| Medium risk         | 33 sites. \u0097 9.7% of the Group's total water consumption. \u0097                           |\n| Low risk            | 42 sites. \u0097                           |\n| Low risk            | 79.4% of the Group's total water consumption. \u0097                           |\n\n10 Indian  dedicated  co-packers  are  located  in  high  risk  areas  and  are concerned by the Group water resource preservation strategy.\n\nTo date, the water resource preservation strategy has been launched on sites  located  in  'Extremely  high  risk'  areas.  Indian  sites  have  already implemented  water  projects  in  their  watersheds.  They  are  actively engaged  with  communities  through  the  development  of  water replenishment projects in order to support water conservation and also provide or improve access to safe water and sanitation. Other sites are in  the  process  of  finding  a  project  partner  and  investigating  water project  options.  The  water  benefits  methodology  and  calculation associated to each project must be checked by a third party.\n\n## Treatment of waste water\n\nTo  reduce  the  pollutants  released  into  the  natural  environment  and make  sure  that  the  water  discharge  by  production  sites  does  not damage surrounding ecosystems or other natural resources, production sites  are  fitted  with  different  technologies  such  as  aerobic,  anaerobic treatments, filtration, etc., depending on waste water quality requirements.  The  Group  will  also  explore  innovative  projects  for treating this waste water.\n\nFY20,  77%  of  waste  water  was  discharged  into  a  public  sewerage system, 17% was discharged into the environment following treatment, and 6% was recycled for vineyard irrigation.\n\n(1) Analysis of the Group's water footprint indicates that by far the most water-intensive activity in the value chain is the supply of agricultural raw materials, representing 99% of the Group's water consumption. In comparison, the direct water consumption of production sites represents less than 1% of the Group's water consumption.\n\n<!-- image -->",

For this reason, Pernod Ricard adopts eco-design principles when designing new packaging and POS and ensures that it can be used sustainably. It also participates in local packaging collection and recycling schemes to address packaging end of life.\n\nOur  vision  is  for  Pernod  Ricard  to  be  recognised  as  a  pioneer  in  sustainable  packaging  &  POS,  contributing  to  setting  the  standards  within  the industry.\n\n| Policies         | Targets   | Achievements in FY20   |\n|------------------|-----------|------------------------|\n| 2030 S&R Roadmap | By 2021, 100% of promotional items made from  \u0097 single-use plastic will be banned  (exception for tasting  cups by 1 July 2025) .

Production  of packaging and promotional items account for 33% of the Group's carbon emissions (see subsection 3.3.3.2).\n\n## BREAKDOWN OF THE WEIGHT OF PACKAGING\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Participation in systems for the collection of packaging in support of recycling and reuse\n\nMost packaging waste produced by the Group's activities is generated after  final  consumption  of  products.  The  key  issue  is  therefore  to improve waste sorting solutions for consumers so that packaging can be recycled  or  reused.  Pernod  Ricard  has  set  up  or  joined  various programmes worldwide to improve recycling or reuse packaging:\n\n- Europe: Group contribution of around \u20ac8 million to national schemes \u0097 designed  to  improve  the  collection  and  recycling  of  domestic packaging, including glass;\n- United  States:  it  joined  the  'Glass  Recycling  Coalition'  to  foster \u0097 efficient and economically viable recycling channels by involving all players in the chain (glass manufacturers, bottlers, recycling service providers, etc.);\n- Brazil:  joined  the  'Glass  is  Good'  project,  whose  purpose  is  to \u0097 increase the glass recycling rate by involving all sectorial players.\n\n## Reduce waste 3.3.3.5\n\nLimiting waste throughout the production chain and at the end of product life is an integral part of the Group's circular economy approach. Pernod Ricard is committed to minimising waste disposal and maximising the recycling and reuse of its products. Pernod Ricard's policy is focused on limiting food waste and eliminating landfill waste, ensuring all waste generated on industrial sites is recycled.\n\n| Policies                   | Targets   | Achievement in FY20   |\n|----------------------------|-----------|-----------------------|\n| 2020 Environmental Roadmap | Zero waste sent to landfill at production level. \u0097           | 557 tonnes of waste disposed to landfill sites this year,  \u0097 42% reduction compared to FY19.                       |\n\n## Limiting of food waste\n\nThe  Group  takes  steps  to  minimise  food  waste  throughout  its  value chain:\n\n- upstream  agriculture:  reducing  food  waste  by  reusing  by-products \u0097 from the production of certain foods. For example, broken rice in India or  sugarcane  molasses  in  Cuba,  to  produce  alcohol.  Moreover, in developed  countries,  where  most  agricultural  raw  materials  used by  the  Group  are  sourced,  the  quality  of  infrastructure  plus  short supply  routes  prevent  products  such  as  cereals  from  perishing. As for grapes,  musts  or  wine,  they  are  delivered  directly  to  the Group's wineries by producers, limiting supply chain losses;\n- production  sites:  focus  on  recycling  waste  generated  through  the \u0097 transformation of raw agricultural materials (spent grains, vinasse and grape  pomace).  The  majority  of  waste  is  recycled  to  make  animal feed, biogas, farm compost or used for other industrial purposes;\n- consumer level: waste generated is very low since wine & spirits can \u0097 be kept for a long time, and the packaging is designed to last until the product is fully consumed.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Reducing waste and improving recycling on industrial sites\n\nThe production sites mostly generate non-hazardous waste (99% of total waste vs. 1% hazardous waste):\n\n- non-hazardous waste: \u0097\n- packaging waste (glass, paper, cardboard and plastics), \u0097\n- waste  from  the  transformation  of  agricultural  raw  materials  not \u0097 recovered as by-products (grape marc, stalks, sediment, etc.),\n- waste  produced  by  the  site's  activities  (sludge  from  treatment \u0097 plants, office waste, green waste, etc.);\n- hazardous waste: waste used for the sites' operation \u0097 (chemical product  containers,  used  oils,  solvents,  electrical  and electronic waste, neon tubes, batteries, etc.).\n\nThe  Group's  aims  at  moving  towards  zero  landfill  waste  by  2020. To achieve  this  goal,  the  affiliates  will  pursue  efforts  to  reduce  the quantity  of  waste  generated  and  identify  recycling  and  recovery processes. For hazardous waste requiring the use of a specific treatment process  to  prevent  environmental  risks,  the  Group  will  continue  to identify appropriate treatment processes locally.",

This  is  the  result  of  our  Group  campaign towards zero waste to landfill implemented across all production sites, with  noticeable  improvements  this  year  at  affiliates  such  as  Chivas Brothers and PR Argentina for example.\n\n## Product quality and safety 3.3.3.6\n\nPernod  Ricard  aims  to  provide  its  customers  with  products  of  the highest  quality,  and  places  particular  importance  on  consumer  health and safety. This has resulted in a significant commitment effort in terms of the prevention of risks associated with alcohol abuse. It also led to a strict  policy  in  terms  of  food  safety  during  the  process  of  product design, sourcing and manufacturing.\n\nThe control of consumer product safety is based on the implementation of the hazard analysis critical control point (HACCP) method that aims to identify all potential risk points in the manufacturing process.\n\nAppropriate preventive measures are then put in place to control them. Brand Companies producing the Group's strategic brands are ISO 9001 certified. This represents 99.8% of the alcohol produced. In addition, and despite  Wines  &  Spirits  being  less  exposed  to  food  safety  risks  than other food industry segments, Pernod Ricard also undertook the gradual certification of its facilities in accordance with ISO 22000 (Food safety management systems).\n\nQuality  internal  standards  are  established  by  Pernod  Ricard  for  its industrial  activities  including  various  specific  guidelines.  The  aim  is  to control risks such as the accidental contamination of a product or the presence of a foreign body in a bottle. These standards are audited as part of an internal cross-audit process.\n\nIn  addition,  a  Group  Intranet  site  called  'Complaint  Management System' is used to record and track consumer complaints and any other quality  issues  in  real  time.  This  immediately  informs  the  affiliate  in question so that corrective action can be taken. In the case of a serious product  safety  concern  issue,  the  system  also  immediately  informs Headquarters,  allowing  for  rapid  response.  Each  affiliate  has  a  crisis management  procedure.  This  is  particularly  for  product  health  risk involving, if necessary, a product recall. These procedures are subject to regular testing, training for people involved and updates.\n\nQuality  indicators  including  the  complaints  rate  are  presented  to  the Senior Management.\n\nFurthermore,  a  Food  Risk  Management  Committee  monitors  product food Safety issues. This is particularly important for emerging risks linked to  scientific  knowledge  or  new  regulations.  As  a  support  for  the  Food Risk Management Committee, a food safety and food law watch review is circulated with all the affiliates every two months. A chemical analysis plan is  conducted every year at Group level. In FY20, this involved 91 finished products with a total of over 3,400 analysis carried out.\n\nTo our knowledge, the Group's products do not contain nano-ingredients.  In  addition,  the  Group  is  committed  to  ensuring complete  GMO  traceability  of  its  products.  This  allows  it  to  assure consumers strict compliance with the labelling regulations for products containing GMOs. Accordingly, all affiliates conduct a risk assessment to identify  potential  sources  of  raw  materials,  taking  the  necessary measures to ensure control of these sources. Although the distillation stage eliminates the risk that GMO material may be present in distilled products,  supply  chains  for  products  that  are  guaranteed  GMO-free have  been  established  for  certain  corn-based  alcohols  in  the  United States and Europe.\n\nThe Group's absolute priority is to ensure its products comply with the regulations that apply to each of its various markets, and is safe for the consumer.\n\n|                                                                                                | FY19   | FY20   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| % of sites ISO 22000 certified by June of the fiscal year                                      | 81%    | 79%    |\n| % ISO 22000 certified in volume produced covering all the Group's strategic brands             | 99.8%  | 99.8%  |\n| % Brand Companies that are producing Group's strategic brands are certified ISO 9001           | 100%   | 100%   |\n| Number of complaints received through the 'Complaint Management System' during the fiscal year | 3,800  | 3,300  |\n\n<!-- image -->",

These  initiatives  will  be  implemented  locally  by  its  affiliates,  in partnership  with  industry  peers,  civil  society  and  local  authorities. Building on the strength of our decentralized business model, each affiliate  chooses  the  area  of  intervention  based  on  local  needs  and priorities. Their actions are nevertheless subject to global coordination, minimum standards and common performance metrics.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## SUSTAINABILITY & RESPONSIBILITY\n\n## Responsible Hosting 3.3.4\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPernod Ricard believes that its products bring people together  and  have  a  valuable  place  in  society. However, the Group also acknowledges that alcohol can be misused, and that inappropriate consumption of alcohol can cause serious problems to individuals and communities. The Group believes it has a role to play  in  preventing  and  reducing  the  harmful  use  of alcohol.  Pernod  Ricard  is  committed  to  promoting responsible  alcohol  consumption  and  combating harmful  drinking  -  working  with    stakeholders  to achieve  real  change  and  continuously  developing and strengthening its responsible marketing\n\npractices.\n\nPernod  Ricard  is  not  alone  in  promoting  responsible  drinking. Partnerships  with  other  industry  members,  governments  and  local communities are essential to success in this area. Positive change can only be achieved in unison with others, with one collective voice.\n\n## Promote responsible drinking 3.3.4.1\n\nPernod Ricard is committed promoting moderate drinkingand reducing alcohol misuse. The Group fully supports the World Health Organization's  (WHO)  goal  of  reducing  harmful  drinking  by  10% worldwide  by  2025.  For  this,  Pernod  Ricard  has  a  new  Responsible Hosting strategy focusing on tackling alcohol misuse. This goal is fully aligned  with  its  'Cr\u00e9ateurs  de  convivialit\u00e9'  vision  as  there  is  no conviviality  in  excessive  or  inappropriate  drinking.  Adult  consumers must make responsible choices about whether or not to drink, and how much  to  drink.  It  is  also  aligned  with  its  Premiumisation  strategy. The Group wants adult consumers to consume better and high-quality products, not increase their overall alcohol consumption.\n\nThe  Alcohol  in  Society  team  within  the  Public  Affairs  Department coordinates the Group's 'Responsible Hosting' strategy and its efforts to  combat  inappropriate  alcohol  consumption  worldwide  through  its network of S&R and Public Affairs leaders.\n\n## RESPONSIBLE DRINKING PROGRAMMES AND CAMPAIGNS\n\nPernod Ricard believes that targeted preventive action on the ground is an  effective  way  of  tackling  inappropriate  consumption  and  keeping alcohol consumption an enjoyable experience. The Group contributes to numerous responsible drinking programmes and campaigns worldwide to ensure alcohol consumption is done responsibly. Pernod Ricard has already expanded  its flagship program  'Responsible  Party' to three countries  outside  the  European  Union:  Australia,  Russia  and Azerbaijan. It often works with peers and external partners to promote moderate drinking, to prevent underage drinking, drink driving, drinking during pregnancy, and to reduce binge drinking.\n\nUnfortunately, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, many of our responsible drinking  initiatives  had  to  be  put  on  hold  or  postponed.  In  some instances, however, digital campaigns have been launched to promote responsible  drinking  and  healthy  lifestyles  in  time  of  the  pandemic. This was  notably  the  case  of  the  Responsible  Party  digital  campaign 'Sharing  Good  Vibes',  launched  in  April 2020.  Articulated  around  the concepts of healthy lifestyles, solidarity and convivialit\u00e9 ,  this campaign aims  at  encouraging  young  adults  to  lead  a  responsible  lifestyle, including  responsible  alcohol  consumption.  It  unveiled  a  series  of inspiring video interviews available on different channels (Facebook, Instagram,  Twitter  and  Linkedin).  Several  speakers  such  as Alexandre Ricard, CEO of Pernod Ricard, Kostis Giannidis, President of ESN, as well as partners from One Young World exchanged their views and perspectives on responsible drinking and healthy life. Other lifestyle influencers and ambassadors, such as the familiar face Alejandro Mazza, also joined to share  their thoughts  around  responsible  living. In 3 months, 2.5 million young adults were reached across 30 countries.\n\n| Policies         | Objectives   |\n|------------------|--------------|\n| 2030 S&R Roadmap | By 2030, each Pernod Ricard affiliate worldwide will have at least one responsible drinking  \u0097 program or campaign in partnership, at scale and evaluated.

IARD  works  with  the leading global beer, wine & spirits producers who have come together to be  part  of  the  solution  in  combatting  harmful  drinking.  IARD  engages with  the  public  sector,  civil  society  and  private  stakeholders,  and  is aligned with the WHO's goal to reduce the harmful use of alcohol by at least 10% by 2025.\n\nIARD's  work  is  informed  by  scientific  evidence  on  alcohol  and  health, as well as alcohol policy. Its tools and resources are intended to support all stakeholders in providing them with approaches that can be tailored to local needs and contexts.\n\nIARD  and  its  members  acknowledge  the  mandate  given  to  economic operators in the area of production and trade of alcoholic beverages by Heads  of  State  and  governments  in  the  UN  Political  Declaration  on Non-Communicable  Diseases  in  2018  to 'take concrete  steps, where relevant, towards eliminating the marketing, advertising and sale of alcoholic products to minors'.\n\nIn  January 2020,  IARD  announced  several  concrete  actions  to  tackle and  to  accelerate  reductions  in  underage  drinking.  This  undertaking includes the following actions:\n\n- introducing  a  clear  age-restriction  symbol  or  words  on  all  alcohol \u0097 products, including alcohol-free extensions of alcohol brands;\n- continue practice of not marketing alcohol-free extensions of alcohol \u0097 brand to minors;\n- pledging  to  implement  rigorous  online  safeguards  across  all  digital \u0097 platforms and reach 95% compliance by 2024;\n- developing  global  standards  for  the  online  sale  and  delivery  of \u0097 alcohol, where such sales are legal.\n\n## RESPONSIBLE MARKETING\n\n(see subsection 3.3.4.2)\n\n## CONSUMER INFORMATION\n\n(see subsection 3.3.4.3)\n\n## EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT\n\nEmployees  are  the  Group's  best  ambassadors.  Pernod  Ricard  thus enlists its employees worldwide with the common goal of reducing the harmful  use  of  alcohol  and  promoting  moderate  responsible  drinking, both internally and externally.\n\nPernod Ricard has developed an internal digital training on alcohol and responsible  drinking,  translated  into  21  languages  and  launched  in April 2020.  This  training,  compulsory  for  all  its  employees  worldwide, embeds the Group's new Global Responsible Drinking Charter ensuring that all employees understand their responsibilities and Pernod Ricard's expectations  of  them  as  ambassadors.  The  goal  is  to  train  100%  of Pernod  Ricard's  employees  by  2021.  As  of  1 July  2020,  40%  of  our employees had completed the training.\n\n## Action plans and next steps\n\n- strengthen  our  programs  and  campaigns  locally,  and  work  on  new \u0097 global programs;\n- amplify Responsible Party's program and digital campaign around the \u0097 world;\n- work  with  industry  peers  to  implement  IARD's  new  commitment  to \u0097 accelerate reductions in underage drinking by 2024;\n- develop a code to ensure that our brands will be sold responsibly on \u0097 e-commerce platforms.\n\n## Responsible marketing 3.3.4.2\n\n## Objectives and policies\n\nPernod  Ricard  believes  that  strong  self-regulation  is  effective  in meeting  the  ethical  expectations  of  consumers  and  stakeholders  in  a rapidly-changing  media  landscape  while  at  the  same  time  building brand equity. Going beyond the Advertising and Marketing Communications  Code  of  the  International  Chamber  of  Commerce, Pernod Ricard's Code for Commercial Communications (CCC) ensures that  the  Group's  commercial  communications  in  particular  do  not encourage or condone irresponsible consumption or misuse of any kind.\n\nPernod Ricard is also committed to being an industry leader in helping raise  the  standard  for  responsible  marketing  of  alcoholic  beverages. A special focus is put on digital marketing. In 2014, IARD partnered with social  media  platforms  to  establish  the  Digital  Guiding  Principles. The Group immediately extended the scope of its CCC to require that all  online  marketing  meet  the  same  high  standards  as  traditional marketing. In 2020, these partnerships were strengthened even further to keep raising standards.\n\nBy 2023, Pernod Ricard expects to have achieved 95% compliance with these principles.\n\n## RESPONSIBLE MARKETING PANEL (RMP)\n\nCreated  in  2005,  the  RMP  is  responsible  for  ethical  oversight  of advertising,  in  charge  of  screening  all  advertising  material  due  to  be rolled out. It has six members and a secretary general, all independent of  the  Marketing  Department,  and  reports  monthly  to  the  Executive Committee. Two members of the Executive Committee act as sponsors and are also consulted on any changes to the CCC or the drafting of implementing guidelines.\n\nAll  commercial  communications must be submitted to the RMP which issues  an  assessment  within  seven  days  maximum.  All  decisions  are taken collectively by RMP members and are binding for everyone in the Group.\n\nIn case of doubt about a campaign submitted for approval, the RMP has the  right  to  request  an  opinion  from  the  local  or  regional  advertising regulatory authorities in the relevant markets.\n\nThe Panel provides assessments on each campaign submitted:\n\n- campaign approved with no restrictions; \u0097\n- campaign approved subject to modifications; or \u0097\n- campaign rejected (in this case it must be re-submitted). \u0097\n\nIn  January 2020,  the  Group  updated  its  CCC,  strengthening  all guidelines  (including  a  provision  mandating  models  shall  be  over 25 years old), and launched a brand-new e-learning module. Completion of the e-learning is mandatory  for  marketing,  communications, legal, public affairs and S&R functions. To ensure maximum compliance to  the  Code,  external  versions  of  the  CCC  and  of  the  e-learning  were launched for the benefits of external agencies.\n\n## Action plans and next steps\n\nWith  the  implementation  of  the  Pernod  Ricard  CCC,  the  Group  will continue to deliver a Convivialit\u00e9 brand experience and responsibility in compliance  with  industry  commitments  and  advertising  authority requirements.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This MoU covers the voluntary communication  by  European  spirits  manufacturers  regarding  the ingredients and nutritional information of products for sale in the EU.\n\nThe purpose of the MoU is to ensure that the products marketed in the EU by those companies disclose the energy information on the labels and  provide  the  list  of  ingredients  and  other  nutritional  information online. The target was set at 66% of the volume of products marketed in the EU by 31 December 2022.\n\nPernod  Ricard  aims  to  exceed  the  target  set  by  the  MoU  and  has decided to progressively  implement  it  worldwide  to  all  products  in  its portfolio. This is assuming the communication of such information is not restricted by local laws or regulations.\n\n## Ethics & compliance 3.4\n\n## The Group's ethical practices 3.4.1\n\n## Data privacy 3.4.1.1\n\n## Objectives and policies\n\nData  privacy,  in  particular  with  the  entry  into  force  in  2018  of  the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other similar legislation around the world, is a critical issue for the Group. This issue has  significantly  affected  how  Pernod  Ricard,  in  the  context  of accelerated digitalisation, collects, stores, and manages personal data. It is  a  business  opportunity  for  Pernod  Ricard  to  ensure  the  accuracy and  relevance  of  its  personal  data,  to  develop  consumer  trust, secure brand image, and continue to promote its culture of conviviality. It is also  an  opportunity  to  rethink  and  optimise  existing  processes  by adopting best practices regarding personal data retention, management of access, etc. Pernod Ricard has developed governance, tools, procedures, and documentation evidencing compliance, policies, awareness materials in order to cover all major data privacy risks.\n\nPernod  Ricard  has  a  strong  strategy  and  data  privacy  governance  in place.  A  comprehensive  data  privacy  roadmap  was  drafted  ahead  of GDPR  enforcement  and  is  being  implemented  across  the  Group. The Group  DPO  (Data  Protection  Officer)  and  data  privacy  network enable  the  Group  to  implement  GDPR  compliance,  implementing policies  and  procedures  at  local  level  and  sharing  best  practices. This governance  structure  involves  a  wide  range  of  stakeholders, including the Group DPO, privacy champions at regional and local level, along with a Data Protection Steering Committee.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs a reminder, all affiliates with a distribution business incorporate the 'pregnant woman' warning logo on the labels of all bottles distributed in the  EU.  In  2006,  Pernod  Ricard  was  the  first  wine  &  spirits  group  to proactively  extend  throughout  Europe  the  application  of  the  logo warning  pregnant  women  to  avoid  alcohol  altogether  on  its  labels.  In 2013, Pernod Ricard gradually extended the application of this logo to all  bottles  distributed  by  Pernod Ricard  worldwide,  wherever  local country regulations so permitted.\n\n## Action plans and next steps\n\nBy  December 2020,  at  least  25%  of  the  volume  of  Pernod  Ricard's products marketed in the EU will carry the energy information on the label and will provide the ingredients and other nutritional information online. The target will be raised to at least 50% by December 2021, and no less than 66% by December 2022.\n\nTo implement the digital part of this commitment, Pernod Ricard works with  relevant  European  industry  bodies  and  stakeholders,  and  GS1 (international organisation specialised in information exchange standards), to make consumer information available online.\n\n## Examples of data privacy actions\n\n- Promotion of data privacy as an integral part of the Group's culture, \u0097 through global awareness campaigns (including videos and newsletters) and employee training (mandatory MOOC  and customised training sessions).\n- Comprehensive documentation to ensure consistent and \u0097 comprehensive  implementation  of  data  privacy  and  common standards  based  on  a  global  data  privacy  policy,  adapted  for  local requirements, along with detailed procedures and toolkits.\n- Implementation of privacy by design and by default on new projects \u0097 and specific privacy documentation on major projects (e.g. development  of  the  latest  version  of  the  consumer  database; development of an online consumer profile centre).",

It also provides  employees  and stakeholders  with  clear,  specific  examples  of  potentially  sensitive situations.\n- Internal  Control  Principles :  they  apply  to  all  Group  affiliates  and \u0097 specify  that  all  Pernod  Ricard  affiliates  must  comply,  among  other things,  with  the  Pernod  Ricard  Code  of  Business  Conduct  and  the Procurement  Code  of  Ethics.  Pernod  Ricard  sends  all  affiliates  a self-assessment  questionnaire  every  year,  in  which  they  must  state whether they are compliant with Group policies. The reliability of the responses  to  these  questionnaires  is  confirmed  in  a  letter  of representation  signed  by  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  Chief Financial  Officer  of  each  entity.  In  addition,  the  Legal  Department works  with  the  internal  audit  team  to  conduct  a  number  of compliance audits each year at certain affiliates. Finally, a further task of the internal audit is to verify the Group's compliance with the rules implemented for the fight against corruption.\n- Whistleblowing policy : employees are invited to speak up about any \u0097 potential  corruption  situation  in  relation  to  the  Pernod  Ricard activities  inside  or  outside  the  Company.  As  part  of  the  protection owed  to  whistleblowers,  alerts  may  be  filed  anonymously,  and  we promote a clear non-retaliation policy.\n- Due  Diligence  policy : our  Third  Parties  are  subject  to  a  due \u0097 diligence process  to  determine  their  compliance  risk  profile (low, medium or high) to adjust, as appropriate, our contractual and operational relationships to mitigate potential risks.\n- Gifts  and  Hospitality  policy :  pre-approval  required  from  the  Line \u0097 Manager of the employee prior to receiving or offering any gifts  or hospitality above a determined amount set at affiliate's level.\n\n## SPECIFIC, USER-FRIENDLY DEDICATED DIGITAL TOOLS TO SUPPORT COMPLIANCE EFFORT\n\n- 'Speak  Up' :  global  whistleblowing  hotline  accessible  to  all  third \u0097 parties  worldwide  (Internet  or  telephone),  24  hours  a  day,  7 days  a week,  ensuring  confidentiality  and  anonymity  (if  allowed  by  local legislation)  to  encourage  the  Pernod  Ricard  stakeholders  to  alert about any corruption matter.\n- 'Partner Up' : global web-based platform to allow any employee who \u0097 may  engage  the  Group  in  a  business  transaction,  to  conduct adequate due diligence on the third party.\n- 'Gifted!' :  our  app  to  declare  and  seek  approval  to  give  or  receive \u0097 gifts and hospitalities in accordance with the provisions of our Gifts & Hospitality  policies.  The  App  has  been  revisited  this  year  and  is accessible on all of our electronic devices.\n- MOOC (Massive Online Open Courses) :  e-learning  tool  providing \u0097 training for employees on the Code of Business Conduct. Still driven by  the  'learning  by  doing'  approach,  a  new  mandatory  MOOC  was kicked  off  this  year  to  train  employees  on  our  updated  Code  of Business Conduct. This new training was successfully completed in the allocated time period by 92% of the mandatory target population ( i.e. all employees with a company-issued electronic device) and it is now part of the onboarding pack for new employees.\n\n## Prevention of anti-competitive practices\n\nPernod Ricard is  committed to the public policy goals of Competition laws  and  to  acting  lawfully  in  the  marketplace.  Such  concern  is unambiguously  addressed  in  a  specific  chapter  of  the  Pernod  Ricard Code  of  Business  Conduct.  The  MOOC  also  includes  a  chapter  on Competition law.\n\n## Transparency and integrity of strategies 3.4.1.3 and influencing practices\n\n## POLICIES AND OBJECTIVES\n\n- Group  policy  on  lobbying  is  guided  by  professional  Codes  (ECPA  in \u0097 Europe, Association  pour  les  relations  avec  les  pouvoirs  publics in France,  etc.)  and  institutional  Codes  such  as  the  EU  Transparency Register (https://ec.europa.eu/transparency-register), with which Pernod Ricard complies.\n- In  France,  the  Group  is  registered  on  the  list  of  representatives  of interests established by the High Authority for Transparency in Public Life (https://www.hatvp.fr/fiche-organisation/?organisation=582041943#%23). It strictly  complies  with  the  High  Authority's  reporting  obligations regarding lobbying activities. Transparency International even recognised its detailed reporting practice in their presentation of committed firms.\n- The Group has been a member of Transparency International France \u0097 since 2013 and actively supports the promotion of transparency and integrity around lobbying and efforts made by this association. It is a signatory  to  a  best  practices  guide  on  parliamentary  lobbying expenditure.\n- Proactive signatory of a declaration made public on 25 February 2014 \u0097 initiated  together  with  seven  companies  who  are  members  of Transparency  International  France.  This  declaration  is  open  to  all companies, business federations, professional associations, trade unions and NGOs (members and non-members of Transparency France)  who  wish  to  show  leadership  through  their  ethics  and corporate social responsibility commitments.\n- This  joint  declaration  on  lobbying  was  reinforced  and  updated  in \u0097 May 2019,  including  new  signatories  who  reaffirm  their  commitments: https://transparency-france.org/actu/declaration-commune-entreprisesmembres-de-transparency -international-france-lobbying.\n\n## ACTION PLANS AND NEXT STEPS\n\n- Maintain its cooperation with Transparency International. \u0097\n- Systematically include a component on the ethics of lobbying in the \u0097 annual seminar for the global public affairs teams.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Pernod  Ricard's  total contribution is estimated at around \u20ac5.5 billion (unaudited data).\n\n## Approach to taxation\n\nThe Group applies the following principles in tax matters:\n\n- support  for  operational  activity  in  compliance  with  applicable \u0097 regulations;\n- integrity in the conduct of tax matters; \u0097\n- tax management that is both proactive and efficient to preserve and \u0097 maximise the value generated for the Group and its shareholders.\n\nPernod Ricard has several subsidiaries in some 73 countries in which it operates.  Whenever  possible,  management  makes  every  effort  to liquidate any dormant or quasi-dormant subsidiary inherited from past acquisitions.\n\nPernod Ricard is vigilant as to the operational and commercial reality of its transactions  and  refuses  to  take  part  in  any  artificial  tax arrangements. The Group will only use tax incentives after considering their impact on its brands, reputation and Sustainability & Responsibility. The Group does not promote any form of tax evasion.\n\n## Transfer pricing\n\nPernod Ricard's strategy and organisation are built on a decentralised model with an ongoing relationship between the Brand Companies and the  Market  Companies.  The  Brand  Companies  generally  own,  protect and  develop  the  intellectual  property.  They  are  also  in  charge  of developing the overall strategy for the brands as well as solutions and ways to activate them. The Market Companies implement this strategy at local level.\n\nRelated  party  transactions  are  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the Group's  transfer  pricing  policy,  which  is  based  on  the  arm's  length principle  ( i.e. on  terms  that  would  have  been  agreed  between independent parties).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## An efficient organisation\n\nPernod Ricard has a team of qualified and well-trained tax and customs specialists  working  under  the  supervision  of  the  EVP  Finance,  IT  and Operations. Clear internal control principles on tax matters have been defined and made available to all employees on the Intranet. Processes have been put in place to prevent risks of tax evasion.\n\nThe  tax  legislation  in  the  countries  where  Pernod  Ricard  operates  is complex and can be subject to interpretation. Pernod Ricard manages these  uncertainties  with  the  help  of  internal  and  external  tax  experts. Tax provisions are measured based on the Group's best estimate based on the information available (in particular that provided by the Group's legal and tax advisors) and presented regularly to the Audit Committee.\n\n## Promotion of international transparency\n\nPernod  Ricard  is  committed  to  being  open  and  transparent  with  tax authorities  and  to  disclosing  relevant  information  to  enable  them  to carry  out  their  work.  Pernod  Ricard  places  particular  importance  on working positively, proactively and transparently with the tax authorities of  the  countries  in  which  the  Group  operates in order to build honest and  sustainable  relationships  and  to  be  able  to  resolve  potential disputes quickly.\n\nPernod Ricard respects the obligations of country-by-country reporting.\n\nThe  Group  also  participates  in  the  development  of  corporate  tax policies, tax transparency initiatives and tax legislation by taking part in public consultations.\n\n## Presentation 3.4.2 and implementation of the Devoir de Vigilance\n\nThe  cross-reference  tables  below  summarise  the  presentation  of  the information constituting the Group's vigilance plan and its implementation  as  required  by  article L. 225-102-4  of  the  French Commercial Code.\n\nPernod  Ricard  has  embarked  on  a  plan  to  monitor  the  risks  associated with  the  Group's  business  activities  and  its  main  suppliers  and subcontractors  during  the  financial  year.  Several  working  groups comprising  representatives  from  the  Sustainability  &  Responsibility, Purchasing,  HR,  Internal  Audit,  Production  and  Legal  Departments  are involved in developing and implementing this plan.\n\nThe  Group  had  already  put  in  place  various  tools  and  procedures, while some  of  the  information  is  contained  elsewhere  in  Section 3, as well as in Section 4.",

The  Group's  Code  of  Business Conduct  advocates  a  'Speak-up  policy',  calling  on  all  employees  to inform management of any suspicions they may have. This may relate to a practice or situation deemed to be contrary to or inconsistent with this Code, associated policies  or  any  legal  or  regulatory  standard.  In  FY19, Pernod  Ricard  launched  a  Group-wide  early  warning  system  titled Speak-Up. This allows people who wish to warn the Group to do so in a\n\nsafe  and  confidential  manner.  Hosted  by  a  third  party,  it  is  available 24/7.  Any  report  deemed  to  be  serious  is  the  subject  of  an  internal analysis and investigation by an Integrity Committee. This is comprised of  the  following  Group-level  functions:  Legal,  Internal  Audit,  HR  and S&R. If  any  violations  are  identified,  the  Integrity  Committee  examines their severity and decides on the appropriate measures. Pernod Ricard ensures that no disciplinary action is taken against anyone reporting a violation in good faith.\n\n## Monitoring system for the measures implemented 3.4.2.5\n\nPernod  Ricard  has  monitoring  procedures  and  systems  in  place  for Human  Rights,  health  &  safety  and  the  environment.  The  aim  is  to ensure  that  the  monitoring  plan  is  properly  implemented  and continually updated:\n\n- internal reporting system  and  indicators  for monitoring the \u0097 implementation of the actions taken. The results have already been extensively published and audited with complete transparency in this report (see Sections 2, 3 and 4 in particular);\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- the S&R Senior Steering Committee oversees the implementation of \u0097 the S&R Strategy and the Company's progress towards targets set;\n- the  role  of  the  Nominations,  Governance  and  CSR  Committee  is  to \u0097 assess  the  relevance  of  the  Group's  S&R  commitments  and  to oversee their implementation.",

Unless otherwise stated, this data relates to activities under the Group's operational control.\n\n## Scope of social reporting\n\nThe social  analyses  in  this  report  are  based  on  all  Group  entities  that have  reported  data  on  their  employees  for  the  relevant  period. When the Group acquires a newly controlled entity, its corporate data is immediately included in full in the figures, regardless of the equity stake held  by  Pernod  Ricard.  At  the  end  of  each  financial  year,  the  list  of entities  in  the  Group's  social  reporting  is  compared  to  the  Financial Reporting  list  to  ensure  its  completeness.  In  FY20,  reporting  covered 141 entities.\n\nThe scope of consolidation and level of detail for corporate data have changed since FY19. Social data is no longer reported by affiliate but by legal entity. This explains the increase in the number of entities covered since then.\n\nThis year, the following updates have been made:\n\n- Chivas Brothers International Ltd has  been created under Chivas \u0097 Brand to focus on marketing activities;\n- Drinks  &  Co  Store  France created  for  the  store  opening  in  Paris, \u0097 France;\n- New acquisitions for digital marketplaces: DrinksAndCo \u0097 Marketplace SLU & Bodeboca, SL ;\n- Pernod  Ricard  Philippines, Inc . & Seagram  China are now \u0097 consolidated individually under Asia;\n- Pernod Ricard Helan Mountain is now reported under Asia HQ; \u0097\n- SIA  Pernod  Ricard  Eastern  Europe  Operations created  under \u0097 EMEA;\n- new acquisition in South Africa, Inverroche . \u0097\n\nThe Asia-Pacific Region includes the Asia distribution network and the Group's  Wines  business.  This  also  includes  Bodegas  Tarsus  and  the Pernod  Ricard  Winemakers  Spain  affiliate,  based  in  Spain,  and  the Pernod  Ricard  Winemakers  Kenwood  and  Pernod  Ricard  Winemakers Mumm Napa affiliates, based in the United States. A distinction is made between the Brand Companies and the Market Companies for Australia and New Zealand resulting in two entities for each country.\n\nPernod  Ricard's  African  activities  are  managed  by  Pernod  Ricard's Europe, Middle East, Africa and Latin America Region and the related data are therefore included in the data for this Region.\n\nThe social reporting indicators are selected to provide the Group with a reliable and accurate picture of its global footprint. The data collected enables Pernod Ricard to be increasingly socially responsible in respect of its employees worldwide.\n\n## Scope of societal reporting\n\nIndicators  relating  to  responsible  drinking  are  included  in  the  social report. The indicators cover all Pernod Ricard affiliates (Brand Companies and Market Companies) that are required to include their  societal  information  in  the  social  report,  with  the  exception  of certain entities. This is because the roll-out of the S&R strategy and the associated  action  plans  are  managed  by  a  sole  affiliate  when  several affiliates  are  in  the  same  country.  These  entities  do  not  have  to  send information to the Group's reporting system.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Scope of environmental reporting\n\nPernod Ricard's environmental reporting relates to production sites and vineyards  under  the  Group's  operational  control  on  30 June  in  the financial  year  in  question  and  that  were  operational  throughout  the year. It does not cover administrative sites (head offices or sales offices) or logistics warehouses when these are located outside industrial sites (this  only  relates  to  a  few  isolated  warehouses).  This  is  because  their environmental  impact  is  not  significant  compared  to  those  located within industrial sites.\n\nFY20 reporting covers:\n\n- 90  industrial  sites.  This  figure  is  higher  than  in  FY19  following  the \u0097 disposal  or  closure  of  two  production  sites  (Cubzac  in  France  and Daurala  in  India),  and  the  integration  of  three  production  sites (Weiden in  Germany,  Cowansville  and  Vineland  Station  in  Canada). The  industrial  scope  taken  into  account  for  this  financial  year therefore covers a production volume of 958 million litres (finished product either bottled or in bulk), compared  with 1,045 million in FY19, and a volume of distilled alcohol of 232 million litres in FY20 compared to 246 million litres in FY19. Commentary on the  results  can  be  found  in  the  various  parts  of  the  'Protect  the planet' subsection of this document;\n- 5,602 hectares of vineyards, in New Zealand, Australia, France, Spain, \u0097 the  United  States,  Argentina  and  China.  Key  results  related  to vineyards  can  be  found  in  the  'Sustainable  agriculture  and performance of our vineyards' subsection.\n\n## Clarification regarding indicators 3.6.1.2\n\n## Social indicators\n\nAverage headcount is calculated on a full-time equivalent basis, without taking into account long- and short-term absences.\n\nSince FY19, employees are included in the headcount of the legal entity with  which  they  have  an  employment  contract.  Expatriates  and seconded  employees  are  included  in  the  headcount  of  their  host affiliates.\n\nPernod  Ricard  China  employees  are  accounted  for  as  staff  on permanent contracts. Chinese employment contracts actually comprise a  statutory  duration and are only converted into permanent contracts after a number of years. However, given the specific characteristics of employment legislation in China, Pernod Ricard considers its employees to  be  permanent  staff.  Due  to  the  particular  characteristics  of  local labour laws, as of last year the same rule applies to Pernod Ricard Minsk employees,  as  the  concept  of  fixed-term  contract  does  not  exist  in Belarus.\n\nWork-study contracts (apprenticeship contracts and training contracts) are not counted as fixed-term contracts, and this also applies to work placement students, temporary workers and VIE programme volunteers.\n\nMaternity/paternity/parental  leaves  are  included  in  the  absenteeism rate.\n\nRegarding the Covid-19 crisis, the leave days resulting from governmental  restrictions  have  been  excluded  from  the  absenteeism reporting to keep coherence with previous absenteeism rates. However, in  some  countries,  sick  leaves  have  been  granted  to  allow  parents  to take  care  of  their  child  having  no  school  -  these  leaves  cannot  be differentiated from real sick leaves and have been included.\n\nThe absenteeism rate and workplace accident frequency and severity rates are calculated on the basis of the theoretical number of hours or days  worked  per  year.  Working  days  are  used  to  calculate  the absenteeism rate.  Calendar  days  are  used  for  the  workplace  accident frequency and severity rates.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nIn  line  with  the  Group  H&S  policy,  frequency/severity  rates  for workplace  accidents,  number  of  lost  time  and  number  of  fatalities integrate newly acquired companies only in their second full fiscal year - this year, DrinksAndCo Marketplace SLU, Bodeboca, SL & Inverroche have been excluded from these indicators.\n\nCommuting  accidents  are  no  longer  included  in  the  number  of accidents. They are thus not used to calculate frequency and severity rates.  Conversely, frequency and severity rates now take into account the  number of workplace accidents involving temporary staff (workers employed  by  a  staff  agency  for  a  temporary  period  and  directly supervised by Pernod Ricard).\n\nTraining  hours  completed  by  employees  are  recorded,  including  both face-to-face training and e-learning hours. Employees are only counted as having received training once, regardless of the number of training courses they have attended.\n\nHeadcount and FTE calculations consider employees leaving the group on  the  last  day  of  the  fiscal  year  as  active.  The  related  termination events are then included on the next fiscal to calculate departure rates & turnover.\n\nHowever,  due  to  the  change  of  tool  in  FY19,  the  terminations  that occurred  on  the  last  day  of  FY19  have  been  wrongly  included  in  the indicators of FY19 and cannot be included in FY20.\n\nDefinition  for  the  classification  'Top  Management'  has  been  reviewed and reclarified after the FY19 publication. This classification reflects the employees from COMEX to Band C job levels. Following this, the FY19 figures  on  diversity  have  been  amended  to  reflect  the  correct classification.\n\n## Environmental indicators\n\nThe  Group  footprint  on  agricultural  land  is  assessed  by  the  areas  on which purchased agricultural raw materials are used. These equivalent areas are estimated on the basis of the agricultural yields of the various materials  used  by  the  Group  (except  for  the  agave  footprint  which  is based on accurate land coverage). For transformed products, industrial yields  are  used  to  assess  the  quantities  of  agricultural  materials purchased.\n\nThe  environmental  performance  of  sites  is  expressed  using  various ratios.  These  are  based  on  the  business  category  in  which  the  Group has classified the sites:\n\n- distilleries: data broken down by volumes of pure distilled alcohol; \u0097\n- bottling  sites:  data  broken  down  by  volumes  of  bottled  finished \u0097 products;\n- wineries: data broken down by volumes made into wine; \u0097\n- vineyards: data broken down by surface area cultivated with vines. \u0097\n\nAt Group level, consolidated performance is expressed based either on:\n\n- the  amount  of  distilled  alcohol  for  environmental  impacts  primarily \u0097 due  to  distillation  (e.g.  water  or  energy  consumption),  expressed  in units per thousand litres of pure distilled alcohol (kl PA);\n- the bottled volume or the volume of finished products manufactured \u0097 (including products delivered in bulk) when bottling or production is the  main  source  of  impact  (such  as  in  the  case  of  solid  waste), expressed in units per thousand litres (kl);\n- the  number  of  hectares  occupied  by  vineyards  for  agricultural \u0097 properties, expressed in units per hectare (ha).\n\nFor industrial sites, this distinction is sometimes complex, as some sites have  several  activities.  As  such,  since  the  time  frames  involved  in bottling  may  sometimes  be  very  different  from  those  for  distilling (aged spirits:  whiskies,  cognac,  etc.),  these  figures  may  be  difficult  to interpret  from  year  to  year.  Both  calculation  methods  are  therefore presented  for  some  indicators.  Setting  overall  Group  quantitative targets for the quantity of water or energy consumed per unit produced, for example, becomes complex as the consolidation of targets depends on  the  business  mix  during  the  year  and  the  consolidated  indicator chosen. For that reason, the results expressed by the indicators should be  used  with  care  and  interpreted  over  the  long  term.  Where  a significant reporting error from previous periods is identified, historical data is only readjusted if the impact on Group performance is greater than 1%. This is to allow for a better interpretation of results and trends.\n\nFY19  POS  materials  carbon  emissions  data have  been  used  for  FY20 figures.\n\nDefinition for 'renewable  energy  consumption'  and  'renewable electricity consumption' have been reviewed after the FY19 publication in order to respect the RE100 requirements. Since FY20:\n\n- the  total  renewable  electricity  consumption  is  calculated  with  the \u0097 part  covered  by  green  or  renewable  energy  certificates  and  the amount of renewable electricity produced and used on site;\n- the total renewable energy consumption is calculated with the total \u0097 renewable  electricity  consumption  and  the  amount  of  other renewable energy used on site (biogass, biofuel, etc.).\n\nWater Risk  Assessment  is  realised  using  Aqueduct  Water  Risk  Atlas,  a tool  developed  by  the  World  Resources  Institute  (WRI).  The  Internal Water Risk Index (IWRI) is calculated based on the blended rating from three Aqueduct indicators:\n\n- overall Water Risk; \u0097\n- baseline Water Stress; \u0097\n- baseline Water Stress - 2025 projected using a 'Business as Usual' \u0097 scenario.\n\nThree  water  risk  levels  are  defined  as  a  result  of  'Internal  Water  Risk Index' analysis:\n\n- extremely high risk, sites with an IWRI higher than 4; \u0097\n- high risk, sites with an IWRI between 3 and 4; \u0097\n- medium risk, sites with an IWRI between 1 and 3; \u0097\n- low risk, sites with an IWRI lower than 1. \u0097\n\nAny sites from the two highest risk levels ( i.e. 3 or higher) are required to replenish  their  water  consumption  through  water  projects.  Dedicated co-packers only include bottling process activities with at least 90% of production volume associated to Pernod Ricard.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This includes specific definitions  of  each  indicator,  which  are  passed  on  to  all  Managers involved in collecting and consolidating data.\n\nPernod Ricard constantly seeks to improve the collection and analysis of its data. It accordingly updates its procedures and user guide each year in  line  with  the  Group's  evolving  needs.  Improvements  are  made  to ensure compliance with the requirements of the decree implementing article 225  on  the  transparency  obligations  of  companies  regarding social  and  environmental  matters  and  in  accordance  with  applicable national  or  international  frameworks.  The  updates  also  result  from contributions from affiliates when reporting data and auditor feedback. Any changes made since the previous year are highlighted.\n\nFor social indicators, a new tool has been created and used to gather and process the data since FY19.\n\nA consolidation tool has been used to gather and process the data for FY20,  from  local  entities.  For  social  indicators,  a  new  tool  has  been created and used to gather and process the data for FY20.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Methods for consolidating and checking data\n\nAfter being submitted by management,  data  is compiled at management entity level, then at Region or Brand level for submission to Headquarters. The data is processed and consolidated at each level. Each  entity  collecting  and  compiling  data  is  responsible  for  the indicators reported and certifies the data as well as the checks done.\n\nThis control is facilitated by automatic checks within the data entry tool in the consolidation documents sent to the Regions or Brands and in the consolidation  tool.  Amongst  other  things,  these  include  consistency checks against previous years and between the indicators themselves. For  social  indicators,  at  each  step  the  affiliates  can  explain  any variations versus the previous financial year - for 10% or more variations, a comment is required to facilitate the understanding and tracking.\n\nOnce  all  the  data  have  been  collected,  Headquarters  performs consistency checks to identify any reporting or input errors. When there are significant variations, the Group checks with the affiliates to ensure the data is valid. Finally, Headquarters consolidates these data.",

The  Statement  was  prepared  by  applying  the  company's procedures (hereinafter the 'Guidelines'), summarized in the Statement and available on request from its headquarters.\n\n## Independence and quality control\n\nOur  independence  is  defined  by  Article L. 822-11-3  of  the  French Commercial Code and the French Code of Ethics for Statutory Auditors ( Code de d\u00e9ontologie ).  In  addition,  we  have  implemented  a  system  of quality control including documented  policies and procedures regarding compliance with the ethical requirements, French professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.\n\n## Responsibility of the Statutory Auditor appointed as independent third party\n\nBased on our work, our responsibility is to express a limited assurance conclusion on:\n\n- the  compliance  of  the  Statement  with  Article R. 225-105  of  the \u0097 French Commercial Code;\n- the  fairness  of  the  information  provided  pursuant  to  part  3  of \u0097 sections I and II of Article R. 225-105 of the French Commercial Code, i.e. the  outcomes  of  policies,  including  key  performance  indicators, and measures relating to the main risks, hereinafter the 'Information.'\n\nHowever,  it  is  not  our  responsibility  to  provide  any  conclusion  on  the company's  compliance  with  other  applicable  legal  and  regulatory provisions, particularly with regard to the duty of vigilance, anti-corruption  and  taxation  nor  with  the  compliance  of  products  and services with the applicable regulations.\n\n## Nature and scope of procedures\n\nWe performed our work in accordance with Articles A. 225-1 et  seq. of the French Commercial Code defining the conditions under which the independent third party performs its engagement and the professional guidance  issued  by  the  French  Institute  of  Statutory  Auditors ( Compagnie nationale  des  commissaires  aux  comptes )  relating  to  this engagement and with ISAE 3000 ( Assurance engagements other than audits or reviews of historical financial information) .\n\nWe  conducted  procedures  in  order  to  assess  the  Statement's compliance  with  regulatory  provisions,  and  the  fairness  of  the Information:\n\n- We  familiarized  ourselves  with  the  Group's  business  activity, \u0097 including activities related to all companies within the consolidation scope  and  the  report  on  the  main  social  and  environmental  risks relating to this activity.\n- We  assessed  the  suitability  of  the  Guidelines  in  terms  of  their \u0097 relevance, completeness, reliability, neutrality and clarity, taking into account, where appropriate, best practices within the sector.\n- We verified that the Statement covers each category of information \u0097 stipulated  in  section III  of  Article L. 225-102-1  governing  social  and environmental  affairs,  the  respect  for  human  rights  and  the  fight against corruption and tax evasion.\n- We  verified  that,  when  relevant  to  the  main  risks  or  policies \u0097 presented,  the  Statement  presents  the  information  stipulated  in section II of Article R. 225-105 and  includes,  when  necessary, an explanation  justifying  the  absence  of  information  required  by paragraph 2 of section III of Article L. 225-102-1.\n- We verified that the Statement presents the business model and the \u0097 main  risks  relating  to  the  Group's  business  activity,  including, where relevant and proportionate, the risks generated by its business relations,  products  or  services  as  well  as  policies,  measures  and outcomes, including key performance indicators.\n- We consulted documentary sources and conducted interviews to: \u0097\n- assess the process of selecting and validating the main risks and \u0097 the  consistency  of  the  results  and  key  performance  indicators used with regard to the main risks and policies presented, and\n- corroborate the qualitative information (measures and outcomes) \u0097 that  in  our  judgment  were  of  most  significance  (see  Appendix), through  work  conducted  at  consolidating  entity  level,  and  for others with a selection of entities.\n- We verified that the Statement covers the consolidated scope, i.e. all \u0097 companies  within  the  consolidation  scope  in  accordance  with Article L. 233-16, with the limits specified in the Statement.\n- We  inquired  as  to  the  existence  of  internal  control  and  risk \u0097 management procedures set  up  by  the  company  and  we  assessed the  collection  process  set  up  by  the  entity  to  ensure  the completeness and fairness of the Information.\n\n<!-- image -->",

As with all control systems, they cannot provide an absolute guarantee that such risks have been fully eliminated.\n\n## Description of the internal 4.1.2 control environment\n\n## Components of the internal control 4.1.2.1 system\n\nThe principal bodies responsible for internal control are as follows:\n\n## At Group level\n\n- The Executive  Board is  the  permanent  coordination  body  for  the \u0097 management of the Group.\n- The Executive Committee ensures that the Group's operations are \u0097 carried out and that its main policies are applied.\n- The Internal Audit Department works under the Group Chief Executive \u0097 Officer  and  reports  to  the  Executive  Board  and  the  Audit  Committee. The internal  audit  team  based  at  Headquarters  is  in  charge  of implementing the audit plan, with the support of the audit teams in the Regions.  The  audit  plan  is  drawn  up  once  the  Group's  main  risks  have been identified and analysed. It is validated by the Executive Board and the Audit Committee and presents various cross-disciplinary issues that will be reviewed during the year, the list of affiliates that will be audited, and the main topics to be covered during the audits.\n\nThe  conclusions  are  then  submitted  to  the  Audit  Committee, Executive Board and Statutory Auditors for examination and analysis.\n\n- External Auditors . The  Board  of  Directors  selects  the  Statutory \u0097 Auditors to be proposed at the Shareholders' Meeting on the basis of recommendations from the Audit Committee.\n\nThe  Group  has  selected  Statutory  Auditors  who  are  able  to  provide comprehensive worldwide coverage of Group risks.\n\n## At affiliate level\n\n- The Management Committee is  appointed by Headquarters or the \u0097 relevant Region and is composed of the affiliate's Chairman & CEO and the Directors of its main functions. The Management Committee is  responsible  for  managing  the  main  risks  that  could  affect  the affiliate.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- The  affiliate's Chief  Financial  Officer is  tasked  by  the  Managing \u0097 Director of the affiliate with establishing appropriate internal control systems  for  the  prevention  and  control  of  risks  arising  from  the affiliate's  operations,  in  particular,  accounting  and  finance  risks, including error or fraud.\n\n## Identification and management of risks 4.1.2.2\n\nFY20 focused on:\n\n- updating  the  Group's  internal  control  principles,  a  process  that \u0097 involved various Group affiliates and functions;\n- strengthening  internal  control  within  the  Group,  using  various \u0097 approaches, including the continued development of data analytics to strengthen auditing methods;\n- implementing the self-assessment questionnaire on internal control \u0097 and risk management. This questionnaire, which was updated during the  financial  year,  complies  with  the  french  Financial  Market Authority  (AMF)  reference  framework  for  risk  management  and internal  control,  as  does  its  application  guide,  itself  updated  in July 2010; and\n- performing  audits:  24 internal  audits  were  conducted  in  FY20. \u0097 The purpose of these audits was to ensure that the Group's internal control principles were properly applied in its affiliates. Furthermore, they made it possible to review the processes in place, best practices and  potential  areas  for  improvement  in  various  cross-functional spheres  (personal  safety,  review  of  strategy  consulting  purchasing processes, payment security and control of free products).\n\nAll of the key areas for improvement identified were addressed in specific action plans drawn up at every affiliate and at Group level, which were validated by the Executive Board and the Audit Committee. Their implementation is regularly monitored and assessed by the Group's Internal Audit Department.\n\nThe  work  performed  enabled  the  quality  of  internal  control  and  risk management to improve within the Group.\n\n## Key components of internal control 4.1.2.3 procedures\n\nThe key components of internal control procedures are as follows:\n\nA formal delegation of authority procedure sets out the powers of the Chairman & CEO, as well as the powers delegated to members of the Executive Board.\n\nThe internal  control  principles outline  the  common  ground  of  all principles  and  rules  that  apply  to  all  of  the  Group's  affiliates  with respect  to  internal  control  for  each  of  the  14  main  operational  cycles identified.\n\nThe self-assessment questionnaire ,  which  is  regularly  updated  to comply  with  the  AMF  reference  framework  for  risk  management  and internal control. In particular, it covers corporate governance practices, operational activities and IT support. Submitted to the Group's affiliates, it  enables  them  to  assess  the  adequacy  and  effectiveness  of  their internal controls. Responses to the questionnaires are documented and reviewed  by  the  Regions  and  the  Group's  Internal  Audit  Department. This work is detailed in:\n\n- a summary by affiliate and an overall Group summary, both of which \u0097 are provided to the Executive Board and the Audit Committee; and\n- a letter of representation from every affiliate to the Chairman & CEO \u0097 of its parent company and a letter of representation from the various parent  companies  to  the  Chairman  &  CEO  of  Pernod  Ricard. This letter is binding on the affiliates' management with regard to the adequacy of their control procedures in light of identified risks.",

It defines the standards, tasks, responsibilities  and  organisation  of  the  Group's  Internal  Audit Department and the way in which it operates, in order to remind every employee to strive for compliance with and improvement of the internal control process.\n\nThe Pernod Ricard Quality, Safety and Environment Standards set out  the  rules  to  be  followed  in  these  areas.  The  Group's  Operations Department is responsible for ensuring that they are followed.\n\nBudget control focuses  on  three  key  areas:  the  annual  budget (reforecast  several  times  during  the  year),  monthly  performance reporting  and  the  strategic  plan.  Budgetary  control  is  exercised  by management  control  teams  attached  to  the  Finance  Departments  at Headquarters, in Regions and in affiliates. It operates as follows:\n\n- the  budget  is  subject  to  specific  instructions  (principles  and \u0097 timetable)  published  by  Headquarters  and  sent  to  all  affiliates. The final budget is approved by the Group's Executive Board;\n- reporting is prepared on the basis of data input directly by affiliates \u0097 working to a specific timetable provided at the beginning of the year and  in  accordance  with  the  reporting  manual  and  the  accounting principles published by Headquarters;\n- a multi-year strategic plan is established for the Group's main brands \u0097 every three years; and\n- a single management and consolidation system allows each affiliate \u0097 to directly input all its accounting and financial data.\n\nCentralised treasury management is  led  by  the  Treasury  Unit  of  the Group's Finance Department.\n\n## Headquarters' legal and operational 4.1.2.4 control over affiliates\n\nAffiliates are  mostly  wholly  owned,  either  directly  or  indirectly, by Pernod Ricard.\n\nPernod  Ricard  is  represented  directly  or  indirectly  (through  an intermediate affiliate) on its affiliates' Boards of Directors.\n\nThe  Group's  internal  control  principles  lay  down  the  various  internal control rules applicable to all affiliates.\n\nThe role assigned to Pernod Ricard, as described in the subsection on 'Decentralised  organisation'  in  Section 1  'Presentation  of  Pernod Ricard'  of  this  universal  registration  document,  is  an  important component of the control of affiliates.\n\n- monthly performance analysis is carried out as part of the reporting \u0097 process  and  is  presented  by  the  Finance  Department  to  the Executive  Board,  the  Executive  Committee  and  at  Meetings  of  the Audit Committee and Board of Directors;\n\n<!-- image -->",

Within each category, the most important risk factors are presented first.\n\n## Impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on Pernod Ricard's 4.2.1 key risk factors and outlook\n\nMany  of  the  risks  mapped  have  materialised  in  one  way  or  another (personal safety, legal restrictions on the sale of alcohol, financial risks) or  have required heightened vigilance (cyberattack, supply disruption) in  the  context  of  the  Covid-19  pandemic.  Main  impact  of  the  sanitary crisis resulted in a sharp decline in Group sales linked to the lockdown, notably with widespread closures in the hospitality sector and a strong decline in the travel retail business.\n\nIn the short term, this required a series of measures to:\n\n- protect  the  health  and  safety  of  employees  by  rigorously  applying \u0097 the  recommendations  of  local  authorities  and  the  World  Health Organization  (partial  shutdown  of  operations,  widespread  working from home for staff, rotation of teams, etc.);\n- ensure  the  continuity  of  our  industrial,  commercial  and  logistical \u0097 operations; and\n- adapt  the  management  of  our  business  and  secure  financing \u0097 (extensive  cost  reduction  programme,  \u20ac2 billion  bond  issue  in April 2020).\n\nIn  the  longer  term,  the  general  challenges  identified  before  the pandemic  remain  as  important  as  ever  to  maintain  the  resilience  of Pernod  Ricard's  business  model.  These  include  adapting  to  new consumer trends, embracing digital technology and ensuring the agile management of distribution channels.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  competitive environment can on occasion also lead Pernod Ricard to organise more  aggressive  or  more  frequent  promotions.  In  addition, e-commerce is putting pressure on traditional retailers.\n\nThe  Group  also  faces  heightened  competition  from  both  major international  players  on  its  strategic  brands  and  local  groups  or producers on its  local  brands,  driven  by  the  increasing  success  of craft products, as is the case with vodka in the United States.\n\nThe  fierce  competition  in  mature  markets  and  the  increasingly competitive nature of emerging markets could require the Group to boost  its  advertising  and  promotional  investments,  or  even  to reduce  or  freeze  prices  in  order  to  protect  market  share,  thereby weighing on  results.\n\n## RISK CONTROL AND MITIGATION\n\nTo mitigate risk, Pernod Ricard is committed to maintaining A&P investment at approximately 16% of sales to reinforce brand equity and, in turn,  the  ability  to  increase  prices.  Further,  Pernod  Ricard  launched  a  global  Revenue  Growth  project  in  2017,  including  rolling  out  a sophisticated promotional effectiveness tool and dedicated pricing management resources at market and HQ levels.\n\n## Geopolitical and macroeconomic instability 2.\n\n## RISK IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION\n\n## POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON THE GROUP\n\nThe  Covid-19  pandemic  has  significantly  increased  the  risk  of another global macroeconomic crisis and fuelled social tensions in different parts of the world.\n\nIn addition, a growing protectionist movement has been observed in recent  years  with  the  United  Kingdom's  exit  from  the  European Union and the trade war between the United States and China and the European Union.\n\nThese economic crises and social tensions could negatively impact consumer spending power and consumption patterns. Ultimately, this  instability  could  result  in  difficulties  for  the  Group  in distributing  its  products  in  the  markets  concerned,  negatively impacting  its  sales  or  margins,  as  has  been  observed  in  Travel Retail  during  the  Covid-19  pandemic.  Indeed,  the  decline  in  the number of passengers at airports in Asia from February, and then worldwide  from  March,  due  to  travel  restrictions  and  border closures,  affected  the  Group's  Travel  Retail  net  sales,  which declined by 27% over FY20.\n\n## RISK CONTROL AND MITIGATION\n\nThe Group's best protection is the diversification of its business both by geography and category. The Group is present today in 73 countries and  has  leading  brands  in  all  major  international  spirit  categories.  Pernod  Ricard  is  continuing  to  actively  develop  new  channels (e.g. e-commerce and hometainment) and new consumer occasions, such as the low/no alcohol trend and opportunities linked to female consumption.\n\nAccordingly,  the  Group  regularly  reassesses  its  routes-to-market  and  local  partners.  In  addition,  Pernod  Ricard  has  implemented  crisis management plans in all affiliates.  Similarly,  in  certain  cases,  the  Group  may  increase  prices  in  order  to  mitigate  the  impact  on  margins. Finally, under certain circumstances, production and logistics infrastructures can be adapted.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPotential impacts include:\n\n- the  increased  negotiating  power  of  Pernod  Ricard's  customers \u0097 leading to margin erosion and/or loss of market share;\n- pressure on Pernod Ricard to align prices across markets within \u0097 a region;\n- temporary delisting and/or loss of promotional support; and \u0097\n- cheaper prices eroding brand image. \u0097",

        "page_content": "## Negative media/social media campaign 3.\n\n## RISK IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION\n\n## POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON THE GROUP\n\nMedia/social media attacks represent a major threat for the Group. Through  the  increasing  number  and  growing  influence  of  social media  networks,  the  Group  faces  the  risk  of  being  exposed  to significant media  coverage  of  inappropriate  publications  or messages.\n\nA malicious attack intending to damage the Group's reputation or a genuine incident in relation to Pernod Ricard brands could have a  significant  impact  on  the  Group's  image  and  reputation. Further widespread  negative  media  coverage  could  jeopardise consumers'  confidence  in  Pernod  Ricard  brands,  resulting  in  a potential sales decline.\n\n## RISK CONTROL AND MITIGATION\n\nThe Group's risk is managed through a series of internal and external measures. While internal measures primarily focus on raising employee awareness of the impact of social media and sharing best practices in terms of communication, external measures are used to monitor social media and promote the Group's S&R activities.\n\n## Cyberattack 4.\n\n## RISK IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION\n\n## POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON THE GROUP\n\nThe  Group's  digital  transformation  has  brought  with  it  greater exposure  to  risks  stemming  from  cyberattacks,  as  well  as  those related to IT and telecommunications system failures. These systems  are  of  inestimable  importance  in  the  Group's day-to-day processing, transmission and storage of electronic data relating to both operations and financial statements, and communication between Pernod Ricard's personnel, customers and suppliers.\n\nStronger  personal  data  protection  regulations,  including  the General  Data  Protection  Regulation,  increase  the  risks  associated with regulatory non-compliance.\n\nPotential impacts of a cyberattack and its effects depend on the nature of the attack, but could include:\n\n- leakage,  loss,  theft  of  personal,  strategic  or  confidential  data, \u0097 and the resulting chain of potential repercussions;\n- system failure; and \u0097\n- incapacity to perform day-to-day operations. \u0097\n\nAlthough  the  Group  invests  a  significant  amount  in  maintaining and  safeguarding  its  IT  systems,  particularly  in  view  of  growing threats  in  terms  of  cybercriminality,  any  malfunctions,  significant disruption,  loss  or  disclosure  of  sensitive  data  could  disrupt  the normal  course  of  business,  and  have  financial,  operational  or reputational consequences.\n\n## RISK CONTROL AND MITIGATION\n\nPernod Ricard has drawn up a cybersecurity roadmap based on the establishment of dedicated governance and resources.\n\nIt  also  has  cyber  insurance  providing  coverage  of  \u20ac20 million,  and  strives  to  strengthen  the  security  of  its  infrastructure,  websites  and networks. Infrastructure monitoring and management is performed constantly. IT and security audits are performed to assess whether the level of security is adequate; they give the Group a good overview of the reliability of its IT systems. In addition, awareness-raising campaigns are  conducted.  Lastly,  tests  are  carried  out  on  the  recovery  of  the  Group's  IT  systems  following  a  hypothetical  cyberattack,  and  a  plan designed to facilitate the recovery of data as efficiently as possible has been drawn up.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

There is global monitoring of the innovation portfolio and innovation roadmap in terms of services and experiences;\n- the  Group  continues  to  accelerate  its  digital  transformation.  The  Group's  HQ  Digital  Marketing  and  e-commerce  teams  have  been \u0097 established,  including  teams  dedicated  to  monitoring  trends  and  the  Group's  performance  in  these  areas,  issuing  guidelines,  sharing expertise and services, and coordinating subsidiaries. Pernod Ricard has also invested in an e-commerce platform (Drinks&Co, formerly Uvinum).  Moreover,  new  human  resources  and  financial  performance  management  systems  (in  progress)  have  been  adopted  and appropriate training has been put in place. Finally, the main contributions of new digital technologies, Artificial Intelligence and Big Data have been identified, enabling the launch of six Key Digital Programs that will be implemented over a three-year period to allow a better presence of the Group's growing portfolio in an increasing number of communication and distribution channels around the world; and\n- keen  attention  is  paid  to  monitoring  strategic,  local  and  trade  inventory  levels,  with  a  particular  focus  on  ageing  spirits  given  the \u0097 investment involved (FY20: approximately \u20ac5 billion on the balance sheet). The latter includes regular meetings involving the Chairman & CEO, EVP Finance, IT & Operations and Brand Companies to define appropriate long-term forecasts and investments.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPotential  impacts  associated  with  this  risk  include  loss  of  market share  or  missed  growth  opportunities  linked  to  Pernod  Ricard's inability to properly satisfy customer/consumer demand, negative impact  on  brand  equity  and/or  on  its  reputation  and  potential surplus  inventory  or  missed  sales  resulting  from  out-of-stock situations.",

        "page_content": "## Product quality issues (1) 6.\n\n## RISK IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION\n\n## POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON THE GROUP\n\nThe main product quality issues encountered within the Group arise from the level of quality and compliance of the:\n\n- ingredients; \u0097\n- packaging; \u0097\n- production process; and \u0097\n- development process of our new products. \u0097\n\n## RISK CONTROL AND MITIGATION\n\nQuality risk management is based on a joint quality management approach implemented worldwide in all production affiliates. Coordinated by the Group's Operations Department, this risk management policy is based on internal Pernod Ricard standards and on systematic risk analysis.\n\nIt draws on the standards setting out best practices and minimum requirements in each of the areas concerned by quality:\n\n- foreign bodies (e.g. glass particles); \u0097\n- contamination; \u0097\n- traceability; \u0097\n- quality control; and \u0097\n- product recall. \u0097\n\nIt  is  also  backed  up  by  an  ambitious  quality  certification  process  for  Group  production  sites  based  on  the  following  two  international standards:\n\n- ISO 9001 for quality management; and \u0097\n- ISO 22000 for food safety management. \u0097\n\nAt the end of June 2020, 79% of bottling sites were ISO 9001 and ISO 22000 certified, covering 99.8% of total bottled production.\n\n## Supply disruption 7.\n\n## RISK IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION\n\n## POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON THE GROUP\n\nSome raw materials that the Group uses for the manufacture of its products  are  commodities  subject  to  price  volatility  caused  by changes  in  global  supply  and  demand,  weather  conditions, agricultural uncertainty and governmental controls.\n\nThe industry has also witnessed a trend towards the consolidation of  raw  material  and  packaging  suppliers.  Today,  many  of  our affiliates  work  with  the  same  suppliers,  which  creates  risk-charged interdependence should one of them fail (e.g. in the event of a major accident at one of their production sites).\n\nAn  unexpected  rise  in  the  cost  of  raw  materials  or  packaging materials could significantly increase the Group's operating costs. As it is not certain that this increase can be offset by higher prices, the Group's results could be affected.\n\nAnother  impact  could  stem  from  a  break  in  the  supply  chain  of certain raw materials or packaging, halting the production of some of our products.\n\n## RISK CONTROL AND MITIGATION\n\nControlling the risk of a break in the supply chain is part of the Group's purchasing policy, with the aim of selecting quality suppliers applying responsible practices in their ethical, environmental and social commitments, via the 'Blue Source' process.\n\nThe Group also recommends that its affiliates systematically identify alternative sourcing possibilities to cover cases of single sourcing risk. This is a critical scenario taken into account in the business continuity plans of our Strategic Brands.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe  success  of  the  Group's  brands  depends  upon  the  positive image that consumers have of those brands.\n\nA quality issue with one of our products affecting the integrity of its  brand  or  its  image  among  consumers  could  have  a  negative impact on the Group's sales.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Talent management (1) 8.\n\n## RISK IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION\n\n## POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON THE GROUP\n\nPernod  Ricard's  success  depends  on  the  commitment  of  its employees  and  its  ability  to  attract  and  retain  them  as  well  as develop  their  skills, particularly in highly-competitive  labour markets,  such  as  Asia,  Africa  and  Eastern  Europe,  where  turnover rates are higher than in the rest of the world. This competitive talent market  is  heightened  by  the  search  for  scarce  skills  (e.g. digital) and by  changes  in  the  aspirations  of  new  generations.  Moreover, employee development through geographic mobility is a key issue (diversity  of  career  paths,  management  of  the  partner's  career, cost control, etc.).\n\nThe Group is aware that talent management must remain an area of long-term vigilance to ensure the sustainability of the business and  ensure  the  transmission  of  key  know-how  within  the organisation.  Excessively  high  turnover  or  unduly  long  job vacancies  could  have  a  financial  impact  and  demotivate  teams. This  could  potentially  slow  the  implementation  of  key  Group development projects and have an adverse impact on its business, results or reputation.\n\n## RISK CONTROL AND MITIGATION\n\nTo mitigate risk,  the  Group  has  established  an  ambitious  skills  development  policy  facilitating  dynamic  career  management.  Accordingly, shared processes and tools have been developed to allow all affiliates to optimise the assessment of skills and performance, to formalise the detection of potential, to encourage internal mobility and to monitor employee satisfaction. Moreover, Pernod Ricard University trains the Group's future leaders through leadership development courses. Lastly, measures are carried out regularly to improve quality of life at work. They  include  the  facilitation  of  telework,  measures  related  to  well-being  at  work,  the  modernisation  of  workspaces  and  managerial awareness-raising programmes.\n\n## Fraud 9.\n\n## RISK IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION\n\n## POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON THE GROUP\n\nPernod  Ricard  is  exposed  to  the  risks  of  fraud,  notably  due  to  its presence  in  a  wide  range  of  countries  as  well  as  its  accelerating digitalisation, and to constantly evolving threats.\n\nFrom theft to cybercriminality, any type of occurrence could lead to financial losses (including legal costs to recover defrauded sums and  products),  leakage  of  sensitive  information  or  theft  of  major physical  assets.  It  could  also  have  a  significant  impact  on  the Group's reputation.\n\n## RISK CONTROL AND MITIGATION\n\nTo  mitigate  risk,  the  Group  has  implemented  training  measures  (e.g.  the  MOOC  on  internal  control)  to  raise  fraud  awareness  among Pernod Ricard employees. In addition, a strong internal control framework - relying on the Group internal control principles and related tools - has been set up across the Group to limit the risk of occurrence. Further, the Group conducts internal and external audits each year to ensure the effectiveness of measures in place.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

In Europe, the Group's four largest distilleries are subject to the European Union carbon emission trading system (EU-ETS). The direct financial challenge is moderate  for Pernod Ricard but can be expected to increase significantly in the years to come. The economic impact of regulations on energy and carbon is also felt through indirect consumption via our suppliers (especially with respect to glass, alcohol and transport).\n\n## RISK CONTROL AND MITIGATION\n\nFor grapes, the relevant inter-professional organisations, such as those for cognac and champagne and the corresponding organisations for wine in  Australia  and  New  Zealand,  have  incorporated  this  issue  into  their  research  programmes  in  order  to  adapt  their  practices  to  the changes (choice of grape varieties, vine training, vinification, etc.).\n\nThe availability and quality of water at the Group's production sites are therefore key factors for ensuring the quality of its products and are monitored very closely. Responsible water management is a significant component of the Group's environmental policy: each site has to ensure that the use of groundwater or river water and the release of wastewater back into the environment do not harm nature. Sites located in areas identified as high risk in terms of water supply are subject to enhanced monitoring so as to ensure the sustainability of resources used by minimising water consumption and recharging the equivalent volume of water in the catchment area.\n\nAs  for  the  financial  impact  related  to  CO2  emissions  generated  directly  by  our  activities  or  indirectly  by  our  suppliers,  the  Group  is implementing a CO2 emission reduction plan aligned with a scenario of less than 2\u00b0C.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Loss of major site/strategic inventory 2.\n\n## RISK IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION\n\n## POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON THE GROUP\n\nToday, the main identified causes that could result in the loss of a major industrial site or strategic inventory are:\n\n- a fire and/or explosion related to the manufacture and handling of \u0097 our flammable products (e.g. alcohol);\n- a natural catastrophe such as an earthquake, hurricane or flood; \u0097 and\n- a malicious act. \u0097\n\nSeveral  Group  sites  are  located  in  seismic  zones,  particularly  in New Zealand, Armenia, California and Mexico.\n\nCertain sites, including the San Jos\u00e9 plant in Cuba, are exposed to risk of cyclones.\n\nLastly, the Group has significant stock of ageing products, such as Scotch whisky, Irish whiskey, cognac, rum, brandy and wines, which are highly flammable.\n\n## RISK CONTROL AND MITIGATION\n\nTo  manage  this  risk,  an  Operations  Risk  Manager  reporting  to  the  Operations  Department  is  responsible  for  coordinating  the  actions  of affiliates  in  the  implementation  of  preventive  measures  (design  and  maintenance  of  facilities,  training,  operating  procedures,  etc.) and physical protection mechanisms (automatic extinguishing, retention basins, emergency procedures, etc.).\n\nIn  cooperation  with  the  insurer,  more  than  40  industrial  sites  are  reviewed  each  year,  resulting  in  an  appraisal  of  the  quality  of  risk, and as such, recommendations for improvement for each.\n\nIn addition, a Group monitoring programme for business continuity and management systems is in place. Strategic affiliates have identified the  various  scenarios  that  could  affect  their  operations  and  have  drawn  up  business  continuity  plans  including  the  implementation of emergency solutions and access to alternative means of production in the event of the loss of a site.\n\n## Toxic contamination (1) 3.\n\n## RISK IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION\n\n## POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON THE GROUP\n\nThe  Group  purchases  most  raw  materials  (grapes,  cereals,  agave, etc.)  used  in  the  manufacture  of  its  wines  &  spirits  from  farmers  or industrial producers (alcohol, sugar, flavourings, etc.). The presence of undesirable substances in these raw materials or a defect in the distillation,  fermentation  or  bottling  process  could  result  in  the presence  of  chemical  (contaminant),  biological  (microorganism), physical (foreign body) or allergen contamination.\n\nThe Group's reputation and image may at any time be undermined by one-off incidents at an industrial facility or relating to a specific product. For example, contamination, whether arising accidentally, or through an act of malice, could cause injury or intoxication to a consumer,  thereby  exposing  the  Group  to  litigation  and  causing business and/or reputational harm to brands.\n\n## RISK CONTROL AND MITIGATION\n\nThe Group has implemented protection and control systems to limit the risk of contamination. The control of this risk is based both on the application of the HACCP method, which aims to identify the risks involved in the manufacturing process and to bring them under control, as well as on the implementation of specific internal guidelines. This approach is also accompanied by the implementation of management systems compliant with the ISO 22000 standard for food safety management, which is aimed specifically at controlling such risk.\n\nThe Group conducts a programme of in-depth analyses covering all contaminants deemed possible. In 2019 and 2020, it focused on all Strategic International Brands and the biggest Strategic Local Brands.\n\nActive monitoring is also implemented in order to monitor changes that may lead to new risks, particularly those relating to components present in packaging, raw materials and water, that are liable to pose a risk to consumer health.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe loss of a major industrial site or strategic inventory is considered a major risk for Pernod Ricard. The materialisation of this risk could result  in  a  significant  operating  loss  and  as  such  a  sharp  drop  or prolonged interruption in the supply of certain products, thereby preventing the Group from meeting consumer demand.\n\n<!-- image -->",

They may result in an accident or a so-called 'occupational' illness.\n\n- A  non-exhaustive  list  of  occupational  risks  Pernod  Ricard  is committed to preventing is as follows:\n- risks relating to noise and vibrations; \u0097\n- electrical risk; \u0097\n- fire and explosion risk; \u0097\n- road risk; \u0097\n- risks  relating  to  the  use  of  certain  machines  or  work  equipment; \u0097 and\n- psychosocial risks. \u0097\n\nIn  addition,  teamwork,  whether  in  the  factory  or  in  the  offices, figures  prominently  in  all  the  Group's  subsidiaries.  The  Covid-19 pandemic  and  the  risk  of  transmission  may  therefore  exist  -  as  in other areas of life - in the Group's facilities.\n\n## RISK CONTROL AND MITIGATION\n\nThe Group has therefore embarked on a process to reduce workplace accidents by launching a comprehensive inventory of industrial sites with the greatest potential for improvement at the end of 2017. The main sites are now assessed by an external company in accordance with specific criteria in terms of both the safety culture and the ISO 45001 \"Occupational Health and Safety\" management system.\n\nBuilding on this overview and the commitment of senior management, the Group has signalled its goal of becoming leader in 2025 in the wine & spirits sector in terms of Health and Safety. This goal is embodied in a programme known as 'Taking care of each other', built on the following three strategic pillars:\n\n- develop a culture where safety is central to the Group's values of conviviality; \u0097\n- engage, motivate and empower all employees and subcontractors on the issue of safety; and \u0097\n- improve our operational efficiency through excellence in Health and Safety. \u0097\n\nThis programme is part of the Group's S&R strategy and has gradually been extended to all affiliates.\n\nFinally,  the  protection  of  the  Health  and  Safety  of  its  employees  lies  at  the  heart  of  the  Group's  decisions  by  rigorously  applying  the recommendations of local authorities and those of the World Health Organization.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPersonal injury is one of the main potential impacts for the Group. Reputational  impact  related  to  inadequate  management  of working conditions must also be considered.\n\nThe most serious impacts are:\n\n- the  death  of  employees,  subcontractors,  visitors  or  other  third \u0097 parties;\n- permanent  disability  of  employees,  subcontractors,  visitors  or \u0097 other third parties; and\n- occupational illness. \u0097\n\nReputational  impact  related  to  inadequate  management  of working conditions must also be taken into account.\n\nThe active and widespread circulation of a virus such as Covid-19 could lead to repeated absences due to illness, the implementation  of  home  working  measures  or  the  temporary stoppage  of  certain  sites  leading  to  productivity  losses  for  the Group.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Business ethics (1)\n\n## RISK IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION\n\n## POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON THE GROUP\n\nPernod Ricard  is  a  decentralised  company  present  in  73 countries where anti-bribery laws apply with potential extraterritorial effect.\n\nExamples  include  the  US  Foreign  Corrupt  Practices  Act,  the  UK Bribery Act or France's Sapin II law. In particular, recent regulations concerning  the  fight  against  corruption  and  the  promotion  of business ethics expose Pernod Ricard to sanctions and reputational risk should it fail to comply. In this context, Pernod Ricard is required to  consider and strongly monitor the risk of corruption around the world.\n\nCompany  employees  interact,  even  to  a  marginal  extent, with political and administrative officials. The nature of Pernod Ricard's  activity  (production  of  wines  &  spirits  enjoyed during  a  meal  or  in  a  bar),  for which  the  motto  is  'Cr\u00e9ateurs  de convivialit\u00e9', means that inappropriate invitations could be issued to  people  in  a  position  of  public  authority  as  part  of  a  lobbying effort.\n\nSuch acts, even in the absence of deliberate intention to obtain an undue  advantage,  are  severely  punished  by  the  anti-corruption laws  of  three  of  the  Group's  main  markets,  which  impose  heavy pecuniary  sanctions  for  the  Company,  as  well  as  penal  penalties for the people committing them.\n\nReputational damage resulting from an official conviction or breach of the rules could damage the Company's overall credibility, and an illicit  or  reprehensible act, even on a single occasion, could affect all  Group  employees  seeking  to  deliver  a  message  to  public authorities. This could in turn limit the Company's ability to legally influence laws that are harmful to its business. It could also result in regulatory developments harming the Company's business (tax increases, marketing restrictions, etc.).\n\nAs a result, these regulations could together result in a significant increase in financial expense or a reduction in the Group's activities.\n\n## RISK CONTROL AND MITIGATION\n\nPernod Ricard has established an anti-bribery risk mapping tool in order to identify and manage risks inherent to the Group's activities and specific  to  production,  distribution  and  cross-functional  risks.  Pernod  Ricard  is  also  committed  to  a  zero-tolerance  policy  with  clear communication  from  Management,  specific  rules  for  employees  and  stakeholders,  and  special  user-friendly  digital  tools  to  support  its compliance efforts (for example, 'Speak Up', a global whistleblowing hotline; 'Gifted!', an app which can be used to declare and authorise gifts and hospitality; an e-learning platform [MOOC] providing educational videos and quizzes to enable employees to identify and manage bribery risks).\n\nFurthermore, the Group's lobbying policy is guided by the various professional or institutional codes, and a training course on lobbying, part of  which  focuses  on  ethical  issues,  is  open  to  all  employees.  Part  of  the  course  is  delivered  by  Transparency  International,  of  which Pernod Ricard has been a member since early 2013.\n\nIn France, Pernod Ricard files a disclosure statement with the HATVP, the High Authority for Transparency in Public Life (2) and is a member of Transparency International's Forum des entreprises engag\u00e9s (3) . The Group is also a joint signatory of a best practice guide on parliamentary lobbying expenditure published by Transparency International.\n\n(1)\n\nNote that this risk is also covered in Section 3.4 of the Extra-Financial Reporting.\n\n(2)\n\nhttps://www.hatvp.fr/fiche-organisation/?organisation=582041943\n\n- (3) https://transparency-france.org/entreprise/forum-des-entreprises-engagees-2\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Taxes and levies (1)\n\n## RISK IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION\n\n## POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON THE GROUP\n\nAs an international player in the Wines & Spirits sector, the Group is very  sensitive  to  changes  in  import  taxes  and  excise  duties  on alcoholic beverages.\n\nThe Group is also exposed to possible changes in tax regulations in the countries in which it operates, in particular at the instigation of the OECD,  the European Union or national governments (including tax rates), and accounting policies and standards.\n\nLastly,  Pernod  Ricard  may  be  subject  to  tax  audits  in  several countries,  and  there  is  no  guarantee  that  the  tax  authorities  will validate the positions taken by the Group, even if the Group deems them to be correct and reasonable in view of its operations.\n\nAn increase in import taxes, such as the US tarifs imposed on some brands, and excise duties or a change in laws relative to duty free sales  could  result  in  an  increase  in  the  price  of  the  Group's products and a reduction in the consumption of its Wines & Spirits brands or an increase in our costs, thereby affecting the Group's financial  position  and  operating  income.  Nevertheless,  this  risk  is qualified  by  the  size  of  advertising  and  promotional  investment which can, in certain cases, limit the impact on consumption of an increase in prices.\n\nOther changes in tax regulations could also have a material impact on  the  Group's  results,  such  as  an  increase  in  the  corporate  tax rate in the countries in which the Group operates.\n\nLastly, in the event that the tax authorities successfully challenge the Group on any material positions, the Group may be subject to additional  tax  liabilities  that  may  have  an  adverse  effect  on  the Group's financial position if they are not covered by provisions or if they otherwise trigger a cash payment.\n\n## RISK CONTROL AND MITIGATION\n\nThe  Group  has  a  tax  policy  based  on  compliance  with  applicable  laws  and  regulations,  sound  conduct  and  proactive  and  efficient  tax management. It involves the rejection of all artificial arrangements, the application of a transfer pricing policy based on the arm's length principle, efficient organisation of the tax function within the Group and a transparent attitude towards the tax authorities.\n\nFurthermore, the Group's diversification in terms of geographies and product categories mitigates the potential impact of tax risks.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## c. Regulatory environment\n\n## RISK IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION\n\n## POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON THE GROUP\n\nThe  Group's  businesses  throughout  the  world  are  subject  to  a growing number of regulations. Regulatory decisions and changes in legal  and  regulatory  systems  could  have  adverse  impacts  on Pernod Ricard's business, particularly in the areas of product recall, advertising and promotion, labelling and access to distribution.\n\nThe regulatory environment governing the production and marketing of alcoholic beverages could undergo change worldwide. Similarly,  advertising  and  promotion  of  alcoholic  beverages  are subject to increasingly stringent rules aimed at changing consumer behaviour and reducing alcohol consumption.\n\nIn addition, in its capacity as a distributor of international beverage brands,  the  Group  is  subject,  in  the  various  countries  in  which  it operates, to numerous regulatory requirements concerning production, product responsibility, distribution, marketing, advertising (such as the Evin Law in France), labelling and imports. More broadly, it is also subject to issues relating to competition and consolidation, commercial and pricing policies, pensions, labour law and environmental concerns.\n\nRegulatory  decisions  and  changes  in  legal  and  regulatory requirements  in  these  areas  could  have  a  negative  impact  on Pernod Ricard's business:\n\n- product recalls : regulatory authorities in the countries in which \u0097 the Group trades could subject the Group to measures including product  recalls,  product  seizures  and  other  sanctions,  any  of which  could  have  an  adverse  effect  on  its  trading  or  harm  its reputation, with negative consequences on its operating profit;\n- advertising  and promotions : regulatory  authorities  in  the \u0097 countries in which the Group trades could impose restrictions on advertising for alcoholic beverages (e.g. television advertising or sport sponsorships). One effect of these limitations is to prevent or  restrict  the  Group's ability to retain or recruit consumers for its brands in a challenging competitive environment. Restrictions on  advertising  freedom  also  constrain  the  Group's  ability  to launch new innovations. They thus have a significant impact on the Group's business;\n- labelling : changes  to  labelling  requirements  for  alcoholic \u0097 beverages  could  diminish  the  appeal  of  these  products  for consumers,  who  might  switch  to  other  less  tightly  regulated products,  resulting  in  a  decline  in  sales.  Furthermore,  such changes  could  have  the  consequence  of  increasing  costs, thereby affecting the Group's results; and\n- access to distribution : government authorities in the countries \u0097 where  the  Group  operates  could  seek  to  restrict  consumer access to the Group's products, for example the prohibition of alcohol  in  Bihar  (India),  which  led  to  the  termination  of Pernod Ricard's  operations  in  this  state,  and  restrictions  on trading hours or sales outlets in many countries. These restrictions tend to shift consumption to illegal or parallel distribution  channels,  which  compete  with  the  Group's  lawful business.\n\n## RISK CONTROL AND MITIGATION\n\nPernod Ricard actively participates in legislative and/or administrative thinking by presenting its positions and solutions to industry and other stakeholders, be they local decision-makers or lawmakers. Pernod Ricard does this through professional bodies to which it belongs, or directly when the subject specifically concerns the Group.\n\nThis causes the Group to express positions on topics that constitute risk factors, advocating alternatives to exclusively repressive solutions for treating alcohol abuse. Pernod Ricard believes that:\n\n- governments, producers and other stakeholders need to work together to reduce the harmful use of alcohol, particularly illegal and/or \u0097 counterfeit alcohol. Counterfeits account for a significant proportion of alcoholic beverages consumed worldwide, particularly in low- and middle-income countries;\n- the Wine & Spirits sector has a role to play in reducing the potential harm associated with alcohol consumption. Pernod Ricard wishes to \u0097 play an active part in this process;\n- alcohol consumption patterns are heavily influenced by cultural and religious factors; \u0097\n- the effectiveness of initiatives aimed at reducing the harmful consumption of alcohol must be scientifically evaluated; and \u0097\n- we need to target at-risk consumers and behaviour, taking into account cultural differences. \u0097\n\nThese proposals are generally well grasped by Pernod Ricard's contact, and can prompt them to adopt rules on the trade, consumption and sale of alcohol that are both respectful of the need for efficiency as regard health-related issues and mindful of the economic constraints weighing on sector companies. These interlocutors are often sensitive to a factual demonstration of the ineffectiveness of radical repressive measures, which generally have little impact on at-risk consumer behaviour.\n\nPernod Ricard also runs awareness campaigns - either alone or in association with other stakeholders - aimed at reducing the negative externalities of alcohol consumption. By effectively tackling excessive consumption, Pernod Ricard seeks to avoid regulatory measures that could be detrimental to its business (while lacking any real health benefits).\n\n<!-- image -->",

In  addition,  the  Group routinely faces litigation in the normal course of business.\n\nThe Group records provisions for all disputes in which it is involved and  all  risks  it  faces.  At  30 June  2020,  these  provisions  totalled \u20ac431 million, compared with \u20ac374 million at 30 June 2019 (see Note 4.7Provisions to the consolidated financial statements).\n\nMajor litigation of any type could have an adverse impact on the Group's  financial  position  (in  the  event  of  a  fine  or  damages), or the Group's  image  and  reputation  due  to  media  coverage  and posts  on  social  networks,  and  may  result  in  the  loss  of  rights (in the event of the cancellation of a trademark or termination of a sourcing contract).\n\n## RISK CONTROL AND MITIGATION\n\nTo  avoid  litigation,  the  Legal  Department,  in  charge  of  the  Group's  protection  and  defence,  has  implemented  preventive  measures. Marketing and operational teams are made aware of legal issues on an ongoing basis, model agreements are made available, and the legal teams provide support in the very early stages of projects. Legal functions have been established at the regional and local levels to ensure better local monitoring.

        "page_content": "## Counterfeiting/IP rights 3.\n\n## RISK IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION\n\n## POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON THE GROUP\n\nThe Group's brands are one of the key aspects of its competitiveness.  However,  they  face  various  threats:  unauthorised reproduction, imitation, use of signs likely to create confusion in the mind  of  the  public,  refilling  of  bottles  with  counterfeit  liquids. These issues  remain  crucial  in  various  markets,  particularly  in developing markets, and could pose serious threats to consumers, including endangering their health.\n\nIn the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, illegal traders are actively seeking to take advantage of the measures put in place to combat the spread of the virus. The closure of on-trade premises and some official  retail  outlets,  combined  with  legislation  prohibiting  the production,  import,  distribution  and  sale  of  alcoholic  beverages  in certain countries, has triggered a shift to online demand (a distribution channel increasingly used by counterfeiters), as well as a resurgence of black market activity. This is of particular concern in India and South Africa.\n\nFraudulent use of the Group's brands damages the Group's image and reputation and impacts its development prospects and results, as it could cause consumers to shun the Group's products if their reliability is not guaranteed (in the case of refills) or if third parties deliberately create confusion with the Group's brands (brand imitation). It also increases operating costs.\n\nWhile  avenues  for  legal  recourse  are  generally  satisfactory, it may be difficult in some countries to obtain swift and dissuasive sanctions against counterfeiters.\n\nFor instance, the Group is currently in a dispute over the 'Havana Club'  brand  (see  Note 6.5  Disputes in  the  notes  to  the consolidated financial statements).\n\n## RISK CONTROL AND MITIGATION\n\nThe protection and defence of the Group's intellectual property rights is based on a triangular organisation established to maximise desired efficiency while minimising costs.\n\nFirst  component:  at  the  end  of  2014,  the  Group  set  up  a  centralised  team  (the  'Group  Intellectual  Property  Hub')  dedicated  notably  to protecting the brands. This team ensures the protection of rights and defends them against any attempt by third parties to file similar rights in order to avoid confusion among consumers and the undermining or dilution of the Group's brands.\n\nSecond component: the Brand Companies are in charge of proceedings brought against any counterfeit goods and/or imitations that may be present in the markets.\n\nThird component: a Brand Security team leads the fight against illicit trade in the Group's products globally by coordinating all action taken against counterfeiting and other forms of trafficking. This action takes the form of investigations on the ground or online, and legal action combined with initiatives to raise awareness among local authorities. In the context of Covid-19, the Brand Security team has stepped up its general monitoring of online sales platforms and social media. Many counterfeiting production facilities have also been dismantled with the help of local authorities, particularly in India and China. Lobbying has also been undertaken jointly with the Public Affairs teams and the Transnational Alliance to Combat Illicit Trade (TRACIT) to raise government awareness of the impact of measures taken on illicit trade during the  lockdown.  Lastly,  the  Brand  Security  team  is  also  involved  in  the  development  of  technical/technological  measures  to  improve  the protection of the Group's products. Examples of such measures include a scheme based on the principle of the smart bottle, introduced in strategic markets such as China, which enables consumers to check the authenticity of the Group's products using a QR code integrated into  the  packaging.  In  addition,  a  platform  identifying  local  legislation  that  could  encourage  illicit  trade  was  set  up  in  conjunction  with industry stakeholders to identify high-risk regions and take the necessary action during the Covid-19 crisis.\n\nThe defence of intellectual property rights also involves operational staff, who are called on to identify imitations (products/brands) in the field and to pass on all necessary information to the aforementioned teams for action.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

This  year,  this  has  notably  resulted  in  asset  impairments  of \u20ac1 billion, in particular on the Absolut brand.\n\nIn order to face the potential fallout from this crisis on the Group's cash flow,  Pernod  Ricard  has  taken  necessary  precautions  to  ensure  that  it has sufficient  cash  to  cover  its  needs,  for  example  by  suspending  the share buyback programme of up to \u20ac1 billion for FY20 and FY21.\n\nMoreover,  the  Group  has  anticipated  the  refinancing  of  part  of  these bond maturities by raising \u20ac2 billion in the form of a bond issued in two 5- and 10-year tranches. This amount is in addition to the October 2019 issues for an amount of \u20ac1.5 billion maturing over 4, 8 and 12 years.\n\n## Foreign exchange risk (1) 1.\n\n## RISK IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION\n\n## POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON THE GROUP\n\nDue to its international footprint, the Group is naturally exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies (excluding the euro, its functional and  reporting  currency)  in  which  its  operations  are  carried  out (transaction  and  translation  risks)  and  in  which  its  assets  and liabilities are denominated.\n\nFluctuations  of  this  nature  may  therefore  have  an  impact  on Pernod Ricard's results and shareholders' equity.\n\nThey include:\n\n- conversion  risk  for  the  financial  statements  of  consolidated \u0097 affiliates with a functional currency other than the euro; and\n- operational risks on operating cash flows not denominated in the \u0097 entities' functional currency.\n\nMoreover, fluctuations in currencies against the euro (notably the US dollar) may impact the nominal amount of these debts and the financial  expense  reported  in  euros  in  the  consolidated  financial statements, and this could affect the Group's reported results.\n\n## RISK CONTROL AND MITIGATION\n\nAs a rule, it is Group policy to invoice end customers in the functional currency of the distributing entity. The resulting net foreign exchange exposures are hedged by the use of forward transactions.\n\nResidual risk may be partially hedged by the use of financial derivatives (forward purchases, forward sales or options) intended to hedge highly probable receivables or payables or to secure the receipt of dividends.\n\nFor asset risk, financing foreign currency-denominated assets acquired by the Group with debt in the same currency provides natural hedging.\n\nIn  May  2020,  the  Group  also  set  up  a  \u20ac7  billion  EMTN  (medium  term note)  issuance  programme.  To  date,  no  drawdowns  have  been  made under the programme.\n\nAs of 30 June 2020, the Group's cash position stood at \u20ac1.9 billion, plus \u20ac3.4 billion  in  undrawn  secured  credit  lines,  including  a  \u20ac600 million revolving credit line set up in March 2020.\n\nAt  30  June  2020,  the  Group's  net  financial  debt  stood  at  \u20ac8.4  billion. The  next  bond  maturities  are  US$200  million  in  January  2021  and US$500 million in April 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Group's risk hedging policy is based on the partial transfer of risk to insurers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Pension funds (1) 4.\n\n## RISK IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION\n\n## POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON THE GROUP\n\nThe Group's unfunded pension obligations amounted to \u20ac605 million  as  of  30 June  2020.  During  FY20,  the  Group's contributions to pension plans totalled \u20ac53 million.\n\nThe Group's pension obligations are  for  the  most  part  covered  by balance sheet provisions and partially covered by pension funds or insurance.  The  amount  of  these  provisions  is  based  on  certain actuarial  assumptions,  including,  for  example,  discounting  factors, demographic  trends,  pension  trends,  future  salary  trends  and expected returns on plan assets.\n\nThe  asset/liability  balance  is  subject  to,  among  other  factors, the performance  of  invested  assets.  A  liquidity  crisis  or  major financial  shock  could  significantly  undermine  the  performance  of financial assets and  jeopardise the asset/liability balance. A pronounced asset/liability imbalance may require an increase in the Group's pension liabilities recognised in the balance sheet and result  in  an  increase  in  the  allowance  for  retirement  provisions. This  could  have  a  significant  negative  impact  on  the  Group's financial results.\n\n## RISK CONTROL AND MITIGATION\n\nSpecific governance and a management policy have been implemented and are regularly reviewed in line with the risk profile of the Group's various pension plans. The investment strategy is subject to frequent review in order to minimise the volatility of assets.\n\nThe buy-in transaction achieved for the largest Pension Fund of the Group in September 2019 is a concrete example of the active derisking strategy. The Fund's Trustee has purchased an insurance policy from a highly-rated and well established insurance company to cover the majority of the pensions obligations. The insurance policy therefore reduces the Group's exposure on that Fund to funding deficits arising from market risks, including inflation and interest rate risks, and longevity risks.\n\nIn addition, defined benefit plans (mainly affiliates in North America, the United Kingdom and the rest of Europe) are subject to an annual actuarial valuation on the basis of country-specific assumptions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

This transfer is accompanied by a policy of prevention to reduce risk as much as possible. The Group evaluates its risks with care in order to fine-tune the level of coverage of the risks it incurs.\n\n## Insurance policies 4.3.1\n\nIn order to cover the main risks, Pernod Ricard has set up international insurance programmes for all Group affiliates, barring exceptions due to local  regulatory  constraints  in  certain  countries  or  as  a  result  of  more attractive  conditions  offered  by  the  local  market.  These  programmes provide the following coverage:\n\n- property damage and business interruption losses; \u0097\n- operating/product liability, including costs and losses incurred by the \u0097 Group due to accidental and/or criminal contamination;\n- environmental liability; \u0097\n\n## Coverage 4.3.2\n\n| Type of insurance                                          |                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Damage to property and operating losses                    | Coverage and limits on the main insurance policies  (1) Coverage: fully comprehensive (except exclusions). \u0097 Basis of compensation: \u0097 replacement value for moveable property and real estate, except for certain affiliates,  \u0097 which have exceptionally chosen, with the contractual agreement of the insurers,  to provide for another basis of compensation;                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| General civil liability (operating and product liability)  | Fully comprehensive coverage (except for exclusions) for damage caused to third parties  \u0097 for up to \u20ac220 million per year of insurance.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| Product contamination                                      | Coverage taken out under the general civil liability programme for recall expenses, the cost  \u0097 of the relevant products, business interruption and outlay on rebuilding Pernod Ricard's  image following accidental or criminal contamination of products that could endanger  persons or property: coverage of up to \u20ac45 million per year.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| General environmental liability Directors' civil liability | Coverage for environmental damage of \u20ac30 million. \u0097                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| Transport                                                  | Coverage of up to \u20ac150 million per year of insurance. \u0097                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n|                                                            | Coverage of up to \u20ac20 million per claim. \u0097                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n|                                                            | \u0097 \u0097                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| Fraud/cyber security                                       | Coverage of up to \u20ac35 million per year, with a cyber-insurance sub-limit of \u20ac20 million.                                                                                                           |\n| Credit                                                     | Coverage differs depending on the affiliate and the programme, with total cover rising to  a maximum of \u20ac180 million.

All these players have the experience and means required for managing exceptional situations.\n\n## Risks and disputes: provisioning procedure 4.4\n\nAs part of its commercial activities, Pernod Ricard is involved in legal actions and subject to tax, customs and administrative audits. The Group only records provisions for risks and contingencies when it is likely that a current obligation stemming from a past event will require the payment of an amount that can be reliably estimated. The amount of the provision is the best estimate of the outflow of resources required to extinguish this liability. Provisions accordingly involve an assessment by Group Management.\n\n## Financial and accounting information 4.5\n\n## Preparation of the Group's consolidated financial statements 4.5.1\n\nIn addition to the management information described above, the Group prepares  half-year  and  annual  consolidated  financial  statements.

For FY20, the trends by region were:\n\n- Americas:  -6%,  with  good  resilience  in  USA (1) and  Canada  in  slight \u0097 growth, but double-digit decline in Latin America and Travel Retail;\n- Asia-RoW:  -14%,  driven  mainly  by  China,  India  and  Travel  Retail, \u0097 against a high basis of comparison;\n- Europe:  -6%,  overall  good  resilience  with  Germany,  UK  and  Eastern \u0097 Europe  growing  and  partially  offsetting  declines  in  Travel  Retail, Spain and France.\n\nKey categories were impacted by the pandemic, but Specialty Brands performed well:\n\n- Strategic International Brands: -10%, after broad-based growth in the \u0097 first  half,  mainly  driven  by  Martell,  Chivas  Regal,  Absolut  and Ballantine's;\n- Strategic  Local  Brands:  -9%,  with  modest  growth  at  the  end  of  the \u0097 first  nine  months,  but a  strong  decline  in  the  fourth  quarter,  mainly due  to  Seagram's  Indian  whiskies,  and  amplified  by  the  high comparison basis;\n- Specialty  Brands:  +7%,  despite  Covid-19,  thanks  to  more  favourable \u0097 geographic  exposure,  with  dynamic  growth  of  Lillet,  Altos  and Redbreast;\n- Strategic  wines:  -4%,  due  mainly  to  Jacob's  Creek,  and  despite  the \u0097 growth of Campo Viejo.\n\nFourth  quarter  net  sales  were  \u20ac1,238 million  in  FY20,  with  an  organic decline of -36.2% (-37.9% reported), strongly impacted  by  the progression of the Covid-19 pandemic throughout the world, particularly for  Travel  Retail  and  On-trade.  The  Off-trade  held  up  better  than expected, notably in the USA and Europe.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  PRO  margin  erosion  was  contained  to  -131 bp, despite a significant reduction in Net sales, demonstrating active cost management. The Structure cost ratio increased by -79 bps, with topline decline  reducing  fixed  cost  absorption,  despite  strong  cost  discipline. The currency  effect  (+1%  or  +\u20ac36 million)  was  primarily  driven    by  the stronger  US  dollar.  The  scope  effect  remained  limited  to  \u20ac(2) million. On a reported basis, Profit from Recurring Operations was down -12%.\n\n## Financial income/expense 5.2.5 from recurring operations\n\nFinancial  expenses  from  recurring  operations  were  \u20ac(328) million, compared  with  \u20ac(314) million  the  previous  period.  This  represents  a slight increase in financial expense from recurring operations mainly due to application of IFRS 16 and Fx impact.\n\nThe debt structure at 30 June 2020 was as follow:\n\n- the bond portion was approximately 94% of gross debt; \u0097\n- the fixed-rate portion was 86% of total debt; \u0097\n- the weighted average maturity of gross bond debt was six years; \u0097\n- the  Group  had  \u20ac1.9 billion  in  cash  and \u20ac3.4 billion  undrawn  bank \u0097 credit lines.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Group net profit from recurring 5.2.6 operations\n\nTax  on  profit  from  recurring  operations  stood  at  \u20ac468 million. This represents a tax rate on recurring items of 24.2% vs. 25.9% for FY19, due to  a  reduction  in  the  Indian  tax  rate  (from  34.9%  to  25.2%)  and  a change in the geographical mix.\n\nNon-controlling interests amounted to \u20ac21 million.\n\nGroup net profit from recurring operations decreased by -13% vs. FY19 to \u20ac1,439 million.  Diluted  net  profit  per  share  from  recurring  operations stood at \u20ac5.45, down -13%.\n\n## Group net profit 5.2.7\n\nOther  non-recurring  operating  income  and  expenses  amounted  to \u20ac(1,283) million, driven by:\n\n- brand impairment: \u20ac(999) million, mainly related to Absolut \u0097 (\u20ac(912)million  gross,  \u20ac(702) million  net  after  tax)  and  triggered  by Covid-19 sanitary crisis;\n- restructuring  charges  \u20ac(178) million,  including  France  and  the  wine \u0097 branch reorganisation;\n- other  charges  of  which  \u20ac(37) million  Covid-19-related  promotional \u0097 event cancellation, charitable donations and supply of hand sanitiser.\n\nNon-current financial  income/(expense)  of  \u20ac(38)  million  mainly  due  to refinancing operations performed during the period, in particular one-off costs  relating  to  early  redemption  of  50%  of  a  US$1  billion  bond  debt due in April 2021 (as part of the active management of Group debt) and foreign exchange impact.\n\nNon-current  tax  was  a  net  income  of  \u20ac210 million,  driven  mainly  by deferred  tax  liability  adjustments  related  to  impairment  charges  and revaluation  of  deferred  taxes  (following  changes  to  tax  rates  in  the United Kingdom and India) recognised during the period.\n\nAccordingly, Group net profit stood at \u20ac329 million, a decrease of -77% on FY20.",

The Group's  management  believes  these  measures  provide  valuable additional information  for  users  of  the  financial  statements  in understanding  the  Group's  performance.  These  non-IFRS  measures should  be  considered  as  complementary  to  the  comparable  IFRS measures and reported movements therein.\n\n## Organic growth 5.5.1\n\nOrganic growth is calculated after excluding the impacts of exchange rate movements and acquisitions and disposals.\n\nExchange  rates  impact  is  calculated  by  translating  the  current  year results at the prior year's exchange rates.\n\nFor  acquisitions  in  the  current  year,  the  post-acquisition  results  are excluded  from  the  organic  movement  calculations.  For  acquisitions  in the prior year, post-acquisition results are included in the prior year but are included in the organic movement calculation from the anniversary of the acquisition date in the current year.\n\nWhere a business, brand, brand distribution right or agency agreement was disposed of or terminated in the prior year, the Group excludes in the  organic  movement  calculations  the  results  for  that  business  from the  prior  year.  For  disposals  or  terminations  in  the  current  year, the Group excludes the results for that business from the prior year from the date of the disposal or termination.\n\nThis  measure  enables  the  Group  to  focus  on  the  performance  of  the business  which  is  common  to  both  years  and  which  represents  those measures that Local Managers are most directly able to influence.\n\n## Free Cash Flow 5.5.2\n\nFree  Cash  Flow  comprises  the  net  cash  flow  from  operating  activities excluding the contributions to Allied Domecq pension plans, aggregated with  the  proceeds  from  disposals  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  and intangible assets and after deduction of the capital expenditures.\n\n## 'Recurring' indicators 5.5.3\n\nThe  following  three  measures  represent  key  indicators  for  the measurement of the recurring performance of the business, excluding significant  items  that,  because  of  their  nature  and  their  unusual occurrence,  cannot  be  considered  as  inherent  to  the  recurring performance of the Group:\n\n## Recurring Free Cash Flow: \u0097\n\nRecurring  Free  Cash  Flow  is  calculated  by  restating  Free  Cash  Flow from non-recurring items.\n\n## Profit from recurring operations: \u0097\n\nProfit  from  recurring  operations  corresponds  to  the  operating  profit excluding other non-current operating income and expenses.\n\n## Group net profit from recurring operations: \u0097\n\nGroup  Net  profit  from  recurring  operations  corresponds  to  net  profit attributable to equity holders of the parent before other non-recurring operating  income  and  expenses,  non-recurring  financial  income  and expenses and non-recurring income taxes.\n\n## Net debt 5.5.4\n\nNet financial debt, as defined and used by the Group, corresponds to total gross debt (translated at the closing rate), including fair value and net  foreign  currency  assets  hedge  derivatives  (hedging  of  net investments and similar), less cash and cash equivalents.\n\n## EBITDA 5.5.5\n\nEBITDA  stands  for  'earnings  before  interest,  taxes,  depreciation  and amortisation'.  EBITDA  is  an  accounting  measure  calculated  using  the Group's  profit  from  recurring  operations  excluding  depreciation  and amortisation on operating fixed assets.\n\n## Material contracts 5.6\n\n## Significant contracts not related to financing 5.6.1\n\n## Suntory 5.6.1.1\n\nIn 1988, Allied Domecq entered into a series of agreements with Suntory Ltd, one of Japan's leading producers and distributors of spirits. One of the  provisions  of  these  agreements  concerned  the  creation  of  a joint-venture  company  in  Japan  called  Suntory  Allied  Ltd,  in  which 49.99% of the capital and voting rights are owned by Allied Domecq and 50.01%  by  Suntory  Ltd.  Suntory  Allied  Ltd  was  granted  the  exclusive distribution  rights  for  certain  Allied  Domecq  brands  in  Japan  until 31 March 2029.\n\nThe  management  of  Suntory  Allied  Ltd  is  jointly  controlled  by Pernod Ricard, as successor-in-interest to Allied Domecq, and Suntory Ltd.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Sale and repurchase agreements 5.6.1.2\n\nDuring FY20, Pernod Ricard did not conclude any sale and repurchase agreements.  For  more  details  on  transactions  related  to  previous  sale and  repurchase  agreements,  please  refer  to  the  Share  buyback programme subsection of Section 9 About the Company and its share capital.",

As the extension  options  to  six  or  seven  years  have  been  activated, this agreement now expires in 2024.\n\nThe obligations of each of the borrowers under the Credit Agreement are  guaranteed  by  Pernod  Ricard.  No  security  interest  ( s\u00fbret\u00e9  r\u00e9elle ) was granted under the terms of the Credit Agreement.\n\n## 2020 Credit Agreement (bilateral credit)\n\nOn 23 March 2020, Pernod Ricard and Pernod Ricard Finance signed a bilateral revolving credit facility (as amended by an amendment dated 9 April  2020,  the  ' Bilateral  Credit  Agreement ',  together  with  the Credit Agreement, the ' Credit Agreements ')  in  a  principal  amount  of \u20ac600 million, for  a  period  of  12 months,  with  the  option  of  a  12-month extension.\n\nThe  obligations  of  Pernod  Ricard  Finance  under  the  Bilateral  Credit Agreement  are  guaranteed  by  Pernod  Ricard.  No  security  interest ( s\u00fbret\u00e9  r\u00e9elle )  was  granted  under  the  terms  of  the  Bilateral  Credit Agreement.\n\n## Provisions of the Credit Agreements\n\nThe  Credit  Agreements  contain  customary  representations  and warranties, as well as the usual restrictive covenants contained in such contracts,  notably  restricting  the  ability  of  some  Group  companies (subject  to  certain  exceptions)  to  pledge  their  assets  as  security interest,  alter  the  general  nature  of  the  Group's  activities  or  carry  out certain acquisition transactions.\n\nThe Credit Agreements also set out obligations, including a commitment to  provide  lenders  with  adequate  information,  compliance  with  a solvency  ratio  at  each  half-year  end  as  mentioned  hereunder (the ' Solvency  Ratio '), and  compliance  with  certain  commitments customary in this type of credit agreement (including the maintenance of the credit's pari passu ranking).\n\nThe Solvency Ratio must be 5.25 or less. At 30 June 2020, the Group was  compliant  with  this  solvency  ratio  (see  'Liquidity  risks'  in  this management report).\n\nThe  Credit  Agreements  incorporate  the  main  terms  of  the  2012 syndicated Credit Agreement and, in addition, provide for certain cases of  voluntary or compulsory early repayment obligations, depending on circumstances,  which  are  standard  practice  for  credit  agreements  of this  kind  (including  non-compliance  with  commitments,  change  of control and cross default). The Credit Agreements also contain a clause under which the taking of control of Pernod Ricard by any other person or group of persons acting in concert (other than Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Paul Ricard or any group of persons acting in concert with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Paul Ricard) is likely to constitute grounds for compulsory early repayment.\n\n## Bond issuance 5.6.2.3\n\nThe  nominal  amount  of  the  Bonds  and  the  interest  thereon (the ' Bonds ') constitute direct, unsubordinated and unsecured obligations of Pernod Ricard, ranking equally amongst themselves and pari passu with  all  other  unsecured and unsubordinated debt, present and future, of Pernod Ricard. In addition, Pernod Ricard has agreed not to  grant  any  security  interest  ( s\u00fbret\u00e9  r\u00e9elle )  with  regard  to  bonds  or other debt securities that have been or may be admitted to trading on a regulated  market,  over-the-counter  market  or  other  exchange  unless the  Bonds  benefit  from  similar  security  interests  or  security  interests approved by the bondholders.\n\nThese  bond  issuances  include  a  clause  regarding  change  of  control, which  could  lead  to  the  compulsory  early  repayment  of  bonds  upon request of each bondholder in the event of a change of control of the Company (benefitting a person or a group of persons acting in concert) and leading to a deterioration in the Company's financial rating.\n\nIn  addition,  these  bonds  may  be  redeemed  early  if  certain  customary events of default arise.\n\n<!-- image -->",

According to  the  terms  of  the  Programme,  Pernod  Ricard  may  issue  bonds  by means of private placements in various currencies. The securities may be admitted to trading on Euronext Paris. The maximum nominal amount of  securities  outstanding  under  the  Programme  is  set  at  \u20ac7 billion (or its equivalent in any other currency). At its meeting on 22 April 2020, the  Board  of  Directors  authorised  the  Company  to  issue  bonds  under the  Programme  up  to  a  maximum  nominal  amount  of  \u20ac1.5 billion (or its equivalent  in  any  other  currency)  for  a  period  of  one  year  from 22 April 2020.\n\n## Europe Factoring Agreement 5.6.2.5\n\nOn  15 December  2008,  certain  affiliates  of  Pernod  Ricard  and Pernod Ricard  Finance  signed  a  factoring  framework  agreement  with BNP Paribas Factor, to set up a pan-European factoring programme in the gross amount of \u20ac350 million, which was increased to \u20ac400 million by  an  addendum  dated  23 June  2009.  The  programme  was  most recently  renewed on 3 December 2018, for a period of five years from 1 January 2019.  This  programme  was  agreed  in  the  amount  of \u20ac500 million. The receivables are sold under the contractual subrogation regime under French law, except where certain local legal restrictions  are  in  force.  As  substantially  all  of  the  risks  and  rewards related  to  the  receivables  are  transferred  to  the  purchaser  in accordance with this factoring programme, transferred receivables are deconsolidated.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOn  24 June  2009,  certain  affiliates  of  Pernod  Ricard  entered  into  an international securitisation programme arranged by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB. The purpose of the programme was the transfer of eligible commercial receivables to \u20acSTR, in accordance with the provisions of a framework agreement  dated  24 June  2009  and  country-specific  agreements entered  into  at  the  time  that  each  relevant  affiliate  joined  the programme. This  programme  was  renewed  on  17 June  2019  under  the terms  of  an  addendum  to  the  framework  agreement.  The  programme amounts  to  \u20ac65 million,  US$230 million,  \u00a3145 million  and  400 million Swedish kronor.\n\nThis  three-year  programme  includes  a  change  of  control  clause  that applies  to  each  affiliate  participating  in  the  programme  as  a  seller, which could  lead  to  the  early  repayment  of  the  programme  by  the affiliate  concerned  by  such  change  of  control.  'Change  of  control'  is defined as Pernod Ricard ceasing to hold, directly or indirectly, at least 80% of the share capital or voting rights of an affiliate participating in the programme as a seller, unless (i) Pernod Ricard continues to hold, directly  or  indirectly,  50%  of  the  share  capital  or  voting  rights  of  such affiliate and (ii) issues, at the request of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB, a guarantee in terms that Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB deems satisfactory (acting reasonably) for  the  purpose  of  securing  the  obligations  of  such  affiliate  under  the securitisation transaction documents.\n\n## Factoring agreement Pacific 5.6.2.7\n\nOn  18 March  2013,  a  new  agreement  for  the  sale  of  receivables  was signed between Pernod Ricard Winemakers Pty Ltd (formerly Premium Wine  Brands  Pty (1) ),  Pernod  Ricard  Winemakers  New  Zealand  Limited (formerly  Pernod  Ricard  New  Zealand  Limited)  and  The  Royal  Bank  of Scotland  plc.  This  factoring  agreement  covers  Australia  and  New Zealand and amounts to AUD128.5 million and NZD45 million. The receivables sale agreement was taken over in full by BNP Paribas on 4 December 2015, replacing The Royal Bank of Scotland plc.\n\nAdditional information on the impact of these financing contracts on the Group's financial statements is provided in Notes 4.8.1 Breakdown of net  financial  debt  by  nature  and  maturity and  4.8.7  Bonds  to  the consolidated financial statements .",

The  Group  does not adopt early application of standards or interpretations.\n\nThe Group's financial year runs from 1 July to 30 June.\n\n## Changes in accounting standards 2.\n\nStandards, amendments and interpretations for which implementation is mandatory for financial years commencing from 1 July 2019\n\nThe standards, amendments  and  interpretations applicable to Pernod Ricard with effect from 1 July 2019, are as follows:\n\n- IFRS 16 \"Leases\"; \u0097\n- IFRIC 23 'Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments'; \u0097\n- amendments  to  IFRS 9 \"Prepayment features with negative \u0097 compensation\";\n- amendments  to  IAS 19  \"Employee  Benefits:  Plan  Amendment, \u0097 Curtailment or Settlement\";\n- amendments to IAS 28 \"Investments in associates and joint ventures\"; \u0097\n- the IFRS improvements cycle 2015/17. \u0097\n\nOther  than  IFRS 16  and  IFRIC 23,  whose  impacts  are  described  in Notes 1.1.2.1.1 and 1.1.2.1.2 below, these amendments and interpretations have no impact on the Group's financial statements.\n\n## Impact of the first-time application of IFRS 16 2.1 and IFRIC 23\n\n## IFRS 16 (Leases) 2.1.1\n\nIn  January 2016,  the  IASB  (International  Accounting  Standards  Board) published a new standard for the recognition of leases. This mandatory new  standard  replaces  IAS 17  and  the  associated  IFRIC  and  SIC interpretations.  It  removes  the  distinction  previously  made  between finance leases and operating leases by requiring all lease commitments to be recorded in the balance sheet. The Group has therefore reviewed all its leases.\n\nAccounting principles amended following the application of IFRS 16 are presented in Note 4.8 Financial liabilities . The Group also analysed the decision by the IFRS Interpretation Committee in November 2019 with regard to the determination of the enforceable period of contracts and the  depreciation  period  for  fixtures  and  fittings  and  installations inseparable  from  the  leased  property.  This  decision  has  no  material impact  on  the  Group's  consolidated  financial  statements  and  the judgements made in determining the term of the leases.\n\nThe Group has applied the simplified retrospective transition method to 1 July 2019.  The  choice  of  this  transition  method  means  that comparative information from prior periods has not been restated.\n\nThe  standard  introduces  various  simplification  measures.  In  particular, the  Group  has  chosen  exemptions  from  recognition  to  exclude  leases with  a  term  of  less  than  12 months  (including  residual  period  at  the transition  date)  and  leases  relating  to  assets  with  a  low  replacement value.  The  value  of  leases  classified  as  finance  leases  under  IAS 17 remains unchanged.\n\nVariable leases or the provision of lease-related services are not taken into  account  when  determining  the  amount  of  the  right-of-use  asset and  lease  liability  and  are  recognised  as  expenses  when  they  are incurred.\n\nIn addition, the value of the right-of-use asset is deemed to be equal to the amount of the liability, adjusted for prepaid rents, initial direct costs, benefits received from lessors and, where applicable, remediation costs.\n\nLease liabilities have been measured at the present value of the lease payments outstanding. The discount rates applied at the transition date are  based  on  the  Group's  borrowing  rate  plus  a  spread  to  take  into account  country-specific  economic  environments.  The  discount  rates were  determined  taking  into  account  the  term  of  each  lease. The weighted  average  incremental  borrowing  rate  applied  to  lease liabilities at 1 July 2019 is 3.94%.\n\nThe  reconciliation  between  the  commitments  relating  to  operating  leases,  disclosed  in  Note 6.3  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements at 30 June 2019, and the lease liability recognised at 1 July 2019 under the first-time application of IFRS 16, is as follows:\n\n\u20ac million\n\n| Operating lease commitments at 30 June 2019       | 555   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|-------|\n| Leases exempt from recognition under IFRS 16      | (4)   |\n| Leases with a commencement date after 1 July 2019 | (201) |\n| Finance leases previously recognised under IAS 17 | 28    |\n| Other items                                       | 13    |\n| Undiscounted lease liabilities at 1 July 2019     | 391   |\n| Discounting effect                                | 52    |\n| Lease liabilities recognised at 1 July 2019       | 339   |\n\nAt 30 June 2020, following the application of IFRS 16, the Group's balance sheet includes lease liabilities totalling \u20ac522 million and right-of-use assets totalling \u20ac448 million.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  assumption  concerning  the  lease  term corresponds  to  the  non-cancellable  period  of  the  lease,  if  necessary increased  by  renewal  periods  where  there  is  an  extension  option  and the management is reasonably certain to exercise that option.\n\n- A  breakdown  of  right-of-use  assets  by  category  of  fixed  asset  at 1 July 2019  and  at  30 June  2020  is  also  given  in  Note 4.2  Property, plant and equipment .\n\nThe  impact  on  the  Group's  income  statement  is  non-material.

The application of this interpretation has no impact on the value of the Group's tax liabilities and involved the reclassification of \u20ac150 million from 'Non-current provisions' to 'Current tax liabilities' at 30 June 2019. The Group's balance sheet at 30 June 2019 has been restated accordingly:\n\n| \u20ac million                     | 30/06/2019 Published   | Impacts IFRIC 23   | 30/06/2019 Restated   |\n|-------------------------------|------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|\n| Non-current provisions        | 420                    | (150)              | 269                   |\n| Total non-current liabilities | 10,185                 | (150)              | 10,034                |\n| Income taxes payable          | 157                    | 150                | 307                   |\n| Total current liabilities     | 4,676                  | 150                | 4,826                 |\n\n## Measurement basis 3.\n\nThe financial statements are prepared in accordance with the historical cost  method,  except  for  certain  categories  of  assets  and  liabilities, which are measured in accordance with the methods provided by IFRS.\n\n## Principal uncertainties arising from the use 4. of estimates and judgements by Management\n\n## Estimates\n\nThe  preparation  of  consolidated  financial  statements  in  accordance with  IFRS  means  that  Group  Management  makes a certain  number of estimates and assumptions which have an impact on the amount of the Group's  assets  and  liabilities,  and  items  of  profit  and  loss  during  the financial  year.  These  estimates  are  made  on  the  assumption  that  the Company  will  continue  as  a  going  concern,  and  are  based  on information available at the time of their preparation. Estimates may be revised where the circumstances on which they were based change or where new information becomes available. Future outcomes can differ from these estimates.\n\n## Goodwill and intangible assets\n\nAs indicated in Note 4.1 Intangible assets and goodwill ,  in  addition to annual impairment tests applied to goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite  useful  lives  (such  as  brands),  the  Group  carries  out  spot impairment  tests  where  there  is  an  indication  that  the  value  of  an intangible  asset  may  have  been  impaired.  Any  impairment  loss  is calculated using discounted future cash flows and/or the market values of  the  assets  in  question.  These  calculations  require  the  use  of assumptions  regarding  market  conditions  and  projected  cash  flows, and any changes in these assumptions may thus lead to results different from those initially estimated.\n\n## Provisions for pensions and other post-employment benefits\n\nAs  indicated  in  Note 4.7  Provisions ,  the  Group  runs  defined  benefit and defined contribution pension plans. In addition, provisions are also recognised in virtue of certain other post-employment benefits such as life  insurance  and  medical  care  (mainly  in  the  United  States  and  the United  Kingdom).  The  carrying  amount  of  these  provisions  at  the balance sheet date is set out in Note 4.7 Provisions .\n\nThese benefit obligations are based on a number of assumptions such as discount rates, future salary increases, the rate of employee turnover and life expectancy.\n\nThese  assumptions  are  generally  updated  annually.  The  assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2020 and the procedures used in their determination are set out  in  Note 4.7  Provisions .  The  Group  considers  that  the  actuarial assumptions used are appropriate and justified. However, such actuarial assumptions  may  change  in  the  future  and  this  may  have  a  material impact  on  the  amount  of  the  Group's  benefit  obligations  and  on  its profits.\n\n## Deferred tax\n\nAs indicated in Note 3.3 Corporate income tax , the deferred tax assets recognised result mainly from tax loss carryforwards and from temporary differences  between  the  tax  base  and  the  carrying  amounts  of  assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets in respect of tax losses are recognised if  it  is  probable  that  the  Group  will  have  future  taxable  profits  against which such losses will be used. The assessment of whether the Group will  be  able  to  use  these  tax  losses  is  largely  a  matter  of  judgement. Analyses  are  carried  out  to  decide  whether  or  not  these  tax  loss carryforwards are likely to be usable in the future.\n\n## Provisions\n\nAs explained in Note 4.7 Provisions , the Group is involved in a number of  disputes  and  claims  arising  in  the  ordinary  course  of  its  business. In some cases, the amounts requested by the claimants are significant and  the  legal  proceedings  can  take  several  years.  In  this  context, provisions are calculated on the basis of the Group's best estimate of the  amount  that  will  be  payable  based  on  the  information  available (notably  that  provided  by  the  Group's  legal  advisers).  Any  change  to assumptions  can  have  a  significant  effect  on  the  amount  of  the provision  recognised.  The  carrying  amount  of  these  provisions  at  the balance sheet date is set out in Note 4.7 Provisions .\n\n## Judgements\n\nIn  the  absence of standards or interpretations applicable to a specific transaction, Group Management uses its judgement to define and apply accounting policies that provide relevant and reliable information in the context of the preparation of the financial statements.\n\n## Hyperinflation\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  IAS 29,  Argentina  has  been considered a hyperinflationary economy since 1 July 2018.\n\nHowever, given the contribution of Argentina's business performance to the Group's financial statements, the impact of the application of IAS 29 has  been  deemed  non-material,  and  the  corresponding  restatements have not been made.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Business combinations after 1 July 2009 are measured and recognised in  accordance  with  the  revised  version  of  IFRS 3:  the  consideration transferred (cost of acquisition) is measured at the fair value of assets given,  equity  instruments  issued  and  liabilities  incurred  at  the transaction  date.  Identifiable  assets  and  liabilities  belonging  to  the acquired  company  are  measured  at  their  fair  value  at  the  acquisition date.  Costs  directly  attributable  to  the  acquisition,  such  as  legal, due diligence  and  other  professional  fees  are  recognised  as  other operating expenses incurred.\n\nAny surplus consideration in excess of the Group's share in the fair value of the  acquired  company's  identifiable  assets  and  liabilities  is recognised as goodwill. The option is available for each transaction to apply either proportionate or full goodwill methods. Goodwill arising on the  acquisition  of  foreign  entities  is  denominated  in  the  functional currency  of  the  business  acquired.  Goodwill  is  not  amortised.  Instead, it is subject to an impairment test once a year or more often if there is any indication that its value may have been impaired.\n\nFinally,  in  accordance  with  IFRS 3  as  revised  and  IAS 27  as  amended, the Group  recognised  in  shareholders'  equity  the  difference  between the  price  paid  and  the  proportional  part  of  non-controlling  interests acquired in previously controlled companies.\n\n## Foreign currency translation 6.\n\n## Reporting currency used in the consolidated 6.1 financial statements\n\nThe  Group's  consolidated  financial  statements  are  prepared  in  euros, which  is  the  functional  currency  and  the  reporting  currency  of  the Parent Company.\n\n## Functional currency 6.2\n\nThe  functional  currency  of  an  entity  is  the  currency  of  the  economic environment in which it mainly operates. In most cases, the functional currency  is  the  entity's  local  currency.  However,  in  a  very  limited number of entities, a functional currency that is different from the local currency may be used if it reflects the entity's economic environment and  the  currency  in  which  most  of  the  entity's  transactions  are denominated.\n\n## Translation of transactions denominated 6.3 in foreign currencies\n\nTransactions denominated in foreign currencies are generally translated into the functional currency using the exchange rate applicable at the transaction  date.  Non-monetary  assets  and  liabilities  denominated  in foreign  currencies  are  recognised  at  the  historical  exchange  rate applicable  at  the  transaction  date.  Monetary  assets  and  liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate applying  at  the  closing  date.  Foreign  currency  differences  are recognised in profit and loss for the period, except for foreign currency differences  arising  on  debts  designated  as  hedges  for  the  net  foreign currency  assets  of  consolidated  affiliates.  The  latter  are  recognised directly in shareholders' equity, under currency translation adjustments, until  the  disposal  of  the  net  investment.  Foreign  currency  differences related to operating activities are recognised within operating profit for the  period;  foreign  currency  differences  related  to  financing  activities are  recognised  within  financial  income  (expense)  or  in  shareholders' equity.\n\n## Translation of financial statements of affiliates whose 6.4 functional currency is different from the euro (the reporting currency)\n\nThe balance sheet is translated into euros at year-end exchange rates. The  income  statement  and  cash  flows  are  translated  on  the  basis  of average exchange rates. The differences resulting from the translation of  the  financial  statements  of  these  affiliates  are  recognised  in translation differences within shareholders' equity under other comprehensive  income.  On  disposal  of  a  foreign  entity,  currency translation  adjustments  previously  recognised  in  shareholders'  equity are recognised in profit and loss.\n\n## Assets held for sale and discontinued operations 7.\n\nIn  accordance  with  IFRS 5  (Non-current  assets  held  for  sale  and discontinued  operations),  where  they  are  significant,  assets  and liabilities  held  for  sale  are  no  longer  subject  to  depreciation  or amortisation.  They  are  shown  separately  in  the  balance  sheet  at  the lower  of  the  carrying  amount  or  the  fair  value  less  costs  to  sell. An asset is considered as being held for sale if its carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing  use.  In  order  for  this  to  be  the  case,  the  asset  must  be available for immediate sale and its sale must be highly probable. Items in the balance sheet related to discontinued operations and assets held for sale are presented under specific lines in the consolidated financial statements. Income statement items related to discontinued operations and  assets  held  for  sale  are  presented  separately  in  the  financial statements  for  all  periods  reported  upon  if  they  are  significant  from a Group perspective.\n\n## Significant events during the financial year Note 1.2\n\n## Impacts of the Covid-19 epidemic 1.\n\nThe  global  spread  of  Covid-19  at  the  beginning  of  2020  had  a  major impact on the Group's business in the second half of the financial year. Many countries have taken strict measures to try to slow the spread of the epidemic and have imposed the closure of establishments open to the  public  (including  bars,  hotels,  restaurants)  as  well  as  lockdown measures and restrictions on international travel (affecting Travel Retail activities in particular).\n\nIn  this  context,  net  sales  for  the  period  amounted  to  \u20ac8,448 million, down 8% compared with FY19. The efforts made by the Group as a whole in terms of advertising and promotional expenditure (down 12% compared with FY19) and structure costs (down 4% compared with FY19), helped to limit the impact of this crisis on Profit from Recurring Operations. The  latter amounted  to \u20ac2,260 million, down 12% compared with FY19.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs part of the management of this crisis, the Group has taken a number of strong measures:\n\n- priority given to the health and safety of its employees and partners; \u0097\n- active  inventory  management  to  maintain  a  healthy  level  in  main \u0097 markets, particularly China and the United States;\n- active  management  of  resources  and  cost  control  to  adapt  to  the \u0097 crisis;\n- dynamic  cash  management  and  a  strengthened  liquidity  position \u0097 thanks to several bond issues over the period (see Note 1.2.2.3 Bond issues  and  redemptions )  and  the  implementation  of  a  new  line  of credit, undrawn to date.\n\nDespite the crisis, the Group has continued to implement its Transform & Accelerate agenda, including the finalisation of the Reconquer project in  France  and  the  re-organisation  of  its  Wines  business  in  order  to improve its performance.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nDue  to  the  sudden  slowdown  in  activity  and  uncertainty  of  the medium-term outlook brought about by the global health crisis and its economic fallout, the Group has recorded an impairment on the carrying amount of its intangible assets (brands) in the amount of \u20ac999 million in other operating income and expenses, i.e. \u20ac768 million in net profit after tax.  This  impairment  loss  mainly  impacts  the  Absolut  brand  in  the amount of \u20ac912 million before tax (\u20ac702 million after tax) and does not call  into  question  the  strategy  or  operational  initiatives  relating  to  the brand  (see  Note  4.1  Intangible  assets  and  goodwill  -  Impairment  of tangible or intangible assets) .\n\nFurthermore, the Group  has  paid  particular attention to the recoverability of its trade receivables in view of the increased credit risk related to the crisis, with the measures implemented enabling optimised management of trade receivables.\n\n## Other significant events during the financial year 2.\n\n## Acquisitions and disposals 2.1\n\nDuring the first half of the year, the Group finalised several transactions with the aim of strengthening its portfolio of American whiskies through three successive acquisitions: the signing of the partnership with Rabbit Hole  Spirits  LLC,  owner  of  the  Rabbit  Hole  Bourbon  Whiskey  brand, the acquisition of Firestone & Robertson Distilling Co., owner of the TX Whiskey  brand,  and  lastly  the  successful  acquisition  of  the  American listed  company,  Castle  Brands  Inc.,  owner  of  the  Jefferson's  Bourbon brand  in  particular.  The  Group  also  carried  out  more  targeted acquisitions,  such as  the  signature  of  a  partnership  with  Laurenskirk (PTY)  Ltd.,  owner of  the  South  African  gin  brand  Inverroche,  the acquisition of 34% of the joint venture Seagram Myanmar Company Ltd, owner  of  the  High  Class  Whisky  brand,  and  the  acquisition  of  the Spanish company Bodeboca SL, owner of the Bodeboca digital platform.\n\nDuring the second half of the year, the Group continued the same strategy by strengthening its positions through partnerships/acquisitions of super  and  ultra-Premium  brands  in fast-growing categories, such as the agreements  signed  with The Kyoto Distillery,  owner  of  the  Japanese  gin  brand  KI  NO  BI, and Italicus  Ltd,  owner  of  the  Italian  aperitif  of  the  same  name. The Group also exercised its call option on the remaining share capital of  Black  Forest  Distillers  GmbH,  owner  of  the  successful  Monkey  47 brand.\n\nThese  acquisitions represent a total amount  of  approximately \u20ac600 million,  mainly  allocated  to  brands  for  \u20ac227 million  and  to goodwill for \u20ac199 million.\n\nFinally,  as  part  of  its  strategy  of  dynamic  management  of  its  brand portfolio, the Group also sold the Caf\u00e9 de Paris brand and the Cubzac production site to the cooperative InVivo.\n\n## Pension fund insurance 2.2\n\nThe  Trustee  of  the  largest  Pernod  Ricard  pension  fund  in  the  UK  has signed a contract with the insurer Rothesay Life to insure the majority of the  fund's  pension  liabilities  through  the  purchase  of  an  insurance policy, commonly known as 'buy-in'.\n\nThis  contract  reduces  the  Group's  exposure  to  a  potential  shortfall  in plan funding that could arise due to fluctuations in market parameters (primarily inflation and interest rates) and changes in longevity.\n\nThe buy-in transaction involves the transfer of \u20ac4,252 million of pension plan assets to the insurer Rothesay Life, with no impact on the Group's cash  flow.  As  a  result  of  this  transaction,  the  carrying  amount  of  the insurance policy fully covers the carrying amount of the insured pension liabilities, estimated at \u20ac3,350 million at the transaction date. The difference  of  \u20ac903 million  was  recognised  by  writing  down  the value  of  'Non-current  financial  assets'  with  the  corresponding recognition  of  shareholders'  equity  in  'Other  comprehensive  income', with no impact on profit or loss.\n\n## Bond issues and redemptions 2.3\n\nDuring the year, Pernod Ricard issued the following bonds:\n\n- \u20ac1.5 billion in three tranches of 4, 8 and 12 years on 24 October 2019, \u0097 bearing interest at the fixed annual rate of 0.00%, 0.50% and 0.875%, respectively;\n- \u20ac1.5 billion  in  two  tranches  of  5  and  10  years  on  1 April  2020, \u0097 bearing interest  at  the  fixed  annual  rate  of  1.125%  and  1.75%, respectively;\n- the Group carried out two tap issues for a total of \u20ac500 million on \u0097 27 April 2020:\n- \u20ac250 million,  bringing  the  total  amount  of  the  bond  maturing  in \u0097 April 2025 to \u20ac1 billion,\n- \u20ac250 million,  bringing  the  total  amount  of  the  bond  maturing  in \u0097 April 2030 to \u20ac1 billion.\n\nOn 23 March 2020, the Group early redeemed a bond with an original maturity  of  June 2020  in  the  amount  of  \u20ac850 million,  in  accordance with the bond's Terms and Conditions.\n\nOn 26 May 2020, the Group completed a \u20ac7 billion medium-term notes (MTN)  issuance  programme.  To  date,  no  drawdowns  have  been  made under this programme.\n\nOn 24 June  2020,  the  Group  early  redeemed  a  bond  with  an  original maturity  of  April 2021  in  the  amount  of  US$500 million,  in  accordance with the bond's Terms and Conditions.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It  is  measured  at  the  fair  value  of  the  consideration received  or  to  be  received,  after  deducting  trade  discounts, volume rebates, certain costs associated with business and promotional activity and sales-related taxes and duties, notably excise duties.\n\n## Costs of commercial and promotional activity\n\nPursuant to IFRS 15, certain costs of services rendered in connection with  sales,  such  as  advertising  programmes  in  conjunction  with distributors, listing costs for new products, promotional activities at point of sale, and advertising and promotional expenses, are deducted  directly  from  Net  sales  if  there  is  no  distinct  service whose fair value can be reliably measured.\n\n## Duties and taxes\n\nIn  accordance  with  IFRS 15,  certain  import  duties,  in  Asia  for instance,  are  classified  as  cost  of  sales,  as  these  duties  are  not specifically re-billed to customers (as is the case for social security stamps in France, for example).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Discounts\n\nIn  accordance  with  IFRS 15,  early  payment  discounts  are  not considered  to  be  financial  transactions,  but  rather  are  deducted directly from net sales.\n\n## Gross margin after logistics expenses, Contribution after advertising and promotion expenses, Profit from Recurring Operations and Other operating income and expenses\n\nThe  gross  margin  after  logistics  costs  corresponds  to  sales (excluding  duties  and  taxes),  less  costs  of  sales  and  logistics expenses. The  contribution after advertising and  promotion expenses  includes  the  gross  margin  after  deduction  of  logistics expenses  and  advertising  and  promotion  expenses.  The  Group applies  recommendation  2013-R03  of  the  French  accounting standards  authority  (Autorit\u00e9  des  normes  comptables  -  ANC), notably as regards the definition of Profit from recurring operations. Profit from recurring operations is the contribution after advertising and  promotion  expenses  less  trading  costs  and  overheads. This is the indicator used  internally  to  measure  the  Group's operational  performance.  It  excludes  other  operating  income  and expenses, such as those related to restructuring, capital gains and losses  on  disposals,  impairment  of  property,  plant  and  equipment and intangible assets, and other non-recurring operating income or expenses. These other operating income and expenses are excluded from  Profit  from  recurring  operations  because  the  Group  believes they  have  little  predictive  value  due  to  their  occasional  nature. They are  described  in  detail  in  Note 3.1  Other  operating  income and expenses .",

(1)\n\nThe increase in the effective tax rate is mainly due to the revaluation of deferred taxes following rate changes in the United Kingdom and India.\n\nDeferred tax is recognised on time differences between the tax and book  values  of  assets  and  liabilities  in  the  consolidated  balance sheet and is measured using the balance sheet approach. Deferred taxes  relating  to  right-of-use  assets  and  lease  liabilities  are recognised  on  a  net  basis.  The  effects  of  changes  in  tax  rates  are recognised in shareholders' equity or in profit and loss in the year in which  the  change  of  tax  rates  is  decided.  Deferred  tax  assets  are recognised in the balance sheet when it is more likely than not that they  will  be  recovered  in  future  years.  Deferred  tax  assets  and liabilities  are  not  discounted  to  present  value.  In  order  to  evaluate the  Group's  ability  to  recover  these  assets,  particular  account  is taken of forecasts of future taxable profits.\n\nDeferred  tax  assets  relating  to  tax  loss  carryforwards  are  only reported when they are likely to be recovered, based on projections of  taxable  income  calculated  by  the  Group  at  the  end  of  each financial year. All assumptions  used,  including,  in  particular, growth in operating profit and financial income (expenses), taking into account interest rates, are reviewed by the Group at the end of the financial year based on data determined by the relevant senior management.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Weighted average cost of debt\n\nThe  Group's  weighted  average  cost  of  debt  was  3.6%  over  FY20 compared  to  3.9%  over  FY19.  This  weighted  average  cost  for  FY20 includes  the  cost  of  lease  liabilities  recognised  under  IFRS 16.  Given that the impacts of this standard are relatively minor, as described in Note 1.1.2.1, its implementation has no significant impact on the Group's weighted average cost of debt.\n\nWeighted average cost of debt is defined as net financing costs plus structuring and placement fees as a proportion of average net financial debt  outstanding  plus  the  average  amount  outstanding  on  factoring and securitisation programmes.",

When  funds  are  obtained  at  the  date  of  exercise  of  the  dilutive instruments, the 'treasury stock' method is used to determine the theoretical number of shares to be taken into account. When funds are obtained at the issue date of the dilutive instruments, net profit is adjusted for the finance cost, net of tax, relating to these instruments.\n\n## Group net profit and net earnings per share from continuing operations\n\n| Numerator  (\u20ac million)                                    | 30.06.2019   | 30.06.2020   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Group net profit                                          | 1,455        | 329          |\n| Denominator  (in number of shares)                        |              |              |\n| Average number of outstanding shares                      | 264,173,497  | 262,858,086  |\n| Dilutive effect of bonus share allocations                | 1,043,157    | 1,063,687    |\n| Dilutive effect of stock options and subscription options | 202,895      | 115,058      |\n| Average number of outstanding shares-diluted              | 265,419,549  | 264,036,831  |\n| Earnings per share  (\u20ac)                                   |              |              |\n| Earnings per share - basic                                | 5.51         | 1.25         |\n| Earnings per share - diluted                              | 5.48         | 1.24         |\n| Earnings per share from continuing operations - basic     | 5.51         | 1.26         |\n| Earnings per share from continuing operations - diluted   | 5.48         | 1.26         |\n\n## Expenses by type Note 3.5\n\nOperating profit notably includes depreciation, amortisation and impairment expenses as well as personnel expenses as follows:\n\n| \u20ac million                                                                                                  | 30.06.2019   | 30.06.2020   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Depreciation, amortisation and impairment expense on property, plant and equipment and  intangible assets* | (293)        | (1,314)      |\n| Salaries and payroll costs                                                                                 | (1,286)      | (1,317)      |\n| Pensions, medical expenses and other similar benefits under defined benefit plans                          | (43)         | (46)         |\n| Expense related to share-based payments                                                                    | (40)         | (22)         |\n| TOTAL PERSONNEL EXPENSES                                                                                   | (1,369)      | (1,385)      |\n\nOperating  profit  also  includes  \u20ac5.1 million  in  lease  expenses  relating  to  short-term  leases,  \u20ac1.9 million  relating  to  leases  of  low-value  assets and \u20ac2.7 million relating to variable leases.\n\n<!-- image -->",

With the exception of assets with indefinite useful lives, they are amortised on a straight-line basis over their period of use, which is generally less than five years, and are written down when their recoverable amount is less than their net carrying amount. Amortisation of intangible assets is recognised within operating profit in the income statement.\n\nIn the context of the Group's activities, and in accordance with IAS 38 (Intangible assets), research and development costs are recognised as expenses in the financial year during which they are incurred, except for certain development costs which meet the capitalisation criteria described by the standard.\n\n## Movements in the year\n\n| \u20ac million               | 30.06.2018   | Acquisitions   | Allowances   | Disposals   | Translation adjustments   | Other movements   | 30.06.2019   |\n|-------------------------|--------------|----------------|--------------|-------------|---------------------------|-------------------|--------------|\n| Goodwill                | 5,456        | 8              | -            | (4)         | 71                        | (3)               | 5,528        |\n| Brands                  | 12,757       | 62             | -            | (34)        | 169                       | 3                 | 12,957       |\n| Other intangible assets | 407          | 42             | -            | (8)         | 3                         | 8                 | 452          |\n| GROSS VALUE             | 18,620       | 112            | -            | (45)        | 243                       | 8                 | 18,937       |\n| Goodwill                | (137)        | -              | -            | -           | 0                         | 0                 | (137)        |\n| Brands                  | (1,334)      | -              | (65)         | 15          | (24)                      | -                 | (1,408)      |\n| Other intangible assets | (291)        | -              | (30)         | 6           | (2)                       | (1)               | (318)        |\n| AMORTISATION/IMPAIRMENT | (1,762)      | -              | (95)         | 21          | (26)                      | (1)               | (1,863)      |\n| INTANGIBLE ASSETS, NET  | 16,858       | 112            | (95)         | (25)        | 217                       | 7                 | 17,074       |\n\n|                         | Movements in the year   | Movements in the year   | Movements in the year   | Movements in the year   | Movements in the year   | Movements in the year   | Movements in the year   |\n|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| \u20ac million               | 30.06.2019              | Acquisitions            | Allowances              | Disposals               | Translation adjustments | Other movements         | 30.06.2020              |\n| Goodwill                | 5,528                   | 199                     | -                       | (1)                     | 21                      | 0                       | 5,747                   |\n| Brands                  | 12,957                  | 227                     | -                       | 0                       | 47                      | 0                       | 13,230                  |\n| Other intangible assets | 452                     | 41                      | -                       | (20)                    | (7)                     | 5                       | 471                     |\n| GROSS VALUE             | 18,937                  | 467                     | -                       | (21)                    | 60                      | 5                       | 19,448                  |\n| Goodwill                | (137)                   | -                       | -                       | -                       | 1                       | 0                       | (136)                   |\n| Brands                  | (1,408)                 | -                       | (999)                   | 0                       | 9                       | 0                       | (2,398)                 |\n| Other intangible assets | (318)                   | -                       | (34)                    | 10                      | 6                       | (1)                     | (338)                   |\n| AMORTISATION/IMPAIRMENT | (1,863)                 | -                       | (1,033)                 | 10                      | 16                      | (1)                     | (2,872)                 |\n| INTANGIBLE ASSETS, NET  | 17,074                  | 467                     | (1,033)                 | (11)                    | 76                      | 4                       | 16,576                  |\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill is subject to an impairment test at least once a year and whenever there is an indication that its value may have been impaired. To perform these tests, goodwill is allocated by geographical area on the basis of asset groupings at the date of each business combination. These asset groupings correspond to groups of assets which jointly generate identifiable cash flows that are largely independent. If impairment is identified, an impairment loss is recognised in profit and loss for the financial year.\n\nGoodwill mainly stems from the acquisitions of Allied Domecq in July 2005 and Vin&Sprit in July 2008. The increase in the value of goodwill for the period was mainly due to the acquisitions mentioned in Note 1.2.1 Significant events during the financial year - Acquisitions and disposals , as well as currency fluctuations.\n\n<!-- image -->",

As  the  Group's  brands  are  intangible  assets  with indefinite useful lives, they are not amortised but are rather subject\n\nThe  main  brands  recorded  on  the  balance  sheet  are:  Absolut, Ballantine's,  Beefeater,  Chivas  Regal,  Kahl\u00faa,  Malibu,  Martell  and Brancott  Estate.  Most  of  these  were  recognised  at  the  time  of  the acquisitions of Seagram, Allied Domecq and Vin&Sprit. The increase in\n\nthe  gross  value  of  brands  for  the  period  was  mainly  due  to  the acquisitions  mentioned  in  Note 1.2.1  Significant  events  during  the financial  year  -  Acquisitions  and  disposals , as  well  as  currency fluctuations.\n\n## Impairment of tangible or intangible assets\n\nIn accordance with IAS 36, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment  are  subject  to  impairment  tests  whenever  there  is  an indication that the value of the asset has been impaired and at least once  a  year  for  non-current  assets  with  indefinite  useful  lives (goodwill and brands).\n\nThe  assets  subject  to  impairment  tests  are  included  in  cash generating  units  (CGUs),  corresponding  to  linked  groups  of  assets which  generate  identifiable  cash  flows.  The  CGUs  include  assets related to the Group's brands and are allocated in accordance with the three geographical areas defined by the Group, on the basis of the  sale  destination  of  the  products.  It  should  be  noted  that, as part of the first-time application of IFRS 16 during FY20, the simplified  method  of  including  the  net  value  of  right-of-use assets and lease liabilities in the various CGUs was adopted.\n\nWhen the recoverable amount of a CGU is less than its net carrying amount,  an  impairment  loss  is  recognised  within  operating  profit. The recoverable amount of the CGU is the higher of its market value and its value in use.\n\nValue  in  use  is  measured  based  on  cash  flows  projected  over  a 19-year  period.  This  period  reflects  the  typically  long  lives  of  the Group's  brands  and  their  productive  assets.  Discounted  projected cash flows are established based on annual budgets and multi-year strategies, extrapolated into subsequent  years  by  gradually\n\nImpairment tests for FY20 were carried out in the context of Covid-19. In this exceptional context of high uncertainty and volatility, the Group has had to adjust the approach used for the valuation of its brands and goodwill, adopting the 'weighted multi-scenario' approach in line with the recommendations of regulators.\n\nThese  different  scenarios,  based  on  business  plans  reviewed  by Management, represent a panel covering the various ways in which the pandemic and its consequences could unfold in the coming months and years, as described by economists and international financial organisations.  Probabilities  have  been  assigned  to  the  scenarios. These estimates were made on the basis of the most recent information available and taking into account the uncertainties associated with the situation.  A  combination  of  the  following  factors  has  been  taken  into account in each impairment model:\n\nconverging the figure for the last year of the plan for each brand and market towards a perpetual growth rate. The calculation includes a terminal  value  derived  by  capitalising  the  cash  flows  generated  in the last forecast year. Assumptions applied to sales and advertising and promotional expenditure are determined by Management based on  previous  results  and  long-term  development  trends  in  the markets concerned. The cash flow projection methodology takes into account,  with  respect  to  Working  Capital  Requirements  and investments,  the  specific  features  of  white  spirits  and  maturing alcohols. The present values of discounted cash flows are sensitive to these assumptions, as well as to consumer trends and economic factors.\n\nMarket value is based either on the sale price, net of selling costs, obtained  under  normal  market  conditions  or  earnings  multiples observed  in  recent  transactions  concerning  comparable  assets. The discount  rate  used  for  these  calculations  is  an  after-tax  rate applied  to  after-tax  cash  flows  and  corresponds  to  the  weighted average  cost  of  capital.  This  rate  reflects  specific  rates  for  each market  or  region,  depending  on  the  risks  that  they  represent. Assumptions  made  in  terms  of  future  changes  in  net  sales  and  in terms of terminal values are reasonable and consistent with market data available for each of the CGUs. Additional impairment tests are applied  where  events  or  specific  circumstances  suggest  that  a potential impairment exists.\n\n- the extent and expected duration of the economic crisis; \u0097\n- the  weight  of  the  On-trade  and  Off-trade  distribution  channels  in \u0097 each key market;\n- the increase in the market risk premium in the discount rates used for \u0097 the calculations, reflecting the unprecedented context of uncertainty and volatility triggered by the Covid-19 crisis.\n\nThis approach has not indicated any need for impairment of the Group's goodwill. The impairment losses required for the Group's brands amount to  \u20ac999 million,  of  which  \u20ac912 million  relates  to  the  Absolut  brand. These impairment losses were recognised during the period (see Note 1.2.1 Significant events - Impacts of the Covid-19 epidemic ).\n\n- the  future  development  of  the  health  crisis,  including  the  duration, \u0097 extent  and  geographical  scope  of  the  closures  of  establishments selling our products;\n\nto an impairment test at least once a year or whenever there is an indication that their value may have been impaired. Brands acquired as  a  part  of  acquisitions  of  foreign  entities  are  denominated  in  the functional currency of the business acquired.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Depreciation  is  calculated  on  a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets. Useful life is reviewed on a regular basis. The average depreciable lives for the major categories of property, plant and equipment are as follows:\n\n| Buildings                           | 15 to 50 years   |\n|-------------------------------------|------------------|\n| Machinery and equipment             | 5 to 15 years    |\n| Other property, plant and equipment | 3 to 5 years     |\n| Vines                               | 25 to 33 years   |\n\nDepreciation of property, plant and equipment is recognised within operating profit in the income statement.\n\nIn accordance with the amendments to standards IAS 41 and IAS 16, vines  are,  since  1 July  2016,  valued  at  acquisition  cost  and depreciated  over  their  useful  life.  In  accordance  with  IAS 41, agricultural  produce  (harvests)  continues  to  be  recognised  at  fair value on the balance sheet, after deducting estimated selling costs,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe other sensitivities presented above would not result in the need for goodwill impairment.\n\nas  from  the  date  at  which  it  is  possible  to  obtain  a  reliable assessment  of  price,  for  example  by  referring  to  an  active  market. Changes  in  fair  value  are  recognised  in  profit  and  loss.  Land  on which biological assets are planted is measured in accordance with IAS 16.\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 16, applicable from 1 July 2019, right-of-use assets for leases are recognised as property, plant and equipment in the  class  of  underlying  asset  to  which  the  right  of  use  relates, with the corresponding recognition of a lease liability. These are mainly offices occupied by the Group and recorded under Buildings. The value of right-of-use assets is determined on the basis of  the  amount  of  the  lease  liability,  adjusted  for  the  amount  of prepaid rent, initial direct costs, benefits received from lessors and, where applicable, remediation costs. Right-of-use assets relating to leases  are  depreciated  over  the  term  of  the  lease.  The  accounting principles for determining the lease liability are detailed in Note 4.8 Financial liabilities .\n\nItems  of  property,  plant  and  equipment,  including  right-of-use assets, are written down when their recoverable amount falls below their net carrying amount.",

Fair value results and the disposal gain or loss  are  recorded,  in  accordance  with  the  management  intention, either  (i)  in  the  income  statement  under  the  heading  'Financial income/Financial  expenses  -  other  non-recurring  financial  items'\n\nor (ii) in  consolidated  shareholders'  equity  under  the  heading 'Other comprehensive income' and are not recycled through profit or loss. Fair value is determined on the basis of the financial criteria most  appropriate  to  the  specific  situation  of  each  company. The fair value of financial assets listed on a financial market is their stock  market  value.  The  valuation  criteria  generally  used  for  other non-consolidated  investments  are  share  of  equity  and  future profitability.\n\n## Loans, guarantees and deposits\n\nLoans, guarantees and deposits are valued at amortised cost.\n\n|                                        | 30.06.2019   | 30.06.2019   | 30.06.2020   | 30.06.2020   |\n|----------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n| \u20ac million                              | Current      | Non-current  | Current      | Non-current  |\n| Net financial assets                   |              |              |              |              |\n| Equity instruments                     | -            | 194          | -            | 93           |\n| Other financial assets                 | -            | 1,096        | -            | 273          |\n| Net loans and receivables              |              |              |              |              |\n| Loans, receivables and deposits*       | -            | 129          | -            | 156          |\n| Total net non-current financial assets | -            | 1,419        | -            | 522          |\n| Derivative instruments                 | 6            | 20           | 12           | 54           |\n| FINANCIAL ASSETS                       | 6            | 1,438        | 12           | 576          |\n\n- Following  the  application  of  IFRS 16  from  1 July  2019  (see  Note 1.1.2.1),  the  category  'Loans,  receivables  and  deposits'  includes  receivables  relating  to  subleases  for * \u20ac14 million at 30 June 2020.\n\nThe table below shows the movements of financial assets, excluding derivative instruments:\n\nMovements in the year\n\n| \u20ac million                                                            | 30.06.2018   | Acquisitions   | Allowances   | Disposals   | Translation adjustments   | Other movements   | 30.06.2019   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|----------------|--------------|-------------|---------------------------|-------------------|--------------|\n| Other financial assets                                               | 765          | 0              | 0            | -           | (18)                      | 349               | 1,097        |\n| Available-for-sale financial assets*                                 | 19           | -              | 0            | -           | 0                         | (19)              | 0            |\n| Equity instruments                                                   | N/A          | 110            | -            | (2)         | 0                         | 94                | 202          |\n| Investment-related receivables                                       | 159          | 14             | -            | (9)         | 4                         | 23                | 191          |\n| GROSS VALUES                                                         | 943          | 124            | 0            | (11)        | (14)                      | 447               | 1,489        |\n| Provisions for other financial assets                                | (2)          | -              | 0            | -           | 0                         | 2                 | 0            |\n| Impairment losses recognised on available- for-sale financial assets | (6)          | -              | -            | -           | 0                         | 6                 | -            |\n| Provisions for equity instruments                                    | N/A          | -              | -            | 0           | 0                         | (7)               | (7)          |\n| Impairment losses recognised on investment- related receivables      | (49)         | -              | -            | -           | (1)                       | (11)              | (62)         |\n| IMPAIRMENT                                                           | (57)         | -              | 0            | 0           | (1)                       | (11)              | (70)         |\n| NON-CURRENT FINANCIAL ASSETS, NET                                    | 886          | 124            | 0            | (11)        | (15)                      | 436               | 1,419        |\n\n- During  FY19,  and  following  the  application  of  IFRS  9,  the  category  'Available-for-sale  financial  assets'  disappeared  as  at  1  July  2018  and  a  new  category * 'Equity instruments' was created.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This  decline  is  mainly  explained  by  a  decrease  of \u20ac903  million  in  net  assets  relating  to  a  pension  plan  in  the  United Kingdom that was the subject of a buy-in (see Note 4.7 Provisions ).\n\nAt 30 June 2020, equity instruments consisted mainly of unconsolidated  securities  held  by  the  Group  and  in  particular, those of Jumia Technologies AG, measured at fair value through OCI in the amount of \u20ac31 million based on the closing share price of \u20ac4.90 on 30 June 2020 (compared with \u20ac23.33 per share on 30 June 2019).\n\n## Inventories and work in progress Note 4.4\n\nInventories  are  measured  at  the  lower  of  either  their  cost (acquisition cost and  cost  of  production,  including  indirect production  overheads)  or  their  net  realisable  value.  Net  realisable value is the selling price less the estimated costs of completion and sale of inventories. Most inventories are valued using the weighted average cost method. The cost of long-cycle inventories\n\nis computed  using  a  single  method  which  includes  distilling  and ageing  costs.  These  inventories  are  classified  in  current  assets, although a substantial part remains in inventory for more than one year in order to undergo the ageing process used for certain wines & spirits before being sold.\n\nThe breakdown of inventories and work in progress at the balance sheet date is as follows:\n\n## Movements in the year\n\n| \u20ac million          | 30.06.2018   | Change in gross values   | Change in impairment   | Translation adjustments   | Other movements   | 30.06.2019   |\n|--------------------|--------------|--------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------|--------------|\n| Raw materials      | 136          | 2                        | -                      | 0                         | 2                 | 140          |\n| Work-in-progress   | 4,614        | 269                      | -                      | (15)                      | 9                 | 4,877        |\n| Goods in inventory | 467          | 38                       | -                      | 2                         | (2)               | 505          |\n| Finished products  | 300          | (23)                     | -                      | 0                         | 3                 | 280          |\n| GROSS VALUE        | 5,517        | 286                      | -                      | (13)                      | 11                | 5,802        |\n| Raw materials      | (9)          | -                        | (1)                    | 0                         | -                 | (10)         |\n| Work-in-progress   | (11)         | -                        | 1                      | 0                         | -                 | (10)         |\n| Goods in inventory | (13)         | -                        | 0                      | 0                         | 0                 | (13)         |\n| Finished products  | (13)         | -                        | 0                      | 0                         | 0                 | (13)         |\n| IMPAIRMENT         | (45)         | -                        | (1)                    | 0                         | 0                 | (46)         |\n| NET INVENTORIES    | 5,472        | 286                      | (1)                    | (13)                      | 11                | 5,756        |\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Group is not significantly dependent on its suppliers.\n\n## Trade receivables and other operating receivables Note 4.5\n\nTrade receivables and other current receivables are recognised initially at their fair value, which usually corresponds to their nominal value. Provisions for impairment are recognised in line with the losses expected over the life of the receivable.\n\nThe following tables break down trade receivables and other operating receivables as of 30 June 2019 and 30 June 2020 by due date:\n\nDue in respect of the following terms\n\n|                                                                     |                 |         | Net       | Net           | Net            | Net             | Net        |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|---------|-----------|---------------|----------------|-----------------|------------|\n| \u20ac million                                                           | carrying amount | Not due | < 30 days | 31 to 90 days | 91 to 180 days | 181 to 360 days | > 360 days |\n| Net carrying amounts                                                |                 |         |           |               |                |                 |            |\n| Trade receivables and other operating receivables  as of 30.06.2019 | 1,226           | 985     | 122       | 47            | 23             | 14              | 36         |\n| o /w impairment                                                     | ( 67)           | ( 13)   | ( 1)      | ( 4)          | ( 2)           | ( 2)            | ( 43)      |\n| Trade receivables and other operating receivables  as of 30.06.2020 | 906             | 675     | 62        | 79            | 52             | 24              | 14         |\n| o /w impairment                                                     | ( 91)           | ( 15)   | 0         | ( 3)          | ( 8)           | ( 11)           | ( 55)      |\n\nChanges in the impairment of trade receivables and other operating receivables were as follows:\n\n| \u20ac million                         | FY19   | FY20   |\n|-----------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| At 1 July                         | 60     | 67     |\n| Allowances during the year        | 12     | 37     |\n| Reversals during the year         | (3)    | 3      |\n| Used during the year              | (2)    | 4      |\n| Foreign currency gains and losses | 0      | (5)    |\n| At 30 June                        | 67     | 105    |\n\nAt  30 June  2020,  there  was  no  reason  to  question  the  creditworthiness  of  non-impaired  past  due  receivables.  More  specifically, non-impaired receivables with due dates of over 12 months show no additional credit-related risk. There is no significant concentration of risks.\n\nThe  change  in  impairment  of  trade  and  other  operating  receivables  during  FY20  is  notably  linked  to  a  reassessment  of  the  recoverability of receivables in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In the case where a potential obligation resulting from past events exists, but where the occurrence of the outflow of resources is  not  probable  or  where  the  amount  cannot be reliably estimated, a contingent liability  is  disclosed  among  the  Group's  commitments. The  amounts  provided  for  are  measured  by  taking  account  of  the most probable assumptions or using statistical methods, depending on the nature of the obligations. Provisions notably include:\n\n- provisions for restructuring; \u0097\n- provisions for pensions and other long-term employee benefits; \u0097\n- provisions for litigation (tax other than corporate income tax, legal, \u0097 employee-related).\n\nLitigation  is  kept  under  regular  review,  on  a  case-by-case  basis, by the Legal Department of each affiliate or region or by the Group's Legal Department, drawing on the help of external legal consultants in  the  most  significant  or  complex  cases.  A  provision  is  recorded when  it  becomes  probable  that  a  present  obligation  arising  from a past event will require an outflow of resources whose amount can be  reliably  estimated.  The  amount  of  the  provision  is  the  best estimate  of  the  outflow  of  resources  required  to  settle  this obligation.\n\nThe  cost  of  restructuring  measures  is  fully  provisioned  in  the financial year, and  is recognised  in  profit and  loss  under 'Other operating  income  and  expenses'  when  it  is  material  and results  from  a  Group  obligation  to  third  parties  arising  from  a decision  made  by  the  competent  corporate  body  that  has  been announced to the third parties concerned before the closing date. This  cost  mainly  involves  redundancy  payments,  early  retirement payments,  costs  of  notice  periods  not  served,  training  costs  of departing  individuals  and  costs  of  site  closure.  Scrapping  of property, plant and equipment, impairment of inventories and other assets,  as  well  as  other  costs  (moving  costs,  training  of  transferred individuals,  etc.)  directly  related  to  the  restructuring  measures  are also  recognised  in  restructuring  costs.  The  amounts  provided  for correspond to forecast future payments to be made in connection with  restructuring  plans,  discounted  to  present  value  when  the payment schedule is such that the effect of the time value of money is significant.\n\n<!-- image -->",

They  are  also  subject  to  tax  audits,  some  of  which may  lead  to  tax  reassessment.  The  main  disputes  are  described  in Note 6.5 Disputes .\n\nAt 30 June 2020, the provisions recorded by the Group for all litigation and  risks  in  which  it  is  involved  amounted  to  \u20ac431 million,  excluding uncertain tax positions recognised in current tax liabilities. The Group does not provide details (with exceptions), as it believes the disclosure  of  the  amount  of  any  provision  booked  in  consideration  of each  pending  dispute  would  be  likely  to  cause  serious  harm  to  the Group.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe  change  in  'Other  current  and  non-current  provisions'  during  the period is explained as follows:\n\n- allowances  stem  mainly  from  proceedings  brought  against  the \u0097 Company and its affiliates, as part of the normal course of business and the emergence of new risks, including tax risks (other than corporate income tax risks);\n- reversals are made at the time of corresponding payments or where \u0097 the  risk  is  considered  to  be  nil.  Unused  reversals  primarily  concern the  re-evaluation  or  the  statute  of  limitation  of  certain  risks, including tax risks.",

As the  Group  is  not  committed  beyond  the  amount  of  such contributions,  no  provision  is  recognised  in  respect  of  defined contribution plans.\n\n## Defined benefit plans\n\nFor defined benefit plans, the projected unit credit method is used to  measure  the  present  value  of  defined  benefit  obligations, current service cost and, if applicable, past service cost. The measurement  is  made  at  each  closing  date  and  the  personal data  concerning  employees  is  revised  at  least  every  three  years. The calculation requires the use of economic assumptions (inflation rate  and  discount  rate)  and  assumptions  concerning employees  (mainly average  salary  increase,  rate  of  employee turnover  and  life  expectancy).  The  assumptions  used  in  FY19  and FY20 and the methods used for their  determination  are  described below.\n\nA  provision  is  recorded  in  the  balance  sheet  for  the  difference between the actuarial debt of related obligations (actuarial liabilities)  and  any  assets  dedicated to funding the plans, measured  at  their  fair  value,  and  includes  past  service  costs  and actuarial gains and losses.\n\nThe Group provides employee benefits such as pensions and retirement bonuses and other post-employment benefits, such as medical care and life insurance:\n\n- in  France,  benefit  obligations  mainly  comprise  arrangements  for \u0097 retirement  indemnities  (non-funded)  and  supplementary  pension benefits (partly funded);\n- in the United States and Canada, benefit obligations include funded \u0097 pension  plans  guaranteed  to  employees  as  well  as  unfunded post-employment medical plans;\n- in Ireland,  the  United  Kingdom  and  the  Netherlands,  benefit \u0097 obligations mainly consist of pension plans granted to employees.\n\nDefined  benefit  plans  in  the  Group  relate  mainly  to  affiliates  in  the United  Kingdom,  in  North  America  and  in  the  rest  of  Europe. Defined benefit plans are subject to an annual actuarial valuation on the basis  of  assumptions  depending  on  the  country.  Under  these  pension and  other  benefit  plan  agreements,  employees  receive  at  the  date  of retirement  either  a  capital  lump  sum  payment  or  an  annuity. These amounts  depend  on  the  number  of  years  of  employment, final salary  and  the  position  held  by  the  employee.  At  30 June  2020, fully or partly funded benefit obligations totalled \u20ac5,335 million, equivalent to 96% of the total benefit obligations.\n\nThe cost of defined benefit plans has three components, which are accounted for as follows:\n\n- the cost of services is recognised in operating profit. It includes: \u0097\n- the cost of services rendered during the period, \u0097\n- the  cost  of  past  services  resulting  from  the  modification  or \u0097 reduction of  a  plan,  fully  recognised  in  profit  and  loss  for  the period in which the services were performed,\n- gains and losses resulting from liquidations; \u0097\n- the financial component, recorded in financial income (expenses), \u0097 comprises  the  impact  of  discounting  the  liabilities,  net  of  the expected  return  on  plan  assets,  measured  using  the  same discount rate as that used to measure the liabilities;\n- revaluations of liabilities (assets) are recognised as non-recyclable \u0097 items  of  comprehensive  income,  and  consist  mainly  of  actuarial differences, namely the change in plan obligations and assets due to  changes  in  assumptions  and  to  experience  gains  or  losses, the latter  representing  the  difference  between  the  expected impact  of  some  actuarial  assumptions  applied  to  previous valuations and the actual impact. Depending on the nature of the texts governing the plans in certain zones, if the hedging assets exceed the commitments entered into the accounts, any assets generated  may  be  limited  to  the  present  value  of  the  future reimbursements and the expected decreases in future contributions.\n\nCertain  affiliates,  mainly  those  located  in  North  America,  also  provide their  employees  with  post-employment  medical  cover.  These  benefit obligations  are  unfunded.  They  are  measured  using  the  same assumptions as those used for the pension obligations in the countries in question.\n\nSeveral  affiliates,  mainly  in  Europe,  also  provide  their  employees  with other long-term benefits. Benefit obligations of this type are mainly in respect of long-service awards and jubilee awards.\n\n<!-- image -->",

As  a  result  of  this  transaction,  the  carrying  amount  of  the insurance policy fully covers the carrying amount of the insured pension liabilities, estimated at \u20ac3,350 million at the transaction date. The difference  of  \u20ac903 million  was  recognised  by  writing  down  the value  of  'Non-current  financial  assets'  with  the  corresponding recognition  of  shareholders'  equity  in  'Other  comprehensive  income', with no impact on profit or loss.\n\nThe net expense recognised in the income statement in respect of pensions and other long-term employee benefits is broken down as follows:\n\n|                                                            | 30.06.2019          | 30.06.2019                                   | 30.06.2019   | 30.06.2020          | 30.06.2020                                   | 30.06.2020   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------|\n| Expense for the period \u20ac million                           | Pension commitments | Medical expenses and other employee benefits | Total        | Pension commitments | Medical expenses and other employee benefits | Total        |\n| Service cost                                               | 40                  | 3                                            | 43           | 42                  | 3                                            | 46           |\n| Interest on provision                                      | (12)                | 5                                            | (7)          | (17)                | 4                                            | (13)         |\n| o/w interest on the commitment \u0097                                                            | 139                 | 5                                            | 144          | 118                 | 4                                            | 122          |\n| o/w interest on the assets \u0097                                                            | (151)               | -                                            | (151)        | (136)               | -                                            | (136)        |\n| o/w interest on the limitation of the assets \u0097                                                            | 0                   | -                                            | 0            | 0                   | -                                            | 0            |\n| Fees/levies/premiums                                       | 10                  | -                                            | 10           | 11                  | -                                            | 11           |\n| Impact of plan amendments/reduction of future rights       | 34                  | 0                                            | 33           | (11)                | (5)                                          | (16)         |\n| Impact of liquidation of benefits                          | -                   | -                                            | -            | 0                   | -                                            | 0            |\n| Actuarial (gains)/losses                                   | -                   | 1                                            | 1            | -                   | 3                                            | 3            |\n| Effect of asset ceiling (including the impact of IFRIC 14) | -                   | -                                            | -            | -                   | -                                            | -            |\n| NET EXPENSE/(INCOME) RECOGNISED IN PROFIT  AND LOSS        | 72                  | 8                                            | 80           | 26                  | 5                                            | 30           |\n\n<!-- image -->",

IAS 32 has been applied since 1 July 2004. IFRS 7 has been applied since 1 July 2007. The amendment approved by the European Union on 22 November 2011 has been applied from 1 July 2011.\n\nBorrowings and other financial liabilities are recognised, on the basis of  their  effective  interest  rates,  in  accordance  with  the  amortised cost  method.  The  effective  interest  rate  includes  all  costs, commissions  and  fees  payable  under  the  contract  between  the parties. Under this method, costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the financial liability are recognised in profit and loss on the basis of the effective interest rate.\n\n## IFRS 16 (Leases)\n\nThe Group assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys, at inception, the right to control the use of an  identified  asset  for  a  set  period  of  time  in  exchange  for consideration.\n\nThe lease liability is initially calculated at the present value of the future  lease  payments.  The  discount  rates  are  based  on  the Group's  borrowing  rate  plus  a  spread  to  take  into  account country-specific  economic  environments.  They  are  estimated  in each currency using available market data, depending on the term of  the  lease.  Lease payments  may  include  fixed  or  variable payments  that  depend  on  a  rate  or  index  known  at  the commencement date of the lease.\n\nThe period used to calculate the lease liability corresponds to the non-cancellable  term  of  the  contract,  unless  it  is  reasonably certain that the Group will exercise a renewal option beyond this period. The probability of exercising an option is determined on a lease-by-lease basis, taking into account Management's intentions. This liability is then calculated at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn  accordance with IAS 7 (Statement of cash flows), cash and cash equivalents presented in assets and liabilities in the balance sheet and shown in the consolidated cash flow statements include items that are immediately available as cash or are readily convertible into a  known  amount of  cash  and  which  are  subject  to  an  insignificant risk of change in their value. Cash is composed of cash at bank and on  hand,  short-term  deposits  with  an  initial  maturity  of  less  than three months and money market mutual funds that are subject to an insignificant  risk  of  change  in  their  value.  Cash  equivalents  are short-term  investments  with  a  maturity  of  less  than  three  months. Bank overdrafts, which are considered to be equivalent to financing, are excluded from cash and cash equivalents.\n\nLeases are recognised in the balance sheet from the commencement date. They are presented in 'lease liabilities' with a corresponding  entry  in  'property,  plant  and  equipment', depending on  the  nature  of  the  underlying  asset  (see  Note 4.1  Property,  plant  and  equipment ). Lease  liabilities  comprise  a current  and  non-current  portion  on  the  basis  of  the  expected future payments.\n\nIn the income statement, depreciation expenses are recognised on the basis of the use of the underlying asset and interest expenses are presented in financial income/(expense).\n\nIn  the  cash  flow  statement,  repayments  of  lease  liabilities  are reported  under  'lease  repayments'  in  cash  flow  from  financing activities,  while  interest  payments  are  reported  under  'interest paid' in cash flow from operating activities.\n\nThe  Group  has  chosen  not  to  apply  IFRS 16  to  leases corresponding to assets with a low unit replacement value or to short-term  leases.  These  leases  are  recognised  directly  in expenses.",

The  measurement  is  based  on  historical  data (rating of counterparty banks and probability of default). At 30 June 2020, the impact was not significant.\n\n## Risk management 2.\n\nManagement  and  monitoring  of  financial  risks  is  performed  by  the Financing  and  Treasury  Department.  Reporting  to  the  Group  Finance Department,  it  oversees  all  financial  exposures  and  processes  or validates all financing, investment and hedging transactions, as part of a programme approved by General Management.\n\nAll financial  instruments  used  hedge  existing  or  forecast  hedge transactions or investments. They are contracted with a limited number of counterparties that have a first-class rating.\n\n## Management of liquidity risk\n\nThe exceptional measures taken as part of the response to the Covid-19 virus  will  have  a  significant  impact  on  the  Group's  earnings  and  cash flow.  Pernod  Ricard  has  taken  all  precautionary  measures  to  ensure sufficient liquidity to meet its needs.\n\nAt  30 June  2020,  the  Group's  cash  and  cash  equivalents  totalled \u20ac1,935 million (compared with \u20ac923 million at 30 June 2019). An additional \u20ac3,360 million of renewable medium-term credit facilities with  banks  was  confirmed  and  undrawn.  Group  funding  is  provided  in the  form  of  long-term  debt  (bank  loans,  bonds,  etc.)  and short-term financing  (commercial  paper  and  bank  overdrafts)  as well  as  factoring and  securitisation,  which  provide  adequate  financial  resources  to ensure the continuity of its business. The Group also set up a \u20ac7 billion EMTN (Euro Medium Term Note) programme in May 2020. The Group's short-term financial debt after hedging was \u20ac1,100 million at 30 June 2020 (compared to \u20ac1,121 million at 30 June 2019).\n\nWhile  the  Group  has  not  identified  any  other  significant  cash requirement,  it  cannot  be  fully  guaranteed  that  it  will  be  able  to continue  to  access  the  funding  and  refinancing  needed  for  its day-to-day operations and investments on satisfactory terms, given the uncertain economic context.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Breaches of these covenants or financial ratio could force the Group to make accelerated payments. At 30 June 2020, the Group was in compliance with the covenants under the terms of its syndicated loan,  with  a  solvency  ratio  (total  Net  debt  converted  at  the  average rate/consolidated EBITDA) of 5.25 or less.\n\nFurthermore, while the vast majority of the Group's cash surplus is placed with  branches  of  global  banks  enjoying  the  highest  agency  ratings, it cannot be ruled out that these Group investments may lose some of their liquidity and/or value.\n\nThe  currency  controls  in  place  in  certain  countries  limit  the  Group's ability  to  use  cash  (prohibition  on  investment  with  the  Group)  and, in some cases, delay the possibility of paying dividends (authorisation is required from the relevant authorities, notably in Cuba). At 30 June 2020, the delayed availability cash amounted to \u20ac135 million, including \u20ac131 million relating to Cuba.\n\nSpecific  terms  of  financing  agreements  and  the  schedule  of  financial liability  maturity  are  respectively  disclosed  in  the  'Material  contracts' subsection  of  the  management  report  and  in  Note 4.8  Financial liabilities of the Notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Management of currency risk\n\nAs the Group consolidates its financial statements in euros, it is exposed to  fluctuations  against  the  euro  by  the  currencies  in  which  its  assets and liabilities are denominated (asset risk) or in which transactions are carried out (transaction risk and translation of results).\n\nWhile some hedging strategies allow exposure to be limited, there is no absolute protection against exchange rate fluctuations.\n\nMovements  in  currencies  against  the  euro  (notably  the  USD) may impact the nominal amount of these debts and the financial costs published  in  euro  in  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  and  this could affect the Group's results.\n\nFor  operational  currency  risk,  the  Group's  international  operations expose it to currency risks affecting transactions carried out by affiliates in a currency other than their operating currency (transaction accounting risk).\n\nAs a rule, it is Group policy to invoice end customers in the functional currency  of  the  distributing  entity.  Exposure  to  currency  risk  on invoicing between producer and distributor affiliates is managed via a monthly  payment  centralisation  procedure  involving  most  countries with freely convertible and transferable currencies and whose internal legislation  allows  this  participation.  This  system  hedges  against  net exposure using forward exchange contracts.\n\nResidual risk is partially hedged using financial derivatives (forward purchases, forward sales or options) to hedge certain or highly probable non-Group operating receivables and payables.\n\nIn addition, the Group may use firm or optional hedges with the aim of reducing the impact of currency fluctuations on its operating activities in some Brand Companies that make significant purchases in currencies other than the euro - especially USD, GBP or SEK - or in order to secure the payment of dividends back to the parent.\n\n## Management of interest rate risk\n\nAt  30 June  2020,  the  Group's  debt  comprised  floating-rate  debt (mainly commercial  paper  and  other  bank  loans)  and  fixed-rate  debt (mainly bonds), in addition to a hedging portfolio including USD swaps.\n\nThe  Group  cannot  guarantee  that  these  hedges  will  prove  sufficient, or that it will be able to maintain them on acceptable terms.\n\nFor asset risk, financing foreign currency-denominated assets acquired by the Group with debt in the same currency provides natural hedging. This principle was applied for the acquisition of Seagram, Allied Domecq and  Vin&Sprit,  with  part  of  the  debt  being  denominated  in  USD, reflecting  the  importance  of  cash  flows  generated  in  dollars  or  linked currencies.\n\n## Schedule of maturity of floating-rate debt and hedging in EUR (notional value)\n\n| At 30.06.2020 \u20ac million               | < 1 year   | > 1 year and < 5 years   | > 5 years   | Total   |\n|---------------------------------------|------------|--------------------------|-------------|---------|\n| Total assets (cash)                   | 1,322      | -                        | -           | 1,322   |\n| Total floating-rate liabilities       | (328)      | 3                        | 0           | (325)   |\n| NET FLOATING-RATE DEBT BEFORE HEDGING | 995        | 3                        | 0           | 998     |\n| Derivative instruments                | 502        | 13                       | -           | 515     |\n| NET FLOATING-RATE DEBT AFTER HEDGING  | 1,497      | 16                       | 0           | 1,513   |\n\n## Schedule of floating-rate debt and hedging in USD (notional value)\n\n| At 30.06.2020  \u20ac million              | < 1 year   | > 1 year and < 5 years   | > 5 years   | Total   |\n|---------------------------------------|------------|--------------------------|-------------|---------|\n| Total assets (cash)                   | 60         | -                        | -           | 60      |\n| Total floating-rate liabilities       | (251)      | (147)                    | -           | (398)   |\n| NET FLOATING-RATE DEBT BEFORE HEDGING | (190)      | (147)                    | -           | (337)   |\n| Derivative instruments                | (661)      | (509)                    | (164)       | (1,335) |\n| NET FLOATING-RATE DEBT AFTER HEDGING  | (851)      | (656)                    | (164)       | (1,672) |\n\n<!-- image -->",

In order to limit this exposure, the Group performs a rigorous selection of counterparties according to several criteria, including credit ratings, and depending on the maturity dates of the transactions.\n\nHowever, no assurance can be given that this rigorous selection will be enough to protect the Group against risks of this type, particularly in the current economic context.\n\n## Interest rate, foreign exchange and commodity derivatives Note 4.10\n\nPursuant to the amended version of IAS 9 (Financial Instruments), all derivative instruments must be recognised in the balance sheet at fair value, determined on the basis of standard market valuation models or external prices issued by financial institutions.\n\nWhere the derivative has been designated as a fair value hedge, changes in the value of the derivative and of the hedged item are recognised in profit and loss for the same period. If the derivative has been designated as a cash flow hedge, the change in value of the 'effective' portion of the hedge is recognised in shareholders' equity. It is recognised in profit and loss when the hedged item is itself recognised in profit and loss. The  change  in  value  of  the  ineffective  component  of  the  derivative  is  however  recognised  directly  in  profit  and  loss.  If  the  derivative  is designated  as  a  hedge  of  a  net  foreign  currency  investment,  the  change  in  value  of  the  effective  portion  of  the  hedge  is  recognised  in shareholders' equity and the change in value of the 'ineffective' portion is recognised in profit and loss.\n\n## Hedging instruments (by risk category and nature of hedge)\n\n|                                                                           |                                     | Notional amount of contracts   | Notional amount of contracts   | Notional amount of contracts   | Fair value   | Fair value   | Fair value   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Type of hedging at 30.06.2019 \u20ac million                                   | Description of financial instrument | < 1 year                       | > 1 year and < 5 years         | > 5 years                      | Total        | Assets       | Liabilities  |\n| Fair value hedge                                                          |                                     |                                |                                |                                |              | 13           | 2            |\n| Interest rate risk hedges                                                 | Swaps                               | -

Foreign currency denominated notional amounts in cross-currency swaps are shown in euros at the exchange rate agreed. For other instruments, notional amounts denominated in foreign currencies are translated into euros at year-end rates. Estimated market values are based on information available on the financial markets and valuation methods appropriate to the type of financial instrument concerned. These valuation methods yield results consistent with the valuations provided by bank counterparties.\n\nThe Group's hedging instruments at 30 June 2020 are not ineffective.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Most of these other current liabilities are due within one year.\n\n## Assets held for sale and related liabilities Note 4.12\n\nAssets held for sale mainly correspond to certain assets received in connection with the acquisition of the US listed company Castle Brands Inc., which the Group envisages disposing of within 12 months.\n\n## Notes to the consolidated cash flow statement NOTE 5\n\n## Working Capital Requirement 1.\n\nWorking Capital Requirements increased by \u20ac433 million. The change breaks down as follows:\n\n- increase in inventory: +\u20ac414 million; \u0097\n- reduction in operating receivables: \u20ac(261) million; \u0097\n- increase in operating and other payables: +\u20ac197 million; \u0097\n- other movements: +\u20ac83 million. \u0097\n\nThe increase in inventory relates to the build-up of ageing inventories to meet future demand.\n\n## Additional information NOTE 6\n\n## Shareholders' equity Note 6.1\n\n## Share capital 1.\n\nThe Group's share capital did not change between 1 July 2019 and 30 June 2020:\n\n|                             | Number of shares   |   Amount \u20ac million |\n|-----------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| Share capital at 30.06.2019 | 265,421,592        |                411 |\n| Share capital at 30.06.2020 | 265,421,592        |                411 |\n\nAll Pernod Ricard shares are issued and fully paid up and have a nominal value of \u20ac1.55. Only one category of ordinary Pernod Ricard shares exists. These shares obtain double voting rights if they have been registered in the name of the same shareholder for an uninterrupted period of 10 years.\n\n## Treasury shares 2.\n\nTreasury shares are recognised on acquisition as a deduction from shareholders' equity. Subsequent changes in the value of treasury shares are not recognised. When treasury shares are sold, any difference between the acquisition cost and the fair value of the shares at the date of sale is recognised as a change in shareholders' equity and has no impact on profit and loss for the year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Purchases of financial assets and activities 2.\n\nPurchases  of  financial  assets  and  activities  had  an  impact  of \u20ac618 million, mainly due to the purchases during the period described in Note 1.2 Significant events during the financial year .\n\n## Issuance/redemption of bonds 3.\n\nDuring  the  financial  year,  the  Pernod  Ricard  Group  carried  out  bond issuance/subscriptions  for  \u20ac3,822 million  and  bond  redemptions  for \u20ac(1,553) million.  These  transactions  mainly  correspond  to  the  bond subscriptions  and  redemptions  described  in  Note 1.2  Significant events during the financial year .\n\nIn  addition,  the  Group  increased  the  stock  of  commercial  paper  for \u20ac299 million.\n\nThe  Group  also  paid  \u20ac112 million  in  respect  of  its  lease  liabilities, of which \u20ac99 million related to repayment of the nominal amount and \u20ac13 million  to  interest  payments  reported  in  cash  flow  from  operating activities.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nAt  30 June  2020,  Pernod  Ricard  and  its  controlled  affiliates  held 4,747,585 Pernod Ricard shares worth \u20ac668 million, of which \u20ac224 million acquired over the period 21 October to 13 December 2019, and \u20ac301 million acquired over the period 18 February to 6 April 2020 under  the  share  buyback  programme  announced  on  28 August  2019. These  treasury  shares  are  reported,  at  cost,  as  a  deduction  from shareholders' equity.\n\nAs  part  of  its  stock  option  and  bonus  share  allocation  plans,  Pernod Ricard  SA  holds  shares  either  directly  (treasury  shares)  or  indirectly (calls  or  repurchase  options)  that  may  be  granted  if  options  are exercised under the stock option plans or, in the case of bonus shares, if performance targets are met.\n\n## Interim dividend 3.\n\nAt its meeting of 22 April 2020, the Board of Directors decided to pay an interim  dividend  of  \u20ac1.18  per  share  in  respect  of  FY20, i.e. a  total  of \u20ac308 million.  The  interim  dividend  was  paid  on  10 July  2020  and recognised  under  'Other  current  liabilities'  in  the  balance  sheet  at 30 June 2020.\n\n## Share-based payments Note 6.2\n\nThe  Group  applies  the  IFRS 2  (Share-based  payment)  standard  to transactions whose award and settlement are share-based.\n\nPursuant  to  this  standard,  stock  options  and  performance-based shares granted to employees are measured at fair value. The amount of  such  fair  value  is  recognised  in  the  income  statement  over  the vesting  period  of  the  rights  and  a  corresponding  double  entry  is recognised as an increase in shareholders' equity.\n\n## Description of share-based payment plans\n\nThe  Group  implements  stock  option  and  performance-based  share plans for Managers with high levels of responsibility, key management personnel for the Group and high-potential Managers. All of the plans are equity-settled.\n\nIn  the  course  of  FY20,  three  share  allocation  plans  were  set  up  on 8 November 2019:\n\n- a stock option plan including a performance condition based on the \u0097 positioning  of  the  overall  performance  of  the  Pernod  Ricard  share (TSR (1) ) compared with the overall performance of a panel of 12 peers over the period from 8 November 2019 to 8 November 2022 inclusive (three years) and a condition of four years' continuous service;\n\n## Capital management 4.\n\nThe Group manages its capital in such a way as to optimise its cost of capital  and  profitability  for  its  shareholders,  provide  security  for  all  its counterparties  and  maintain  a  high  rating.  In  this  context,  the  Group may adjust its payment of dividends to shareholders, repay part of its capital,  buy  back  its  own  shares  and  authorise  share-based  payment plans.\n\n## Liquidity agreement 5.\n\nOn  24 May  2012,  Pernod  Ricard  SA  put  in  place  a  12-month  liquidity agreement,  effective  from  1 June  2012,  through  Rothschild  &  Cie Banque.  The  agreement  is  tacitly  renewable  for  successive  periods  of 12 months.  It  complies  with  the  French  Financial  Markets  Association (AMAFI) Code of Conduct, which was approved by the French Financial Markets Authority (AMF) in its decision of 21 March 2011.\n\nThe  sum  of  \u20ac5 million  was  allocated  for  the  implementation  of  the liquidity agreement.\n\nThis  fair  value  was  calculated  using  valuation  models  taking  into account the characteristics of the plan and market data at the date of grant and on the basis of Group Management assumptions.\n\n- a performance-based share plan, including a performance condition \u0097 based  on  the  average  level  of  Profit  from  Recurring  Operations achieved  compared  with  the  budget,  measured  over  three consecutive  financial  years  including  the  year  in  which  the  shares were granted and a condition of four years' continuous service;\n- a  performance-based share plan including a performance condition \u0097 based on the positioning  of  the  overall  performance  of  the  Pernod Ricard  share  (TSR (1) )  compared  with  the  overall  performance  of  a panel  of  12  peers  over  the  period  from  8 November  2019  to 8 November  2022  inclusive  (three  years)  and  a  condition  of  four years' continuous service.\n\n|                       | Commencement    | Commencement                      | Commencement            | Commencement                 | Commencement   | Commencement                        |                                 |                                             |\n|-----------------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------|----------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| Stock options         | Type of options | Presence of performance condition | Number of beneficiaries | date for exercise of options | Expiry date    | Subscription or purchase price  (\u20ac) | Outstanding options at 30.06.20 | Stock option expense for FY20 (\u20ac thousands) |\n| Plan dated 06.11.2015 | Purchase        | Conditional                       | 161                     | 07.11.2019                   | 06.11.2023     | \u20ac102.80                             | 114,893                         | 389                                         |\n| Plan dated 17.11.2016 | Purchase        | Conditional                       | 16                      | 18.11.2020                   | 17.11.2024     | \u20ac105.81                             | 124,502                         | 571                                         |\n| Plan dated 09.11.2017 | Purchase        | Conditional                       | 15                      | 10.11.2021                   | 09.11.2025     | \u20ac126.53                             | 124,050                         | 587                                         |\n| Plan dated 21.11.2018 | Purchase        | Conditional                       | 15                      | 22.11.2022                   | 21.11.2026     | \u20ac137.78                             | 109,492                         | 577                                         |\n| Plan dated 08.11.2019 | Purchase        | Conditional                       | 14                      | 09.11.2023                   | 08.11.2027     | \u20ac162.79                             | 131,864                         | 518                                         |\n\n<!-- image -->",

In  addition,  only  the  values  relating  to  the  plans allocated  during  FY20  are  presented  above  (information  on  previous plans is available in the previous Universal Registration Documents).\n\nFrom 2012 onwards, the volatility assumption used for the plans is based on a multi-criteria approach taking into consideration:\n\n- historic volatility over a period equal to the duration of the options; \u0097\n- implied  volatility  calculated  on  the  basis  of  options  available \u0097 in financial markets.\n\nThe  possibility  of  exercising  options  prior  to  maturity  has  been  taken into  account  in  the  valuation  model  of  the  stock  option  plans  by reflecting, via an assumption, the behaviour of beneficiaries as regards the anticipated periods (before maturity). In 2017, a new option exercise profile was defined and replaced that established in 2010. It was assumed  that  30%,  40%  and  30%  of  the  options  would  be exercised  once  the  share  price  reached  120%,  150%  and  180%  of  the exercise  price  respectively.  This  assumption  is  based  on  a  recent analysis of behaviour observed on plans awarded before 2017.\n\nOptions  allocated  on  8 November  2019  are  all  conditional  on  the positioning  of  the  overall  performance  of  the  Pernod  Ricard  share (TSR (1) )  compared with the overall performance of a panel of 12 peers: the stock options will be pre-vested on 8 November 2022, provided that\n\nthe overall performance of the Pernod Ricard share (TSR (1) ) is positioned 7 th out  of  13  or  better  (the  number  will  be  determined  in  increments depending on the level of performance achieved). Vesting will be final if the continuous service condition is met on 8 November 2023.\n\nTwo performance-based share plans were granted on 8 November 2019. In  one  case,  the  fair  value  corresponds,  amongst  other  things,  to  the market price of the shares at the grant date, less the loss of expected dividends during the vesting period ( i.e. four years for all beneficiaries). Lastly, the number of performance-based shares granted will depend on the  average  level  of  Group  Profit  from  Recurring  Operations  for  the years ended 30 June 2020, 30 June 2021 and 30 June 2022 compared with budgeted Profit from recurring operations for each of those years, at constant exchange rates and scope of consolidation. The accounting expense for the plan under IFRS 2 will be adjusted for this condition no later than the end of the vesting period.\n\nThe  fair  value  of  the  other  plan  takes  account  of  the  same  market performance  condition  as  applied  to  the  stock  options  allocated  on 8 November  2019:  positioning  of  the  overall  performance  of  the Pernod Ricard share (TSR (1) ) compared with the overall performance of a panel  of  12  peers  over  the  period  from  8 November  2019  to 8 November 2022  inclusive  (three  years).  Vesting  will  be  final  as  of 9 November  2023  if  the  continuous  service  condition  is  met  on 8 November 2023.\n\n## Off-balance sheet commitments Note 6.3\n\n> 1 year and\n\n| \u20ac million                                                      | Total   | < 1 year   | < 5 years   | > 5 years   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|---------|------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Commitments given at 30.06.2019                                | 2,587   | 863        | 1,356       | 368         |\n| Commitments given in relation to companies within the Group    | 7       | 2          | 5           | -           |\n| Commitments given in relation to the financing of the Company  | 23      | 6          | 12          | 6           |\n| Financial guarantees given                                     | 23      | 6          | 12          | 6           |\n| Other items                                                    | -       | -          | -           | -           |\n| Commitments relating to the operating activities of the issuer | 2,556   | 855        | 1,339       | 362         |\n| Firm and irrevocable commitments to purchase raw materials     | 1,744   | 582        | 1,087       | 74          |\n| Tax commitments (customs guarantees and others)                | 243     | 163        | 11          | 68          |\n| Operating lease agreements                                     | 555     | 97         | 239         | 219         |\n| Other items                                                    | 15      | 13         | 2           | 1           |\n\n<!-- image -->",

It should be noted that the level and amount of this risk have been gradually and significantly reduced in recent  years  and  that  the  Company  obtained  two  court  rulings  in  its favour  in  2020  for  the  period  from  FY07  to  FY14.  These  two  court decisions  further  strengthen  Pernod  Ricard  India's  position  on  the  tax deductibility  of  advertising  and  promotional  expenses.  Reassured  by these decisions and after consulting with its tax advisers, Pernod Ricard India will  continue to dispute the merits of the reassessment proposal and  believes  it  has  a  probable  chance  of  success  in  litigation. Accordingly, no provision has been booked for this matter.\n\n## Disputes Note 6.5\n\nIn the normal course of business, Pernod Ricard is involved in a number of legal, governmental, arbitration and administrative proceedings.\n\nA provision for such procedures is constituted under 'Other provisions for  risks  and  charges'  (see  Note 4.7  Provisions )  only  when  it  is  likely that  a  current  liability  stemming  from  a  past  event  will  require  the payment of an amount that can be reliably estimated. In the latter case, the provisioned amount corresponds to the best estimation of the risk. The  provisioned  amount  recorded  is  based  on  the  assessment  of  the level of risk on a case by case basis, it being understood that any events arising during the proceedings may at any time require that risk to be reassessed.\n\nThe  provisions  recorded  by  Pernod  Ricard  at  30 June  2020  for  all litigation  and  risks  in  which  it  is  involved  amounted  to  \u20ac431 million, compared with \u20ac374 million at 30 June 2019 (see Note 4.7 Provisions ), excluding  uncertain  tax  positions  recognised  in  current  tax  liabilities. Pernod  Ricard  provides  no  further  details  (other  than  in  exceptional circumstances), as disclosing the amount of any provision for ongoing litigation could cause the Group serious harm.\n\nTo  the  best  of  the  Company's  knowledge,  there  are  no  other governmental, legal  or  arbitration  proceedings  pending  or  threatened, including  any  proceeding  of  which  the  Company  is  aware,  which  may have  or  have  had  over  the  last  12 months  a  significant  impact  on  the profitability  of  the  Company  and/or  the  Group,  other  than  those described below.\n\n## Disputes relating to brands\n\n## Havana Club\n\nThe Havana Club brand is owned in most countries by a joint-venture company called Havana Club Holding SA (HCH), of which Pernod Ricard is  a  shareholder,  and  is  registered  in  over  160 countries  in  which  the Havana  Club  rum  is  distributed.  In  the  United  States,  this  brand  is owned by a Cuban company (Cubaexport). Ownership of this brand is currently  being  challenged  in  the  United  States  by  a  competitor  of Pernod Ricard.\n\nIn 1998, the United States passed a law relating to the conditions for the protection  of  brands  previously  used  by  nationalised  companies. This law  was  condemned  by  the  World  Trade  Organization  (WTO) in 2002.  However,  to  date,  the  United  States  has  not  amended  its legislation to comply with the WTO decision:\n\n- The United States Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) decided 1. that  this  law  had  the  effect  of  preventing  any  renewal  of  the  US trademark registration for the Havana Club brand, which, in the United  States,  has  been  owned  by  Cubaexport  since 1976, without obtaining a specific licence from OFAC. In August 2006,  the United States  Patent  and  Trademark  Office (USPTO)  denied  the  renewal  of  the  said  Havana  Club  trademark\n\nregistration,  following OFAC'S  refusal  to  grant  a  specific  licence. Cubaexport  petitioned  the  Director  of  the  USPTO  to  reverse  this decision and also filed a claim against the OFAC, challenging both OFAC's  decision  and  the  law  and  regulations  applied  by  OFAC. In March 2009,  the  US  District  Court  for  the  District  of  Columbia ruled  against  Cubaexport.  In  March 2011,  in  a  two-to-one  decision, the  Court  of  Appeals  blocked  Cubaexport  from  renewing  its trademark.  A certiorari petition  was  filed  before  the  US  Supreme Court  on  27 January  2012,  with  the  support  of  the  French government, the National Foreign Trade Council and the Washington Legal Foundation. On 14 May 2012, the Supreme Court denied the petition. In November 2015, Cubaexport again applied for a specific licence from OFAC to renew the trademark in the United States.  On  11 January  2016,  OFAC  granted  Cubaexport's  licence application and on 13 January 2016, the application to the Director of USPTO was declared admissible and the trademark was renewed for the 10-year period ending on 27 January 2016. A request for a further renewal  for  a  period  of  10  years  from  27 January  2016  was  also granted;\n\n- A competitor of the Group has petitioned the USPTO to cancel the 2. Havana  Club  trademarks  in  the  United  States.  In  January 2004, the USPTO  denied  the  petition  and  refused  to  cancel  the trademark registration. As this decision was appealed, proceedings are  now  before  the  Federal  District  Court  for  the  District  of Columbia. These proceedings were stayed pending the outcome of Cubaexport's petition to the USPTO. Following acceptance of the petition  by  the  Director  of  the  USPTO,  these  judicial  proceedings resumed  and  the  plaintiff  amended  their  complaint.  In  response, Cubaexport and HCH filed two motions: one to dismiss all actions commenced  against  them  and  one  to  expedite  proceedings  on certain issues.\n\nThese  risks  constitute  a  potential  obstacle  to  the  Group's  business development  but  there  are  no  foreseeable  obligations  resulting  from these events at the present time. The resolution of these disputes would represent a business development opportunity for the Group.\n\n## Tax disputes\n\nThe Group's companies are regularly audited by the tax authorities in the countries in which they are registered.\n\nThe estimation of the risk concerning each dispute is regularly reviewed by the affiliate or region concerned and by the Group's Tax Department, with  the  assistance  of  external  counsel  for  the  most  significant  or complex  cases.  Provisions  are  recognised  if  necessary.  Pernod  Ricard provides  no  further  details  (other  than  in  exceptional  circumstances), as disclosing the amount of any provision for ongoing tax litigation could cause the Group serious harm.\n\n## India\n\nPernod  Ricard  India  (P)  Ltd  has  an  ongoing  dispute  with  the  Indian customs authorities over the declared transaction value of concentrates of alcoholic  beverages  (CAB)  imported  into  India.  Customs  are challenging the transaction values, arguing that some competitors used different values for the import of similar goods. This matter was ruled on by the Supreme Court which issued an order in July 2010, setting out the principles applicable for the determination of values which should be taken into account for the calculation of duty. Pernod Ricard India (P)  Ltd  has  already  paid  the  corresponding  amounts  up  to  2001. For the period between 2001 and December 2010, Pernod Ricard India (P)  Ltd  has  paid  almost  the  entire  differential  duty  as  determined  by customs in Delhi following the initial adjustment notice received in 2011. A  second  notice,  received  in  2013  and  confirmed  by  a  court  on 14 August 2017 has been  suspended  by  the  Supreme  Court. The Company continues to actively work with the authorities and courts to resolve pending issues.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Discussions  are  ongoing  with  the  relevant authorities and jurisdictions.\n\nMoreover,  Pernod  Ricard  India  (P)  received  several  notices  of  tax adjustment  for  FY07  to  FY16  relating  to  the  tax  deductibility  of advertising  and  promotional  expenses  (see  Note 6.4  Contingent liabilities ). In 2020, Pernod Ricard India (P) obtained two court rulings in its favour for the period from FY07 to FY14, strengthening its position on the tax deductibility of advertising and promotional expenses.\n\nIt  should  be  noted  that  the  above-mentioned  disputes  are  only  the subject  of  provisions,  which,  where  appropriate,  are  recorded  in  other provisions for risks and charges (see Note 4.7 Provisions ) or in current tax  liabilities  (see  Note 3.3  Income  tax ),  when  it  is  probable  that  a present obligation resulting from a past event will require a settlement the  amount  of  which  can  be  reliably  estimated.  The  amount  of  the provision  is  the  best  estimate  of  the  outflow  of  resources  required  to extinguish this liability.\n\n## Commercial disputes\n\n## Colombia\n\nA  complaint  was  filed  before  the  Colombian  Competition  Agency (the Superintendencia  De  Industria  Y  Comercio)  on  14 November  2017 by  the  Department  of  Cundinamarca  and  its  wholly  owned  distilling company Empresa de Licores de Cundinamarca against Pernod Ricard SA,  Pernod  Ricard  Colombia  SA  and  a  competitor company. The complaint alleges that the defendants have committed violations  of  the  Colombian  Unfair  Competition  Act  and,  in  particular, articles 7  and  18  thereof  through  the  illegal  import  of  spirits  into Colombia.  The  complaint  alleges  that  the  companies  have  gained  an unfair  market  advantage  over  local  producers  through  such  activity. The plaintiffs seek to reclaim lost profits and taxes for a four year period between  2013  and  2017.  Pernod  Ricard  intends  to  vigorously  defend itself against such  allegations. This recent complaint  contains allegations  that  are  similar  to  those  made  in  prior  legal  proceedings before the New York courts brought by Cundinamarca, the Republic of Colombia  and  several  other  Colombian  departments  in  2004. The New York proceedings were dismissed voluntarily by the parties in 2012.\n\n## Related parties Note 6.6\n\nTransactions with associates and joint ventures were immaterial in the year ended 30 June 2020.\n\nThe compensation paid to corporate officers and Executive Committee (COMEX) members in return for their services to the Group is detailed below:\n\n| \u20ac million                              | 30.06.2019   | 30.06.2020   |\n|----------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Board of Directors  (1)                | 1            | 1            |\n| Group Executive Committee              |              |              |\n| Short-term benefits \u0097                                        | 14           | 15           |\n| Post-employment benefits \u0097                                        | 5            | 5            |\n| Share-based payments  (2) \u0097                                        | 6            | 5            |\n| TOTAL EXPENSES RECOGNISED FOR THE YEAR | 26           | 26           |\n\n- The cost of share-based payments corresponds to the expenses recognised in profit/loss over the period under stock options and performance-based shares allocated (2) to the members of the Group Executive Committee.\n\nMoreover, the Executive Director is eligible for the following termination compensation  (subject  to  a  regulated  agreement  approved  by  the Shareholders' Meeting of 17 November 2016):\n\n- one-year non-compete clause, together with a payment \u0097 corresponding to 12 months' compensation;\n\n## Subsequent events Note 6.7\n\nIn  July  2020,  the  Group  reduced  its  share  capital  by  cancelling 3,545,032 shares previously held that were acquired under the Group's share buyback programme.

income statement during a financial year. (1)\n- The issuer is understood to be the Parent Company. (2)\n- Including the services of independent experts or members of the Statutory Auditors' network employed to certify the financial statements. (3)\n- This section sets out the procedures and services provided to the issuer or its affiliates by the Statutory Auditors or the members of their networks. They may be required (4) by law or by the provisions stipulated at the request of the Group or its affiliates and undertake to comply with the requirements of independence.\n\n## Consolidation scope NOTE 7\n\nThe  annual  consolidated  financial  statements  include  the  financial statements of the Parent Company, Pernod Ricard SA, and those of entities controlled  by  the  Parent  Company  ('the  affiliates'). Control is the power to influence the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities, irrespective of the  percentage  held  in  the  entity.  Non-controlling  interests  in  the net  assets  of  consolidated  affiliates  are  presented  separately  from Parent  Company  shareholders'  equity.  Non-controlling  interests\n\ninclude both the interests of minority shareholders at the date of the original business  combination  and  minority  interests  in  any subsequent changes to shareholders' equity.\n\nIntragroup  transactions  and  internal  profits  and  losses  relating  to consolidated companies are eliminated.\n\nCompanies over which the Group exercises significant influence are accounted for under the equity method.\n\n## Consolidation scope Note 7.1\n\nThe main changes to the Group's scope of consolidation at 30 June 2020 are presented in Note 1.2 Significant events during the financial year .\n\n<!-- image -->",

We  believe  that  the  audit  evidence  we  have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nOur responsibilities under those standards are further described in the ' Statutory  Auditors'  Responsibilities  for  the  Audit  of  the  Consolidated Financial Statements' section of our report.\n\n## Key Audit Matters\n\n## Responses as part of our audit\n\n## Brands' valuation\n\n(notes 1.1.4, 1.2.1, 3.1 and 4.1 to the consolidated financial statements) As of 30 June 2020, indefinite-life brands were recorded in the balance sheet for a net carrying amount of \u20ac10,832 million, i.e. 34% of total assets. An impairment loss is recorded when their net carrying amount exceeds their recoverable amount. Their recoverable amount is determined as part of  mandatory  annual  impairment  tests  given  their  indefinite  life  and/or specific  tests  required  in  the  event  of  an  indication  of  a  loss  in  value. Recoverable  amounts  are  generally  determined  based  on  discounted future cash flow calculations and/or market values and involve significant management judgments of components such as price and volume growth rates,  the  timing  of  future  operating  expenses  and  discount  and long-term  growth  rates.  The specific  context  of  the  COVID-19  crisis creates uncertainty and  volatility. In response, the Group  has exceptionally  adopted a  weighted average multiple scenarios approach for  impairment  testing  purposes.  This  approach  allocates  estimated probabilities to various possible developments in the pandemic and their consequences on brands' activity.\n\nThe  drastic  slowdown  in  activity  and  the  uncertainties  surrounding mid-term  perspectives  relating  to  the  health  crisis  impacted  the performance and future outlook of certain brands, leading the Company to record an impairment loss before tax of \u20ac999 million for the year ended 30 June 2020, of which \u20ac912 million on the Absolut brand, as disclosed in Notes 1.2.1, 3.1 and 4.1 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur procedures mainly consisted in:\n\n- appraising  the  relevance  and  compliance  with  applicable  accounting \u0097 standards of the weighted average multiple scenarios approach applied by the  Group  in  the  current  year  for  impairment  testing,  as well as  the consistency of the scenarios used with regard to the current health crisis;\n- assessing the principles and methods of calculating brands' recoverable \u0097 amounts;\n- testing  the  operation  of  Group  controls  covering  the  calculation \u0097 of brands' recoverable amounts;\n- for  brands  with  a  recoverable  amount  close  to  their  carrying  amount \u0097 ('sensitive brands'), confirming the results of the valuation model used by management by comparing them with the results of our models;\n- developing,  especially  for  the  Absolut  brand,  a  sensitivity  analysis \u0097 (notably regarding probabilities of occurrence allocated to the crisis exit scenarios) to support the amount of impairment losses accounted for as of 30 June 2020 on the brand;\n- corroborating  the  reasonableness  of  the  main  data  and  assumptions \u0097 underlying the estimates (such as the discount rates, long-term growth rates and other factors used in the weighted average multiple scenarios approach),  primarily  for  'sensitive  brands',  especially  with  regard  to available  market  analyses  and  in  relation  to  economic  environments where the Group operates. In particular, we assessed the appropriateness  of  the  equity  risk  premium  included  in  the  discount rates computations;\n\n## INDEPENDENCE\n\nWe conducted our audit engagement in compliance with independence rules applicable to us, for the period from 1 July 2019 to the date of our report  and  specifically  we  did  not  provide  any  prohibited  non-audit services  referred  to  in  Article 5(1)  of  Regulation  (EU)  No  537/2014  or  in the French Code of ethics (' Code de d\u00e9ontologie ') for statutory auditors.\n\n## EMPHASIS OF MATTER\n\nWithout  qualifying  our  opinion,  we  draw  attention  to  the  matter described in Note 1.1 to the consolidated financial statements relating to the  impacts  of  the  first-time  adoption  as  of  1 July 2019  of  the  IFRS 16 \"Leases\"  and  the  interpretation  of  IFRIC 23  \"Uncertainty  over  Income Tax Treatments\".\n\nOur opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.\n\n## Justification of Assessments - Key Audit Matters\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of Articles L. 823-9 and R. 823-7 of the  French  Commercial  Code  (' Code  de  commerce ')  relating  to  the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit matters relating  to  risks  of  material  misstatement  that,  in  our  professional judgment,  were  of  most  significance  in  our  audit  of  the  consolidated financial statements of the current period, as well as how we addressed those risks.\n\nThese  matters  were  addressed  in  the  context  of  our  audit  of  the consolidated  financial  statements  as  a  whole,  approved  in  the conditions  mentioned  above,  and  in  forming  our  opinion  thereon,  and we  do  not  provide  a  separate  opinion  on  specific  items  of  the consolidated financial statements.",

        "page_content": "## Key Audit Matters\n\n## Responses as part of our audit\n\nFurthermore, the sensitivity of brands' recoverable amounts  to assumptions  was  analysed  by  management  and  presented  in  Note 4.1. Changes  in  these  assumptions  could  give  rise  to  further  impairment losses.\n\nConsidering the weight of brands on the balance sheet, the complexity of the  models  used  and  their  sensitivity  to  changes  in  the  data and assumptions  underlying  the  estimates,  particularly  cash  flow forecasts  and  discount  rates  used,  we  considered  the  recoverable amount of brands to be a key audit matter presenting a risk of material misstatement.\n\n## Tax risk\n\n(notes 1.1.2.1.2,  1.1.4,  3.3,  4.7,  4.7.1,  4.7.2,  6.4  and  6.5  to  the  consolidated financial statements)\n\nThe Group operates in numerous different tax jurisdictions. The tax authorities  of  the  countries  in  which  the  Group  companies operate  regularly  have  queries  on  issues  relating  to  their  everyday activities.\n\nTax audits can therefore give rise to tax reassessments and litigation with these  tax  authorities.  The  assessment  of  the  risk  related  to  each  tax litigation  is  regularly  reviewed  by  each  concerned  subsidiary  or  region and  by  the  Group's  tax  department,  with  the  support  of  its  external counsels  for  the  most  significant  and  complex  litigations.  Part  of  the amount  of  provisions  for  contingences  for  all  legal  disputes  or  risks involving  the  Group  relate  to  tax  risks  and  litigation.  The  first-time application  of  IFRIC 23,  'Uncertainty  over  Income  Tax  Treatments', led to the  reclassification  in  the  opening  balance  sheet  of  \u20ac150 million from  'Non-current  provisions'  to  'Income  tax  payables',  as  disclosed  in Note 1.1.2.1.2 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nMore  particularly,  the  Indian  subsidiary  is  involved  in  disputes  with customs and tax authorities over, among others, the declared transaction value  of  imported  products  into  India  and  the  tax  deductibility  of promotional  and  advertising  expenses.  As  indicated  in  the  Note 6.5 'Disputes', the reassessment proposals are only the subject of provisions or income tax payables where appropriate, when it is likely that a current liability  resulting  from  a  past  event  will  require  an  outflow  of  resources which can be reliably estimated.\n\nGiven the Group's exposure to tax issues, which are in part specific to its business  sector,  and  the  high  level  of  management  judgment  in estimating the risks and amounts recorded, we considered tax risks to be a  key  audit  matter  and  the  understatement  of  the  corresponding provisions  to  be  a  possible  source  of  material  misstatement  in  the financial statements.\n\n- being  informed  of  the  commercial  outlook  of  the  brands  based  on \u0097 interviews with management and comparing the accounting estimates of prior period cash flow projections with corresponding actual values to assess reliability;\n- testing  the  arithmetical  accuracy  of  the  valuations  used  by  the \u0097 Company on a sample basis;\n- assessing management's sensitivity analysis on recoverable amounts to \u0097 changes in main assumptions.\n\nWe also assessed the appropriateness of the disclosures in Notes 1.1.4, 1.2.1, 3.1  and  4.1  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements  and  verified  the arithmetical accuracy of the presented sensitivity analysis.\n\nBased  on  discussions  with  management,  we  have  been  informed  of  the procedures  implemented  by  the  Group  to  identify  tax  risks  and, where necessary, provide for risks or income tax payables.\n\nIn  addition,  we  assessed  the  judgments  made  by  management  in evaluating the probability of taxes being payable, the amount of potential exposure and the reasonableness of the estimates adopted for provisions for tax risks or income tax payables. We particularly focused on the impact of changes in local tax regulations and ongoing audits conducted by local tax authorities.\n\nTo  assess  whether  the  tax  liabilities  were  appropriately  recognized, and with the assistance of our tax experts, we:\n\n- conducted interviews with the Group's tax department and regional and \u0097 local  management  teams  in  order  to  assess  the  current  state  of  the investigations and reassessments made by tax authorities and monitor the development of ongoing tax disputes;\n- consulted  the  recent  Group  company  decisions  and  correspondence \u0097 with  local  tax  authorities,  and  reviewed  the  correspondence  between the relevant companies and their lawyers, where necessary;\n- analysed lawyers' responses to our information requests; \u0097\n- performed  a  critical  review  of  the  estimates  and  positions  adopted \u0097 by management;\n- assessed whether the latest developments were taken into account in \u0097 the provisions recorded in the balance sheet.\n- assessed the correct application of the standard amendment \u0097 introduced by IFRIC 23.\n\nWe also assessed the disclosures in Notes 1.1.2.1.2, 1.1.4, 3.3, 4.7, 4.7.1, 4.7.2, 6.4 and 6.5 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS",

These projections are based on assumptions arising from management's judgment.\n\nWe considered  the  recoverability  of  deferred  tax  assets  relating  to  tax loss  carryforwards  to  be  a  key  audit  matter  due  to  the  significant judgments made by management in recognising these assets, particularly in the current economic environment, and the material amounts.\n\n## Post-employment benefit commitments\n\n(notes 1.1.4, 1.2.2.2, 4.3 and 4.7.3 to the consolidated financial statements) The  Group  contributes  to  several  defined-benefit  post-employment benefit  plans,  mainly  pension  plans.  The  main  plans  located  in  France, the United  States,  Canada,  Ireland,  and  the  United  Kingdom  represent nearly the entire actuarial value of accumulated benefits, which amounted  to  \u20ac5,584 million  as  of  30 June 2020.  These  liabilities are  covered  by  plan  assets  with  a  fair  value  of  \u20ac5,259 million, resulting in a  net  liability  position  as  of  30 June 2020  of  \u20ac341 million. The most significant plan assets concern the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, and Ireland.\n\nThe  measurement  of  pension  plan  assets  and  liabilities  as  well  as  the actuarial  expense  for  the  period  requires  the  exercise  of  judgment  to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used, such as discount and inflation  rates,  future  wage  increases,  employee  turnover  rate,  mortality tables, etc. Changes in some of these assumptions may have a material impact  on  the  calculation  of  the  net  liability  and  the  Group's  earnings. In this  context,  management  calls  on  external  actuaries  to  assist  in determining these assumptions.\n\nDuring  the  fiscal  year  ended  30 June 2020,  in  order  to  reduce  the Group's exposure to any shortfall in scheme funding due to changes in life expectancy and fluctuations in market parameters, including inflation and  interest  rates,  a  bulk  purchase  annuity  contract  ('buy-in'  policy) was achieved for Pernod Ricard's largest pension scheme in the United Kingdom. This transaction involved the transfer of \u20ac4,252 million in plan assets from the pension scheme to an insurer, covering \u20ac3,350 million of pension commitments of this same pension plan at the transaction date. Thus,  a  \u20ac903 million  reduction  in  non-current  financial  assets  was recognized in other comprehensive income, as disclosed in notes 1.2.2.2, 4.3 and 4.7 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nGiven the amounts of the commitments and plans assets as well as the significant judgments made by management and the technical expertise required for their measurement, we considered this type of commitment to be a key audit matter.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAssisted  by  our  tax  specialists  from  the  relevant  countries,  where necessary, our audit approach consisted in assessing the probability that the  company  can  utilise  its  current  tax  loss  carryforwards  in  the  future, particularly with regard to:\n\n- deferred  tax  liabilities  within  the  same  tax  jurisdiction  that  could  be \u0097 offset against current tax loss carryforwards prior to their expiration; and\n- the ability of the relevant subsidiaries to generate future taxable profits \u0097 in order to utilise current tax loss carryforwards, notably with regards to their consistency with management data and past performance.\n\nWe also assessed the reasonableness of the main data and assumptions (earnings growth taking into account the current economic environment and  sustainability  of  operations)  used  to  calculate  the  taxable  income forecasts underlying the recognition and recoverability of the deferred tax assets relating to tax loss carryforwards.\n\nWe also assessed the appropriateness of the disclosures in Notes 1.1.4 and 3.3 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nWe have been informed of the procedures implemented by the Group to value post-employment benefit commitments.\n\nWe called on internal actuarial specialists to assess the assumptions used in  the  valuation  of  pension  plan  commitments,  in  particular  those  of  the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Ireland and France, by:\n\n- assessing  the  consistency  of  the  discount  and  inflation  rates  with \u0097 market conditions;\n- assessing the assumptions relating to wage increases, staff turnover and \u0097 mortality  rates  to  determine  their  consistency  with  the  specificities  of each  plan  and,  where  necessary,  with  the  relevant  national  and sector-specific benchmarks;\n- analysing  the  calculations  prepared  by  external  actuaries,  particularly \u0097 those justifying the liability's sensitivity to changes in the discount rate;\n- verifying the classification of the transaction as a 'buy-in' policy and the \u0097 accounting treatment applied. In this respect, we familiarized ourselves with  the  terms  and  conditions  of  the  agreement  and  the  transaction, assessed  the  consistency  of  the  classification  adopted  by  the  Group with the legal, economic  and  financial  terms  and  conditions, and assessed the compliance of the accounting treatment adopted with prevailing standards.\n\nRegarding  the  plan  assets,  we  also  assessed  whether  the  assumptions adopted by management to measure these assets and the documentation provided by management to justify the recognition of net plan assets were appropriate.  Regarding  net  plan  assets,  we  analysed  the  plan  rules, the latest financing report and the legal position obtained by management with respect to the applicable accounting standards, to assess the Group's ability to recover surplus assets.\n\nWe  also  assessed  the  appropriateness  of  the  disclosures  in  Notes 1.1.4, 1.2.2.2, 4.3 and 4.7.3 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS",

Our  objective  is  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether  the consolidated  financial  statements  as  a  whole  are  free  from  material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not  a  guarantee  that  an  audit  conducted  in  accordance  with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material  if,  individually  or  in  the  aggregate,  they  could  reasonably  be expected  to  influence  the  economic  decisions  of  users  taken  on  the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs  specified  in  Article L. 823-10-1  of  the  French  Commercial  Code (' Code de commerce '),  our statutory audit does not include assurance on  the  viability  of  the  Company  or  the  quality  of  management  of  the affairs of the company.\n\nAs  part  of  an  audit  conducted  in  accordance  with  professional standards  applicable  in  France,  the  statutory  auditor  exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:\n\n- identifies  and  assesses  the  risks  of  material  misstatement  of  the \u0097 consolidated  financial  statements,  whether  due  to  fraud  or  error, designs  and  performs  audit  procedures  responsive  to  those  risks, and obtains  audit  evidence  considered  to  be  sufficient  and appropriate  to  provide  a  basis  for  his  opinion.  The  risk  of  not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for  one  resulting  from  error,  as  fraud  may  involve  collusion,  forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in \u0097 order  to  design  audit  procedures  that  are  appropriate  in  the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control;\n- evaluates  the  appropriateness  of  accounting  policies  used  and  the \u0097 reasonableness  of  accounting  estimates  and  related  disclosures made by management in the consolidated financial statements;\n- assesses  the  appropriateness  of  management's  use  of  the  going \u0097 concern  basis  of  accounting  and,  based  on  the  audit  evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to  continue  as  a  going  concern.  This  assessment  is  based  on  the audit  evidence  obtained  up  to  the  date  of  his  audit  report. However, future  events  or  conditions  may  cause  the  Company  to cease  to  continue  as  a  going  concern.  If  the  statutory  auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention  in  the  audit  report  to  the  related  disclosures  in  the consolidated  financial  statements  or,  if  such  disclosures  are  not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein;\n- evaluates  the  overall  presentation  of  the  consolidated  financial \u0097 statements  and  assesses  whether  these  statements  represent  the underlying  transactions  and  events  in  a  manner  that  achieves  fair presentation;\n- obtains sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial \u0097 information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express  an  opinion  on  the  consolidated  financial  statements. The statutory auditor is responsible for the direction, supervision and performance  of  the  audit  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements and  for  the  opinion  expressed  on  these  consolidated  financial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Pernod  Ricard  SA's financial relations with its affiliates mainly involve the billing of royalties for the operation of brands owned by Pernod Ricard SA, various billings and the receipt of dividends.\n\n## Income statement and balance 7.4.2 sheet as at 30 June 2020\n\n## Analysis of FY20 income statement\n\nOperating income represented a total of \u20ac240 million in the year ended 30 June 2020, an increase of \u20ac19 million compared with the year ended 30 June  2019,  reflecting  an  \u20ac8 million  decline  in  royalties  and  a \u20ac27 million increase in net sales.\n\nThe  amount  of  operating  expenses  as  at  30 June  2020  was \u20ac(300) million  compared  with  \u20ac(309) million  in  the  previous  year, i.e. a reduction  in  expenses  of  \u20ac9 million.  The  main  changes  are explained by:\n\n- a decrease in personnel expenses of \u20ac14 million; \u0097\n- a negative change in provisions and provision reversals of \u20ac5 million. \u0097\n\nThe  operating  result  was  a  loss  of  \u20ac(61) million  in  the  year  ended 30 June 2020, an improvement of \u20ac27 million compared with the year ended 30 June 2019.\n\nThe  amount  of  financial  income  was  \u20ac1,140 million  at  30 June 2020, compared to \u20ac305 million at 30 June 2019. This increase of \u20ac834 million was mainly attributable to:\n\n- an increase in dividends received of \u20ac883 million; \u0097\n- an increase in net financial expense of \u20ac75 million; \u0097\n- a  negative  change  in  foreign  exchange  gains  and  losses  of \u0097 \u20ac28 million;\n- a net reversal of financial provisions of \u20ac54 million. \u0097\n\nProfit from continuing operations before tax amounted to \u20ac1,079 million.\n\nAt  30 June  2020,  exceptional  items  amounted  to  an  expense  of \u20ac(64) million, relating to \u20ac1 million in net provisions for risks and charges over FY20 and \u20ac(65) million in non-current income and expenses.\n\nThe Covid-19 health crisis has not had a material impact on earnings for Pernod Ricard SA.\n\nFinally, income tax comprised tax income of \u20ac163 million related to the effects of the tax consolidation in FY20.\n\nAs a result, net profit for FY20 was \u20ac1,178 million.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Analysis of the FY20 balance sheet\n\n## Assets\n\nTotal  net  fixed  assets  stood  at  \u20ac13,716 million  at  30 June 2020 compared with \u20ac12,948 million for the previous year, i.e. an  increase of \u20ac768 million. The main changes observed are as follows:\n\n- an  increase  of  \u20ac16 million  in  property,  plant  and  equipment  and \u0097 intangible assets;\n- an increase of \u20ac752 million in financial assets due primarily to: \u0097\n- a  change  in  investments  of  \u20ac37 million,  including  PR  Cesam's \u0097 capital increase for \u20ac38 million,\n- an  increase  in  impairment  of  securities  for  \u20ac28 million,  including \u0097 \u20ac23 million for PR Cesam,\n- the increase in dividends due and receivables from associates of \u0097 \u20ac195 million,\n- an increase in own treasury shares of \u20ac544 million, \u0097\n- an increase in guarantee deposits of \u20ac4 million. \u0097\n\nCurrent  assets  amounted  to  \u20ac2,942 million  during  the  financial  year, i.e. an increase of \u20ac614 million compared with 30 June 2019. The main movements include:\n\n- a decrease of \u20ac4 million in trade receivables; \u0097\n- an increase of \u20ac584 million in other receivables, consisting of: \u0097\n- an increase in government receivables of \u20ac15 million, \u0097\n- an  increase  in  sundry  receivables  of  \u20ac569 million,  mainly  due  to \u0097 the increase in group financial receivables;\n- an increase in cash and cash equivalents of \u20ac115 million, attributable \u0097 chiefly  to  negative  changes  of  \u20ac26 million  on  financial  instruments and \u20ac141 million on cash;\n- a decrease in marketable securities of \u20ac75 million; \u0097\n- a decrease in prepaid expenses of \u20ac5 million. \u0097\n\nPrepaid  expenses  and  deferred  charges  amounting  to  \u20ac581 million consist  of  unrealised  foreign  exchange  losses,  bond  redemption premiums  and  prepaid  expenses,  which  changed  respectively  by \u20ac(55) million,  \u20ac14 million  and  \u20ac(5) million  between  30 June  2019  and 30 June 2020.\n\n## Liabilities\n\nShareholders'  equity  amounted  to  \u20ac6,505 million  at  30 June 2020, compared with \u20ac6,148 million at 30 June 2019. The main movements for the period were:\n\n- profit for the financial year of \u20ac1,178 million; \u0097\n- the payment of the balance of the dividend for FY19 of \u20ac512 million; \u0097\n- the payment of an interim dividend of \u20ac1.18 per share in respect of \u0097 FY20, amounting to \u20ac308 million. This interim dividend was paid on 10 July 2020.",

This  change  was attributable to:\n\n- a  decrease  in  the  provision  for  post-employment  benefits  of \u0097 \u20ac5 million;\n- a decline in the provision for foreign exchange losses of \u20ac24 million; \u0097\n- a decrease in provisions relating to the coverage of \u0097 performance-based  share  and  employee  share  ownership  plans  of \u20ac64 million.\n\nDuring  the  period,  borrowings  increased  by  \u20ac2,279 million.  This  was mainly due to:\n\n- bond issuance for \u20ac3,500 million; \u0097\n- bond  redemption  for  \u20ac850 million  and  $500 million  (equivalent  to \u0097 \u20ac432 million);\n- the revaluation of US dollar-denominated bonds for \u20ac56 million; \u0097\n- the change in accrued interest for \u20ac5 million. \u0097\n\nThe \u20ac1,199 million decrease in operating debts is explained primarily by:\n\n- the  decrease  in  other  debts  amounting  to  \u20ac1,191 million,  of  which \u0097 \u20ac1,214 million from a decrease in the Pernod Ricard Finance current account,  \u20ac27 million  from  the  increase  in  intragroup  creditors' liabilities and tax current accounts and the \u20ac3 million fall in dividends to pay;\n- the \u20ac10 million increase in trade payables; \u0097\n- the \u20ac17 million decrease in tax and social security payables. \u0097\n\nThe  deferred  income  and  adjustment  accounts  of  \u20ac468 million  at 30 June  2020  comprise  the  \u20ac26 million  decrease  in  the  value  of unrealised foreign exchange gains compared with 30 June 2019.\n\n<!-- image -->",

General  accounting  principles  were applied,  in  accordance  with  the  prudence  principle,  using  certain assumptions whose objective is to provide a true and fair  view  of  the Company. These principles are:\n\n- going concern; \u0097\n- consistency of accounting policies from one financial year to the next; \u0097\n- accruals basis of accounting; \u0097\n- and  in  accordance  with  the  general  rules  of  drawing  up  and \u0097 presenting the annual financial statements.\n\nBalance  sheet  assets  and  liabilities  are  measured,  depending  on  the specific items, at their historical cost, contribution cost or market value.\n\n## Intangible assets 1.\n\nThe brands acquired from the merger of Pernod and Ricard in 1975 and from subsequent mergers are the Company's main intangible assets.\n\nIntangible assets are initially measured at cost; depreciation has been calculated on a straight-line basis over their expected useful life.\n\n## Property, plant and equipment 2.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is initially measured at cost (purchase price  plus  ancillary  costs  but  not  including  fees  incurred  in connection with asset purchases). Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line  or  declining-balance  methods,  on  the  basis  of  the estimated useful lives of the assets:\n\n- buildings: between 20 and 50 years (straight line); \u0097\n- fixtures and fittings: 10 years (straight line); \u0097\n- machinery and equipment: five years (straight line); \u0097\n- office  furniture  and  equipment:  10  years  (straight  line)  or  4  years \u0097 (reducing balance).\n\n## Financial assets 3.\n\nThe  gross  value  of  investments  is  composed  of  their  acquisition  cost, excluding ancillary costs.\n\nIf  the  value  in  use  of  investments  is  lower  than  their  acquisition  cost, a provision  for  impairment  is  recognised  in  financial  income/(expense) for the amount of the difference.\n\nValue in use is determined on the basis of a multi-criteria analysis taking into account, depending on the nature of the investment:\n\n- either  the  share  of  equity  of  the  affiliate  that  these  securities \u0097 represent;\n- or  the  intrinsic  value  and  economic  and  financial  potential  of  the \u0097 affiliate, notably by reference to the net asset value, for example by using the cash flow projection method or identifying the unrealised gains on assets held by the affiliates.\n\n## Receivables 4.\n\nReceivables  are  recognised  at  their  nominal  value.  A  provision  is recognised  in  the  event  that  their  value  falls  below  the  net  carrying amount at the balance sheet date.\n\n## Marketable securities 5.\n\nThis item includes the treasury shares acquired for the allocation of stock option and performance-based share plans from the time of acquisition.\n\nA  liability  is  recognised  when  it  becomes  probable  that  the  rights  to receive  the  marketable  securities  concerned  under  the  plans  will  be exercised.  For  other  marketable  securities,  an  impairment  provision  is recognised when the cost price is higher than the market price.\n\n## Bonds 6.\n\nRedemption premiums are amortised over the life of the loans.\n\n## Provisions for risks and charges 7.\n\nProvisions for risks and charges are recognised in accordance with French Accounting Regulation 2000-06 on liabilities, issued on 7 December 2000 by the French Accounting Regulatory Committee (CRC).\n\nThis  accounting regulation provides that a liability be recognised when an entity  has  an  obligation  towards  a  third  party  and  that  it  is  probable  or certain  that  this  obligation  will  cause  an  outflow  of  resources  to  the  third party without equivalent consideration being received. A present obligation must exist at the balance sheet date for a provision to be recognised.\n\n## Pensions and other long-term employee benefits 8.\n\nSince  the  year  ended  on  30 June  2014,  the  Company  has  opted  to recognise  the  full  liability  for  pensions  and  other  long-term  employee benefits in the balance sheet, as provided by recommendation 2013-02. At  30 June  2020,  the  provision  for  pensions  and  other  long-term employee benefits was \u20ac51 million.\n\n## Translation of foreign currency-denominated items 9.\n\nPayables,  receivables  and  cash  balances  denominated  in  foreign currencies are translated into euros as follows:\n\n- translation of all payables, receivables and cash balances \u0097 denominated in foreign currencies at year-end rates;\n- recognition of differences compared to the amounts at which these \u0097 items were initially recognised under prepaid expenses and deferred charges or deferred income and adjustment accounts (translation differences);\n- recognition  of  a  provision  for  currency  risk  for  any  unrealised \u0097 currency losses, after taking into account the effect of any offsetting foreign exchange hedging transactions.\n\nPernod  Ricard  has  several  hedging  relationships  and  generates  an overall  foreign  currency  position  for  the  hedging  instruments  and  the covered  items  that  are  not  part  of  a  hedging  relationship  in  order  to calculate the currency risk provision.\n\n## Forward financial instruments 10.\n\nDifferences  arising  from  changes  in  the  value  of  financial  instruments used  as  hedges  are  recognised  in  profit  and  loss  in  a  manner symmetrical  to  that  in  which  income  and  expenses  relating  to  the hedged item are recognised.\n\n## Corporate income tax 11.\n\nPernod  Ricard  SA  is  subject  to  the  French  tax  consolidation  system defined  by  the  law  of  31 December  1987.  Under  certain  conditions, this system allows income taxes payable by profitable companies to be offset against tax losses of other companies. The scheme is governed by articles 223 A et seq. of the French General Tax Code.\n\nEach  company  in  the  tax  group  calculates  and  accounts  for  its  tax expenses as if it were taxed as a stand-alone entity.\n\nThe effects of tax consolidation are recognised in the Pernod Ricard SA financial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->",

(1)\n- Changes related to allowances for impairment of investments. (2)\n\n## Provisions for risks and charges\n\n## Provision for currency losses\n\nThe  \u20ac129 million  provision  for  currency  losses  as  at  30 June  2020 consists  of  the  unrealised  currency  loss  for  unhedged  US  dollar receivables and payables.\n\n## Other provisions for risks\n\nOther provisions for risks correspond to:\n\n- provisions  for  risks  and  charges  relating  to  tax  consolidation  for \u0097 \u20ac121 million;\n- various provisions amounting to \u20ac136 million. \u0097\n\n## Provisions for pensions and other long-term employee benefits\n\n## Description and recognition of employee benefit obligations\n\nPernod Ricard SA's employee benefit obligations are composed of:\n\n- long-term  post-employment  benefits  (retirement  bonuses,  medical \u0097 expenses, etc.);\n- long-term benefits payable during the period of employment. \u0097\n\nThe liability arising as a result of the Company's net employee benefit obligation  is  recognised  in  provisions  for  risks  and  charges  on  the balance sheet.\n\n## Calculation of the provision with respect to the net benefit obligation\n\nThe provision recognised by Pernod Ricard SA is equal to the difference, for  each  benefit  plan,  between  the  present  value  of  the  employee benefit  obligation  and  the  value  of  plan  assets  paid  to  specialised entities in order to fund the obligation.\n\nThe present value of employee benefit obligations is calculated using the prospective method involving the calculation of a projected salary at the retirement date (projected unit credit method). The measurement is made at each balance sheet date and the personal data concerning employees is revised at least every three years. The calculation requires the  use  of  economic  assumptions  (inflation  rate  and  discount  rate) and assumptions concerning employees (mainly average salary increase, rate of employee turnover and life expectancy).\n\nAt  30 June  2020,  the  total  amount  of  benefit  obligations  was \u20ac51 million. These obligations are fully provisioned.\n\nFor information, the inflation rate used  for the valuation at 30 June 2020 was 1.75% and the discount rate was 1.5%.\n\nPlan assets are measured at their market value at each balance sheet date.\n\n## Accounting for actuarial gains and losses\n\nActuarial  gains  and  losses  arise  primarily  when  estimates  differ  from actual  outcomes,  or  when  there  are  changes  in  long-term  actuarial assumptions (e.g. discount rate, rate of increase of salaries, etc.).\n\nThe  Company  has  applied  the  option  set  out  in  recommendation 2013-02,  in  which  the  full  pension  liability  is  recognised,  since  the financial year ended 30 June 2014.\n\n## Components of the expense recognised for the financial year\n\nThe expense recognised in respect of the benefit obligations described above incorporates:\n\n- expenses  corresponding  to  the  acquisition  of  an  additional  year's \u0097 rights;\n- interest expense arising on the unwinding of the discount applied to \u0097 vested rights at the start of  the  year  (as  a  result  of  the  passage  of time);\n- income  corresponding  to  the  expected  return  on  plan  assets \u0097 measured  using  the  discount  rate  which  is  used  to  measure  plan liabilities;\n- income or expense corresponding to actuarial gains or losses; \u0097\n- income  or  expense  related  to  changes  to  existing  plans  or  the \u0097 creation of new plans;\n- the  income  or  expense  related  to  any  plan  curtailments  or \u0097 settlements.\n\n<!-- image -->",

They  are  initially  recognised  at acquisition cost, excluding ancillary costs.\n\nIf the value in use of investments is lower than their net carrying amount, a  provision  for  impairment  is  recognised  in  financial  income/(expense) in the amount of the difference. As disclosed in Note 1.3 to the financial statements, value in use is determined based on a multi-criteria analysis. This  takes  into  account,  depending  on  the  nature  of  the  investment, either  the  share  of  the  subsidiary's  equity  represented  by  the investment, or the value based on dividend yield and the financial and economic  potential  of  the  subsidiary,  with  particular  reference  to  the market value of its net assets (for example, by using cash flow projections or  identifying  unrealised  capital  gains  on  assets  held  by  subsidiaries). Estimates of the value in use of these investments are based on complex valuation models for subsidiaries which in turn own several subsidiaries and  require  management  to  exercise  significant  judgment  (particularly regarding  cash  flow  assumptions  and  taking  into  consideration  asset revaluations).\n\nGiven the weight of investments in the balance sheet, the complexity of the  models  used  and  their  sensitivity  to  changes  in  the  data  and assumptions underlying estimates, we considered the determination of the value in use of investments to be a key audit matter.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe  familiarized  ourselves  with  the  Company's  controls  covering  the process for determining the value in use of investments. Our procedures primarily consisted in:\n\n- verifying, based on information communicated to us, that the values in \u0097 use  for  investments  estimated  by  management  are  supported  by appropriate documentation of the valuation method and amounts used;\n- obtaining  and  analysing  the  valuation  report  on  certain  investments \u0097 produced by the Company's external valuation advisors;\n- comparing  data  used  in  investment  impairment  tests  with  source \u0097 documents by entity and the results of our audit procedures on these subsidiaries;\n- sample testing the arithmetical accuracy of values in use adopted by \u0097 the Company.\n\nWe  also  assessed  the  appropriateness  of  disclosures  in  Note 1.3  to  the financial statements.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\n## AUDIT FRAMEWORK\n\nWe  conducted  our  audit  in  accordance  with  professional  standards applicable  in  France.  We  believe  that  the  audit  evidence  we  have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nOur responsibilities under those standards are further described in the 'Statutory  Auditors'  Responsibilities  for  the  Audit  of  the  Financial Statements' section of our report.\n\n## INDEPENDENCE\n\nWe conducted our audit engagement in compliance with independence rules applicable to us, for the period from 1 July 2019 to the date of our report  and  in  particular  we  did  not  provide  any  prohibited  non-audit services referred to in Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014 or in the French Code of Ethics for statutory auditors ( Code de d\u00e9ontologie ).\n\n## Justification of Assessments - Key Audit Matters\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of Articles L.823-9 and R.823-7 of the  French  Commercial  Code  ( Code  de  commerce )  relating  to  the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit matters relating  to  risks  of  material  misstatement  that,  in  our  professional judgment,  were  of  most  significance  in  the  audit  of  the  financial statements  of  the  current  period,  as  well  as  how  we  addressed  those risks.\n\nThese  matters  were  addressed  in  the  context  of  our  audit  of  the financial statements as a whole, approved in the conditions mentioned above,  and  in  forming  our  opinion  thereon,  and  we  do  not  provide  a separate opinion on specific items of the financial statements.",

Based on these procedures, we attest the accuracy and fair presentation of this information.\n\nWith  respect  to  the  information  relating  to  items  that  your  Company considered likely to have an impact in the event of a public takeover bid or exchange offer, provided pursuant to Article L.225-37-5 of the French Commercial  Code  ( Code  de  commerce ), we  have  agreed  this information  to  the  source  documents  communicated  to  us.  Based  on these procedures, we have no observations to make on this information.\n\n## OTHER INFORMATION\n\nIn  accordance  with  French  law,  we  have  verified  that  the  required information concerning the identity of the shareholders and holders of the voting rights has been properly disclosed in the management report.\n\n## Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements\n\n## APPOINTMENT OF THE STATUTORY AUDITORS\n\nWe  were  appointed  as  statutory  auditors  of  Pernod  Ricard  by  the Shareholders' Meeting held on 13 May 2003 for Deloitte & Associ\u00e9s and on 17 November 2016 for KPMG S.A.\n\nAs  at  30 June 2020,  Deloitte  &  Associ\u00e9s  and  KPMG S.A.  were  in  the 17 th year and 4 th year of total uninterrupted engagement, respectively.\n\n## Responsibilities of Management and those charged with Governance for the Financial Statements\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  French  accounting principles  and  for  such  internal  control  as  management  determines  is necessary  to  enable  the  preparation  of  financial  statements  that  are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn  preparing  the  financial  statements,  management  is  responsible  for assessing  the  Company's  ability  to  continue  as  a  going  concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless it is expected to liquidate the Company or to cease operations.\n\nThe  Audit  Committee  is  responsible  for  monitoring  the  financial reporting  process  and  the  effectiveness  of  internal  control  and  risks management  systems  and  where  applicable,  its  internal  audit, regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures.\n\nThe financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors.\n\n## Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements\n\n## OBJECTIVE AND AUDIT APPROACH\n\nOur role is to issue a report on the financial statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a  high  level  of  assurance,  but  is  not  a  guarantee  that  an  audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a  material  misstatement  when  it  exists.  Misstatements  can  arise  from fraud  or  error  and  are  considered  material  if,  individually  or  in  the aggregate,  they  could  reasonably  be  expected  to  influence  the economic  decisions  of  users  taken  on  the  basis  of  these  financial statements.\n\nAs  specified  in  Article L.823-10-1  of  the  French  Commercial  Code ( Code de commerce ), our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company.\n\nAs  part  of  an  audit  conducted  in  accordance  with  professional standards  applicable  in  France,  the  statutory  auditor  exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:\n\n- identifies  and  assesses  the  risks  of  material  misstatement  of  the \u0097 financial  statements,  whether  due  to  fraud  or  error,  designs  and performs  audit  procedures  responsive  to  those  risks,  and  obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a  basis  for  his  opinion.  The  risk  of  not  detecting  a  material misstatement  resulting  from  fraud  is  higher  than  for  one  resulting from  error,  as  fraud  may  involve  collusion,  forgery,  intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in \u0097 order  to  design  audit  procedures  that  are  appropriate  in  the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control;\n- evaluates  the  appropriateness  of  accounting  policies  used  and  the \u0097 reasonableness  of  accounting  estimates  and  related  disclosures made by management in the financial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This  assessment  is  based  on  the audit  evidence  obtained  up  to  the  date  of  his  audit  report. However, future  events  or  conditions  may  cause  the  Company  to cease  to  continue  as  a  going  concern.  If  the  statutory  auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention  in  the  audit  report  to  the  related  disclosures  in  the financial  statements  or,  if  such  disclosures  are  not  provided  or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein.\n- evaluates  the  overall  presentation  of  the  financial  statements  and \u0097 assesses  whether  these  statements  represent  the  underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n\n## REPORT TO THE AUDIT COMMITTEE\n\nWe submit a report to the Audit Committee which includes in particular a  description  of  the  scope  of  the  audit  and  the  audit  program implemented,  as  well  as  the  results  of  our  audit.  We  also  report, if any, significant deficiencies in internal control regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures that we have identified.\n\nOur  report  to  the  Audit  Committee  includes  the  risks  of  material misstatement  that,  in  our  professional  judgment,  were  of  most significance  in  the  audit  of  the  financial  statements  of  the  current period  and  which  are  therefore  the  key  audit  matters,  that  we  are required to describe in this audit report.\n\nWe also provide the Audit Committee with the declaration provided for in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) N\u00b0 537/2014, confirming our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France such as  they  are  set  in  particular  by  Articles L.822-10  to  L.822-14  of  the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ) and in the French Code of Ethics for statutory auditors. Where appropriate, we discuss with the Audit Committee the risks that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and the related safeguards.\n\nParis-La D\u00e9fense, 17 September 2020\n\nThe Statutory Auditors French original signed by\n\nKPMG Audit\n\nA division of KPMG\u00a0S.A.\n\nEric Ropert        Caroline Bruno-Diaz\n\nPartner                   Partner\n\nDeloitte & Associ\u00e9s\n\nDavid Dupont-Noel Partner",

This  report  on regulated agreements  should be read in conjunction and construed in accordance  with  French  law  and  professional  auditing  standards applicable  in  France.  It  should  be  understood  that  the  agreements reported on are only those provided by the French Commercial Code (Code  de  Commerce)  and  that  the  report  does  not  apply  to  those related  party  transactions  described  in  IAS  24  or  other  equivalent accounting standards.\n\nTo the Pernod Ricard Shareholders' Meeting,\n\nAs Statutory Auditors of your Company, we hereby present our report on regulated agreements.\n\nThe  terms  of  our  engagement  require  us  to  communicate  to  you, based on information provided to us, the principal terms and conditions of  those  agreements  brought  to  our  attention  or  which  we  may  have discovered  during  the  course  of  our  audit,  as  well  as  the  reasons justifying that such agreements are in the Company's interest, without expressing  an  opinion  on  their  usefulness  and  appropriateness  or identifying  such  other  agreements,  if  any.  It  is  your  responsibility, pursuant  to  Article  R.  225-31  of  the  French  Commercial  Code ( Code de commerce ),  to  assess  the  interest  involved  in  respect  of  the conclusion of these agreements for the purpose of approving them.\n\nOur role is also to provide you with the information stipulated in Article R. 225-31 of the French Commercial Code  relating to the implementation  during  the  past  year  of  agreements  previously approved by the Shareholders' Meeting, if any.\n\nWe  conducted  the  procedures  we  deemed  necessary  in  accordance with  the  professional  guidelines  of  the  French  National  Institute  of Statutory  Auditors  ( Compagnie  Nationale  des  Commissaires  aux Comptes )  relating  to  this  engagement.  These  procedures  consisted  in cross-checking the information provided to us with the relevant source documents.\n\n## Agreements submitted to the approval of the shareholders' meeting\n\n## AGREEMENTS AUTHORISED DURING THE YEAR\n\nWe hereby inform you that we have not been advised of any agreement authorised  during  the  year  to  be  submitted  to  the  approval  of  the Shareholders'  Meeting  pursuant  to  Article  L.  225-38  of  the  French Commercial Code.\n\n## Agreements previously approved by the Shareholders' Meeting\n\n## AGREEMENTS APPROVED IN PRIOR YEARS THAT REMAINED IN FORCE DURING THE FINANCIAL YEAR\n\nPursuant  to  Article  R.  225-30  of  the  French  Commercial  Code, we have been informed that the following agreement, previously approved  by  prior  Shareholders'  Meetings,  has  remained  in force during the year.\n\n## \u20ac2,500,000,000 Multicurrency Revolving Facility Agreement\n\nThe Board of Directors' meeting of 19 April 2017 authorised the signature of a new  loan  agreement  in  English  entitled  '\u20ac2,500,000,000 Multicurrency  Revolving  Facility  Agreement'  with,  amongst  others, BNP Paribas  and  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Corporate  Investment  Bank  as Mandated Lead Arrangers and Bookrunners and BNP Paribas and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank as Original Lenders, under which the  lenders  would  make  available  to  the  Company,  to  Pernod  Ricard Finance  and  to  the  other  companies  of  the  Group  party  to  the agreement, a revolving loan facility of a maximum principal amount of \u20ac2,500,000,000.\n\nPernod  Ricard  undertook  to  guarantee  under  certain  conditions, as joint and several guarantor, compliance with the payment obligations of the other borrowing companies of the Group.\n\nThis new loan agreement signed on 14 June 2017 reduces the contract margin and extends its maturity.\n\nNo  amounts  were  drawn  down  by  Pernod  Ricard  and  its  subsidiaries under  this  loan  agreement  during  the  year  ended  30  June  2020. Non-use fees for the syndicated loan facility totalled \u20ac2,431,771 for the year ended 30 June 2020.\n\nPernod  Ricard  invoices  a  guarantee  commission  at  market  rates  to Group  companies  exercising  their  drawing  rights  in  respect  of  the guarantee granted by Pernod Ricard to certain of its subsidiaries under the loan agreement; the amount of this commission may vary in line with market conditions. No subsidiaries exercised their drawing rights in the year  ended  30 June  2020  and  accordingly,  Pernod  Ricard  did  not invoice any guarantee commission to its subsidiaries.\n\nThis  loan  agreement  provides  Pernod  Ricard,  Pernod  Ricard  Finance and the other Group companies with a multicurrency revolving credit facility for their financing needs.\n\n## Corporate officers involved:\n\n- Mr.  Wolfgang  Colberg,  also  member  of  the  Deutsche  Bank  AG \u0097 Regional Board (party to the loan agreement).\n- Mrs.  Veronica  Vargas,  also  Director,  Strategic  and  Acquisition \u0097 Finance,  of  Soci\u00e9t\u00e9  G\u00e9n\u00e9rale  Group  (party  to  the  loan  agreement), until 17 September 2019.\n\nParis-La D\u00e9fense, 17 September 2020\n\nThe Statutory Auditors\n\nKPMG Audit\n\nDivision of KPMG S.A.\n\nEric Ropert       Caroline Bruno-Diaz\n\nPartner                   Partner\n\nDeloitte & Associ\u00e9s\n\nDavid Dupont-Noel\n\nPartner\n\n<!-- image -->",

We  propose  that  you  adopt  this  amendment  in  the  first resolution  so  that  the  new  vote-counting  rules  can  be  applied  to subsequent resolutions on the agenda of the Shareholders' Meeting.\n\n## Resolutions presented at the Ordinary Shareholders' Meeting 8.2.2\n\n## SECOND TO FOURTH RESOLUTIONS\n\n## Approval of the annual financial statements and allocation of net profit\n\nThe  purpose  of  the 2 nd resolution is  to  approve  the  Pernod  Ricard Parent Company financial statements for FY20.\n\nThe  purpose  of  the 3 rd resolution is  to  approve  the  Pernod  Ricard consolidated financial statements for FY20.\n\nThe  purpose  of  the 4 th resolution is to  allocate  the  net  profit. It is proposed  that  the  dividend  for  FY20  be  set  at  \u20ac2.66  per  share. An interim  dividend  payment  of  \u20ac1.18  per  share  having  been  paid on 10 July 2020, the balance, amounting to \u20ac1.48 per share, would be detached on 9 December 2020 (with a record date of 10 December 2020 and paid on 11 December 2020).\n\n## FIFTH RESOLUTION\n\n## Approval of the regulated agreements\n\nIt  is  proposed  that,  by  voting  on  the 5 th resolution ,  you  approve  the regulated  agreements  concluded  or  still  in  force  during  FY20,  as described  in  the  Statutory  Auditors'  special  report  (see Section 7 'Pernod Ricard SA  Parent  Company  Financial  Statements'  of  the universal  registration  document).  These  relate  mainly  to  agreements concluded  in  the  context  of  financing  transactions  between  the Company  and  companies  or  affiliates  with  which  it  has  Directors  or Executives in common.\n\n## SIXTH TO EIGHTH RESOLUTIONS\n\n## Composition of the Board: renewals of Directors\n\nInformation  regarding  the  Directors  for  whom  renewal  of  the  term  of office  or  appointment  is  proposed,  appears  in  Section 2  'Corporate Governance' of the universal registration document.\n\nThe  directorship  of  Mr Alexandre  Ricard  expires  at  the  close  of  this Shareholders'  Meeting.  It  is  thus  proposed  that,  by  voting  on  the 6 th resolution , you  renew  his  directorship  for  a  term  of  four  years expiring at the close of the Shareholders' Meeting to be held in 2024 to approve the financial statements for the previous financial year.\n\nThe  directorship  of  Mr C\u00e9sar  Giron  expires  at  the  close  of  this Shareholders'  Meeting.  It  is  thus  proposed  that,  by  voting  on  the 7 th resolution , you  renew  his  directorship  for  a  term  of  four  years expiring at the close of the Shareholders' Meeting to be held in 2024 to approve the financial statements for the previous financial year.\n\nThe  directorship  of  Mr Wolfgang  Colberg  expires  at  the  close  of  this Shareholders'  Meeting.  It  is  thus  proposed  that,  by  voting  on  the 8 th resolution , you  renew  his  directorship  for  a  term  of  four  years expiring at the close of the Shareholders' Meeting to be held in 2024 to approve the financial statements for the previous financial year.\n\nThus, at the close of the Shareholders' Meeting, the Board of Directors would comprise thirteen members (including two Directors representing the  employees),  including  six  Independent  Directors  (54.5%)  and  five women  (45%),  in  accordance  with  the  recommendations  of  the AFEP- MEDEF Code and the law.\n\n## NINTH RESOLUTION\n\n## Directors' compensation\n\nThe  purpose  of  the 9 th resolution is  to  set  the  annual    amount  of compensation  allocated  to  the  Board  of  Directors.

The purpose of the 17 th resolution is to allow employees and corporate officers in certain countries outside of France to subscribe to Company shares with similar benefits in terms of economic profile to those offered to employees in the 16 th resolution, in particular,  when  local  legal  and/or  tax  constraints  make  the  implementation  of  the  employee  shareholding  plan  in  the  context  of  the 16 th resolution impossible or difficult.\n\nIt  is  stated  that  these  delegations  of  authority  allow  share  capital  increases  and  that  they  could  not  be  used  during  a  public offering for Company shares.\n\n## SIXTEENTH RESOLUTION\n\nDelegation of authority to increase the share capital through the issue of shares or securities granting access to the share capital, with cancellation of preferential subscription rights, reserved for members of a company saving plan\n\nBy voting on the 16 th resolution , you delegate authority to the Board of Directors to decide on share capital increases reserved for employees and/or corporate officers who are members of an employee savings plan in place within Pernod Ricard. It is specified that the capital increase is limited to a maximum nominal amount of 2% of the share capital at the close of this Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nThis limit is the same as the limit for the 17 th resolution below, with the  reminder  that  it  is  deducted  from  the  Overall  Limit  and  the maximum amount of  any  capital  increase  set  respectively  in  the 13 th and  14 th resolutions  of  the  Shareholders'  Meeting  dated 8 November 2019.\n\nThe issue price for the new shares or securities granting access to the share capital may not be more than 20% below the average of the listed closing prices of Pernod Ricard shares on the regulated Euronext Paris market during the 20 trading sessions prior to the date of the decision setting the opening date for the subscription period, nor may the issue price exceed this average.\n\nThis delegation of authority is granted for 26 months from the date of today's Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  may  not  make  the  decision  to  use  this delegation of authority as from the date on which a third party files a  takeover  bid  for  the  Company  shares  unless  it  obtains  prior authorisation from the Shareholders' Meeting; this restriction shall remain in effect until the end of the offer period.\n\n## SEVENTEENTH RESOLUTION\n\nDelegation of authority to decide on a share capital increase through the issue of shares or securities granting access to the share capital, with cancellation of preferential subscription rights, reserved for certain categories of beneficiaries\n\nThe 2% limit of the share capital of this resolution is common with the  limit  of  the  16 th resolution  above,  with  the  reminder  that  it  is deducted from the Overall Limit and the maximum amount of any capital increase set respectively in the 13 th and 14 th resolutions of the Shareholders' Meeting dated 8 November 2019.\n\nThe  17 th resolution  seeks  to  adapt  the  conditions  of  the  employee shareholding plan set in the 16 th resolution to the local legal and/or tax constraints  to  allow  employees  and/or  corporate  officers  in  certain countries  outside  France  to  subscribe  to  shares  of  the  Company  with similar  benefits,  in  terms  of  economic  profile,  to  those  given  to employees under the 16 th resolution.\n\nThe share capital increase may be reserved for (i) certain categories of employees  and/or  corporate  officers,  (ii) UCITS  or  other  employee shareholding  entities  whose  unitholders  or  shareholders  are  persons described in (i), or (iii) any entity or banking institution with the exclusive purpose  of  subscribing  to  Company  shares  or  any  other  financial instrument in order to facilitate access to the capital of the Company for employees  and/or  corporate  officers  outside  France  or  to  similar investment formulas.\n\nThe  issue  price  of  new  shares  or  securities  granting  access  to  the Company's capital will be set by the Board of Directors and (a) may not be more than 20% below the average of the listed closing prices of the Pernod Ricard share recorded on the regulated Paris market over the 20 trading sessions preceding the date of the decision setting the opening date of the subscription period under this resolution, nor exceed such average or (b) will be equal to the price set for the shares issued as part of the capital increase reserved for members of company savings plans pursuant to the 16 th resolution of this Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nThis  delegation  of  authority  is  granted  for  18 months  from  the  date  of today's Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  may  not  make  the  decision  to  use  this delegation of authority as from the date on which a third party files a  takeover  bid  for  the  shares  of  the  Company  unless  it  obtains prior authorisation from the Shareholders' Meeting; this restriction shall remain in effect until the end of the offer period.\n\nBy  voting  on  the 17 th resolution ,  we  request  that,  in  accordance  with the provisions of the French Commercial Code, you delegate authority to the Board of Directors to decide on a capital increase of a maximum nominal  amount  corresponding  to  2%  of  the  share  capital at  the close  of  this  Shareholders'  Meeting,  by  way  of  an  issue  of  shares  or securities  granting  access  to  the  share  capital,  reserved  for  a  certain category(ies) of beneficiaries with cancellation of preferential subscription rights, in favour of such beneficiaries.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Transactions involving blocks of shares may account for the entire share buyback programme.\n\nThese  transactions  may  be  carried  out  during  periods  considered appropriate by the Board of Directors. However, during a public offering period, buybacks may only be carried out if they:\n\n- enable  the  Company  to  comply  with  its  prior  commitments \u0097 undertaken before the launch of the public offering;\n- are  undertaken  in  connection  with  the  pursuit  of  a  share  buyback \u0097 programme that was already in progress;\n- fall  within  the  scope  of  the  objectives  referred  to  in  items  (i) to \u0097 (iii) above; and\n- cannot cause the offer to fail. \u0097\n\nThe Shareholders'  Meeting  decides  that  the  maximum  purchase  price per share shall be \u20ac270, excluding acquisition costs.\n\nUnder article R. 225-151 of the French Commercial Code, the Shareholders' Meeting sets the total maximum amount allocated to the  share  buyback  programme  authorised  above  at  \u20ac7,070,667,120, corresponding to a maximum number of 26,187,656 shares purchased at the maximum unit price of \u20ac270 as authorised above.\n\nThe  Shareholders'  Meeting  delegates  authority  to  the  Board  of Directors, with the option for it to delegate these powers in turn under the conditions provided for by law, in the event of transactions on the Company's share capital, and in particular a change in the par value of the  share,  a  share  capital  increase via the  capitalisation  of  reserves, a granting  of  bonus  shares,  stock  split  or  reverse  stock  split,  to  adjust the above-mentioned maximum purchase price in order to take account of the impact of such transactions on the share value.\n\nThe Board of Directors may also carry out, in accordance with applicable legal  and regulatory provisions, the reassignment to another objective of shares  previously  bought  back  (including  under  a  previous authorisation) and their sale (on- or off-market).\n\nThe  Shareholders'  Meeting  grants  the  Board  of  Directors  full  powers, with  the  option  for  it  to  delegate  these  powers  in  turn  under  the conditions  provided  for  by  law,  to  decide  and  implement  this authorisation,  to  specify,  if  necessary,  its  terms  and  decide  on  its conditions  with  the  option  to  delegate  implementation  of  the  share buyback programme, under the conditions provided for by law, and in particular to place all stock exchange orders, enter into any agreements, with a view to keeping registers of share purchases and sales, make all declarations  notably  to  the  French  Financial  Markets  Authority  (AMF) and  to  any  other  official  body  which  may  take  its  place,  complete  all formalities and, in general, do whatever may be necessary.\n\nThis authorisation will be valid for a period of 18 months from the date of this Shareholders' Meeting and cancels, as from this same date, for any unused portion, the authorisation granted to the Board of Directors by the  Combined  Shareholders'  Meeting  of  8 November  2019  in  its 11 th resolution to trade in the Company's shares.",

The  Censors  may attend the committees established by the Board of Directors.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  shall  determine  the  duration  of  their  term  of office,  which  it  may  terminate  at  any  time.  The  term  of  office  of  the Censors may be renewed.\n\nThe  Censors  shall  be  convened  to  the  Board  of  Directors'  meetings, which  they  shall attend in a consultative capacity; however, their absence  shall  not  impair  the  validity  of  the  Board  of  Directors' deliberations.\n\nThe  compensation  arrangements  for  the  censor  or  censors  shall  be determined by the Board of Directors, which may pay them part of the fixed annual Directors'  fees compensation allocated  to  the  Directors by the Ordinary Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nCensors are bound by the same confidentiality obligations (obligation de discretion) as the Directors.'\n\n## 'Article 35 - Ordinary General Shareholders' Meetings\n\nI  - In order to validly deliberate, Ordinary Shareholders' Meetings must be made up of a number of shareholders present or represented holding at  least  one-fifth  of  shares  having  the  right  to  vote.

The deduction is no longer mandatory when the legal reserve reaches an amount equal to one-tenth of the share capital. It once again becomes mandatory in the event that, for whatever reason, this reserve falls below one-tenth of the share capital.\n\nFor the first distributable profit (dividend) as determined in accordance with the law, an amount corresponding to 6% of the fully paid up share is deducted,  subject  to  the  possibility  that  the  Board  of  Directors authorises shareholders who request to do so to pay up their shares in advance,  it  being  specified  that  the  payments  cannot  give  rise  to entitlement to the aforementioned initial dividend.\n\nThis initial dividend is not cumulative, i.e. if profits for the financial year are  not  sufficient  to  make  this  payment  or  are  only  sufficient  to  make the  payment  in  part,  the  shareholders  cannot  claim  this  on  profits generated in the following financial year.\n\nFrom  the  available  surplus,  the  Ordinary  Shareholders'  Meeting  may decide  to  deduct  all  amounts  it  considers  appropriate,  either  to  be carried  forward  to  the  following  financial  year  or  to  be  transferred  to extraordinary or special reserves, with or without special allocations.\n\nThe  balance  is  distributed  among  shareholders  as  an  additional dividend.\n\nThe  Ordinary  Shareholders'  Meeting  is  authorised  to  distribute non-statutory  reserves  set  up  in  previous  years  any  amounts  that  it considers should be either:\n\n- distributed  to  the  shareholders  or  allocated  to  total  or  partial \u0097 depreciation of the shares; or\n- accumulated or used for the repurchase and cancellation of shares. \u0097\n\nWholly  depreciated  shares  are  replaced  by  dividend  right  certificates granting  the  same  rights  as  the  existing  shares,  with  the  exception  of entitlement to the initial statutory dividend and capital repayment.\n\nDividend  payment  terms  and  conditions  are  fixed  by  the  Ordinary Shareholders' Meeting or, failing that, by the Board of Directors within the maximum period set by law.\n\nIn  deliberating  on  the  financial  statements  for  the  financial  year, the Ordinary  Shareholders'  Meeting  has  the  option  to  grant  each shareholder the choice between a cash or stock dividend, for all or part of a dividend or interim dividend payment.\n\nDividends must be paid within a maximum of nine months following the year end. This period may be extended by court ruling. Dividends will be transferred to the French State after the statutory period, i.e. five years.\n\n## Changes in the share capital and the rights attached to shares 9.1.10\n\nAny changes in the share capital or the voting rights attached to the shares making up the share capital shall be governed by the standard legal provisions as the bylaws do not contain any specific provisions in this respect.\n\n## The Statutory Auditors 9.1.11\n\nDeloitte  &  Associ\u00e9s,  member  of  the Compagnie  R\u00e9gionale  des Commissaires  aux  Comptes  de  Versaill es  (Versailles  regional  auditors' association),  represented  by  Mr  David  Dupont-Noel,  whose  registered office  is  at  TSA  20303,  92030  La  D\u00e9fense  Cedex,  reappointed  by  the Shareholders'  Meeting  of  19 November  2017  for  a  term  of  six  financial years, which will end after the Shareholders' Meeting to be convened in 2023 to approve the preceding year's financial statements.\n\nKPMG SA, member of the Compagnie R\u00e9gionale des Commissaires aux Comptes  de  Versailles (Versailles regional auditors' association), represented by Ms  Caroline Bruno-Diaz and  Mr  \u00c9ric  Ropert, whose registered  office  is  at  Tour  Eqho,  2,  avenue  Gambetta, 92066 Paris La D\u00e9fense Cedex, and whose term of office as passed by the  Shareholders'  Meeting  of  17 November  2016  will  end  after  the Shareholders'  Meeting  to  be  convened  in  2022  to  approve  the preceding year's financial statements.\n\n## Fees of Statutory Auditors and members of their networks\n\nThe fees of the Statutory Auditors and members of their networks for the 12-month financial year are set out in Note 6.8 Fees of Statutory Auditors and  members  of  their  networks  for  the  12-month  financial  year in  Section 6  'Consolidated  financial  statements'  of  this  universal  registration document.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",
