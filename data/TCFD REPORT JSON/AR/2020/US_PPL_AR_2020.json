        "page_content": "## MESSAGE TO OUR SHAREOWNERS\n\n## DEAR SHAREOWNERS,\n\nFor 100 years, PPL has been a force for good in the communities we serve, putting people at the heart of all we do and providing energy that is essential to our quality of life.\n\nIn 2020, COVID-19 reinforced the vital role we play in our customers' lives. As hospitals responded to the public health crisis, as families and businesses struggled, as homes became o/f.ffices and classrooms, and as our communities coped with economic disruption, those we served counted on us more than ever.\n\nIn these unprecedented times, PPL delivered.\n\nWe provided electricity and natural gas safely and reliably to more than 10 million customers from the U.S. to the U.K. We delivered on our financial commitments to shareowners. We provided strong support in our communities. We remained committed to our long-term strategy of investing in the future even as we navigated an uncertain present. And we took bold steps to unlock shareowner value and better position PPL for long-term growth and success.\n\nBelow are highlights of our 2020 performance:\n\n## Responding e/f.ffectively to COVID-19\n\nAt the outset of the COVID-19 outbreak, we activated our pandemic plans and responded quickly and aggressively to implement social distancing, protect our employees and customers, and ensure business continuity.\n\nIn March, we adopted work-from-home measures for approximately 40% of our workforce and adjusted work processes and procedures to maximize social distancing for those still reporting to the workplace due to the nature of their jobs. We acted early to ensure that our critical suppliers were permitted to operate during emergency declarations. We kept employees informed and shared best practices across business lines in our approach to the pandemic.\n\nWhile well-positioned to weather the economic downturn due to our low-risk, rate-regulated business model, we also took steps to strengthen our financial position, including bolstering our liquidity position by $1 billion to guard against any disruptions to capital markets.\n\nAs a result of our e/f.ffective response, PPL served our customers in 2020 without missing a beat.\n\n## Achieving strong operational performance and customer satisfaction\n\nWe maintained strong transmission and distribution reliability across PPL, with customers experiencing, on average, fewer interruptions and shorter outage durations than in 2019 - this despite the challenges presented by COVID-19. In addition, we maintained exceptional generation reliability in Kentucky. And across PPL, we responded quickly and e/f.ffectively to severe weather, including Tropical Storm Isaias.\n\nVincent Sorgi President and Chief Executive O/f.fficer\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCraig A. Rogerson Independent Chair of the Board\n\nAs we remained focused on reliability, we provided a superior customer experience. We received three new J.D. Power awards for customer satisfaction in the U.S., raising our total to 54. In addition, we achieved over 9-out-of-10 ratings from U.K. customers and earned maximum incentive rewards under Ofgem's Broad Measure of Customer Satisfaction.\n\nAt the same time, we continued to invest in infrastructure to further improve our service to customers moving forward. Building on the $27 billion we invested over the past decade, we completed more than $3 billion in infrastructure improvements during 2020 to strengthen grid resilience, incorporate new technology and advance our clean energy strategy.\n\n## Delivering on our financial commitments\n\nAs we excelled operationally, we also managed significant headwinds to deliver on our financial commitments to shareowners.\n\nWe achieved earnings results within our guidance range despite approximately $130 million of unfavorable impact due to COVID-19 and milder than normal weather. In addition, we delivered on our commitment to return capital to shareowners, increasing our dividend for the 18th time in 19 years.\n\nUnfortunately, PPL's continued operational excellence did not translate to strong stock price performance in 2020, as the utility sector trailed the broader S&P 500 and PPL's stock performance lagged its peers, challenged by political and regulatory uncertainty in the U.K.\n\nOur Board of Directors and our leadership team are fully committed to changing this dynamic and improving PPL's total shareowner return.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Positioning PPL for future success\n\nWith this in mind, in August we launched a formal process to sell our U.K. utility business, Western Power Distribution (WPD), and reposition PPL as a high growth, U.S.-/f.locused energy company.\n\nThis resulted in our recently announced agreements to sell WPD to National Grid for \u00a37.8 billion, or $10.2 billion*, and acquire National Grid's Rhode Island electric and gas utility for $ 3.8 billion.\n\nThese transactions, which achieve all the objectives we set at the outset o/f.l our sale process, will unlock value /f.lor our shareowners, strengthen our credit metrics, enhance long-term earnings growth and predictability, and provide us greater /f.linancial /f.llexibility to invest in sustainable energy solutions.\n\nThis strategic repositioning re/f.llects our Board's continuous focus on delivering shareowner value. We expect to complete the WPD sale within /f.lour months o/f.l our 18 announcement and the Rhode Island acquisition within  one year. March\n\n## Advancing our clean energy strategy\n\nIn 2020, we also advanced our clean energy strategy to:\n\n- \u00b7 Decarbonize our owned generation.\n- \u00b7 Enable third-party decarbonization through transmission and distribution investments.\n- \u00b7 Decarbonize our non-generation operations.\n- \u00b7 Expand research and development in clean energy technology.\n\nAt the outset of the year, we established a more aggressive carbon reduction goal of at least 80% from 2010 levels by 2050 and accelerated our previous 70% goal by 10 years to 2040. We also adopted goals to electrify our /f.lleet vehicles.\n\nThroughout the year, we invested in our networks to enable increased electrification and large-scale additions of distributed energy resources in the future. In Kentucky, we secured regulatory approval for a 100-megawatt solar power purchase agreement (PPA) to meet increasing customer demand for clean energy options. Elsewhere, our Safari Energy subsidiary added more than 90 megawatts of owned solar capacity contracted via long-term PPAs.\n\nIn addition, we joined a five-year industry initiative to accelerate the development of low-carbon energy technology and advance a/f.ffordable pathways to economy-wide decarbonization. We did so because we recognize that going further faster than the goals we've set requires new technologies and systems that can be deployed safely, reliably and a/f.ffordably.\n\n## Making a positive impact on society\n\nAs we focused on these achievements, we also remained committed to supporting our communities beyond the energy we provide.\n\nWe o/f.ffered customers /f.llexible payment options and assistance with their energy bills in response to the impacts COVID-19 has had on our economy and our customers' financial health.\n\n*Net of transaction-related taxes and fees, and based on an average foreign currency rate of $1.35/\u00a3 as of March 12, 2021, inclusive of hedges.\n\nOur companies and foundations donated more than $2 million to support COVID-19 relief for individuals and families. Our employee and retiree charitable giving campaigns in the U.S. raised a record $7 million in pledges to strengthen our communities. And our companies and foundations donated more than $12 million overall.\n\nAt the same time, PPL continued to make a positive impact by supporting diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) as the world witnessed acts of racism and injustice that spurred unrest and highlighted inequities in our society.\n\nWe adopted a new enterprise-wide DEI strategy and commitments. We conducted focused discussions on race and social justice that will inform our e/f.fforts moving forward. PPL Foundation expanded its mission to support racial justice and equity initiatives more directly and launched a new scholarship program to encourage diverse candidates to pursue careers in engineering, IT, technical and trade roles. In addition, we continued to engage with community coalitions focused on race and equity issues.\n\nThese e/f.fforts will continue as we seek to support meaningful change and progress in the communities we serve.\n\n## Looking forward\n\nIn closing, we are tremendously proud of how your company performed in 2020, and of the strength, determination, creativity, compassion and resilience that our team of more than 12,000 displayed from the U.S. to the U.K. While we recognize our work is not done in seeing this pandemic through, we truly believe better days are ahead, and we are confident that PPL will emerge from this pandemic even stronger.\n\nLooking ahead, our strategy is sharper and more focused than ever. We aim to achieve industry-leading performance in safety, reliability, customer satisfaction and operational e/f.fficiency; to advance a clean energy transition while maintaining a/f.ffordability and reliability; to maintain a strong financial foundation and create long-term value for our shareowners; to foster a diverse and exceptional workplace; and to build strong communities in the areas we serve.\n\nThis is what EnergyForward means to us, and we're excited about our future as we begin a new century of service. We thank you for your continued investment in PPL, and we appreciate the trust you have placed in us.\n\nSincerely,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCraig A.raig Rogerson Independent Chair of the Board\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nVincent Vi t SorgiS i President and Chief Executive O/f.fficer",

See 'Combined Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Overview - Financial and Operational Developments - Initiation of Formal Process to Sell U.K. Utility Business.\n\n## Franchise and Licenses\n\nWPD's operations are regulated by Ofgem under the direction of the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority. Ofgem is a nonministerial government department and an independent National Regulatory Authority responsible for protecting the interests of existing and future electricity and natural gas consumers. The Electricity Act 1989 provides the fundamental framework for electricity companies and established licenses that require each DNO to develop, maintain and operate efficient distribution networks. WPD's operations are regulated under these licenses which set the outputs WPD needs to deliver to customers and associated revenues WPD is allowed to earn. WPD operates under a regulatory year that begins April 1 and ends March 31 of each year.\n\nOfgem has the formal power to propose modifications to each distribution license; however, licensees can appeal such changes to the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority. Generally, any potential changes to these licenses are reviewed with stakeholders in a formal regulatory consultation process prior to a formal change proposal.\n\n## Competition p\n\nAlthough WPD operates in non-exclusive concession areas in the U.K., it currently faces little competition with respect to endusers connected to its network. WPD's four DNOs are, therefore, regulated monopolies, opff erating under regulatory price controls.\n\n## Customers\n\nWPD provides regulated electricity distribution services to licensed third-party energy suppliers who use WPD's networks to transfer electricity to their customers, the end-users. WPD bills energy suppliers for this service and the supplier is responsible for billing its end-users. Ofgem requires that all licensed electricity distributors and suppliers become parties to the Distribution i Connection and Use of System Agreement. This agreement specifies how creditworthiness will be determined and, as a result, whether a supplier needs to collateralize its payment obligations.\n\n## U.K. Regulation and Rates g\n\n## Overview\n\nOfgem has adopted a price control regulatory framework with a balanced objective of enhancing and developing future electricity networks, controlling costs to customers and allowing DNOs, such as WPD's DNOs, to earn a fair return on their investments. This regulatory structure is focused on outputs and performance in contrast to traditional U.S. utility ratemaking that operates under a cost recovery model. Price controls are established based on long-term business plans developed by each DNO with substantial input from its stakeholders. To measure the outputs and performance, each DNO business plan includes incentive targets that allow for increases and/or reductions in revenues based on operational performance, which are intended to align returns with quality of service, innovation and customer satisfaction.\n\nFor comparative purposes, amounts listed below are in British pounds sterling, nominal prices and in calendar years unless otherwise noted.\n\n## Key Ratemaking Mechanisms\n\nPPL believes the U.K. electricity utility model is a premium jurisdiction in which to do business due to its significant stakeholder engagement, incentive-based structure and high-quality ratemaking mechanisms.tt\n\n## Current Price Control: RIIO-ED1\n\nWPD currently operates under an eight-year price control called RIIO-ED1, which commenced for electricity distribution companies on April 1, 2015. The regulatory framework is based on an updated approach for sustainable network regulation known as the \"RIIO\" model where Revenue = Incentives + Innovation + Outputs.",

        "page_content": "In coordination with numerous stakeholders, WPD developed its business plans for RIIO-ED1 building off its historical track record and long-term strategy of delivering industry-leading levels of performance at an efficient level of cost. As a result, all four of WPD's DNOs' business plans were accepted by Ofgem as \"well justified\" and were \"fast-tracked\" ahead of all other DNOs. WPD's DNOs were rewarded for being fast-tracked with preferential financial incentives, a higher return on equity andff higher cost savings retention under their business plans as discussed further below. However, an unintended consequence of being fast-tracked resulted in WPD being disadvantaged from a cost of debt recovery standpoint, as further discussed within ' (2) Real Return on capital from RAV ' below. V V\n\nWPD's combined RIIO-ED1 business plans as accepted by Ofgem included funding for total expenditures of approximately \u00a312.8 billion (nominal) over the eight-year period, as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Totex - \u00a38.5 billion (\u00a36.8 billion recovered as additions to RAV over time (\"Slow pot\"); \u00a31.7 billion recovered in the year spent in the plan (\"Fast pot\"));\n- \u00b7 Pension deficit funding - \u00a31.2 billion;\n- \u00b7 Cost of debt recovery - \u00a31.0 billion;\n- \u00b7 Pass Through Charges - \u00a31.6 billion (Property taxes, Ofgem fees and National Grid transmissions charges); and\n- \u00b7 Corporate income taxes recovery - \u00a30.5 billion.\n\nThe chart below illustrates the building blocks of allowed revenue and GAAP net income for the U.K. Regulated Segment.

For WPD, the base cost of equity collected in revenues was set at 6.4% (real). Base equity returns exclude inflation adjustments, allowances for incentive rewards/penalties and over/under collections driven by cost efficiencies. WPD's DNO base equity returns are calculated using an equity ratio of 35% of RAV. The equity ratio was reviewed and set during the RIIO-ED1 business plan process taking various stakeholder impacts into consideration such as costs to consumers, credit ratings and investor needs. The amounts of base real equity return for 2020, 2019 and 2018 were \u00a3177 million, \u00a3168 million and \u00a3160 million.\n\nIndexed cost of debt recovery (real) -As part of WPD's fast-track agreement with Ofgem for RIIO-ED1, WPD collects in y( ) revenues an assumed real cost of debt that is derived from a historical 10-year bond index (iBoxx) and adjusted annually for inflation. This calculated real cost of debt is then applied to 65% of RAV at the DNOs to determine the cost of debt revenue recovery. The cost of debt was set at 2.55% in the original \"well justified\" business plans. The recovery amounts are trued up annually as a component of the MOD true-up mechanism described within \" (9) MOD and Inflation True-Up (TRU) \" below.\n\nAs discussed above, WPD's cost of debt revenue allowances are derived from using a rolling 10-year trailing average of historical 10-year bond index (iBoxx); however, the cost of debt revenue allowances for all slow track companies are derived using an extending trailing average of the index. Under this approach, the trailing average period used is progressively extended from 10 to 20 years and consequently short-term fluctuations in the interest rate have a less pronounced effect on the regulatory cost of debt applied. Therefore, WPD's cost of debt recovery is significantly lower than it would have been had it been derived under the approach used for the slow-track companies.\n\nOver the 8-year RIIO-ED1 period WPD is expected to under-recover its cost of debt at the four DNOs, based upon the latest inflation assumptions and projected 10-year iBoxx bond indices rates, by approximately \u00a3300 million primarily driven by the previously discussed differing cost of debt recovery calculations. Under the terms of the fast track process, fast tracked companies were not supposed to be disadvantaged financially to slow track companies. It is currently unlikely, however, if WPD will be able to recover any of this under-recovery in the next price control period, RIIO-ED2, beginning April 1, 2023.\n\nInterest costs relating to long-term debt issued at WPD's holding companies are not recovered in revenues and for 2020, 2019 and 2018 were approximately \u00a358 million, \u00a357 million and \u00a346 million.\n\n- (3) Recovery of depreciation in revenues -Recovery of depreciation in regulatory revenues is one of the key mechanisms Ofgem uses to support financeable business plans that provide incentives to attract the continued substantial investment required in the U.K. Differences between GAAP and regulatory depreciation exist primarily due to differing assumptions on asset lives and because RAV is adjusted for inflation using RPI.d\n\nCompared to asset lives established for GAAP, asset lives established for ratemaking are set by Ofgem based on economic lives which results in improved DNO near-term revenues and cash flows during investment cycles. Under U.K. regulation prior to RIIO-ED1, electric distribution assets were depreciated on a 20-year asset life for the purpose of setting revenues. After review and consultation, Ofgem decided to use 45-year asset lives for RAV additions after April 1, 2015, with transitional arrangements available for DNOs fully demonstrating a need to ensure financeable plans. WPD adopted a transition that has a linear increase in asset lives from 20 to 45 years for additions to RAV in each year of RIIO-ED1 (with additions averaging a life of approximately 35 years over this period), which adds support to its credit metrics. RAV additions prior to March 31, 2015 continue to be recovered in revenues over 20 years.\n\nThe asset lives used to determine depreciation expense for GAAP purposes are not the same as those used for the depreciation of the RAV in setting revenues and, as such, vary by asset type and are based on the expected useful lives of the assets. Effective January 1, 2015, after completing a review of the useful lives of its distribution network assets, WPD set the weighted average useful lives to 69 years for GAAP depreciation expense.",

        "page_content": "Because Ofgem uses a real cost of capital, the RAV and recovery of depreciation are adjusted for inflation using RPI. The d inflation revenues collected in this line item help recover the cost of equity and debt returns on a \"nominal\" basis, compared to the \"real\" rates used to set the return component of base revenues.\n\nThis regulatory construct, in combination with the different assets lives used for ratemaking and GAAP, results in amounts collected by WPD as recovery of depreciation in revenues being significantly higher than the amounts WPD recorded for depreciation expense under GAAP. For 2020, 2019 and 2018, this difference was \u00a3458 million, \u00a3450 million and \u00a3444 million (pre-tax) and positively impacted net income. The difference is expected to continue in the \u00a3400 million to \u00a3460 million (pretax) range at least through 2022 (the last full calendar year of RIIO-ED1), assuming RPI of approximately 3.0% per year from 2021 through 2022 and based on expected RAV additions of approximately \u00a3800 million per year to prepare the distribution system for future U.K. energy objectives while maintaining premier levels of reliability and customer service.\n\n(4) Expenditure efficiency mechanisms -Ofgem introduced the concept of Totex in RIIO to ensure all DNOs face equal incentives in choosing between operating and capital solutions. Totex is split between immediate recovery (called \"Fast pot\") and deferred recovery as an addition to RAV (called \"Slow pot\"). The ratio of Slow pot to Fast pot was determined by each DNO in its business plan development. WPD established a Totex split of 80% Slow pot and 20% Fast pot for RIIO-ED1 to balance maximizing RAV growth with immediate cost recovery to support investment grade credit ratings. Comparatively, other DNOs on average used a ratio of approximately 70% Slow pot and 30% Fast pot for RIIO-ED1.\n\nOfgem also allows a Totex Incentive Mechanism that is intended to reward DNOs for cost efficiency. WPD's DNOs are able tod retain 70% of any amounts not spent against their RIIO-ED1 plan and bear 70% of any over-spends. Any amounts to be returned to customers are trued up in the AIP discussed below.\n\nBecause Fast pot cost recovery represents 20% of Totex expenditures and certain other costs are recovered in other components of revenue, Fast pot will not equal operation and maintenance expenses recorded for GAAP purposes.\n\n(5) Income Tax Allowance -For price control purposes, WPD collects income tax based on Ofgem's notional tax charge, which will not equal the amount of income tax expense recorded for GAAP purposes. The following table shows the amount of taxes collected in revenues and recorded under GAAP.\n\n|                             |   2020 |   2019 |   2018 |\n|-----------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Taxes collected in revenues |     55 |     56 |     58 |\n| Taxes recorded under GAAP   |    233 |    167 |    156 |\n\n(6) Other revenue included in base revenue -Other revenue included in base revenue primarily consists of pension deficit funding, pass through costs, profiling adjustments and legacy price control adjustments.\n\nRecovery of annual (normal) pension cost and pension deficit funding - Ofgem allows DNOs to recover annual (normal) y ( ) p p g pension costs through the Totex allocation, split between the previously described Fast pot (immediate recovery) and Slow pot recovery (as an addition to RAV). The amount of normal pension cost is computed by the pension trustees, using assumptions that differ from those used in calculating pension costs/income under GAAP. In addition, the timing of the revenue collection may not match the actual pension payment schedule, resulting in a timing difference of cash flows.\n\nIn addition, WPD recovers approximately 80% of pension deficit funding for certain of WPD's defined benefit pension plans in conjunction with actual costs similar to the Fast pot mechanism. The pension deficit is determined by the pension trustees on a triennial basis in accordance with their funding requirements. Pension deficit funding recovered in revenues was \u00a3155 million, \u00a3151 million and \u00a3147 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018. Following the completion of the 2019 Actuarial Valuations and Ofgem's 2020 Reasonableness Review, WPD expects to collect \u00a3142 million, \u00a3138 million and \u00a362 million in revenues through December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023.\n\nSee Note 12 to the Financial Statements for additional information on pension costs/income recognized under GAAP.\n\nRecovery of pass through costs - WPD recovers certain pass-through costs over which the DNO has no control such as property y p g taxes, National Grid transmission charges and Ofgem fees. Although these items are intended to be pass-through charges there could be timing differences, primarily related to property taxes, as to when amounts are collected in revenues and when amounts are expensed in the Statements of Income. WPD over-collected property taxes by \u00a330 million, \u00a337 million and \u00a338 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018. WPD expects to continue to over-recover property taxes until the end of RIIO-ED1. Amounts under-or over-recovered in revenues in a regulatory year are trued up through revenues two regulatory years later.",

        "page_content": "Profiling adjustments - Ofgem permitted DNOs the flexibility to make profiling adjustments to their base revenues within their g j business plans. These adjustments do not affect the total base revenue in real terms over the eight-year price control period but change the year in which the revenue is collected. In the first year of RIIO-ED1, WPD's base revenue decreased by 11.8% r compared to the final year of the prior price control period (DPCR5), primarily due to a change in profiling methodology and a lower weighted-average cost of capital. Base revenue then increased by approximately 2.5% per annum before inflation for regulatory years up to March 31, 2019 and will increase by approximately 1% per annum before inflation for each regulatory a year thereafter for the remainder of RIIO-ED1.\n\n(7) Incentives for developing high-quality business plans (known as fast-tracking) -For RIIO-ED1, Ofgem incentivized DNOs with certain financial rewards to develop \"well justified\" business plans that drive value to customers. WPD was awarded the following fast-track incentives:\n\n- \u00b7 an annual fast-track revenue incentive worth 2.5% of Totex (approximately \u00a325 million annually for WPD);\n- \u00b7 a real cost of equity rate of 6.4% compared to 6.0% for slow-tracked DNOs; and,\n- \u00b7 cost savings retention was established at 70% for WPD compared to approximately 55% for slow-tracked DNOs.\n\n(8) Allowed Revenue -Allowed revenue is the amount that a DNO can collect from its customers in order to fund its investment requirements.\n\nBase revenues are adjusted annually during RIIO-ED1 to arrive at allowed revenues. These adjustments are discussed in sections (9) through (13) below.\n\n## (9) MOD and Inflation True-Up (TRU)\n\nMOD - RIIO-ED1 includes an AIP that allows future base revenues, agreed with the regulator as part of the price control review, to be updated during the price control period for financial adjustments including taxes, pensions, cost of debt, legacy price control adjustments from preceding price control periods and adjustments relating to actual and allowed total expenditure together with the Totex Incentive Mechanism (TIM). The AIP calculates an incremental change to base revenue, known as the \"MOD\" adjustment.\n\n- \u00b7 The MOD provided by Ofgem in November 2016 included the TIM for the 2015/16 regulatory year, as well as the cost of debt calculation based on the 10-year trailing average to October 2016. This MOD of \u00a312 million reduced base revenue in calendar years 2017 and 2018 by \u00a38 million and \u00a34 million.\n- \u00b7 The MOD provided by Ofgem in November 2017 for the 2016/17 regulatory year was a \u00a339 million reduction to revenue that reduced base revenue in calendar years 2018 and 2019 by \u00a326 million and \u00a313 million.\n- \u00b7 The MOD provided by Ofgem in November 2018 for the 2017/18 regulatory year was a \u00a342 million reduction to revenue that reduced base revenue in calendar year 2019 and 2020 by \u00a328 million and \u00a314 million.\n- \u00b7 The MOD provided by Ofgem in November 2019 for the 2018/19 regulatory year was a \u00a381 million reduction to revenue that reduced base revenue in calendar year 2020 by \u00a354 million and will reduce base revenues in calendar year 2021 by \u00a327 million.\n- \u00b7 The MOD provided by Ofgem in November 2020 for the 2019/20 regulatory year was a \u00a3126 million reduction to revenue that will reduce base revenue in calendar years 2021 and 2022 by \u00a384 million and \u00a342 million.\n- \u00b7 The projected MOD for the 2020/2021 regulatory year is a \u00a3159 million reduction to revenue that is expected to reduce base revenue in calendar years 2022 and 2023 by \u00a3106 million and \u00a353 million.\n\nTRU - As discussed below in \" (10) Inflation adjusted, multi-year rate cycle ,\" the base revenue for the RIIO-ED1 period was set based on 2012/13 prices. Therefore, an inflation factor as determined by forecasted RPI, provided by HM Treasury, is applied to base revenue. Forecasted RPI is trued up to actuals and affects future base revenue two regulatory years later. This revenue change is called the \"TRU\" adjustment.\n\n- \u00b7 The TRU for the 2015/16 regulatory year was a \u00a331 million reduction to revenue that reduced base revenue in calendar years 2017 and 2018 by \u00a321 million and \u00a310 million.\n- \u00b7 The TRU for the 2016/17 regulatory year was a \u00a36 million reduction to revenue that reduced base revenue in calendar years 2018 and 2019 by \u00a34 million and \u00a32 million.",

The current price control for electricity distribution is for the eight-year period from April 1, 2015 through March 31, 2023. This both required and enabled WPD to design a base business plan with predictable revenues and expenses over the long-term to drive value for its customers through predetermined outputs and for its investors through preset base returns. A key aspect to the multi-year cycle is an annual inflation adjustment for revenue and cost components, which are inflated using RPI from the base 2012/13 prices used to establish the business plans. Consistent with Ofgem's formulas, the inflation adjustment is applied to base revenue, MOD and TRU when determining allowed revenue. This inflation adjustment also has the effect of inflating RAV, and real returns are earned on the inflated RAV.\n\n(11) Incentive revenues for strong operational performance and innovation -Ofgem has established incentives to provide opportunities for DNOs to enhance overall returns by improving network efficiency, reliability and customer service. These incentives can result in an increase or reduction in revenues based on incentives or penalties for actual performance against preestablished targets based on past performance. Some of the more significant incentives that may affect allowed revenue include the Interruptions Incentive Scheme (IIS), the broad measure of customer service (BMCS) and the time to connect (TTC) incentive:\n\n- \u00b7 The IIS has two major components: (1) Customer interruptions (CIs) and (2) Customer minutes lost (CMLs), and both are designed to incentivize the DNOs to invest in and operate their networks to manage and reduce both the frequency and duration of power outages.\n- \u00b7 The BMCS encompasses customer satisfaction in supply interruptions, connections and general inquiries, complaints, stakeholder engagement and delivery of social obligations.\n- \u00b7 The TTC incentive rewards DNOs for reducing connection times for minor connections against an Ofgem set target.\n\nThe annual incentives and penalties are reflected in customer rates on a two-year lag from the time they are earned and/or assessed. Based on applicable GAAP, incentive revenues and penalties are recorded in revenues when they are billed to customers. The following table shows the amount of incentive revenues (in total), primarily from IIS, BMCS and TTC that WPD has received and is projected to receive on a calendar year basis:\n\n| Calendar Year Ended Incentive Earned   | Incentive Received (in millions)   |   Calendar Year Ended Incentive Included in Revenue |\n|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| 2016                                   | 76                                 |                                                2018 |\n| 2017                                   | 72                                 |                                                2019 |\n| 2018                                   | 78                                 |                                                2020 |\n| 2019                                   | 85                                 |                                                2021 |\n| 2020 (a)                               | 75-85                              |                                                2022 |\n| 2021 (a)                               | 75-85                              |                                                2023 |\n\n(12) Correction Factor (K-factor) -During the price control period, WPD sets its tariffs to recover allowed revenue. However, in any fiscal period, WPD's revenue could be negatively affected if its tariffs and the volume delivered do not fully recover the tt allowed revenue for a particular period. Conversely, WPD could over-recover revenue. Over- and under-recoveries are subtracted from or added to allowed revenue in future years, known as the \"Correction Factor\" or \"K-factor.\" Over and underrecovered amounts during RIIO-ED1 will be refunded/recovered two regulatory years later.\n\n- \u00b7 The K-factor for the 2015/16 regulatory year was a \u00a34 million under-recovery that increased allowed revenue in calendar years 2017 and 2018 by \u00a33 million and \u00a31 million.",

In 2015, Ofgem determined that, beginning with the 2017/18 regulatory year, tariffs would be established a minimum of fifteen months in advance. This change will potentially increase volatility in future revenue forecasts due to the need to forecast components of s allowed revenue including MOD, TRU, K-factor and incentive revenues.\n\n(13) Other Allowed Revenue -Other Allowed Revenue primarily consists of pass through true-ups. For a discussion on property tax true-ups, see recovery of pass through costs in \" (6) Other revenue included in base revenue \" above.\n\n(14) GAAP Operating Revenue - Operating revenue under GAAP primarily consists of allowed revenue, which has been converted to rates and earned as electricity was delivered in the calendar year, converted to U.S. dollars. It also includes miscellaneous revenue primarily from engineering recharge work and ancillary activity revenue. Engineering recharge is work performed for a third party by WPD which is not for general network maintenance or to increase reliability. Examples are diversions and running new lines and equipment for a new housing complex. Ancillary activity revenue includes revenue primarily from WPD's Telecoms and Property companies. The amounts of miscellaneous revenue for 2020, 2019 and 2018 were \u00a3121 million, \u00a3115 million and \u00a3115 million. The margin or profit on these activities, however, was not significant.\n\n(15) Currency Hedging - Earnings generated by PPL's U.K. subsidiaries are subject to foreign currency translation risk. Due to g the significant earnings contributed from WPD, PPL enters into foreign currency contracts to economically hedge the value of the GBP versus the U.S. dollar. These hedges do not receive hedge accounting treatment under GAAP.\n\n## GAAP Accounting implications\n\nAs the regulatory model in the U.K. is incentive based rather than a cost recovery model, WPD is not subject to accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation as prescribed by GAAP. Therefore, the accounting treatment for the differences in thPP e amounts collected in revenues and the amounts recorded for expenses related to depreciation, pensions, cost of debt and income taxes, and the adjustments to base revenue and/or allowed revenue are evaluated primarily based on revenue recognition guidance.\n\nSee \"Revenue Recognition\" in Note 1 to the Financial Statements for additional information.\n\nSee \"Overview - Financial and Operational Developments - RIIO-2 Framework\" in \"Combined Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" for information on the RIIO-2 Framework which will commence on April 1, 2023.\n\n## Kentucky Regulated Segment (PPL) y g g\n\nThe Kentucky Regulated segment consists of the operations of LKE, which owns and operates regulated public utilities engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity and distribution and sale of natural gas, representing primarily the activities of LG&E and KU. In addition, certain acquisition-related financing costs are allocated to the Kentucky Regulated segment.\n\n## (PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU)\n\nLG&E and KU, direct subsidiaries of LKE, are engaged in the regulated generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity in Kentucky and, in KU's case, also Virginia. LG&E also engages in the distribution and sale of natural gas in Kentucky. LG&E provides electricity service to approximately 425,000 customers in Louisville and adjacent areas in Kentucky, covering approximately 700 square miles in nine counties and provides natural gas service to approximately 332,000 customers in its electricity service area and eight additional counties in Kentucky. KU provides electric service to approximately 536,000",

KU also sells wholesale electricity to two municipalities in Kentucky under load following contracts. See Note 3 to the Financial Statements for revenue information.\n\n## Franchises and Licenses\n\nLG&E and KU provide electricity delivery service, and LG&E provides natural gas distribution service, in their respective service territories pursuant to certain franchises, licenses, statutory service areas, easements and other rights or permissions granted by state legislatures, cities or municipalities or other entities.\n\n## Competition p\n\nThere are currently no other electric public utilities operating within the electricity service areas of LKE. From time to time, bills are introduced into the Kentucky General Assembly which seek to authorize, promote or mandate increased distributed generation, customer choice or other developments. Neither the Kentucky General Assembly nor the KPSC has adopted or approved a plan or timetable for retail electric industry competition in Kentucky. The nature or timing of legislative or regulatory actions, if any, regarding industry restructuring and their impact on LKE, which may be significant, cannot currently be predicted. Virginia, formerly a deregulated jurisdiction, has enacted legislation that implemented a hybrid model of costbased regulation. KU's operations in Virginia have been and remain regulated.\n\nAlternative energy sources such as electricity, oil, propane and other fuels indirectly impact LG&E's natural gas revenues.aa Marketers may also compete to sell natural gas to certain large end-users. LG&E's natural gas tariffs include gas price passthrough mechanisms relating to its sale of natural gas as a commodity. Therefore, customer natural gas purchases from alternative suppliers do not generally impact LG&E's profitability. Some large industrial and commercial customers, however, may physically bypass LG&E's facilities and seek delivery service directly from interstate pipelines or other natural gas distribution systems.\n\n## Power Supply pp y\n\nAt December 31, 2020, LKE owned generating capacity of 7,561 MW, of which 2,786 MW related to LG&E and 4,775 MW related to KU.\n\nThe system capacity of LKE's owned or controlled generation is based upon a number of factors, including the operating experience and physical condition of the units, and may be revised periodically to reflect changes in circumstances.\n\nDuring 2020, LKE's power plants generated the following amounts of electricity:\n\n|             | GWh    | GWh    | GWh    |\n|-------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Fuel Source | LKE    | LG&E   | KU     |\n| Coal        | 24,039 | 9,961  | 14,078 |\n| Gas         | 5,370  | 1,274  | 4,096  |\n| Hydro       | 367    | 242    | 125    |\n| Solar       | 18     | 7      | 11     |\n| Total (a)   | 29,794 | 11,484 | 18,310 |\n\nThe majority of LG&E's and KU's generated electricity was used to supply their retail customer bases.\n\nLG&E and KU jointly dispatch their generation units with the lowest cost generation used to serve their customers. When LG&E has excess generation capacity after serving its own customers and its generation cost is lower than that of KU, KU purchases electricity from LG&E and vice versa.\n\nDue to environmental requirements and energy efficiency measures, as of December 31, 2020, LG&E and KU have retired approximately 1,200 MW of coal-fired generation plants since 2010.\n\nLG&E and KU received approval from the KPSC to develop a 4 MW Solar Share facility to service a Solar Share program. The Solar Share program is a voluntary program that allows customers to subscribe capacity in the Solar Share facility. Construction commences, in 500-kilowatt phases, when subscription is complete. Construction of two 500-kilowatt phases was completed as",

        "page_content": "of December 31, 2020. The subscription for the third and fourth 500-kilowatt phase was completed with construction expected to be completed in 2021. LG&E and KU continue to market the program and have started receiving subscriptions for the fifth 500-kilowatt phase.\n\nOn January 23, 2020, LG&E and KU applied to the KPSC for approval of arrangements relating to the purchase of 100 MW of solar power in connection with the Green Tariff option established in the 2018 Kentucky base rate cases. Pursuant to the agreements, LG&E and KU would purchase the initial 20 years of output of a proposed third-party solar generation facility andtt resell the bulk of the power as renewable energy to two large industrial customers and use the remaining power for other customers. On May 8, 2020, the KPSC issued an order approving LG&E's and KU's applications with certain modifications. LG&E and KU requested reconsideration of limited portions of the KPSC's Ordef r and on December 16, 2020, the KPSC amended their original order. PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU do not anticipate that these arrangements will have a significant impact on their results of operations or financial condition.\n\n## Fuel Supply pp y\n\nCoal and natural gas are expected to be the predominant fuels used by LG&E and KU for generation for the foreseeable future. Natural gas used for generation is primarily purchased using contractual arrangements separate from LG&E's natural gas distribution operations. Natural gas and oil are also used for intermediate and peaking capacity and flame stabilization in coalfired boilers.\n\nFuel inventory is maintained at levels estimated to be necessary to avoid operational disruptions at coal-fired generating units. Reliability of coal deliveries can be affected from time to time by a number of factors including fluctuations in demand, coal mine production issues, high or low river level events, lock outages and other supplier or transporter operating difficulties.\n\nLG&E and KU have entered into coal supply agreements with various suppliers for coal deliveries through 2024 and augment their coal supply agreements with spot market purchases, as needed.\n\nFor their existing units, LG&E and KU expect, for the foreseeable future, to purchase most of their coal from western Kentucky, southern Indiana, southern Illinois, northern West Virginia and western Pennsylvania. LG&E and KU continue to purchase certain quantities of ultra-low sulfur content coal from Wyoming for blending at Trimble County Unit 2. Coal is delivered to the generating plants primarily by barge and rail.\n\nTo enhance the reliability of natural gas supply, LG&E and KU have secured firm long-term pipeline transport capacity with contracts of various durations through 2024 on the interstate pipeline serving Cane Run Unit 7. This pipeline also serves the six simple cycle combustion turbine units located at the Trimble County site as well as three other simple cycle units at the Paddy's Run site. For the seven simple cycle combustion turbines at the E.W. Brown facility, no firm long-term pipeline transport capacity has been purchased due to the facility being interconnected to two pipelines and some of the units having dual fuel capability.\n\nLG&E and KU have firm contracts for a portion of the natural gas fuel for Cane Run Unit 7 through March 2023. The bulk of the natural gas fuel remains purchased on the spot market.\n\n## (PPL, LKE and LG&E)\n\n## Natural Gas Distribution Supply pp y\n\nFive underground natural gas storage fields, with a current working natural gas capacity of approximately 15 billion cubic feet (Bcf), are used to provide natural gas service to LG&E's firm sales customers. Natural gas is stored during the summer season for withdrawal during the following winter heating season. Without this storage capacity, LG&E would need to purchase additional natural gas and pipeline transportation services during winter months when customer demand increases and the uu prices for natural gas supply and transportation services are expected to be higher. At December 31, 2020, LG&E had 12 Bcf of natural gas stored underground with a carrying value of $30 million.\n\nLG&E has a portfolio of supply arrangements of varying durations and terms that provide competitively priced natural gas designed to meet its firm sales obligations. These natural gas supply arrangements include pricing provisions that are marketresponsive. In tandem with pipeline transportation services, these natural gas supplies provide the reliability and flexibility necessary to serve LG&E's natural gas customers.",

        "page_content": "LG&E purchases natural gas supply transportation services from two pipelines. LG&E has contracts with one pipeline that are subject to termination by LG&E between 2023 and 2026. Total winter season capacity under these contracts is 184,900 MMBtu/day and summer season capacity is 60,000 MMBtu/day. With this same pipeline, LG&E also has another contract for pipeline capacity through 2026 for 60,000 MMBtu/day during both the winter and summer seasons. LG&E has a single contract with a second pipeline with a total capacity of 20,000 MMBtu/day during both the winter and summer seasons that expires in 2023.\n\nLG&E expects to purchase natural gas supplies for its gas distribution operations from onshore producing regions in South Texas, East Texas, North Louisiana and Arkansas, as well as gas originating in the Marcellus and Utica production areas.\n\n(PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU)\n\n## Transmission\n\nLG&E and KU contract with the Tennessee Valley Authority to act as their transmission reliability coordinator and contract with TranServ International, Inc. to act as their independent transmission organization.\n\n## Rates\n\nLG&E is subject to the jurisdiction of the KPSC and FERC, and KU is subject to the jurisdiction of the KPSC, FERC and VSCC. LG&E and KU operate under a FERC-approved open access transmission tariff.\n\nLG&E's and KU's Kentucky base rates are calculated based on a return on capitalization (common equity, long-term debt and short-term debt) including adjustments for certain net investments and costs recovered separately through other means. As such, LG&E and KU generally earn a return on regulatory assets in Kentucky.\n\nKU's Virginia base rates are calculated based on a return on rate base (net utility plant plus working capital less accumulated deferred income taxes and miscellaneous deductions). As all regulatory assets and liabilities, except the levelized fuel factor andr regulatory assets or liabilities recorded for pension and postretirement benefits and AROs related to certain CCR impoundments, are excluded from the return on rate base utilized in the calculation of Virginia base rates, no return is earned on the related assets.\n\nKU's rates to municipal customers for wholesale power requirements are calculated based on annual updates to a formula rate that utilizes a return on rate base (net utility plant plus working capital less accumulated deferred income taxes and miscellaneous deductions). As all regulatory assets and liabilities are excluded from the return on rate base utilized in the development of municipal rates, no return is earned on the related assets. In April 2014, certain municipalities submitted notices of termination to cease taking power under the wholesale requirements contracts. KU's service to eight municipalities terminated effective April 30, 2019. KU continues to provide service to two municipalities.\n\nSee \"Financial and Operational Developments\" in \"Combined Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" and Note 7 to the Financial Statements for additional information on current rate proceedings and rate mechanisms.\n\n## Pennsylvania Regulated Segment (PPL) y g g\n\nThe Pennsylvania Regulated segment consists of PPL Electric, a regulated public utility engaged in the distribution and transmission of electricity.\n\n## (PPL and PPL Electric)\n\nPPL Electric delivers electricity to approximately 1.4 million customers in a 10,000-square mile territory in 29 counties within eastern and central Pennsylvania.

In general, such conditions have been met by ordinance, resolution, permit, acquiescence or other action by an appropriate local political subdivision or agency of the Commonwealth.\n\n## Competition p\n\nPursuant to authorizations from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the PUC, PPL Electric operates a regulated distribution monopoly in its service area. Accordingly, PPL Electric does not face competition in its electricity distribution business. Pursuant to the Customer Choice Act, generation of electricity is a competitive business in Pennsylvania, and PPL Electric does not own or operate any generation facilities.\n\nThe PPL Electric transmission business, operating under a FERC-approved PJM Open Access Transmission Tariff, is subject to competition pursuant to FERC Order 1000 from entities that are not incumbent PJM transmission owners with respect to the construction and ownership of transmission facilities within PJM.\n\n## Rates and Regulation g\n\n## Transmission\n\nPPL Electric's transmission facilities are within PJM, which operates the electricity transmission network and electric energy market in the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest regions of the U.S.\n\nPJM serves as a FERC-approved Regional Transmission Operator (RTO) to promote greater participation and competition in the region it serves. In addition to operating the electricity transmission network, PJM also administers regional markets for energy, capacity and ancillary services. A primary objective of any RTO is to separate the operation of, and access to, the transmission grid from market participants that buy or sell electricity in the same markets. Electric utilities continue to own the n transmission assets and to receive their share of transmission revenues, but the RTO directs the control and operation of the transmission facilities. Certain types of transmission investments are subject to competitive processes outlined in the PJM tariff.\n\nAs a transmission owner, PPL Electric's transmission revenues are recovered through PJM and billed in accordance with a FERC-approved Open Access Transmission Tariff that allows recovery of incurred transmission costs, a return on transmissionrelated plant and an automatic annual update based on a formula-based rate recovery mechanism. Under this formula, rates are put into effect in June of each year based upon prior year actual expenditures and current year forecasted capital additions. Rates are then adjusted the following year to reflect actual annual expenses and capital additions, as reported in PPL Electric's annual FERC Form 1, filed under the FERC's Uniform System of Accounts. Any difference between the revenue requirement in effect for the prior year and actual expenditures incurred for that year is recorded as a regulatory asset or regulatory liability. a Any change in the prior year PPL zonal peak load billing factor applied on January 1 of each year will result in an increase or decrease in revenue until the next annual rate update is effective on June 1 of that same year.\n\nAs a PLR, PPL Electric also purchases transmission services from PJM. See \"PLR\" below.\n\nSee Note 7 to the Financial Statements for additional information on rate mechanisms.\n\n## Distribution\n\nPPL Electric's distribution base rates are calculated based on a return on rate base (net utility plant plus a cash working capital allowance less plant-related deferred taxes and other miscellaneous additions and deductions). All regulatory assets and liabilities are excluded from the return on rate base. Therefore, no return is earned on the related assets unless specifically provided for by the PUC. Currently, PPL Electric's Smart Meter rider and the DSIC are the only riders authorized to earn a return. Certain operating expenses are also included in PPL Electric's distribution base rates including wages and benefits, other operation and maintenance expenses, depreciation and taxes.\n\nPennsylvania's Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard (AEPS) requires electricity distribution companies and electricity generation suppliers to obtain from alternative energy resources a portion of the electricity sold to retail customers in Pennsylvania. Under the default service procurement plans approved by the PUC, PPL Electric purchases all of the alternative energy generation supply it needs to comply with the AEPS.\n\nAct 129 created an energy efficiency and conservation program, a demand side management program, smart metering technology requirements, new PLR generation supply procurement rules, remedies for market misconduct and changes to the existing AEPS.",

        "page_content": "Act 11 authorizes the PUC to approve two specific ratemaking mechanisms: the use of a fully projected future test year in base rate proceedings and, subject to certain conditions, the use of a DSIC. Such alternative ratemaking procedures and mechanisms provide opportunity for accelerated cost-recovery and, therefore, are important to PPL Electric as it is in a period of significant capital investment to maintain and enhance the reliability of its delivery system, including the replacement of aging assets. PPL Electric utilized the fully projected future test year mechanism in its 2015 base rate proceeding. PPL has had the ability to utilize the DSIC recovery mechanism since July 2013.\n\nSee \"Financial and Operational Developments\" in \"Combined Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" and Note 7 to the Financial Statements for additional information on legislative and regulatory matters.\n\n## PLR\n\nThe Customer Choice Act requires electric distribution companies, including PPL Electric, or an alternative supplier approved by the PUC, to act as a PLR of electricity supply for customers who do not choose to shop for supply with a competitive supplier and provides that electricity supply costs will be recovered by the PLR pursuant to PUC regulations. In 2020, the following average percentages of PPL Electric's customer load f were provided by competitive suppliers: 42% of residential, 81% of small commercial and industrial and 98% of large commercial and industrial customers. The PUC continues to favor expanding the competitive market for electricity.\n\nPPL Electric's cost of electricity generation is based on a competitive solicitation process. The PUC approved PPL Electric's default service plan for the period June 2017 through May 2021, which included a total of eight semi-annual solicitations for electricity supply. Additionally, on December 17, 2020, the PUC approved PPL Electric's next default service plan for the period of June 2021 through May 2025, which includes a total of eight solicitations for electricity supply held semiannually in April and October. The new plan also includes eight solicitations for alternative energy credits held semiannually in January and July with the first solicitation being in July 2021 and the final solicitation being in January 2025.\n\nPursuant to the plans, PPL Electric contracts for all of the electricity supply for residential, commercial and industrial customers who elect to take default service from PPL Electric. These solicitations contain a mix of products including 5-year block energy contracts for residential customers, 6- and 12-month fixed-price load-following contracts for residential and small commercial and industrial customers, 12-month real-time pricing contracts for large commercial and industrial customers, and alternative energy credit contracts for residential, commercial and industrial customers. These contracts fulfill PPL Electric's obligation to provide customer electricity supply as a PLR.\n\nNumerous alternative suppliers have offered to provide generation supply in PPL Electric's service area. As the cost of generation supply is a pass-through cost for PPL Electric, its financial results are not impacted if its customers purchase electricity supply from these alternative suppliers.\n\n## Corporate and Other (PPL) p\n\nPPL Services provides PPL subsidiaries with administrative, management and support services. The costs of these services are charged directly to the respective recipients for the services provided or indirectly charged to applicable recipients based on an average of the recipients' relative invested capital, operation and maintenance expenses and number of employees or a ratio of overall direct and indirect costs.\n\nPPL Capital Funding, PPL's financing subsidiary, provides financing for the operations of PPL and certain subsidiaries. PPL's growth in rate-regulated businesses provides the organization with an enhanced corporate level financing alternative, through PPL Capital Funding, that enables PPL to cost effectively support targeted credit profiles across all of PPL's rated companies. As a result, PPL plans to utilize PPL Capital Funding as a source of capital in future financings, in addition to continued direct financing by the operating companies.\n\nUnlike PPL Services, PPL Capital Funding's costs are not generally charged to PPL subsidiaries. Costs are charged directly to PPL. However, PPL Capital Funding participated significantly in the financing for the acquisitions of LKE and WPD Midlands and certain associated financing costs were allocated to the Kentucky Regulated and U.K. Regulated segments. The associated financing costs, as well as the financing costs associated with prior issuances of certain other PPL Capital Funding securities, have been assigned to the appropriate segments for purposes of PPL management's assessment of segment performance. The financing costs associated primarily with PPL Capital Funding's securities issuances beginning in 2013, with certain exceptions, have not been directly assigned or allocated to any segment.",

The EPA and other federal agencies with jurisdiction over environmental matters have issued numerous environmental regulations relating to air, water and waste that directly affect the electric power industry. Due to these environmental issues, it may be necessary for the Registrants to modify or cease certain operations or operation of certain facilities to comply with statutes, regulations and other requirements of regulatory bodies or courts. In addition, legal challenges to environmental permits or rules add uncertainty to estimating future costs of complying with such permits and rules. The new U.S. presidential administration is expected to undertake an assessment of potential changes in a wide range of environmental programs.\n\nSee 'Legal Matters' in Note 14 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of environmental commitments and contingencies. See \"Financial Condition - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Forecasted Uses of Cash - Capital Expenditures\" in \"Combined Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" for information on projected environmental capital expenditures for 2021 through 2025.\n\nLG&E and KU are entitled to recover, through the ECR mechanism, certain costs of complying with the Clean Air Act, as amended, and other federal, state and local environmental requirements applicable to coal combustion wastes and by-products from coal-fired generating facilities upon KPSC review. Costs not covered by the ECR mechanism for LG&E and KU and all t such costs for PPL Electric are subject to rate recovery at the discretion of the companies' respective state regulatory authorities, or the FERC, if applicable. WPD's distribution businesses are subject to certain statutory and regulatory environmental requirements. It may be necessary for WPD to incur significant compliance costs, which may be recoverable through rates subject to Ofgem approval. Because neither WPD nor PPL Electric own any generating plants, their exposure to related environmental compliance costs is reduced. PPL, PPL Electric, LKE, LG&E and KU can provide no assurances as to the ultimate outcome of future proceedings before regulatory authorities.\n\n## Air\n\n(PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU)\n\n## NAAQS\n\nThe Clean Air Act has a significant impact on the operation of fossil fuel generation plants. The Clean Air Act requires the EPA PP periodically to establish and review National Ambient Air Quality Standards, known as NAAQS, for six pollutants: carbon monoxide, lead, nitrogen dioxide, ozone (contributed to by nitrogen oxide emissions), particulate matter and sulfur dioxide. In December 2020, the EPA released final actions keeping the existing NAAQS standard for particulate matter and ozone without change. PPL, LKE, LG&E, and KU are unable to predict the outcome of future evaluations by the EPA and the states with respect to the NAAQS standards.\n\nApplicable regulations require each state to identify areas within its boundaries that fail to meet the NAAQS, (known as nonattainment areas), and develop a state implementation plan to achieve and maintain compliance. States that are found to contribute significantly to another state's nonattainment with ozone standards are required to establish \"good neighbor\" state implementation plans. In addition, for attainment of ozone and fine particulates standards, certain states, including Kentucky, are subject to a regional EPA program known as the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR).\n\nIn January 2018, the EPA designated Jefferson County, Kentucky (Louisville) as being in nonattainment with the existing 2015 ozone standard. In 2020, LG&E entered into an agreement with the Louisville Metro Air Pollution Control District for temporary nitrogen oxide emission limits at LG&E's Mill Creek Station during 2020 to facilitate compliance with the ozone standard. If Jefferson County is unable to demonstrate attainment within the specified timeframes, it may be 'bumped up' to the moderate nonattainment classification and thus subject to additional requirements including requirements for installation of reasonably available control technology on coal-fired generating units. Compliance with such requirements may require",

LKE and LG&E are unable to determine the impact on operations until certain compliance determinations are made by the EPA and Kentucky.\n\nIn December 2018, the EPA finalized the CSAPR \"Close-Out Rule,\" determining that the existing CSAPR \"Update Rule\" for the 2008 ozone NAAQS fully addresses applicable states' interstate pollution transport obligations. Various states and others challenged the rule in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit (D.C. Circuit). In September 2019, the D.C. Circuit granted these petitions and remanded a portion of the CSAPR Update Rule to the EPA. In October 2020, the EPA released proposed revisions to the CSAPR Update Rule providing for rescission of Kentucky's approved good neighbor state implementation plan and additional reductions in ozone season nitrogen oxide emissions for 2021 and subsequent years from sources in 12 states, including Kentucky.\n\nPPL, LKE, LG&E and KU are unable to determine the impact of the rule on operations until the rule is finalized, and certain d implementation determinations are made by the EPA and Kentucky. Compliance with the NAAQS, CSAPR and related requirements may require installation of additional pollution controls or other compliance actions, the costs of which PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU believe would be subject to rate recovery.\n\n## Climate Change\n\nThere is continuing world-wide attention focused on issues related to climate change. In 2015, 195 nations, including the U.S., signed the Paris Agreement on Climate, establishing non-binding targets to reduce GHG emissions from both developed and developing nations. In 2017, the President announced a U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, effective November 2020. In January 2021, the new U.S. presidential administration initiated the process to rejoin the Paris Agreement. The new U.S. presidential administration also issued executive orders directing agencies to conduct a general review of regulations and executive actions relating to the environment and reestablished a framework for considering the social cost of carbon as part of certain agency cost-benefit analyses for new regulations \u0358glyph<c=3,font=/LMKEGB+Calibri> The new U.S. presidential administration is considering a wide range of additional policies, executive orders, rules, legislation and other initiatives to address climate change. Some of these initiatives may include repeal of policies, executive orders or rules implemented by the prior administration. Additionally, there are ongoing efforts by various state and local governments to assess potential changes to legislation, rules, policies, directives, and other requirements applicable to greenhouse gas emissions. PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU cannot predict the outcome of ongoing developments.\n\nThe U.K. has enacted binding carbon reduction requirements that are applicable to WPD. Under the U.K. law, WPD must purchase carbon allowances to offset emissions associated with WPD's operations. The cost of these allowances is not significant and is included in WPD's current operating expenses.\n\n## The EPA's Affordable Clean Energy Rule\n\nIn July 2019, the EPA repealed the Clean Power Plan and finalized the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) Rule which gives states broad latitude to establish emission guidelines providing for plant-specific efficiency upgrades or \"heat-rate improvements\" to reduce GHG emissions per unit of electricity generated. States are generally allowed three years to submit plans establishing standards of performance, while the EPA anticipates that most facilities will be required to demonstrate compliance within two years of plan approval. The EPA intends to take additional action to finalize new criteria for determining whether efficiency projects will trigger New Source Review and thus be subject to more stringent emission controls. LG&E and KU are currently working with state agencies on submittal of compliance plans to the EPA. Various entities filed petitions for review and petitions for reconsideration. On January 19, 2021, the D.C. Circuit Court issued an opinion finding that the EPA had erroneously repealed the Clean Power Plan. The D.C Circuit Court's opinion also vacated and remanded the ACE Rule to the EPA. PPL, LKE, LG&E, and KU cannot predict the outcome of the pending litigation and regulatory proceedings or changesrr that may be pursued by the new U.S. presidential administration, but believe that the costs would be subject to rate recovery.\n\n## Water/Waste\n\n(PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU)\n\n## Clean Water Act\n\nRegulations under the federal Clean Water Act dictate permitting and mitigation requirements for facilities and construction projects that impact \"Waters of the United States.\" Many other requirements relate to power plant operations, including thef treatment of pollutants in effluents prior to discharge, the temperature of effluent discharges and the location, design and construction of cooling water intake structures at generating facilities, and standards intended to protect aquatic organisms tff hat t",

These requirements could impose significant costs for LG&E and KU, which are expected to be subject to rate recovery.\n\n## Clean Water Act Jurisdiction\n\nEnvironmental groups and others have claimed that discharges to groundwater from leaking CCR impoundments at power plants are subject to Clean Water Act permitting. A citizen suit raising such claims has been filed against KU with respect to the E.W. Brown plant, as discussed under 'Legal Matters' - 'E.W. Brown Environmental Claims' in Note 14 to the Financial Statements. On April 12, 2019, the EPA released regulatory clarification finding that Clean Water Act jurisdiction does not cover such discharges to groundwater. On January 23, 2020, the EPA announced a final rule modifying the jurisdictional scope of the Clean Water Act. The announced rule revises the definition of the \"Waters of the United States,\" including a revision to exclude groundwater from the definition. In April 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a ruling that Clean Water Act jurisdiction may apply to certain discharges to groundwater that result in the functional equivalent of a direct discharge to navigable waters. In December 2020, the EPA published draft guidance addressing how the Supreme Court decision applies to the Clean Water Act National Pollutant Elimination System permit program. PPL, LKE, LG&E, and KU are unaware of any unpermitted releases from their facilities that are subject to Clean Water Act jurisdiction, but future regulatory developments and judicial rulings could potentially subject certain releases from CCR impoundments and landfills to additional permitting and remediation requirements, which could impose substantial costs. Any associated costs are expected to be subject to rate recovery. PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU are unable to predict the outcome or financial impact of future regulatory proceedings and litigation.\n\n## Seepages and Groundwater Infiltration\n\nIn addition to the actions described above, LG&E and KU have completed, or are completing, assessments of seepages or groundwater infiltration at various facilities and have completed, or are working with agencies to implement, further testing, monitoring or abatement measures, where applicable. Depending on the circumstances in each case, certain costs, which may be subject to rate recovery, could be significant.\n\n## Superfund and Other Remediationp\n\n## (All Registrants)\n\nFrom time to time, PPL's subsidiaries in the United States undertake testing, monitoring or remedial action in response to spills or other releases at various on-site and off-site locations, negotiate with the EPA and state and local agencies regarding actions necessary to comply with applicable requirements, negotiate with property owners and other third parties alleging impacts from PPL's operations and undertake similar actions necessary to resolve environmental matters that arise in the course of normal operations. Based on analyses to date, resolution of these environmental matters is not expected to have a significant adverse impact on the operations of PPL Electric, LG&E and KU.\n\nFuture cleanup or remediation work at sites not yet identified may result in significant additional costs for PPL, PPL Electric, LKE, LG&E and KU. Insurance policies maintained by LKE, LG&E and KU may be available to cover certain of the costs or other obligations related to these matters, but the amount of insurance coverage or reimbursement cannot be estimated or assured.\n\nSee 'Legal Matters' in Note 14 to the Financial Statements for additional information.\n\n## (All Registrants)\n\n## HUMAN CAPITAL\n\nPPL, together with its subsidiaries, is committed to fostering an exceptional workplace for employees. PPL pledges to enable success of its current and future workforce through a human capital management approach that cultivates a diverse, equitable and inclusive culture, fosters professional development and encourages employee engagement. Matters related to these priorities and corporate culture are overseen by PPL's senior management, which provides r updates to the PPL Board of Directors (the Board). Three priorities of this commitment and their oversight are as follows:",

PPL's operating companies regularly conduct assessments related to employee engagement, safety and culture. Senior management reviews corporate culture with the Board annually.\n- \u00b7 Human capital - Invest in our current and future workforce through training and development, succession planning and creation of a pipeline for internal advancement. In addition to challenging careers and competitive salaries, PPL offers competitive benefits programs to attract and retain talent and support employees' well-being. PPL offers competitive vacation time, expanded leave for new parents, retirement programs, and internal and external development opportunities, including tuition reimbursement offerings for undergraduate and certain graduate degrees. Senior management reviews succession planning with the Compensation Committee of the Board on an annual basis.\n\nPPL is also committed to maintaining an ethical and safe workplace culture. Additional steps to ensure Board oversight in these areas include:\n\n- \u00b7 Compliance - The Corporate Compliance Committee, including senior executives, meets quarterly to discuss metrics and other matters related to the compliance and ethics culture. Among the items discussed are statistics regarding Ethics Helpline reports and employee concerns. This information is also reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Board quarterly.\n- \u00b7 Safety - PPL carries out programs focused on health and safety, including emergency preparedness, vehicle safety and accident prevention. Employees receive safety training and are encouraged to share best practices. Senior management receives monthly safety data to determine whether additional safety measures should be implemented. The Board annually reviews the company's safety programs and results. The Board is also immediately engaged in the event of a fatality.\n\nPPL will continue to engage with employees and to assess these priorities as we work to best position individuals and the company for future success. As a result of our continued effort in these areas, we have a relatively low turnover rate of 5.8% for the year ended December 31, 2020. Looking forward, we will maintain our strong focus on workforce planning to address future talent needs.\n\nAt December 31, 2020, PPL and its subsidiaries had the following full-time employees and employees represented by labor unions:\n\n|              | Total Full-Time Employees   | Number of Union Employees   | Percentage of Total Workforce   |\n|--------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| PPL          | 12,318                      | 5,692                       | 46 %                            |\n| PPL Electric | 1,533                       | 887                         | 58 %                            |\n| LKE          | 3,482                       | 759                         | 22 %                            |\n| LG&E         | 1,016                       | 640                         | 63 %                            |\n| KU           | 889                         | 119                         | 13 %                            |\n\nPPL's domestic workforce has 1,820 employees, or 32%, who are members of labor unions.\n\nWPD has 3,872 employees who are members of labor unions (or 59% of PPL's U.K. workforce). WPD recognizes four unions, the largest of which represent 40% of its union workforce. WPD's Electricity Business Agreement, which covers 3,816 union employees, may be amended by agreement between WPD and the unions and can be terminated with 12 months' notice by either side.\n\n## CYBERSECURITY MANAGEMENT\n\nThe Registrants and their subsidiaries are subject to risks from cyber-attacks that have the potential to cause significant interruptions to the operation of their businesses. The frequency of these attempted intrusions has increased in recent years and the sources, motivations and techniques of attack continue to evolve and change rapidly. PPL has adopted a variety of measures to monitor and address cyber-related risks and continues to implement and explore additional cybersecurity measures. Cybersecurity and the effectiveness of PPL's cybersecurity strategy are regular topics of discussion at Board of Directors meetings. PPL's strategy for managing cyber-related risks is risk-based and, where appropriate, integrated within PPL's enterprise risk management processes.

The cybersecurity team also routinely participates in industry-wide programs to further information sharing, intelligence gathering, and unity of effort in responding to potential or actual attacks. In addition, in 2018, PPL revised and formalized its internal policy and procedures for communicating cybersecurity incidents on an enterprise-wide basis.\n\nIn addition to these enterprise-wide initiatives, PPL's Kentucky and Pennsylvania operations are subject to extensive and rigorous mandatory cybersecurity requirements that are developed and enforced by NERC and approved by the FERC to protect grid security and reliability. Finally, PPL purchases insurance to protect against a wide range of costs that could be incurred in connection with cyber-related incidents.

Combined Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations' in the 2019 Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on February 14, 2020.\n\n## Overview\n\nFor a description of the Registrants and their businesses, see \"Business.\"\n\n## Business Strategy\n\n(All Registrants)\n\nPPL operates seven fully regulated high-performing utilities. These utilities are located in the U.K., Pennsylvania and Kentucky,kk constructive regulatory jurisdictions with distinct regulatory structures and customer classes.\n\nPPL's strategy, and that of the other Registrants, is to deliver best-in-sector operational performance, invest in a sustainable energy future, provide superior customer service, maintain a strong financial foundation, and engage and develop its people. PPL's business plan is designed to achieve growth by providing efficient, reliable and safe operations and strong customer service, maintaining constructive regulatory relationships and achieving timely recovery of costs. These businesses are expected to achieve long-term growth in rate base in the U.S. and RAV in the U.K. Rate base growth is being driven by planned significant capital expenditures to maintain existing assets and improve system reliability and, for LKE, LG&E and KU, to comply with federal and state environmental regulations related to coal-fired electricity generation facilities.\n\nFor the U.S. businesses, central to PPL's strategy is recovering capital project costs efficiently through various rate-making mechanisms, including periodic base rate case proceedings using forward test years, annual FERC formula rate mechanisms and other regulatory agency-approved recovery mechanisms designed to limit regulatory lag. In Kentucky, the KPSC has adopted a series of regulatory mechanisms (ECR, DSM, GLT, fuel adjustment clause and gas supply clause) and recovery on construction work-in-progress that reduce regulatory lag and provide timely recovery of and return on, as appropriate, prudently incurred costs. In addition, the KPSC requires a utility to obtain a CPCN prior to constructing a facility, unless the construction",

        "page_content": "is an ordinary extension of existing facilities in the usual course of business or does not involve sufficient capital expenditurestt to materially affect the utility's financial condition. Although such KPSC proceedings do not directly address cost recovery issues, the KPSC, in awarding a CPCN, concludes that the public convenience and necessity require the construction of the facility on the basis that the facility is the lowest reasonable cost alternative to address the need. In Pennsylvania, the FERCRR transmission formula rate, DSIC mechanism, Smart Meter Rider and other recovery mechanisms operate to reduce regulatory lag and provide for timely recovery of and a return on, as appropriate, prudently incurred costs.\n\nTo manage financing costs and access to credit markets, and to fund capital expenditures, a key objective of the Registrants is to maintain their investment grade credit ratings and adequate liquidity positions. In addition, the Registrants have financial and operational risk management programs that, among other things, are designed to monitor and manage exposure to earnings and cash flow volatility, as applicable, related to changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and counterparty credit quality. To manage these risks, PPL generally uses contracts such as forwards, options and swaps. See \"Financial Condition Risk Management\" below for further information.\n\nEarnings generated by PPL's U.K. subsidiaries are subject to foreign currency translation risk. Because WPD's earnings represent such a significant portion of PPL's consolidated earnings, PPL enters into foreign currency contracts to economically hedge the value of the GBP versus the U.S. dollar. These hedges do not receive hedge accounting treatment under GAAP.\n\nThe U.K. subsidiaries also have currency exposure to the U.S. dollar to the extent of their U.S. dollar denominated debt. To manage these risks, PPL generally uses contracts such as forwards, options and cross-currency swaps that contain characteristics of both interest rate and foreign currency exchange contracts.\n\nAs discussed above, a key component of this strategy is to maintain constructive relationships with regulators in all jurisdictions in which the Registrants operate (U.K., U.S. federal and state). This is supported by a strong culture of integrity and delivering on commitments to customers, regulators and shareowners, and a commitment to continue to improve customer service, reliability and operational efficiency.\n\n## Financial and Operational Developments\n\n## Initiation of Formal Process to Sell U.K. Utility Business (PPL) s\n\nOn August 10, 2020, PPL announced that it initiated a formal process to sell its U.K. utility business. There can be no assurance of any specific outcome, including whether the sale process will result in the completion of any potential transaction, the timing or terms thereof, the value or benefits that may be realized or the effect that any potential transaction will have on future financial results.\n\nAs a result of the potential sale, PPL assessed the recoverability of the assets of its U.K. utility business. PPL prepared probability-weighted undiscounted cash flow estimates as of December 31, 2020 and September 30, 2020 that considered the likelihood of the possible outcomes of the sale process, including the possibility of not selling the U.K. utility business. Thf e resulting cash flow analyses exceeded the carrying value of the assets of the U.K. utility business. A change in the possible outcomes of the sale process could result in the carrying value of the assets of the U.K. utility business not being recoverable, which could result in an impairment in future periods. The U.K. utility business will continue to be classified as held and used until it meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale, which includes management obtaining a commitment to a plan to sell from its Board of Directors.\n\nShould the U.K. utility business meet the criteria to be classified as held for sale in a future period, PPL will be required at that aa time to compare the estimated fair value of its investment in the U.K. utility business, less costs to sell, to its carrying value, including accumulated other comprehensive losses related to the U.K. utility business, for impairment purposes. The resulting measurement may result in a loss. In addition, PPL will reassess its assertion of the indefinite reinvestment of the unremitted earnings of the U.K. utility business. See Note 21 to the Financial Statements for additional information on accumulated other comprehensive income and losses. See Note 6 to the Financial Statements for additional information on income taxes.\n\n## Outbreak of COVID-19 (All Registrants)\n\nThe continued spread of COVID-19 has disrupted the U. S. and global economies and continues to present extraordinary challenges to businesses, communities, workforces and markets. The Registrants have taken significant steps to mitigate the potential spread of COVID-19 to our customers, suppliers and employees.

The Registrants have implemented social distancing measures for all employees including work from home arrangements where possible and continue to implement strong physical and cyber security measures to ensure that systems function effectively to serve operational and remote workforce needs. The Registrants continue to monitor developments affecting their workforces and customers and will take additional actions as appropriate to respond to changing conditions and mitigate the impacts.\n\nThis rapidly evolving situation could lead to continued disruption of economic activity in the Registrants' markets for an undetermined period of time. Lock-down or closure of non-essential businesses has occurred in each of the Registrants' service territories, which has resulted in reductions in commercial and industrial demand and an increase in residential demand for aa electricity service. The impact of this net reduction in load has not been material to the Registrants' 2020 financial condition. The impact on future periods will depend upon various factors, including the pace and extent to which the Registrants' jurisdictions reopen their economies and community response to the reopening of businesses as well as the extent that businesses continue work from home protocols. We cannot predict these factors and therefore cannot quantify the overall impact COVID-19 will have on our future results of operations.\n\nThe Registrants are committed to supporting their customers and communities and have followed federal and state mandates related to suspending disconnections for non-payment and new late fees, reconnecting service for customers who had previously been disconnected and developing late payment plans with customers, where appropriate. The Registrants have experienced an increase in aged accounts receivable, resulting in an increase in expected credit losses. See \"Current Expected Credit Losses\" in Note 1 to the Financial Statements for additional information. The Registrants will continue to monitor cash receipts and accounts receivable aging to determine if further increases in their allowance for uncollectible accounts are required.\n\nAt December 31, 2020, the Registrants had approximately $3.2 billion of combined unused credit facility capacity. In addition, PPL Capital Funding, PPL Electric, LG&E and KU may, subject to certain conditions, increase their syndicated credit facilities in an aggregate amount of up to $1 billion. In April 2020, PPL Capital Funding issued $1 billion of 4.125% Senior Notes due 2030. In June 2020, KU issued $500 million of First Mortgage Bonds due 2050. In October 2020, PPL Electric issued $250 million of First Mortgage Bonds, Floating Rate Series due 2023.

See Note 8 to the Financial Statements for additional information.\n\nThe Registrants have assessed the fair value of their assets and liabilities and no impairment charges were required. See 'Goodwill Assessment' below for additional information on the interim goodwill impairment test performed for the U.K. Regulated segment reporting unit in the first quarter of 2020 and the annual goodwill impairment tests performed in the fourth quarter of 2020 for all of PPL's reporting units.\n\nPPL's pension plans continue to be well-funded as its liability-driven investment strategy and active management function to mitigate investment losses resulting from market volatility.\n\nIn response to COVID-19, various forms of aid and relief were enacted in 2020, including the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act). The provisions of the CARES Act and other forms of aid and relief did not have a material impact on the Registrants' financial statements.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020 the following estimated changes in revenue and incremental costs incurred resulted from the impact of COVID-19.\n\n|      | Reduction in  Revenue   | Incremental Costs   |\n|------|-------------------------|---------------------|\n| PPL  | $ (114)                 | $ 28                |\n| WPD  | (82)                    | 19                  |\n| LKE  | (32)                    | 7                   |\n| LG&E | (18)                    | 3                   |\n| KU   | (14)                    | 4                   |\n\nWPD tariffs are set to recover allowed revenues. Any under-recoveries, including the estimated amounts shown above, will be added to revenue, with interest, in future years through K-factor. See discussion of K-factor in 'Business.' The impact on revenue and incremental COVID-19 related costs were not significant at PPL Electric.",

        "page_content": "To date, there has been no material impact on the Registrants' operations, financial condition, liquidity or on their supply chain as a result of COVID-19. The ultimate severity or duration of the outbreak or its effects on the global economy, the capital markets, or the Registrants' workforce, contractors, customers and suppliers is uncertain. The Registrants cannot predict the ultimate impact COVID-19 will have on their financial position, results of operations, cash flows or liquidity.\n\n## Goodwill Assessment (PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU)\n\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2020, PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU considered whether the impact of COVID-19 described above, resulting volatility and decrease in PPL's shares would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the Registrants' reporting units below their carrying amounts. Based on our assessment, a quantitative impairment test was not required for the LKE, LG&E and KU reporting units, but was required for the U.K. Regulated segment reporting unit, the allocated goodwill of which was $2.5 billion at March 31, 2020. The test did not indicate impairment of the reporting unit.\n\nNo impairments were recognized in conjunction with the annual goodwill impairment tests performed in the fourth quarter of 2020. See \"Long-Lived and Intangible Assets - Asset Impairment (Excluding Investments)\" in Note 1 to the Financial Statements for additional information. An impairment charge could occur in future periods if PPL's share price or any of the assumptions used in determining fair value of the reporting units are negatively impacted.\n\n## U.K. Corporation Tax Rate Change (PPL)\n\n19% to 17%, effective April 1, 2020. On March 11, 2020, the U.K. Finance Act 2020 included a cancellation of the tax rate reduction to 17%, thereby maintaining the corporation tax rate at 19%. The Finance Act 2020 was formally enacted on July 22, 2020. The primary impact of the cancellation of the corporation tax rate reduction was an increase in deferred tax liabilities and a corresponding deferred tax expense of $106 million.\n\n## U.S. Tax Reform (All Registrants)\n\nIn July 2020, the IRS issued final and new proposed regulations relating to the limitation on interest deductibility. The final regulations do not apply to the Registrants until the 2021 tax year. The new proposed regulations were finalized on January 5, 2021 and will apply to the Registrants in the 2022 tax year. The Registrants are evaluating the final regulations issued in 2021, but do not expect these regulations or the 2020 final regulations to have a material impact on the Registrants' financial condition or results of operations.\n\n## U.K. Withdrawal from European Union (PPL)\n\nIn March 2017, the U.K. Government invoked Article 50 (Article 50) of the Lisbon Treaty, formally beginning the two-year period for the U.K. to negotiate an agreement specifying the terms of its withdrawal from the European Union (EU), popularly referred to as Brexit. After repeated extensions, in October 2019, the EU agreed to extend the Article 50 process until January 31, 2020. Following an early general election in December 2019, which resulted in a substantial Conservative Party Parliamentary majority, the U.K. and EU Parliaments voted to approve the EU withdrawal agreement negotiated by Prime Minister Boris Johnson.\n\nThe U.K. formally left the EU on January 31, 2020 and entered into a transition period that ended on December 31, 2020 through which the U.K. sought to negotiate a free trade arrangement with the EU and new trade terms with countries outside of the EU. Successively, the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement was agreed on December 24, 2020 and ratified by the U.K. Parliament on December 30, 2020 and was provisionally applied by the EU beginning December 31, 2020. While significant progress has been made, uncertainty continues to surround the economic impact of Brexit. PPL believes that its greatest risks relate to any extended period of depressed value of the GBP or the potential further decline in the value of the GBP compared to the U.S. dollar.\n\nPPL cannot predict the impact, in either the short-term or long-term, on foreign exchange rates or PPL's financial condition that may be experienced as a result of the actions taken by the U.K. government to withdraw from the EU, although such impacts could be material.\n\nPPL does not expect the financial condition and results of operations of WPD, itself, to change significantly as a result of Brexit. The regulatory environment and operation of WPD's businesses are not expected to change. RIIO-ED1, the current price control, with allowed revenues agreed with Ofgem runs through March 2023.

        "page_content": "WPD would be mitigated in part because U.K. regulation provides that any reduction in the volume of electricity delivered will be recovered in allowed revenues in future periods through the K-factor adjustment. See \"Business - Segment Information U.K. Regulated Segment\" for additional information on the current price control and K-factor adjustment. In addition, an increase in inflation would have a positive effect on revenues and RAV as annual inflation adjustments are applied to both d revenues and RAV (and real returns are earned on inflated RAV). This impact, however, would be partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses and interest expense on index-linked debt. With respect to access to financing, WPD has substantial borrowing capacity under existing credit facilities and expects to continue to have access to all major financial markets. With respect to access to and cost of equipment and other materials, WPD management continues to review U.K. government issued advice on preparations for Brexit and has taken actions to mitigate potential increasing costs and disruption to its critical sources of supply. Additionally, less than 1% of WPD's employees are non-U.K. EU nationals and no change in their domicile is expected.\n\n## Regulatory Requirements\n\n## ( All Registrants) ( (\n\nThe Registrants cannot predict the impact that future regulatory requirements may have on their financial condition or results of operations.\n\n## (PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU)\n\nThe businesses of LKE, LG&E and KU are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws, rules and regulations, including those pertaining to CCRs, GHG, and ELGs. See \"Business\" and Notes 7, 14 and 20 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of these significant environmental matters. These and other environmental requirements led PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU to retire approximately 1,200 MW of coal-fired generating plants in Kentucky since 2010.\n\n## RIIO-2 Framework (PPL)\n\nIn 2018, Ofgem issued its consultation document on the RIIO-2 framework, covering all U.K. gas and electricity transmission and distribution price controls. The current electricity distribution price control, RIIO-ED1, continues through March 31, 2023 and will not be impacted by the RIIO-2 consultation process. Later in 2018, Ofgem published its decision following its RIIO-2 framework consultation after consideration of comments received including those from WPD and PPL.\n\nIn August 2019, Ofgem published an open letter seeking views on its proposed sector specific approach on the RIIO-ED2 framework. WPD and PPL provided responses to this open letter. In December 2019, Ofgem published its decision on the RIIO-ED2 framework, thus confirming the following points in its RIIO-2 and RIIO-ED2 framework decision documents:\n\n- \u00b7 RIIO-ED2 will be a five-year price control period, compared to eight years in the current RIIO-ED1 price control.\n- \u00b7 CPI or CPIH will be used for inflation measurement in calculating both RAV and allowed returns rather than RPI.\n- \u00b7 The baseline allowed return on equity will be set using the same methodology in all RIIO-2 sectors. The new methodology includes; (a) an equity indexation, whereby the allowed return on equity is updated to reflect changes in the risk-free rate, and (b) potentially setting the allowed return 0.5% below the expected return.\n- \u00b7 Full debt indexation will be retained.\n- \u00b7 The early settlement process (fast tracking) will be removed and replaced with an alternative mechanism to incentivize high-quality, rigorous and ambitious business plans.\n- \u00b7 The Totex incentive rate will be based on a confidence level for setting baseline cost allowances.\n- \u00b7 A new enhanced engagement model will be introduced requiring distribution companies to set up a customer engagement group to provide Ofgem with a public report of local stakeholders' views on the companies' business plans. Ofgem will also establish an independent RIIO-2 challenge group comprised of consumer experts to provide Ofgem with a public report on companies' business plans.\n- \u00b7 There will be no change to the existing depreciation policy of using economic asset lives as the basis for depreciating RAV as part of base revenue calculations. WPD is currently transitioning to 45-year asset lives for new additions in RIIO-ED1 based on Ofgem's extensive review of asset lives in RIIO-ED1.\n- \u00b7 A focus of RIIO-2 will be on whole-system outcomes. Ofgem intends network companies and system operators working together to ensure the energy system as a whole is efficient and delivers the best value to consumers. Ofgem is undertaking further work to clarify the definition of whole-system and the appropriate roles of the network companies in supporting this objective. Ofgem is still undecided on how DSO functions",

Ofgem will include a DSO reopener to reassess progress made in the establishment of DSO activities.\n\nOn July 30, 2020, Ofgem published its consultation on the RIIO-ED2 price control methodology which Ofgem will use to apply its framework decisions listed above. Some of the key aspects in Ofgem's consultation include:\n\n- \u00b7 Proposing a suite of Net-Zero related investment and innovation mechanisms, including a Net Zero re-opener, to ensure that RIIO-ED2 is adaptable and can keep pace with changes in the wider policy and technological environment.\n- \u00b7 Consulting on four different models for managing strategic investment to enable more flexibility within the price control and allow DNOs to adapt their investment plans to keep pace with Net Zero.\n- \u00b7 Consulting on debt allowance proposals including the debt allowance calibration, the index used, and a possible additional cost of borrowing allowance.\n- \u00b7 Consulting on whether the three-stage equity indexation methodology for baseline allowance returns proposed in the Gas Distribution and Transmission Draft Determination should equally apply to the ED sector and if the estimation approach for systematic risk should differ for ED2.\n- \u00b7 Proposing to introduce a suite of reforms to define and regulate the distribution system operation. In the first instance, those reforms will apply to DNOs.\n\nWPD and PPL continue to be fully engaged in the RIIO-ED2 process. The comment period on the July 30, 2020 consultation closed on October 1, 2020, which WPD provided a response to, and a decision on the RIIO-ED2 Sector Specific Methodology was made in December 2020 with the Regulatory finance decisions to be confirmed in the first quarter of 2021. Final Determinations for RIIO-ED2 will be made in December 2022. The RIIO-ED2 price control will come into effect on April 1, 2023. PPL cannot predict the outcome of this process or the long-term impact the final RIIO-ED2 price control will have on its financial condition or results of operations.\n\n## Challenge to PPL Electric Transmission Formula Rate Return on Equity\n\n( PPL and PPL Electric) ( (\n\nOn May 21, 2020, PP&L Industrial Customer Alliance (PPLICA) filed a complaint with the FERC alleging that PPL Electric's base return on equity (ROE) of 11.18% used to determine PPL Electric's formula transmission rate is unjust and unreasonable, and proposing an alternative ROE of 8.00% based on its interpretation of FERC Opinion No. 569. However, also on May 21, 2020, the FERC issued Opinion No. 569-A in response to numerous requests for rehearing of Opinion No. 569, which revised the method for analyzing base ROE. On June 10, 2020, PPLICA filed a Motion to Supplement the May 21, 2020 complaint in which PPLICA continued to allege that PPL Electric's base ROE is unjust and unreasonable, but revised its analysis of PPL Electric's base ROE to reflect the guidance provided in Opinion No. 569-A. The amended complaint proposed an updated alternative ROE of 8.50% and also requested that the FERC preserve the original refund effective date as established by the filing of the original complaint on May 21, 2020. Several parties have filed motions to intervene, including one party who filed Comments in Support of the original complaint.\n\nOn July 10, 2020, PPL Electric filed its Answer and supporting Testimony to the PPLICA filings arguing that the FERC should deny the original and amended complaints as they are without merit and fail to demonstrate the existing base ROE is unjust and unreasonable. In addition, PPL Electric contended any refund effective date should be set for no earlier than June 10, 2020 and PPLICA's proposed replacement ROE should be rejected.\n\nOn October 15, 2020, the FERC issued an order on the PPLICA complaints which established hearing and settlement procedures, set a refund effective date of May 21, 2020 and granted the motions to intervene. On November 16, 2020, PPL Electric filed a request for rehearing of the portion of the October 15, 2020 Order that set the May 21, 2020 refund effective date. On December 17, 2020, the FERC issued a Notice of Denial of Rehearing by Operation of Law and Providing for Further Consideration. On February 16, 2021, PPL Electric filed a Petition for Review with the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit of the portion of the October 15, 2020 Order that set the May 21, 2020 refund effective date.\n\nPPL Electric continues to believe its ROE is just and reasonable and that it has meritorious defenses against the original and amended complaints. At this time, PPL Electric cannot predict the outcome of this matter or the range of possible losses, if any, that may be incurred. However, revenue earned from May 21, 2020 through the settlement of this matter may be subject to",

A change of 50 basis points to the base ROE would impact PPL Electric's net income by approximately $12 million on an annual basis.\n\n## FERC Transmission Rate Filing\n\n## (PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU)\n\nIn 2018, LG&E and KU applied to the FERC requesting elimination of certain on-going credits to a sub-set of transmission customers relating to the 1998 merger of LG&E's and KU's parent entities and the 2006 withdrawal of LG&E and KU from the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, Inc. (MISO), a regional transmission operator and energy market. The application sought termination of LG&E's and KU's commitment to provide certain Kentucky municipalities mitigation for certain horizontal market power concerns arising out of the 1998 LG&E and KU merger and 2006 MISO withdrawal. The amounts at issue are generally waivers or credits granted to a limited number of Kentucky municipalities for either certain LG&E and KU or MISO transmission charges incurred for transmission service received. Due to the development of robust, accessible energy markets over time, LG&E and KU believe the mitigation commitments are no longer relevant or appropriate. In March 2019, the FERC granted LG&E's and KU's request to remove the ongoing credits, conditioned upon the implementation by LG&E and KU of a transition mechanism for certain existing power supply arrangements, subject to FERC review and approval. In July 2019, LG&E and KU proposed their transition mechanism to the FERC and in September 2019, the FERC rejected the proposed transition mechanism and issued a separate order providing clarifications of certain aspects of the March order. In October 2019, LG&E and KU filed requests for rehearing and clarification on the two September orders. In September 2020, the FERC issued its orders in the rehearing process that modified the discussion in, and set aside portions of, the September 2019 orders including adjusting factors impacting the proposed transition mechanism. In October 2020, both LG&E and KU and other parties filed separate motions for rehearing and clarification regarding FERC's September 2020 orders. In November 2020, the FERC denied the parties' rehearing requests. In November 2020 and January 2021, LG&E and KU and other parties filed for appeal of the September 2020 and November 2020 orders with the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, where certain additional prior petitions for review relating to the proceedings are also pending. On January 15, 2021, LG&E and KU made a filing seeking FERC acceptance of a new proposal for a transition mechanism. LG&E and KU cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings. LG&E and KU currently receive recovery of the waivers and credits provided through other rate mechanisms.\n\n## Rate Case Proceedings\n\n## ( PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU) ( (\n\nOn November 25, 2020, LG&E and KU filed requests with the KPSC for an increase in annual electricity and gas revenues of approximately $331 million ($131 million and $170 million in electricity revenues at LG&E and KU and $30 million in gas revenues at LG&E). The revenue increases would be an increase of 11.6% and 10.4% in electricity revenues at LG&E and KU, and an increase of 8.3% in gas revenues at LG&E. LG&E and KU are also requesting approval of a one-year billing credit which will credit customers approximately $53 million ($41 million at LG&E and $12 million at KU). The billing credit represents the return to customers of certain regulatory liabilities on LG&E's and KU's balance sheets and serves to partially mitigate the rate increases during the first year in which the new rates are in effect.\n\nLG&E's and KU's applications also include a request for a CPCN to deploy Advanced Metering Infrastructure across LG&E's and KU's service territories in Kentucky.\n\nThe applications are based on a forecasted test year of July 1, 2021 through June 30, 2022 and request an authorized return on equity of 10.0%. Subject to KPSC approval, the requested rates, decreased by the amount of the billing credit, are expected to become effective July 1, 2021. Certain counterparties have intervened in the proceedings. Data discovery and the filing of written testimony will continue through April 2021 and a hearing is expected to occur during the second quarter of 2021. PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings.\n\n## (LKE and KU)\n\nIn July 2019, KU filed a request with the VSCC for an increase in annual Virginia base electricity revenues of approximately $13 million, representing an increase of 18.2%. In January 2020, KU reached a partial settlement agreement including an increase in annual Virginia base electricity revenues of $9 million effective May 1, 2020, representing an increase of 12.9%. A hearing on the settlement and certain tariff provisions was held in January 2020. On April 6, 2020, the VSCC issued an order approving the settlement and Hearing Examiner tariff provision recommendations. KU implemented the new rates on May 1, 2020.",

PPL believes that Earnings from Ongoing Operations is useful and meaningful to investors because it provides management's view of PPL's earnings performance as another criterion in making investment decisions. In addition, PPL's management uses Earnings from Ongoing Operations in measuring achievement of certain corporate performance goals, including targets for certain executive incentive compensation. Other companies may use different measures to present financial performance.\n\nEarnings from Ongoing Operations is adjusted for the impact of special items. Special items are presented in the financial tables on an after-tax basis with the related income taxes on special items separately disclosed. Income taxes on special items, when applicable, are calculated based on the statutory tax rate of the entity where the activity is recorded. Special items may include ll items such as:\n\n- \u00b7 Unrealized gains or losses on foreign currency economic hedges (as discussed below).\n- \u00b7 Gains and losses on sales of assets not in the ordinary course of business.\n- \u00b7 Impairment charges.\n- \u00b7 Significant workforce reduction and other restructuring effects.\n- \u00b7 Acquisition and divestiture-related adjustments.\n- \u00b7 Other charges or credits that are, in management's view, non-recurring or otherwise not reflective of the company's ongoing operations.",

In calculating this measure, direct costs such as connection charges from National Grid, which owns and manages the electricity transmission network in England and Wales, and Ofgem license fees (recorded in \"Other operation and maintenance\" on the Statements of Income) are deducted from operating revenues, as they are costs passed through to customers. As a result, this measure represents the net revenues from the delivery of electricity across WPD's distribution network in the U.K. and directly related activities.\n- \u00b7 \"Kentucky Adjusted Gross Margins\" is a single financial performance measure of the electricity generation, transmission and distribution operations of the Kentucky Regulated segment, as well as the Kentucky Regulated segment's distribution and sale of natural gas. In calculating this measure, fuel, energy purchases and certain variable costs of production (recorded in \"Other operation and maintenance\" on the Statements of Income) are deducted from operating revenues. In addition, certain other expenses, recorded in \"Other operation and maintenance\", \"Depreciation\" and \"Taxes, other than income\" on the Statements of Income, associated with approved cost recovery mechanisms are offset against the recovery of those expenses, which are included in revenues. These mechanisms allow for direct recovery of these expenses and, in some cases, returns on capital investments and performance incentives. As a result, this measure represents the net revenues from electricity and gas operations.\n- \u00b7 \"Pennsylvania Adjusted Gross Margins\" is a single financial performance measure of the electricity transmission and distribution operations of the Pennsylvania Regulated segment. In calculating this measure, utility revenues and expenses associated with approved recovery mechanisms, including energy provided as a PLR, are offset with minimal impact on earnings. Costs associated with these mechanisms are recorded in \"Energy purchases,\" \"Other operation and maintenance,\" (which are primarily Act 129, Storm Damage and Universal Service program costs), \"Depreciation\" (which is primarily related to the Act 129 Smart Meter program) and \"Taxes, other than income,\" (which is primarily gross receipts tax) on the",

This measure represents the net revenues from the Pennsylvania Regulated segment's electricity delivery operations.\n\nThese measures are not intended to replace \"Operating Income,\" which is determined in accordance with GAAP, as an indicator of overall operating performance. Other companies may use different measures to analyze and report their results of operations. Management believes these measures provide additional useful criteria to make investment decisions. These performance measures are used, in conjunction with other information, by senior management and PPL's Board of Directors to manage operations and analyze actual results compared with budget.\n\n## Changes in Adjusted Gross Margins g j g\n\nThe following table shows Adjusted Gross Margins by PPL's reportable segment and by component, as applicable, for the year ended December 31 as well as the changes between periods.

In November 2020, PPL declared its quarterly common stock dividend, payable January 4, 2021, at 41.50 cents per share (equivalent to $1.66 per annum). Future t dividends, declared at the discretion of the Board of Directors, will depend upon future earnings, cash flows, financial and leuu gal requirements and other factors.\n\nSubject to certain exceptions, PPL may not declare or pay any cash dividend or distribution on its capital stock during any period in which PPL Capital Funding defers interest payments on its 2007 Series A Junior Subordinated Notes due 2067 or 2013 Series B Junior Subordinated Notes due 2073. At December 31, 2020, no interest payments were deferred.\n\n## (PPL Electric, LKE, LG&E and KU)\n\nFrom time to time, as determined by their respective Board of Directors, the Registrants pay dividends, distributions or return capital, as applicable, to their respective shareholders or members. Certain of the credit facilities of PPL Electric, LKE, LG&E and KU include minimum debt covenant ratios that could effectively restrict the payment of dividends or distributions.\n\n## (All Registrants)\n\nSee Note 8 to the Financial Statements for these and other restrictions related to distributions on capital interests for the Registrants and their subsidiaries.\n\n## Purchase or Redemption of Debt Securities\n\nThe Registrants will continue to evaluate outstanding debt securities and may decide to purchase or redeem these securities in open market or privately negotiated transactions, in exchange transactions or otherwise, depending upon prevailing market conditions, available cash and other factors, and may be commenced or suspended at any time. The amounts involved may be material.",

Based on their respective independent reviews, the rating agencies may make certain ratings revisions or ratings affirmations. aa\n\nA credit rating reflects an assessment by the rating agency of the creditworthiness associated with an issuer and particular securities that it issues. The credit ratings of the Registrants and their subsidiaries are based on information provided by the Registrants and other sources. The ratings of Moody's and S&P are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any securities of the Registrants or their subsidiaries. Such ratings may be subject to revisions or withdrawal by the agencies at any time and should be evaluated independently of each other and any other rating that may be assigned to the securities.\n\nThe credit ratings of the Registrants and their subsidiaries affect their liquidity, access to capital markets and cost of borrowingrr under their credit facilities. A downgrade in the Registrants' or their subsidiaries' credit ratings could result in higher borrowingrr costs and reduced access to capital markets. The Registrants and their subsidiaries have no credit rating triggers that would result in the reduction of access to capital markets or the acceleration of maturity dates of outstanding debt. f\n\nThe following table sets forth the Registrants' and their subsidiaries' credit ratings for outstanding debt securities or commercial paper programs as of December 31, 2020.\n\n|                      | Senior Unsecured   | Senior Unsecured   | Senior Secured   | Senior Secured   | Commercial Paper   | Commercial Paper   |\n|----------------------|--------------------|--------------------|------------------|------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| Issuer               | Moody's            | S&P                | Moody's          | S&P              | Moody's            | S&P                |\n| PPL                  |                    |                    |                  |                  |                    |                    |\n| PPL Capital Funding  | Baa2               | BBB+               |                  |                  | P-2                | A-2                |\n| WPD plc              | Baa3               | BBB+               |                  |                  |                    |                    |\n|                      | Baa1               | A-                 |                  |                  |                    |                    |\n|                      | Baa1               | A-                 |                  |                  |                    |                    |\n|                      | Baa1               | A-                 |                  |                  |                    |                    |\n|                      | Baa1               | A-                 |                  |                  |                    |                    |\n| PPL and PPL Electric |                    |                    |                  |                  |                    |                    |\n| PPL Electric         |                    |                    | A1               | A                | P-2                | A-2                |\n| PPL and LKE          |                    |                    |                  |                  |                    |                    |\n| LKE                  | Baa1               | BBB+               |                  |                  |                    |                    |\n|                      |                    |                    | A1               | A                | P-2                | A-2                |\n| KU                   |                    |                    | A1               | A                | P-2                | A-2                |\n\nThe rating agencies have taken the following actions related to the Registrants and their subsidiaries.\n\n## (PPL)\n\nIn April 2020, Moody's and S&P assigned ratings of Baa2 and BBB+ to PPL Capital Funding's $1 billion 4.125% Senior Notes due 2030. The notes were issued April 1, 2020.\n\n## (PPL and PPL Electric)\n\nIn September 2020, Moody's and S&P assigned ratings of A1 and A to PPL Electric's $250 million First Mortgage Bonds, Floating Rate Series, due 2023. The bonds were issued October 1, 2020.\n\nIn September 2020, Moody's and S&P assigned ratings of A1 and A to PEDFA's $90 million Pollution Control Revenue Refunding Bonds, Series 2008, due 2023, previously issued on behalf of PPL Electric. The bonds were remarketed October 1, 2020.\n\n## (PPL, LKE and LG&E)\n\nIn August 2020, Moody's and S&P assigned ratings of A1 and A to the Louisville/Jefferson County Metro Government, Kentucky's $23 million 0.90% Pollution Control Revenue Bonds, 2001 Series A, due 2026, previously issued on behalf of LG&E.

The bonds were remarketed September 3, 2020.\n\n## (PPL, LKE and KU)\n\nIn May 2020, Moody's and S&P assigned ratings of A1 and A to KU's $500 million 3.30% First Mortgage Bonds due 2050. The bonds were issued June 3, 2020.\n\n## Ratings Triggersg gg\n\n## (PPL)\n\nAs discussed in Note 8 to the Financial Statements, certain of WPD's senior unsecured notes may be put by the holders to the issuer for redemption if the long-term credit ratings assigned to the notes are withdrawn by any of the rating agencies (Moody's or S&P) or reduced to a non-investment grade rating of Ba1 or BB+ or lower in connection with a restructuring event. A restructuring event includes the loss of, or a material adverse change to, the distribution licenses under which WPD (East Midlands), WPD (South West), WPD (South Wales) and WPD (West Midlands) operate and would be a trigger event for each company. These notes totaled \u00a35.8 billion (approximately $7.7 billion) nominal value at December 31, 2020.\n\n## (PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU)\n\nVarious derivative and non-derivative contracts, including contracts for the sale and purchase of electricity and fuel, commodity transportation and storage, interest rate and foreign currency instruments (for PPL), contain provisions that require the posting of additional collateral, or permit the counterparty to terminate the contract, if PPL's, LKE's, LG&E's or KU's or their subsidiaries' credit rating, as applicable, were to fall below investment grade. See Note 18 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of \"Credit Risk-Related Contingent Features,\" including a discussion of the potential additional collateral requirements for PPL, LKE and LG&E for derivative contracts in a net liability position at December 31, 2020.\n\n## Guarantees for Subsidiaries (PPL)\n\nPPL guarantees certain consolidated affiliate financing arrangements. Some of the guarantees contain financial and other covenants that, if not met, would limit or restrict the consolidated affiliates' access to funds under these financing arrangements, accelerate maturity of such arrangements or limit the consolidated affiliates' ability to enter into certain transactions. At thistt time, PPL believes that these covenants will not limit access to relevant funding sources. See Note 14 to the Financial Statements for additional information about guarantees.\n\n## Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements (All Registrants)\n\nThe Registrants have entered into certain agreements that may contingently require payment to a guaranteed or indemnified party.

The Registrants and their subsidiaries utilize various financial derivative instruments to adjust the mix of fixed and floating interest rates in their debt portfolios, adjust the duration of their debt portfolios and lock in benchmark interest rates in anticipation of future financing, when appropriate. Risk limits under the risk management program are designed to balance risk exposure to volatility in interest expense and changes in the fair value of the debt portfolios due to changes in the absolute level of interest rates. In addition, the interest rate risk of certain subsidiaries is potentially mitigated as a result of the existing regulatorytt framework or the timing of rate cases.\n\nThe following interest rate hedges were outstanding at December 31:\n\n|                          | 2020            | 2020                                     | 2020                                          | 2020                       | 2019            | 2019                                     | 2019                                          |\n|--------------------------|-----------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n|                          | Exposure Hedged | Fair Value, Net - Asset (Liability)  (a) | Effect of a 10% Adverse Movement in Rates (b) | Maturities Ranging Through | Exposure Hedged | Fair Value, Net - Asset (Liability)  (a) | Effect of a 10% Adverse Movement in Rates (b) |\n| PPL                      |                 |                                          |                                               |                            |                 |                                          |                                               |\n| Cash flow hedges         |                 |                                          |                                               |                            |                 |                                          |                                               |\n| Cross-currency swaps (c) | $ 702           | $ 148                                    | $ (69)                                        | 2028                       | $ 702           | $ 156                                    | $ (71)                                        |\n| Economic hedges          |                 |                                          |                                               |                            |                 |                                          |                                               |\n| Interest rate swaps (d)  | 64              | (24)                                     | -                                             | 2033                       | 147             | (22)                                     | (1)                                           |\n| LKE                      |                 |                                          |                                               |                            |                 |                                          |                                               |\n| Economic hedges          |                 |                                          |                                               |                            |                 |                                          |                                               |\n| Interest rate swaps (d)  | 64              | (24)                                     | -                                             | 2033                       | 147             | (22)                                     | (1)                                           |\n| LG&E                     |                 |                                          |                                               |                            |                 |                                          |                                               |\n| Economic hedges          |                 |                                          |                                               |                            |                 |                                          |                                               |\n| Interest rate swaps (d)  | 64              | (24)                                     | -                                             | 2033                       | 147             | (22)                                     | (1)                                           |\n\nThe Registrants are exposed to a potential increase in interest expense and to changes in the fair value of their debt portfolios.

Potential commodity price risk is insignificant and mitigated through its PUC-approved cost recovery mechanism and full-requirement supply agreements to serve its PLR customers which transfer the risk to energy suppliers.\n- \u00b7 LG&E's and KU's rates include certain mechanisms for fuel, fuel-related expenses and energy purchases. In addition, LG&E's rates include a mechanism for natural gas supply expenses. These mechanisms generally provide for timely recovery of market price fluctuations associated with these expenses.\n\n## Volumetric Risk\n\nVolumetric risk is the risk related to the changes in volume of retail sales due to weather, economic conditions or other factors. PPL is exposed to volumetric risk through its subsidiaries as described below.\n\n- \u00b7 WPD is exposed to volumetric risk which is significantly mitigated as a result of the method of regulation in the U.K. Under the RIIO-ED1 price control regulations, recovery of such exposure occurs on a two year lag. See Note 1 to the Financial Statements for additional information on revenue recognition under RIIO-ED1.\n- \u00b7 PPL Electric, LG&E and KU are exposed to volumetric risk on retail sales, mainly due to weather and other economic conditions for which there is limited mitigation between rate cases.\n\n## Defined Benefit Plans - Equity Securities Price Risk\n\nSee \"Application of Critical Accounting Policies - Defined Benefits\" for additional information regarding the effect of equity securities price risk on plan assets.\n\n## Credit Risk\n\n## (All Registrants)\n\nCredit risk is the risk that the Registrants would incur a loss as a result of nonperformance by counterparties of their contractual obligations. The Registrants maintain credit policies and procedures with respect to counterparty credit (including requirements that counterparties maintain specified credit ratings) and require other assurances in the form of credit support or collateral in certain circumstances in order to limit counterparty credit risk. However, the Registrants, as applicable, have concentrations of suppliers and customers among electric utilities, financial institutions and energy marketing and trading companies. These concentrations may impact the Registrants' overall exposure to credit risk, positively or negatively, as counterparties may be similarly affected by changes in economic, regulatory or other conditions.\n\n## (PPL and PPL Electric)\n\nIn January 2017, the PUC issued a Final Order approving PPL Electric's default service plan for the period June 2017 through May 2021, which included a total of eight semi-annual solicitations for electricity supply.

        "page_content": "the PUC approved PPL Electric's next default service plan for the period of June 2021 through May 2025, which includes a total of eight solicitations for electricity supply held semiannually in April and October. The new plan also includes eight solicitations for alternative energy credits held semiannually in January and July with the first solicitation being in July 2021 and the final solicitation being in January 2025.\n\nUnder the standard Supply Master Agreement (the Agreement) for the competitive solicitation process, PPL Electric requires all suppliers to post collateral if their credit exposure exceeds an established credit limit. In the event a supplier defaults on its obligation, PPL Electric would be required to seek replacement power in the market. All incremental costs incurred by PPL Electric would be recoverable from customers in future rates. At December 31, 2020, most of the successful bidders under all of the solicitations had an investment grade credit rating from S&P and were not required to post collateral under the Agreement. A small portion of bidders were required to post an insignificant amount of collateral under the Agreement. There is no instance under the Agreement in which PPL Electric is required to post collateral to its suppliers.\n\nSee Note 18 to the Financial Statements for additional information on credit risk.\n\n## Foreign Currency Translation (PPL)\n\nThe value of the British pound sterling fluctuates in relation to the U.S. dollar. In 2020, changes in this exchange rate resulted in a foreign currency translation gain of $267 million, which reflected a $433 million increase to PP&E and a $76 million increase to goodwill partially offset by a $214 million increase to long-term debt and a $28 million increase to other net liabilities. In 2019, changes in this exchange rate resulted in a foreign currency translation gain of $106 million, which reflected a $181 million increase to PP&E, $34 million increase to goodwill and $12 million decrease to other net liabilities partially offset by a $121 million increase to long-term debt. In 2018, changes in this exchange rate resulted in a foreign currency translation loss of $453 million, which reflected a $754 million decrease to PP&E and $150 million decrease to goodwill partially offset by a $445 million decrease to long-term debt and a decrease of $6 million to other net liabilities.\n\n## (All Registrants)\n\n## Related Party Transactions\n\nThe Registrants are not aware of any material ownership interests or operating responsibility by senior management in outside partnerships, including leasing transactions with variable interest entities, or other entities doing business with the Registrants. See Note 15 to the Financial Statements for additional information on related party transactions for PPL Electric, LKE, LG&E and KU.\n\n## Acquisitions, Development and Divestitures\n\nThe Registrants from time to time evaluate opportunities for potential acquisitions, divestitures and development projects. Development projects are reexamined based on market conditions and other factors to determinet whether to proceed with, modify or terminate the projects. Any resulting transactions may impact future financial results.\n\n## (PPL)\n\nOn August 10, 2020, PPL announced that it initiated a formal process to sell its U.K. utility business. There can be no assurance of any specific outcome, including whether the sale process will result in the completion of any potential transaction, the timing or terms thereof, the value or benefits that may be realized or the effect that any potential transaction will have on futurer financial results. See Note 9 to the Financial Statements for additional information on the potential sale of the U.K. utility business.\n\n## (All Registrants)\n\n## Environmental Matters\n\nExtensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations are applicable to PPL's, PPL Electric's, LKE's, LG&E's and KU's air emissions, water discharges and the management of hazardous and solid waste, as well as other aspects of the Registrants' businesses. The costs of compliance or alleged non-compliance cannot be predicted with certainty but could be significant. In addition, costs may increase significantly if the requirements or scope of environmental laws or regulations, or similar rules, are expanded or changed. Costs may take the form of increased capital expenditures or operating and maintenance expenses, monetary fines, penalties or other restrictions. Many of these environmental law considerations are also applicable to",

See Note 20 to the Financial Statements for information related to the impacts of CCRs on AROs. See \"Business - Environmental Matters\" for additional information regarding climate change, NAAQS and other environmental matters.\n\n## Sustainability\n\nIncreasing attention has been focused on a broad range of corporate activities under the heading of 'sustainability', which has resulted in a significant increase in the number of requests from interested parties for information on sustainability topics. These parties range from investor groups focused on environmental, social, governance and other matters to non-investors concerned with a variety of public policy matters. Often the scope of the information sought is very broad and not necessarily relevant to an issuer's business or industry. As a result, a number of private groups have proposed to standardize the subject matter constituting sustainability, either generally or by industry. Those efforts remain ongoing. In addition, certain of these private groups have advocated that the SEC promulgate regulations requiring specific sustainability reporting under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ''34 Act'), or that issuers voluntarily include certain sustainability disclosure in their '34 Act reports. To date, no new reporting requirements have been adopted or proposed by the SEC.\n\nAs has been PPL's practice, to the extent sustainability issues have or may have a material impact on the Registrants' financial condition or results of operation, PPL discloses such matters in accordance with applicable securities law and SEC regulations. With respect to other sustainability topics that PPL deems relevant to investors but that are not required to be reported under applicable securities law and SEC regulation, PPL will continue each spring to publish its annual sustainability report including tracking reductions related to the company's goal to reduce carbon emissions and post that report on its corporate website at www.pplweb.com and on www.pplsustainability.com. Neither the information in such annual sustainability report nor the information at such websites is incorporated in this Form 10-K by reference, and it should not be considered a part of this Form rr 10-K. In preparing its sustainability report, PPL is guided by the framework established by the Global Reporting Initiative, which identifies environmental, social, governance and other subject matter categories. PPL also participates in efforts by the Edison Electric Institute to provide the appropriate subset of sustainability information that can be applied consistently across the electric utility industry. Additionally, PPL publicly discloses its corporate political contributions and responds to the CDP climate survey.\n\n## Cybersecurity\n\nSee 'Cybersecurity Management' in 'Business' for a discussion of cybersecurity risks affecting the Registrants and the related f strategies for managing these risks.\n\n## Competition\n\nSee \"Competition\" under each of PPL's reportable segments in \"Business - General - Segment Information\" for a discussion of competitive factors affecting the Registrants.\n\n## New Accounting Guidanceg\n\nSee Note 1 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of new accounting guidance adopted.\n\n## Application of Critical Accounting Policiespp g\n\nFinancial condition and results of operations are impacted by the methods, assumptions and estimates used in the application of critical accounting policies. The following accounting policies are particularly important to an understanding of the reportedrr financial condition or results of operations and require management to make estimates or other judgments of matters that are inherently uncertain. Changes in the estimates or other judgments included within these accounting policies could result in a significant change to the information presented in the Financial Statements (these accounting policies are also discussed in Note",

Senior management has reviewed with PPL's Audit Committee these critical accounting policies, the following disclosures regarding their application, and the estimates and assumptions regarding them.\n\n## Defined Benefits\n\n## (All Registrants)\n\nCertain of the Registrants and/or their subsidiaries sponsor or participate in certain qualified funded and non-qualified unfunded defined benefit pension plans and both funded and unfunded other postretirement benefit plans. See Notes 1, 7 and 12 to the Financial Statements for additional information about the plans and the accounting for defined benefits. t\n\nA summary of plan sponsors by Registrant and whether a Registrant or its subsidiaries sponsor (S) or participate in and receives allocations (P) from those plans is shown in the table below.\n\n| Plan Sponsor   | PPL   | PPL Electric   | LKE   | LG&E   | KU   |\n|----------------|-------|----------------|-------|--------|------|\n| PPL Services   | S     | P              |       |        |      |\n| WPD (a)        | S     |                |       |        |      |\n|                |       |                | S     | P      | P    |\n\nManagement makes certain assumptions regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets. As f such, annual net periodic defined benefit costs are recorded in current earnings or regulatory assets and liabilities based on estimated results. Any differences between actual and estimated results are recorded in AOCI or, in the case of PPL Electric, LG&E and KU, regulatory assets and liabilities for amounts that are expected to be recovered through regulated customer rates. These amounts in AOCI or regulatory assets and liabilities are amortized to income over future periods. The significant assumptions are:\n\n- \u00b7 Discount Rate - In selecting the discount rates for U.S. defined benefit plans, the plan sponsors start with a cash flow analysis of the expected benefit payment stream for their plans. The plan-specific cash flows are matched against the coupons and expected maturity values of Aa-rated non-callable (or callable with make-whole provisions) bonds that could be purchased for a hypothetical settlement portfolio. The plan sponsors then use the single discount rate derived from matching the discounted benefit payment stream to the market value of the selected bond portfolio.\n- In selecting the discount rate for its U.K. pension plans, WPD starts with a cash flow analysis of the expected benefit payment stream for its plans. These plan-specific cash flows are matched against a spot-rate yield curve to determine the assumed discount rate. The spot-rate yield curve uses an iBoxx British pounds sterling denominated corporate bond index as its base. From this base, those bonds with the lowest and highest yields are eliminated to develop an appropriate subset of bonds. WPD uses the single weighted-average discount rate derived from the spot rates to discount the benefit obligation. In addition, the spot rates that match the cash flows associated with the service cost and interest cost are used to discount those components of net periodic defined benefit cost.\n- \u00b7 Expected Return on Plan Assets - The expected long-term rates of return for pension and other postretirement benefits are based on management's projections using a best-estimate of expected returns, volatilities and correlations for each asset class. Each plan's specific current and expected asset allocations are also considered in developing a reasonable return assumption.\n- \u00b7 Rate of Compensation Increase - Management projects employees' annual pay increases, which are used to project employees' pension benefits at retirement. In selecting a rate of compensation increase, plan sponsors consider past experience, the potential impact of movements in inflation rates and expectations of ongoing compensation practices.\n\nSee Note 12 to the Financial Statements for details of the assumptions selected for pension and other postretirement benefits. A variance in the assumptions could significantly impact accrued defined benefit liabilities or assets, reported annual net periodic defined benefit costs and AOCI or regulatory assets and liabilities.\n\nThe following tables reflect changes in certain assumptions based on the Registrants' primary defined benefit plans. The inverse of this change would have the opposite impact on accrued defined benefit liabilities or assets, reported annual net periodic",

On a quarterly basis, uncertain tax positions are reassessed by considering information known as of the reporting date. Based on management's assessment of new information, a tax benefit may subsequently be recognized for a previously unrecognized tax position, a previously recognized tax position may be derecognized, or the benefit of a previously recognized tax position may be remeasured. The amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of issues raised by taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued and may materially impact the financial statements in the future.\n\nThe need for valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets also requires significant management judgment. Valuation allowances are initially recorded and reevaluated each reporting period by assessing the likelihood of the ultimate realization of a deferred tax asset. Management considers several factors in assessing the expected realization of a deferred tax asset, including the reversal of temporary differences, future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Any tax planning strategy utilized in this assessment must meet the recognition and measurement criteria utilized to account for an uncertain tax position. When evaluating the need for valuation allowances, the uncertainty posed by political risk on such",

The amount of deferred tax assets ultimately realized may differ materially from thed estimates utilized in the computation of valuation allowances and may materially impact the financial statements in the future.\n\nSee Note 6 to the Financial Statements for income tax disclosures, including the impact of the TCJA and management's conclusion that the undistributed earnings of WPD are considered indefinitely reinvested. Based on the conclusion of indefinite reinvestment, PPL Global has not recorded deferred U.S. federal income taxes associated with the outside book-tax basis difference on its investment in WPD.\n\n## Regulatory Assets and Liabilities\n\n## (All Registrants)\n\nPPL Electric, LG&E and KU are subject to cost-based rate regulation. As a result, the effects of regulatory actions are required to be reflected in the financial statements. Assets and liabilities are recorded that result from the regulated ratemaking process that may not be recorded under GAAP for non-regulated entities. Regulatory assets generally represent incurred costs that have been deferred because such costs are probable of future recovery in regulated customer rates. Regulatory liabilities are recognized for amounts expected to be returned through future regulated customer rates. In certain cases, regulatory liabilities are recorded based on an understanding or agreement with the regulator that rates have been set to recover costs that are expected to be incurred in the future, and the regulated entity is accountable for any amounts charged pursuant to such rates and not yet expended for the intended purpose.\n\nManagement continually assesses whether the regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as changes in the applicable regulatory and political environments, the ability to recover costs through regulated rates, recent rate orders to the Registrants and other regulated entities, and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation. Based on this continual assessment, management believes the existing regulatory assets are probable of recovery. This assessment reflects the current political and regulatory climate at the state and federal levels and is subject to change in the future. If future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, the regulatory asset would be written-off. Additionally, the regulatory agencies can provide flexibility in the manner and timing of recovery of regulatory assets.\n\nSee Note 7 to the Financial Statements for regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities recorded at December 31, 2020 and 2019, as well as additional information on those regulatory assets and liabilities. All regulatory assets are either currently being recovered under specific rate orders, represent amounts that are expected to be recovered in future rates or benefit future periods based upon established regulatory practices.\n\n## (PPL)\n\nWPD's operations are regulated by Ofgem. Ofgem has adopted a price control regulatory framework focused on outputs and performance in contrast to traditional U.S. utility ratemaking that operates under a cost recovery model. Because the regulatory rr model is incentive-based, WPD is not subject to accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation as prescribed by GAAP for entities subject to cost-based rate regulation and does not record regulatory assets and liabilities. See \"General - Regulation\" aa in Note 1 to the Financial Statements for additional information.\n\n## Price Risk Management (PPL)\n\nSee \"Financial Condition - Risk Management\" above.\n\n## Asset Impairment (Excluding Investments)\n\n## Goodwill Impairment (PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU) p\n\nGoodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. PPL has determined its reporting units to be primarily at the same aa level as its reportable segments. LKE, LG&E and KU are individually single operating and reportable segments. A goodwill impairment test is performed annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the reporting unit may be greater than the reporting unit's fair value. Additionally, goodwill is tested for impairment after a portion of goodwill has been allocated to a business to be disposed of.\n\nEffective January 1, 2020, the Registrants adopted accounting guidance that simplifies the test for goodwill impairment by ff eliminating the second step of the quantitative test. Under the new guidance, the fair value of a reporting unit will be compared",

See \"Long-Lived and Intangible Assets - Asset Impairment (Excluding Investments)\" in Note 1 to the Financial Statements for further discussion of goodwill impairment tests. See Note 19 to the Financial Statements for information on goodwill balances at December 31, 2020.\n\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2020, PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU considered whether the economic events associated with COVID-19, which resulted in PPL's shares experiencing volatility and a decrease in market value, would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the Registrants' reporting units below their carrying amounts. Based on our assessment, a quantitative impairment test was not required for the LKE, LG&E and KU reporting units, but was required for the U.K. Regulated segment reporting unit, the allocated goodwill of which was $2.5 billion at March 31, 2020. The test did not indicate impairment of the reporting unit.\n\nManagement used both discounted cash flows and market multiples, including implied RAV premiums, which required significant assumptions, to estimate the fair value of the reporting units. Significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flows include discount and growth rates, the finalization of RIIO-ED2, and projected operating and capital cash flows. Projected operating and capital cash flows are based on internal business plans, which assume the occurrence of certain future events. Significant assumptions used in the market multiples include sector market performance and comparable transactions.\n\nA high degree of judgment is required to develop estimates related to fair value conclusions. A decrease in the forecasted cash flows of 10%, an increase in the discount rate of 10%, or a 10% decrease in the market multiples would not have resulted in an impairment of goodwill for the U.K. Regulated segment reporting unit as of March 31, 2020.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020, PPL, for its U.K. Regulated and Kentucky Regulated segments, and individually for LKE, LG&E and KU, elected to perform qualitative step zero evaluations for their annual goodwill impairment tests as of October 1, 2020. PPL further updated the qualitative step zero evaluation for the U.K. Regulated segment as of December 31, 2020. Based on these evaluations, management concluded it was not more likely than not that the fair value of these reporting units was less than their carrying values. As such, quantitative impairment tests were not performed.\n\n## Impairment of Long-lived Assets (PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU) p g\n\nImpairment analyses are performed for long-lived assets that are subject to depreciation or amortization whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a long-lived asset's carrying amount may not be recoverable. For these long-lived assets classified as held and used, such events or changes in circumstances are:\n\n- \u00b7 a significant decrease in the market price of an asset;\n- \u00b7 a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is being used or in its physical condition;\n- \u00b7 a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate;\n- \u00b7 an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of d an asset;\n- \u00b7 a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of losses or a forecast that demonstrates continuing losses; or\n- \u00b7 a current expectation that, more likely than not, an asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life.\n\nFor a long-lived asset classified as held and used, an impairment is recognized when the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. The carrying amount is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If the asset is impaired, an impairment loss is f recorded to adjust the asset's carrying amount to its estimated fair value. Management must make significant judgments to estimate future cash flows, including the useful lives of the assets, the amount of revenue, the amount of capital and operations and maintenance spending and management's intended use of the assets. Alternate courses of action are considered to recover the carrying amount of a long-lived asset, and estimated cash flows from the \"most likely\" alternative are used to assess impairment whenever one alternative is clearly the most likely outcome. If no alternative is clearly the most likely, then a probability-weighted approach is used taking into consideration estimated cash flows from the alternatives. For assets tested for ff impairment as of the balance sheet date, the estimates of future cash flows used in that test consider the likelihood of possible outcomes that existed at the balance sheet date, including an assessment of the likelihood of a future sale of the assets.

Changes in assumptions and estimates could result in materially different results than those identified and recorded in the financial statements.\n\n## Initiation of Formal Process to Sell U.K. Utility Business (PPL)\n\nAs discussed in Note 9 to the Financial Statements, on August 10, 2020, PPL announced that it initiated a formal process to sell its U.K. utility business. As a result of the potential sale, PPL assessed the recoverability of the assets of its U.K. utility business. PPL prepared probability-weighted undiscounted cash flow estimates as ofd December 31, 2020 and September 30, f 2020 that considered the likelihood of the possible outcomes of the sale process, including the possibility of not selling the U.K. utility business. The resulting cash flow analyses exceeded the carrying value of the assets of the U.K. utility business. A change in the possible outcomes of the sale process could result in the carrying value of the assets of the U.K. utility business not being recoverable, which could result in an impairment in future periods. The recoverability test was performed assuming estimates of selling price, expected forecasted cash flows from the operations of the U.K. utility business (which included significant assumptions made by management to estimate projected operating and capital cash flows, RAV and the finalization of RIIO-ED2) and weighted average probability of sale. A decrease in the expected selling price of 10%, a decrease in the forecasted cash flows from the operations of the U.K. utility business of 10%, or a change in the probability of a sale occurring of 10% would not have resulted in the carrying value of the assets of the U.K. utility business not being recoverable.\n\n## Asset Retirement Obligations (PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU)\n\nARO liabilities are required to be recognized for legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets. Initial obligations are measured at estimated fair value. An ARO must be recognized when incurred if the fair value of the ARO can be reasonably estimated. An equivalent amount is recorded as an increase in the value of the capitalized asset and amortized to expense over the asset's useful life.\n\nIn determining AROs, management must make significant judgments and estimates to calculate fair value. Fair value is developed using an expected present value technique based on assumptions of market participants that consider estimated retirement costs in current period dollars, inflated to the anticipated retirement date and discounted back to the date the ARO was incurred. Changes in assumptions and estimates included within the calculations of the fair value of AROs could result in significantly different results than those identified and recorded in the financial statements. Estimated ARO costs and settlemd ent dates, which affect the carrying value of the ARO and the related capitalized asset, are reviewed periodically to ensure that any material changes are incorporated into the ARO estimate. Any change to the capitalized asset is generally amortized over thed remaining life of the associated long-lived asset.\n\nSee 'Long-Lived and Intangible Assets - Asset Retirement Obligations' in Note 1, Note 7 and Note 20 to the Financial Statements for additional information on AROs.\n\nAt December 31, 2020, the total recorded balances and information on the most significant recorded AROs were as follows.\n\n|      |                    | Most Significant AROs   | Most Significant AROs   | Most Significant AROs                  |\n|------|--------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n|      | Total ARO Recorded | Amount Recorded         | % of Total              | Description                            |\n| PPL  | $ 250              | $ 147                   | 59                      | Ponds, landfills and natural gas mains |\n| LKE  | 182                | 147                     | 81                      | Ponds, landfills and natural gas mains |\n| LG&E | 67                 | 49                      | 73                      | Ponds, landfills and natural gas mains |\n| KU   | 115                | 98                      | 85                      | Ponds and landfills                    |\n\nThe most significant assumptions surrounding AROs are the forecasted retirement costs (including settlement dates and the timing of cash flows), discount and inflation rates. At December 31, 2020, a 10% increase to retirement cost would increase these ARO liabilities by $32 million. A 0.25% decrease in the discount rate would increase these ARO liabilities by $3 milliont and a 0.25% increase in the inflation rate would increase these ARO liabilities by $3 million. There would be no significant change to the annual depreciation expense of the ARO asset or the annual accretion expense of the ARO liability as a result of these changes in assumptions.\n\n## Revenue Recognition - Unbilled Revenues (LKE, LG&E and KU)\n\nRevenues related to the sale of energy are recorded when service is rendered or when energy is delivered to customers.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years f in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 18, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are fra ee of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\n## Regulatory Assets and Liabilities - Impact of Rate-Regulation on Various Account Balances and Disclosures - Refer to Notes 1 and 7 to the Financial Statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, PPL Corporation owns and operates three cost-based rate-regulated utilitiesaa in the United States (U.S.) for which rates are set by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), the Kentucky Public Service Commission (KPSC), the Virginia State Corporation Commission (VSCC) and the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PUC) to enable the regulated utilities to recover the costs of providing electric or gas service, as applicable, and to provide a reasonable return to shareholders. Base rates are generally established based on a future test period. As a result, the financial statements are subject to the accounting for certain types of regulation as prescribed by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and reflect the effects of ref gulatory actions. Regulatory assets are recognized for the effect of transactions or events where future recovery of underlying costs is probable in regulated customer rates. The effect of such accounting is to defer certain or qualifying costs that would otherwise currently be charged to expense. Regulatory liabilities are recognized for amounts expected to be returned through future regulated customer rates.",

        "page_content": "The accounting for regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities is based on specific ratemaking decisions or precedent for each transaction or event as prescribed by the FERC, KPSC, VSCC and PUC. The accounting for the economics of rate regulation also impacts other financial statement line items, including regulated utility plant, operating revenues, depreciation, and income taxes and impacts multiple note disclosures. As of December 31, 2020, PPL Corporation had aL recorded regulatory assets balance of $1,361 million and regulatory liabilities balance of $2,609 million.\n\nPPL Corporation's U.S. regulated utilities' rates are subject to d cost-based rate-setting processes and annual earnings oversight. Rates are established based on an analysis of the costs incurred and the regulated utility's capital structure and must be approved by one or more federal or state regulatory commissions, including the FERC, KPSC, VSCC and PUC. Regulatory decisions can have an impact on the recovery of costs, the rate earned on invested capital, and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered by rates. The FERC, KPSC, VSCC and PUC regulation of rates is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and an adequate return on capital investments. Decisions to be made by the FERC, KPSC, VSCC and PUC in the future will impact the accounting for regulated operations, including decisions about the amount of allowable costs and t return on invested capital included in rates and any refunds that may be required. While PPL Corporation's U.S. utilities have indicated that they expect to recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the FERC, KPSC, VSCC or PUC will not approve full recovery of such costs or approve recovery on a timely basis in future regulatory decisions.\n\nWe identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management in continually assessing whether the regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors, such as changes in the applicable regulatory and political environments, the ability to recover costs through regulated rates, recent rate orders and the status of any pending legislation. Auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate-setting process due to its inherent complexities.\n\n## How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the FERC, KPSC, VSCC and PUC included the following, among others:\n\n- \u00b7 We tested the effectiveness of management's internal controls over evaluating the likelihood of recovery in future rates of costs deferred as regulatory assets. We tested the effectiveness of management's controls over the recognition of amounts as regulated utility plant, regulatory assets or liabilities, operating revenues, depreciation expense, income r tax expense, and note disclosures.  We tested the effectiveness of management's internal controls over the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates.\n- \u00b7 We obtained and read relevant regulatory orders issued by the FERC, KPSC, VSCC and PUC for PPL Corporation's U.S. regulated utilities and other public utilities, regulatory statutes, interpretations, procedural memorandums, filings made by interveners, and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. We evaluated the external information and compared to management's recorded regulatory asset and liability balances for completeness.\n- \u00b7 We inquired of management about regulated utility plant that may be abandoned. We inspected minutes of the Board of Directors, regulatory orders and other filings with the FERC, KPSC, VSCC and PUC to identify any evidence that may contradict management's assertion regarding probability of an abandonment.\n- \u00b7 We evaluated PPL Corporation's disclosures related to the impacts of rate-regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments.",

Net deferred tax assets have been recognized based on management's estimates of future taxable income for the U.S. and the U.K. PPL Corporation files tax returns in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax laws and regulations. Valuation allowances have been established for the amounts that, more likely than not, will not be realized. PPL Corporation has $906 million of valuation allowances recorded on $1,455 million of deferred tax assets related to federal, state and foreign loss and credit carryforwards as of December 31, 2020.\n\nManagement considers a number of factors in assessing the realization of a deferred tax asset associated with net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards, including the reversal of temporary differences, future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax-planning strategies. Management also considers the uncertainty posed by political risk and the effect of this uncertainty on the various factors that management takes into account in evaluating the need for valuation allowances. The amount of deferred tax assets ultimately realized may differ materially from the estimates utilized in the computation of valuation allowances and may materially impact the financial statements in the future.\n\nWe identified management's estimation of the valuation allowances associated with loss and credit carryforwards as a critical audit matter because the need for valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets requires significant management judgment. A high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our income tax specialists, was required when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management's estimates of f future taxable income and the determination of whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized.\n\n## How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures related to estimated future taxable income and the determination of whether it is more likely than not that aa the deferred tax assets will be realized included the following, among others:\n\n- \u00b7 We tested the effectiveness of management's internal controls over the valuation allowance for income taxes, including management's internal controls over the estimates of future taxable income and the determination of whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized.\n- \u00b7 We evaluated the reasonableness of the methods, assumptions, and judgments used by management to determine whether a valuation allowance was necessary.\n- \u00b7 With the assistance of our income tax specialists, we evaluated whether the sources of management's estimated taxable income were of the appropriate character and sufficient to utilize the deferred tax assets under the relevant tax laws.\n- \u00b7 We evaluated management's ability to accurately estimate taxable income by comparing actual results to management's historical estimates and evaluating whether there have been any changes that would affect management's ability to continue accurately estimating taxable income.\n- \u00b7 We tested the reasonableness of management's estimates of future taxable income by comparing the estimates to:\n- \u0195 Internal budgets.",

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020, of the Company and our report dated February 18, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThe Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\n\nParsippany, New Jersey February 18, 2021",

        "page_content": "WPD, a subsidiary of PPL Global, through wholly owned subsidiaries, operates distribution networks providing electricity service in the U.K. WPD serves end-users in South Wales and southwest and central England. Its principal subsidiaries are WPD (South Wales), WPD (South West), WPD (East Midlands) and WPD (West Midlands).\n\nPPL consolidates WPD on a one-month lag. Material events, such as debt issuances that occur in the lag period, are recognized in the current period financial statements. Events that are significant but not material are disclosed.\n\n## (PPL and PPL Electric)\n\nPPL Electric is a cost-based rate-regulated utility subsidiary of PPL. PPL Electric's principal business is the transmission anf d distribution of electricity to serve retail customers in its franchised territory in eastern and central Pennsylvania and the regulated supply of electricity to retail customers in that territory as a PLR.\n\n## (PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU)\n\nLKE is a utility holding company with cost-based rate-regulated utility operations through its subsidiaries, LG&E and KU. LG&E and KU are engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity. LG&E also engages in the distribution and sale of natural gas. LG&E and KU maintain their separate identities and serve customers in Kentucky under their respective names. KU also serves customers in Virginia under the Old Dominion Power name.\n\n## (All Registrants)\n\nThe financial statements of the Registrants include each company's own accounts as well as the accounts of all entities in which the company has a controlling financial interest. Entities for which a controlling financial interest is not demonstrated through voting interests are evaluated based on accounting guidance for Variable Interest Entities (VIEs). The Registrants consolidate a VIE when they are determined to have a controlling interest in the VIE and, as a result, are the primary beneficiary of the entity. Amounts consolidated under the VIE guidance are not material to the Registrants. Investments in entities in which a company has the ability to exercise significant influence but does not have a controlling financial interest are accounted for under the equity method. All other investments are carried at cost or fair value. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated.\n\nThe financial statements of PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU include their share of any undivided interests in jointly owned facilities, as well as their share of the related operating costs of those facilities. See Note 13 for additional information.\n\n## Regulation g\n\n## (PPL)\n\nWPD operates in an incentive-based regulatory structure under distribution licenses granted by Ofgem. Electricity distribution revenues are set by Ofgem for a given time period through price control reviews that are not directly based on cost recovery. The price control formula that governs WPD's allowed revenue is designed to provide economic incentives to minimize operating, capital and financing costs. As a result, WPD is not subject to accounting for the effects of certain types of regulff ation as prescribed by GAAP and does not record regulatory assets and liabilities.\n\n## (All Registrants)\n\nPPL Electric, LG&E and KU are cost-based rate-regulated utilities for which rates are set by regulators to enable PPL Electric, LG&E and KU to recover the costs of providing electric or gas service, as applicable, and to provide a reasonable return to shareholders. Base rates are generally established based on a future test period. As a result, the financial statements are subject b to the accounting for certain types of regulation as prescribed by GAAP and reflect the effects d of regulatory actions. Regulatory assets are recognized for the effect of transactions or events where future recovery of underlying costs is probable in regulated customer rates. The effect of such accounting is to defer certain or qualifying costs that would otherwise currently be charged to expense. Regulatory liabilities are recognized for amounts expected to be returned through future regulated customer rates. In certain cases, regulatory liabilities are recorded based on an understanding or agreement with the regulator that rates have been set to recover expected future costs, and the regulated entity is accountable for any amounts charged pursuant to such rates and not yet expended for the intended purpose. The accounting for regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities is based on specific ratemaking decisions or precedent for each transaction or event as prescribed by the FERC or the applicable state regulatory commissions. See Note 7 for additional details regarding regulatory matters.",

        "page_content": "## Accounting Records g\n\nThe system of accounts for domestic regulated entities is maintained in accordance with the Uniform System of Accounts prescribed by the FERC and adopted by the applicable state regulatory commissions.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statementstt and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n\n## Loss Accruals\n\nPotential losses are accrued when (1) information is available that indicates it is \"probable\" that a loss has been incurred, given the likelihood of uncertain future events and (2) the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Accounting guidance defines \"probable\" as cases in which \"the future event or events are likely to occur.\" The Registrants continuously assess potential loss contingencies for environmental remediation, litigation claims, regulatory penalties and other events. Loss accruals for environmental remediation are discounted when appropriate.\n\nThe accrual of contingencies that might result in gains is not recorded, unless realization is assured.\n\n## Earnings Per Share (PPL)\n\nEPS is computed using the two-class method, which is an earnings allocation method for computing EPS that treats a participating security as having rights to earnings that would otherwise have been available to common shareowners. Sharebased payment awards that provide recipients a non-forfeitable right to dividends or dividend equivalents are considered participating securities.\n\n## Price Risk Management\n\n## (All Registrants)\n\nInterest rate contracts are used to hedge exposure to changes in the fair value of debt instruments and to hedge exposure to variability in expected cash flows associated with existing floating-rate debt instruments or forecasted fixed-rate issuances of debt. Foreign currency exchange contracts are used to hedge foreign currency exposures, primarily associated with PPL's investments in U.K. subsidiaries. Similar derivatives may receive different accounting treatment, depending on management's intended use and documentation.\n\nCertain contracts may not meet the definition of a derivative because they lack a notional amount or a net settlement provision. In cases where there is no net settlement provision, markets are periodically assessed to determine whether market mechanisms have evolved to facilitate net settlement. Certain derivative contracts may be excluded from the requirements of derivative accounting treatment because NPNS has been elected. These contracts are accounted for using accrual accounting. Contracts that have been classified as derivative contracts are reflected on the balance sheets at fair value. The portion of derivative positions that deliver within a year are included in \"Current Assets\" and \"Current Liabilities,\" while the portion of derivative positions that deliver beyond a year are recorded in \"Other Noncurrent Assets\" and \"Deferred Credits and Other Noncurrent Liabilities.\"\n\nCash inflows and outflows related to derivative instruments are included as a component of operating, investing or financing activities on the Statements of Cash Flows, depending on the classification of the hedged items.\n\nPPL and its subsidiaries have elected not to offset net derivative positions against the right to reclaim cash collateral (a receivable) or the obligation to return cash collateral (a payable) under master netting arrangements.\n\n## (PPL)\n\nProcesses exist that allow for subsequent review and validation of contract information as it relates to interest rate and foreign currency derivatives. The accounting department provides the treasury department with guidelines on appropriate accounting",

Examples of accounting guidelines provided to the treasury department staff include, but are not limited to:\n\n- \u00b7 Transactions to lock in an interest rate prior to a debt issuance can be designated as cash flow hedges, to the extent the forecasted debt issuances remain probable of occurring.\n- \u00b7 Cross-currency transactions to hedge interest and principal repayments can be designated as cash flow hedges.\n- \u00b7 Transactions to hedge fluctuations in the fair value of existing debt can be designated as fair value hedges. f\n- \u00b7 Transactions to hedge the value of a net investment of foreign operations can be designated as net investment hedges.\n- \u00b7 Derivative transactions that do not qualify for cash flow or net investment hedge treatment are marked to fair value through earnings. These transactions generally include foreign currency forwards and options to hedge GBP-denominated earnings translation risk associated with PPL's U.K. subsidiaries that report their financial statements in GBP. As such, theset transactions reduce earnings volatility due solely to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. PPL also hedges anticipated transactions, including the previously announced potential sale of its U.K utility business and net investments.f\n\n## (All Registrants)\n\n- \u00b7 Derivative transactions may be marked to fair value through regulatory assets/liabilities at PPL Electric, LG&E and KU, if approved by the appropriate regulatory body. These transactions generally include the effect of interest rate swaps that are included in customer rates.\n\n## (PPL and PPL Electric)\n\nTo meet its obligation as a PLR to its customers, PPL Electric has entered into certain contracts that meet the definition of a derivative. However, NPNS has been elected for these contracts.\n\nSee Notes 17 and 18 for additional information on derivatives.\n\n## Revenue\n\n## (All Registrants)\n\nOperating revenues are primarily recorded based on energy deliveries through the end of each calendar month. Unbilled retail revenues result because customers' bills are rendered throughout the month, rather than bills being rendered at the end of the month. For LKE, LG&E and KU, unbilled revenues for a month are calculated by multiplying an estimate of unbilled kWh by the estimated average cents per kWh. Any difference between estimated and actual revenues is adjusted the following month when the previous unbilled estimate is reversed and actual billings occur. For PPL Electric, unbilled revenues for a month are calculated by multiplying the actual unbilled volumes by the price per tariff.\n\nPPL Electric's, LG&E's and KU's base rates are determined based on cost of service. Some regulators have also authorized the use of additional alternative revenue programs, which enable PPL Electric, LG&E and KU to adjust future rates based on past activities or completed events. Revenues from alternative revenue programs are recognized when the specific events permitting future billings have occurred. Revenues from alternative revenue programs are required to be presented separately from revenues from contracts with customers. These amounts are, however, presented as revenues from contracts with customers, with an offsetting adjustment to alternative revenue program revenue, when they are billed to customers in future periods. See Note 3 for additional information.\n\n## (PPL)\n\nWPD is currently operating under the eight-year price control period of RIIO-ED1, which commenced for electric distribution companies on April 1, 2015. Ofgem has adopted a price control mechanism that establishes the amount of base demand revenue WPD can earn, subject to certain true-ups, and provides for increased or reduced revenues based on incentives or penalties for performance relative to pre-established targets. WPD's allowed revenue primarily includes base demand revenue (adjusted for inflation using RPI), performance incentive revenues/penalties and adjustments for over or under-recovery from prior periods.",

        "page_content": "As the regulatory model is incentive based rather than a cost recovery model, WPD is not subject to accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation as prescribed by GAAP. Therefore, the accounting treatment of adjustments to base demand revenue and/or allowed revenue is evaluated based on revenue recognition accounting guidance.\n\nUnlike prior price control reviews, base demand revenue under RIIO-ED1 is adjusted during the price control period. The most significant of those adjustments are:\n\n- \u00b7 Inflation True-Up - The base demand revenue for the RIIO-ED1 period was set based on 2012/13 prices. Therefore, an inflation factor as determined by forecasted RPI, provided by HM Treasury, is applied to base demand revenue. Forecasted RPI is trued up to actuals and affects future base demand revenue two regulatory years later. This revenue change is called the \"TRU\" adjustment.\n- \u00b7 Annual Iteration Process (AIP) - The RIIO-ED1 price control period also includes an AIP. This allows future base demand revenues agreed with Ofgem as part of the price control review, to be updated during the price control period for financial adjustments including tax, pensions, cost of debt, legacy price control adjustments from preceding price control periods and adjustments relating to actual and allowed total expenditure, together with the Totex Incentive Mechanism (TIM). Under the TIM, WPD's DNOs are able to retain 70% of any amounts not spent against the RIIO-ED1 plan and bear 70% of any over-spends. The AIP calculates an incremental change to base demand revenue, known as the \"MOD\" adjustment.\n\nAs both MOD and TRU are changes to future base demand revenues as determined by Ofgem, these adjustments are recognized as a component of revenues in future years in which service is provided and revenues are collected or returned to customers.\n\nIn addition to base demand revenue, certain other items are added or subtracted to arrive at allowed revenue. The most significant of these are:\n\n- \u00b7 Incentives - Ofgem has established incentives to provide opportunities for DNO's to enhance overall returns by improving network efficiency, reliability and customer service. These incentives can result in an increase or reduction in revenues based on incentives or penalties for actual performance against pre-established targets based on past performance. The annual incentives and penalties are reflected in customers' rates on a two-year lag from the time they are earned and/or assessed. Incentive revenues and penalties are included in revenues when they are billed to customers.\n- \u00b7 Correction Factor - During the current price control period, WPD sets its tariffs to recover allowed revenue. However, in any fiscal period, WPD's revenue could be negatively affected if its tariffs and the volume delivered do not fully recover the revenue allowed for a particular period. Conversely, WPD could also over-recover revenue. Over and under-recoveries are subtracted from or added to allowed revenue in future years when billed to customers, known as the \"Correction Factor\" or \"K-factor.\" Over and under-recovered amounts arising for the period are refunded/recovered on a two year lag.\n\n## Financing Receivables\n\n## (All Registrants)\n\nAccounts receivable are reported on the Balance Sheets at the gross outstanding amount adjusted for an allowance for doubtful t accounts. Financing receivables include accounts receivable, with the exception of those items within accounts receivable that are not subject to the credit loss model.\n\n## Current Expected Credit Losses p\n\nFinancing receivable collectibility is evaluated using a combination of factors, including past due status based on contractual terms, trends in write-offs and the age of the receivable. Specific events, such asf bankruptcies, are also considered when applicable. Adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts are made when necessary based on the results of analysis, the aging of receivables and historical and industry trends. The Registrants periodically evaluate the impact of observable external factors on the collectibility of the financing receivables to determine if adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts should be made based on current conditions or reasonable and supportable forecasts. Accounts receivable are written off in the period in which the receivable is deemed uncollectible.\n\n## (PPL and PPL Electric)\n\nPPL Electric has identified one class of financing receivables, 'accounts receivable-customer', which includes financing receivables for all billed and unbilled sales with residential and non-residential customers. All other financing receivables are",

Generally, the most significant fair value measurements relate to price risk management assets and liabilities, investments in securities in defined benefit plans, aa and cash and cash equivalents. PPL and its subsidiaries use, as appropriate, a market approach (generally, data from market transactions), an income approach (generally, present value techniques and option-pricing models) and/or a cost approach (generally, replacement cost) to measure the fair value of an asset or liability. These valuation approaches incorporate inputs such as observable, independent market data and/or unobservable data that management believes are predicated on therr assumptions market participants would use to price an asset or liability. These inputs may incorporate, as applicable, certain r risks such as nonperformance risk, which includes credit risk.\n\nThe Registrants classify fair value measurements within one of three levels in the fair value hierarchy. The level assigned to a fair value measurement is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Level 1 - quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that are accessible at the measurement date. Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.\n- \u00b7 Level 2 - inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.\n- \u00b7 Level 3 - unobservable inputs that management believes are predicated on the assumptions market participants would use to measure the asset or liability at fair value.\n\nAssessing the significance of a particular input requires judgment that considers factors specific to the asset or liability. As such, the Registrants' assessment of the significance of a particular input may affect how the assets and liabilities are classified r within the fair value hierarchy.",

Investments that would otherwise be classified as short-term, but are restricted as to withdrawal or use for other than current operations or are clearly designated for expenditure in the acquisition or construction of noncurrent assets or for the liquidation of long-term debts, are classified as long-term.\n\n## Short-term Investments\n\nShort-term investments generally include certain deposits as well as securities that are considered highly liquid or provide for periodic reset of interest rates. Investments with original maturities greater than three months and less than a year, as well as investments with original maturities of greater than a year that management has the ability and intent to sell within a year, areaa included in \"Other current assets\" on the Balance Sheets.\n\n## Long-Lived and Intangible Assets\n\n## Property, Plant and Equipment p y, q p\n\n## (All Registrants)\n\nPP&E is recorded at original cost, unless impaired. PP&E acquired in business combinations is recorded at fair value at the time of acquisition. If impaired, the asset is written down to fair value at that time, which becomes the new cost basis of the asset. Original cost for constructed assets includes material, labor, contractor costs, certain overheads and financing costs, where applicable. Included in PP&E are capitalized costs of software projects that were developed or obtained for internal use. The cost of repairs and minor replacements are charged to expense as incurred. The Registrants record costs associated with planned major maintenance projects in the period in which work is performed and costs are incurred.\n\nAFUDC is capitalized at PPL Electric as part of the construction costs for cost-based rate-regulated projects for which a returt n on such costs is recovered after the project is placed in service. The debt component of AFUDC is credited to \"Interest Expense\" and the equity component is credited to \"Other Income (Expense) - net\" on the Statements of Income. LG&E and KU generally do not record AFUDC as a return is provided on construction work in progress.\n\n## (PPL)\n\nPPL capitalizes interest costs as part of construction costs. Capitalized interest, including the debt component of AFUDC for PPL, was $9 million in 2020, $10 million in 2019 and $15 million 2018.\n\n## (PPL Electric)\n\nPPL Electric capitalizes interest costs as part of construction costs. Capitalized interest, including the debt component of AFUDC for PPL Electric was $7 million in 2020, $8 million in 2019 and $7 million in 2018.\n\n## Depreciationp\n\n## (All Registrants)\n\nDepreciation is recorded over the estimated useful lives of property using various methods including the straight-line, composite and group methods. When a component of PP&E that was depreciated under the composite or group method is retired, the original cost is charged to accumulated depreciation. When all or a significant portion of an operating unit that was depreciated under the composite or group method is retired or sold, the property and the related accumulated depreciation account is reduced and any gain or loss is included in income, unless otherwise required by regulators. LG&E and KU accrue costs of removal net of estimated salvage value through depreciation, which is included in the calculation of customer rates over the assets' depreciable lives in accordance with regulatory practices. Cost of removal amounts accrued through depreciation rates are accumulated as a regulatory liability until the removal costs are incurred. For LKE, LG&E and KU, all ARO depreciation expenses are reclassified to a regulatory asset. See \"Asset Retirement Obligations\" below and Note 7 for additional information. PPL Electric records net costs of removal when incurred as a regulatory asset. The regulatory asset is",

Intangibles that have finite useful lives are amortized over their useful lives based upon the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed or otherwise used. Costs incurred to obtain an initial license and renew or extend terms of licenses are capitalized as intangible assets.\n\nWhen determining the useful life of an intangible asset, including intangible assets that are renewed or extended, PPL and its subsidiaries consider:\n\n- \u00b7 the expected use of the asset;\n- \u00b7 the expected useful life of other assets to which the useful life of the intangible asset may relate;\n- \u00b7 legal, regulatory, or contractual provisions that may limit the useful life;\n- \u00b7 the company's historical experience as evidence of its ability to support renewal or extension;\n- \u00b7 the effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, and other economic factors; and,\n- \u00b7 the level of maintenance expenditures required to obtain the expected future cash flows from the asset.\n\n## Asset Impairment (Excluding Investments)p ( g )\n\nThe Registrants review long-lived assets that are subject to depreciation or amortization, including finite-lived intangibles, for impairment when events or circumstances indicate carrying amounts may not be recoverable.\n\nA long-lived asset classified as held and used is impaired when the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If impaired, the asset's carryinf g value is written down to its fair value.\n\nA long-lived asset classified as held for sale is impaired when the carrying amount of the asset (disposal group) exceeds its fair ff value less cost to sell. If impaired, the asset's (disposal group's) carrying value is written down to its fair value less cost to sell.t\n\nPPL, LKE, LG&E and KU review goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or more frequently when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a reporting unit may be greater than the unit's fair value. Additionally, goodwill must be tested for impairment in circumstances when a portion of goodwill has been allocated to a business to be disposed. PPL's, LKE's, LG&E's and KU's reporting units are primarily at the operating segment level.\n\nPPL, LKE, LG&E and KU may elect either to initially make a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of an impairment of goodwill or to bypass the qualitative evaluation and test goodwill for impairment using a quantitative test. If the qualitative evaluation (referred to as \"step zero\") is elected and the assessment results in a determination that it is not more likely than not aa that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test is not necessary. However, the quantitative impairment test is required if management concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of af reporting unit is less than the carrying amount based on the step zero assessment. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amn ount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.",

        "page_content": "In the first quarter of 2020, PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU considered whether the economic events associated with COVID-19, which resulted in PPL's shares experiencing volatility and a decrease in market value, would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the Registrants' reporting units below their carrying amounts. Based on the assessment, a quantitative impairment test was not required for the LKE, LG&E and KU reporting units, but was required for the U.K. Regulated segment reporting unit, the allocated goodwill of which was $2.5 billion at March 31, 2020. The test did not indicate impairment of the reporting unit.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020, PPL (for its U.K. Regulated and Kentucky Regulated segments), and individually, LKE, LG&E and KU elected to perform qualitative step zero evaluations for their annual goodwill impairment tests, as of October 1, 2020. Based on these evaluations, management concluded it was not more likely than not that the fair value of these reporting units was less than their carrying values. As such, quantitative impairment tests were not performed.\n\n## ( PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU ) U U\n\n## Asset Retirement Obligations  g\n\nPPL and its subsidiaries record liabilities to reflect various legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets. Initially, this obligation is measured at fair value and offset with an increase in the value of the capitalized asset, which is depreciated over the asset's useful life. Until the obligation is settled, the liability is increased through the recognition of accretion expense classified within \"Other operation and maintenance\" on the Statements of Income to reflect changes in the obligation due to the passage of time. For LKE, LG&E and KU, all ARO accretion f and depreciation expenses are reclassified as a regulatory asset. ARO regulatory assets associated with certain CCR projects are amortized to expense in accordance with regulatory approvals. For other AROs, at the time of retirement, the related ARO regulatory asset is offset against the associated cost of removal regulatory liability, PP&E and ARO liability.\n\nEstimated ARO costs and settlement dates, which affect the carrying value of the ARO and the related capitalized asset, are reviewed periodically to ensure that any material changes are incorporated into the latest estimate of the ARO. Any change to the capitalized asset, positive or negative, is generally amortized over the remaining life of the associated long-lived asset. See Note 7 and Note 20 for additional information on AROs.\n\n## Compensation and Benefits\n\n## Defined Benefits (All Registrants)\n\nCertain PPL subsidiaries sponsor various defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. An asset or liability is recorded to recognize the funded status of all defined benefit plans with an offsetting entry to AOCI or, for LG&E, KU and PPL Electric, to regulatory assets or liabilities. Consequently, the funded status of all defined benefit plans is fully recognized on the d Balance Sheets.\n\nThe expected return on plan assets is determined based on a market-related value of plan assets, which is calculated by rolling forward the prior year market-related value with contributions, disbursements and long-term expected return on investments. One-fifth of the difference between the actual value and the expected value is added (or subtracted if negative) to the expected value to determine the new market-related value.\n\nPPL uses an accelerated amortization method for the recognition of gains and losses for its defined benefit pension plans. Under the accelerated method, actuarial gains and losses in excess of 30% of the plan's projected benefit obligation are amortized on a straight-line basis over one-half of the required amortization period. Actuarial gains and losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the plan's projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets and less than 30% of the plan's projected benefit obligation are amortized on a straight-line basis over the full required amortization period.\n\nSee Note 7 for a discussion of the regulatory treatment of defined benefit costs and Note 12 for a discussion of defined benefits.\n\n## Stock-Based Compensation (PPL, PPL Electric and LKE) p\n\nPPL has several stock-based compensation plans for purposes of granting stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance units to certain employees as well as stock units and restricted stock units to directors. PPL grants most stockbased awards in the first quarter of each year. PPL and its subsidiaries recognize compensation expense for stock-based awards based on the fair value method. Forfeitures of awards are recognized when they occur. See Note 11 for a discussion of stock-",

The first step requires an entity to determine whether, based ond the technical merits supporting a particular tax position, it is more likely than not (greater than a 50% chance) that the tax position will be sustained. This determination assumes that the relevant taxing authority will examine the tax position and is aware of all the relevant facts surrounding the tax position. The second step requires an entity to recognize in its financial statements the benefit of a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition criterion. The benefit recognized is measured at the largest amount of benefit that has a likelihood of realization upon settlement that exceeds 50%. Unrecognized tax benefits are classified as current to the extent management expects to settle the uncertain tax position by payment or receipt of cash within one year of the reporting date. The amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of issues raised by taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued and may materially impact the financial statements of the Registrants in future periods. At December 31, 2020, no significant changes in unrecognized tax benefits were projected over the next 12 months.\n\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net future tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for accounting purposes and their basis for income tax purposes, as well as the tax effects of net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards.\n\nThe Registrants record valuation allowances to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amounts that are more-likely-than-not to be realized. The need for valuation allowances requires significant management judgment. If the Registrants determine that they are able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of recorded net deferred tax assets, adjustments to the valuation allowances increase income by reducing tax expense in the period that such determination is made. Likewise, if the Registrants determine that they are not able to realize all or part of net deferred tax assets in the future, adjustments to the valuation allowances would decrease income by increasing tax expense in the period that such determination is made. The amount of deferred tax assets ultimately realized may differ materially from the estimates utilized in the computation of valuation allowances and may materially impact the financial statements in the future \u0358\n\nThe Registrants defer investment tax credits when the credits are generated and amortize the deferred amounts over the average lives of the related assets.\n\nThe Registrants recognize tax-related interest and penalties in \"Income Taxes\" on their Statements of Income.\n\nThe Registrants use the portfolio approach method of accounting for deferred taxes related to pre-tax OCI transactions. The portfolio approach involves a strict period-by-period cumulative incremental allocation of income taxes to the change in income and losses reflected in OCI. Under this approach, the net cumulative tax effect is ignored. The net change in unrealized gains and losses recorded in AOCI under this approach would be eliminated only on the date the investment portfolio is classified as held for sale or is liquidated.\n\nSee Note 6 for additional discussion regarding income taxes, including the impact of the TCJA and management's conclusion that the undistributed earnings of WPD are considered indefinitely reinvested.\n\nThe provision for PPL's, PPL Electric's, LKE's, LG&E's and KU's deferred income taxes related to regulatory assets and liabilities is based upon the ratemaking principles reflected in rates established by relevant regulators. The difference in the provision for deferred income taxes for regulatory assets and liabilities and the amount that otherwise would be recorded undert GAAP is deferred and included on the Balance Sheets in noncurrent \"Regulatory assets\" or \"Regulatory liabilities.\"",

The CECL model requires an entity to measure credit losses using historical information, current information and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future events, rather than the incurred loss impairment model required under previous GAAP. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Registrants.\n\n## Accounting for Implementation Costs in a Cloud Computing Service Arrangementg p p g g\n\nEffective January 1, 2020, the Registrants prospectively adopted accounting guidance that requires a customer in a cloud computing hosting arrangement that is a service contract to capitalize implementation costs consistent with internal-use software guidance for non-service arrangements. The guidance requires these capitalized implementation costs to be amortized over the term of the hosting arrangement to the statement of income line item where the service arrangement costs are recorded. The guidance also prescribes the financial statement classification of the capitalized implementation costs and cash flows associated with the arrangement. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Registrants.\n\n(PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU)\n\n## Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment p y g p\n\nEffective January 1, 2020, the Registrants adopted accounting guidance that simplifies the test for goodwill impairment by eliminating the second step of the quantitative test. The second step of the quantitative test required a calculation of the implied mm fair value of goodwill, which was determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill in a business combination. Under the new guidance, the fair value of a reporting unit will be compared with the carrying value and an impairment charge will be recognized if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit.

        "page_content": "(PPL Electric, LKE, LG&E and KU)\n\nPPL Electric has two operating segments that are aggregated into a single reportable segment. LKE, LG&E and KU are individually single operating and reportable segments.\n\n## 3. Revenue from Contracts with Customers\n\n(All Registrants)\n\nThe following is a description of the principal activities from which the Registrants and PPL's segments generate their revenues.\n\n(PPL)\n\n## U.K. Regulated Segment Revenueg g\n\nThe U.K. Regulated Segment generates revenues from contracts with customers primarily from WPD's DUoS operations.\n\nDUoS revenues result from WPD charging licensed third-party energy suppliers for their use of WPD's distribution systems to deliver energy to their customers. WPD satisfies its performance obligation and DUoS revenue is recognized over-time as electricity is delivered. The amount of revenue recognized is based on actual and forecasted volumes of electricity delivered during the period multiplied by a per-unit energy tariff, plus fixed charges. This methody of recognition fairly presents WPD's d transfer of electric service to the customer as the calculation is based on volumes, and the tariff rate is set by WPD using ar methodology prescribed by Ofgem. Customers are billed monthly and outstanding amounts are typically due within 14 days of the invoice date.\n\nDUoS customers are 'at will' customers of WPD with no term contract and no minimum purchase commitment. Performance obligations are limited to the service requested and received to date. Accordingly, there is no unsatisfied performance obligation associated with WPD's DUoS contracts.\n\n## (PPL and PPL Electric)\n\n## Pennsylvania Regulated Segment Revenue y g g\n\nThe Pennsylvania Regulated Segment generates substantially all of its revenues from contracts with customers from PPL Electric's tariff-based distribution and transmission of electricity.\n\n## Distribution Revenue\n\nPPL Electric provides distribution services to residential, commercial, industrial, municipal and governmental end users of energy. PPL Electric satisfies its performance obligation to its distribution customers and revenue is recognized over-time as electricity is delivered and simultaneously consumed by the customer. The amount of revenue recognized is the volume of electricity delivered during the period multiplied by the price per tariff, plus a monthly fixed charge. This method of recognition fairly presents PPL Electric's transfer of electric service to the customer as the calculation is based on actual volumes, and the price per tariff and the monthly fixed charge are set by the PUC. Customers are typically billed monthly and outstanding amounts are normally due within 21 days of the date of the bill.\n\nDistribution customers are \"at will\" customers of PPL Electric with no term contract and no minimum purchase commitment. Performance obligations are limited to the service requested and received to date. Accordingly, there is no unsatisfied performance obligation associated with PPL Electric's retail account contracts.\n\n## Transmission Revenue\n\nPPL Electric generates transmission revenues from a FERC-approved PJM Open Access Transmission Tariff. An annual revenue requirement for PPL Electric to provide transmission services is calculated using a formula-based rate. This revenue requirement is converted into a daily rate (dollars per day). PPL Electric satisfies its performance obligation to provide transmission services and revenue is recognized over-time as transmission services are provided and consumed. This method of",

PJM remits payment on a weekly basis.\n\nPPL Electric's agreement to provide transmission services contains no minimum purchase commitment. The performance obligation is limited to the service requested and received to date. Accordingly, PPL Electric has no unsatisfied performance obligations.\n\n## (PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU)\n\n## Kentucky Regulated Segment Revenue y g g\n\nThe Kentucky Regulated Segment generates substantially all of its revenues from contracts with customers from LG&E's and KU's regulated tariff-based sales of electricity and LG&E's regulated tariff-based sales of natural gas.\n\nLG&E and KU are engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity in Kentucky and, in KU's case, Virginia. LG&E also engages in the distribution and sale of natural gas in Kentucky. Revenue from these activities is generated from tariffs approved by applicable regulatory authorities including the FERC, KPSC and VSCC. LG&E and KU satisfy their performance obligations upon LG&E's and KU's delivery of electricity and LG&E's delivery of natural gas to customers. This revenue is recognized over-time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by LG&E and KU. The amount of revenue recognized is the billed volume of electricity or natural gas delivered multiplied by a tariff rate perunit of energy, plus any applicable fixed charges or additional regulatory mechanisms. Customers are billed monthly and outstanding amounts are typically due within 22 days of the date of the bill. Additionally, unbilled revenues are recognized as a result of customers' bills rendered throughout the month, rather than bills being rendered at the end of the month. Unbilled revenues for a month are calculated by multiplying an estimate of unbilled kWh or Mcf delivered but not yet billed by the estimated average cents per kWh or Mcf. Any difference between estimated and actual revenues is adjusted the following tt month when the previous unbilled estimate is reversed and actual billings occur. This method of recognition fairly presents LG&E's and KU's transfer of electricity and LG&E's transfer of natural gas to the customer as the amount recognized is based on actual and estimated volumes delivered and the tariff rate per-unit of energy and any applicable fixed charges or regulatory mechanisms as set by the respective regulatory body.\n\nLG&E's and KU's customers generally have no minimum purchase commitment. Performance obligations are limited to the service requested and received to date. Accordingly, there is no unsatisfied performance obligation associated with theseff customers.\n\n## (All Registrants)\n\nThe following table reconciles \"Operating Revenues\" included in each Registrant's Statement of Income with revenues generated from contracts with customers for the years ended December 31:\n\n|                                        | 2020    | 2020         | 2020    | 2020    | 2020    |\n|----------------------------------------|---------|--------------|---------|---------|---------|\n|                                        | PPL     | PPL Electric | LKE     | LG&E    | KU      |\n| Operating Revenues (a)                 | $ 7,607 | $ 2,331      | $ 3,106 | $ 1,456 | $ 1,690 |\n| Revenues derived from:                 |         |              |         |         |         |\n| Alternative revenue programs (b)       | (24)    | (12)         | (12)    | (8)     | (4)     |\n| Other (c)                              | (27)    | (3)          | (17)    | (7)     | (10)    |\n| Revenues from Contracts with Customers | $ 7,556 | $ 2,316      | $ 3,077 | $ 1,441 | $ 1,676 |\n\n2019\n\nPPL\n\nPPL Electric\n\nLKE\n\nLG&E\n\nKU\n\nOperating Revenues (a)\n\n$\n\n7,769\n\n$\n\n2,358\n\n$\n\n3,206\n\n$\n\n1,500\n\n$\n\n1,740\n\nRevenues derived from:\n\nAlternative revenue programs (b)\n\n(30)\n\n(6)\n\n(24)\n\n(10)\n\n(14)\n\nOther (c)\n\n(38)\n\n(10)\n\n(21)\n\n(9)\n\n(12)\n\nRevenues from Contracts with Customers\n\n$\n\n7,701\n\n$\n\n2,342\n\n$\n\n3,161\n\n$\n\n1,481\n\n$\n\n1,714",

Earnings Per Share\n\n## (PPL)\n\nBasic EPS is computed by dividing income available to PPL common shareowners by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the applicable period. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing income available to PPL common shareowners by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding, increased by incremental shares that would be outstanding if potentially dilutive non-participating securities were converted to common shares as calculated using the Treasury Stock Method. Incremental non-participating securities that have a dilutive impact are detailed in the table below. ww In 2019 and 2018, these securities also included the PPL common stock forward sale agreements, which were partially settled in 2018 with the remaining shares settled in 2019. The forward sale agreements were dilutive under the Treasury Stock Method to the extent the average stock price of PPL's common shares exceeded the forward sale price prescribed in the agreements.\n\nReconciliations of the amounts of income and shares of PPL common stock (in thousands) for the periods ended December 31, used in the EPS calculation are:\n\n|                                                                      | 2020    | 2019    | 2018    |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Income (Numerator)                                                   |         |         |         |\n| N Net income                                                         | $ 1,469 | $ 1,746 | $ 1,827 |\n| Less amounts allocated to participating securities                   | 1       | 1       | 2       |\n| N Net income available to PPL common shareowners - Basic and Diluted | $ 1,468 | $ 1,745 | $ 1,825 |\n| Shares of Common Stock (Denominator)                                 |         |         |         |\n| Weighted-average shares - Basic EPS                                  | 768,590 | 728,512 | 704,439 |\n| Add incremental non-participating securities:                        |         |         |         |\n| Share-based payment awards (a)                                       | 794     | 1,101   | 445     |\n| Forward sale agreements                                              | -       | 7,141   | 3,735   |\n| Weighted-average shares - Diluted EPS                                | 769,384 | 736,754 | 708,619 |\n| Basic EPS                                                            |         |         |         |\n| Net Income available to PPL common shareowners                       | $ 1.91  | $ 2.39  | $ 2.59  |\n| Diluted EPS                                                          |         |         |         |\n| Net Income available to PPL common shareowners                       | $ 1.91  | $ 2.37  | $ 2.58  |",

The primary component of such outside basis differences is ordinarily accumulated unremitted earnings. PPL Global does not record deferred U.S. income taxes associated with the accumulated unremitted earnings of WPD, as management has determined that such earnings are indefinitely reinvested. Current year distributions from WPD to the U.S. are sourced from a portion of the current year's earnings of the WPD group. There have been no material changes to the facts underlying PPL's assertion that historically reinvested earnings of WPD as well as some portion of current year earnings will continue to be indefinitely reinvested. WPD's long-term working capital forecasts and capital expenditure projections for the foreseeable future require reinvestment of WPD's undistributed earnings. Additionally, U.S. long-term working capital forecasts and capital expenditure projections for the foreseeable future do not require or contemplate annual distributions from WPD in excess of some portion of WPD's future annual earnings. The cumulative undistributed earnings are included in \"Earnings reinvested\" on the Balance Sheets. The amount considered indefinitely reinvested at December 31, 2020 was $8.0 billion. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional taxes that could be payable on these foreign earnings in the event of repatriation to the U.S., but it could be material. PPL will reassess the indefinite reinvestment of these earnings if and when the U.K. utility business meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale.\n\nDetails of the components of income tax expense, a reconciliation of federal income taxes derived from statutory tax rates applied to \"Income Before Income Taxes\" to income taxes for reporting purposes, and details of \"Taxes, other than income\" were as follows:\n\n|                                                                          | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Income Tax Expense (Benefit)                                             |        |        |        |\n| Current - Federal                                                        | $ (9)  | $ (10) | $ (19) |\n| Current - State                                                          | 24     | 19     | 17     |\n| Current - Foreign                                                        | 85     | 91     | 104    |\n| Total Current Expense (Benefit)                                          | 100    | 100    | 102    |\n| Deferred - Federal                                                       | 123    | 139    | 203    |\n| Deferred - State                                                         | 94     | 76     | 100    |\n| Deferred - Foreign (a)                                                   | 215    | 123    | 107    |\n| Total Deferred Expense (Benefit), excluding operating loss carryforwards | 432    | 338    | 410    |\n| Amortization of investment tax credit                                    | (3)    | (3)    | (3)    |\n| Tax expense (benefit) of operating loss carryforwards                    |        |        |        |\n| Deferred - Federal                                                       | 6      | 7      | (20)   |\n| Deferred - State                                                         | (33)   | (33)   | (31)   |\n| Total Tax Expense (Benefit) of Operating Loss Carryforwards              | (27)   | (26)   | (51)   |\n| Total income tax expense (benefit)                                       | $ 502  | $ 409  | $ 458  |\n| Total income tax expense (benefit) - Federal                             | $ 117  | $ 133  | $ 161  |\n| Total income tax expense (benefit) - State                               | 85     | 62     | 86     |\n| Total income tax expense (benefit) - Foreign                             | 300    | 214    | 211    |\n| Total income tax expense (benefit)                                       | $ 502  | $ 409  | $ 458  |",

The more significant changes that impact the Registrants were:\n\n- \u00b7 The reduction in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21%, effective m January 1, 2018;\n- \u00b7 The exclusion from U.S. federal taxable income of dividends from foreign subsidiaries and the associated \"transition tax;\"\n- \u00b7 Limitations on the tax deductibility of interest expense, with an exception to these limitations for regulated public utilities;\n- \u00b7 Full current year expensing of capital expenditures with an exception for regulated public utilities for capital projects commencing after December 31, 2017 that qualify for the exception to the interest expense limitation; and\n- \u00b7 The continuation of certain rate normalization requirements for accelerated depreciation benefits. For non-regulated businesses, the TCJA generally provides for full expensing of property acquired after September 27, 2017.",

        "page_content": "## 2018 Impacts of TCJAp\n\nThe Registrants recognized certain provisional amounts relating to the impact of the enactment of the TCJA in their December 31, 2017 financial statements, in accordance with SEC guidance. Included in those provisional amounts were estimates of tax depreciation, deductible executive compensation, accumulated foreign earnings, foreign tax credits, and deemed dividends from foreign subsidiaries, all of which were based on the interpretation and application of various provisions of the TCJA.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2018, PPL filed its consolidated federal income tax return, which was prepared using guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS since the filing of each Registrant's 2017 Form 10-K. Accordingly, the Registrants updated the following provisional amounts and now consider them to be complete: (1) the amount of the deemed dividend and associated foreign tax credits relating to the transition tax imposed on accumulated foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017; (2) the amount of accelerated 100% \"bonus\" depreciation PPL was eligible to claim in its 2017 federal income tax return; and (3) the related impacts on PPL's 2017 consolidated federal net operating loss to be carried forward to future periods. In addition, the Registrants recorded the tax impact of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate reduction from 35% to 21% on the changes to deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from the completed provisional amounts. The completed provisional amounts related to the tax rate reduction had an insignificant impact on the net regulatory liabilities of PPL's U.S. regulated operatit ons. In the fourth quarter of 2018, PPL completed its analysis of the deductibility of executive compensation awarded as of November 2, 2017 and concluded that no material change to the provisional amounts was required. The final amounts reported in PPL's 2017 federal income tax return, provisional amounts for the year ended December 31, 2017, the related measurement period adjustments, and the resulting tax impact for the year ended December 31, 2018 were as follows.\n\n|                                                                         | Taxable Income (Loss) (a)        | Taxable Income (Loss) (a)           | Taxable Income (Loss) (a)   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n|                                                                         | Adjustments  per 2017 Tax Return | Adjustments  per 2017 Tax Provision | 2018  Adjustments           |\n| PPL                                                                     |                                  |                                     |                             |\n| Deemed Dividend                                                         | $ 397                            | $ 462                               | $ (65)                      |\n| Bonus Depreciation (b)                                                  | ( ) (67)                         | -                                   | ( ) (67)                    |\n| Consolidated Federal Net Operating Loss due to the TCJA (c)             | ( ) (330)                        | ( ) (462)                           | 132                         |\n| Total                                                                   | $ -                              | $ -                                 | $ -                         |\n| PPL Electric                                                            |                                  |                                     |                             |\n| Bonus Depreciation (b)                                                  | $ ( ) (39)                       | $ -                                 | $ ( ) (39)                  |\n| Consolidated Federal Net Operating Loss reallocated due to the TCJA (c) | ( ) (68)                         | ( ) (105)                           | 37                          |\n| Total                                                                   | $ (107)                          | $ (105)                             | $ (2)                       |\n| LKE                                                                     |                                  |                                     |                             |\n| Bonus Depreciation (b)                                                  | $ ( ) (28)                       | $ -                                 | $ ( ) (28)                  |\n| Consolidated Federal Net Operating Loss reallocated due to the TCJA (c) | ( ) (32)                         | ( ) (45)                            | 13                          |\n| Total                                                                   | $ (60)                           | $ (45)                              | $ (15)                      |\n| LG&E                                                                    |                                  |                                     |                             |\n| Bonus Depreciation (b)                                                  | $ ( ) (17)                       | $ -                                 | $ ( ) (17)                  |\n| Consolidated Federal Net Operating Loss reallocated due to the TCJA (c) | 17                               | -                                   | 17                          |\n| Total                                                                   | $ -                              | $ -                                 | $ -                         |\n| KU                                                                      |                                  |                                     |                             |\n| Bonus Depreciation (b)                                                  | $ ( ) (11)                       | $ -                                 | $ ( ) (11)                  |\n| Consolidated Federal Net Operating Loss reallocated due to the TCJA (c) | 11                               | -                                   | 11                          |\n| Total                                                                   | $ -                              | $ -                                 | $ -                         |",

In 2019, final and new proposed regulations were issued relating to the GILTI provisions. PPL has determined that neither the final or new proposed regulations materially change PPL's conclusion that currently no incremental tax arises under these rules. Proposed regulations relating to the limitation on the deductibility of interest expense were issued in November 2018 and such regulations provide detailed rules implementing the broader statutory provisions. These proposed regulations did not apply to the Registrants in 2019.\n\nIn July 2020, the IRS issued final and new proposed regulations relating to the limitation on interest deductibility. The final regulations do not apply to the Registrants until the 2021 tax year. The new proposed regulations were finalized on January 5, 2021 and will apply to the Registrants in the 2022 tax year. The Registrants are evaluating the final regulations issued in 2021, but do not expect these regulations or the 2020 final regulations to have a material impact on the Registrants' financial condition or results of operations.\n\n## 7. Utility Rate Regulation\n\n## Regulatory Assets and Liabilities\n\n## (All Registrants)\n\nPPL, PPL Electric, LKE, LG&E and KU reflect the effects of regulatory actions in the financial statements for their cost-based rate-regulated utility operations. Regulatory assets and liabilities are classified as current if, upon initial recognition, the entire amount related to an item will be recovered or refunded within a year of the balance sheet date.\n\n## (PPL)\n\nWPD is not subject to accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation as prescribed by GAAP and does not record regulatory assets and liabilities. See Note 1 for additional information.\n\n## (PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU)\n\nLG&E is subject to the jurisdiction of the KPSC and FERC, and KU is subject to the jurisdiction of the KPSC, FERC and VSCC.\n\nLG&E's and KU's Kentucky base rates are calculated based on a return on capitalization (common equity, long-term debt and short-term debt) including adjustments for certain net investments and costs recovered separately through other means. As such, LG&E and KU generally earn a return on regulatory assets.",

PPL Electric's transmission revenues are billed in accordance with a FERC tariff that allows for recovery of transmission costs incurred, a return on transmission-related rate base (net utility plant plus a working capital allowance less plant-related deferred taxes and other miscellaneous additions and deductions) and an automatic annual update. See \"Transmission Formula Rate\" below for additional information on this tariff. All regulatory assets and liabilities are excluded from distribution and transmission return on investment calculations; therefore, generally no return is earned on PPL Electric's regulatory assets.\n\n## (All Registrants)\n\nThe following table provides information about the regulatory assets and liabilities of cost-based rate-regulated utility operations at December 31:\n\n|                                              | PPL     | PPL     | PPL Electric   | PPL Electric   |\n|----------------------------------------------|---------|---------|----------------|----------------|\n|                                              | 2020    | 2019    | 2020           | 2019           |\n| Current Regulatory Assets:                   |         |         |                |                |\n| Plant outage costs                           | $ 46    | $ 32    | $ -            | $ -            |\n| Gas supply clause                            | 4       | 8       | -              | -              |\n| Smart meter rider                            | 17      | 13      | 17             | 13             |\n| Storm costs                                  | 7       | -       | 7              | -              |\n| Transmission formula rate                    | 15      | 3       | 15             | 3              |\n| Transmission service charge                  | -       | 10      | -              | 10             |\n| Other                                        | 10      | 1       | 1              | -              |\n| Total current regulatory assets (a)          | $ 99    | $ 67    | $ 40           | $ 26           |\n| N Noncurrent Regulatory Assets:              |         |         |                |                |\n| Defined benefit plans                        | $ 570   | $ 800   | $ 290          | $ 467          |\n| Storm costs                                  | 17      | 39      | -              | 15             |\n| Unamortized loss on debt                     | 30      | 41      | 8              | 18             |\n| Interest rate swaps                          | 23      | 22      | -              | -              |\n| Terminated interest rate swaps               | 75      | 81      | -              | -              |\n| Accumulated cost of removal of utility plant | 240     | 220     | 240            | 220            |\n| AROs                                         | 300     | 279     | -              | -              |\n| Act 129 compliance rider                     | -       | 6       | -              | 6              |\n| Other                                        | 7       | 4       | 3              | -              |\n| Total noncurrent regulatory assets           | $ 1,262 | $ 1,492 | $ 541          | $ 726          |",

        "page_content": "- (a) For PPL, these amounts are included in \"Other current assets\" on the Balance Sheets.\n\nFollowing is an overview of selected regulatory assets and liabilities detailed in the preceding tables. Specific developments with respect to certain of these regulatory assets and liabilities are discussed in \"Regulatory Matters.\"\n\n## Defined Benefit Plans\n\n## (All Registrants)\n\nDefined benefit plan regulatory assets and liabilities represent prior service cost and net actuarial gains and losses that will be recovered in defined benefit plans expense through future base rates based upon established regulatory practices and, generally, are amortized over the average remaining service lives of plan participants. These regulatory assets and liabilities are adjusted at least annually or whenever the funded status of defined benefit plans is remeasured.\n\n## (PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU)\n\nAs a result of the 2014 Kentucky rate case settlement that became effective July 1, 2015, the difference between pension cost calculated in accordance with LG&E's and KU's pension accounting policy and pension cost calculated using a 15-year amortization period for actuarial gains and losses is recorded as a regulatory asset. As of December 31, 2020, the balances were $79 million for PPL and LKE, $44 million for LG&E and $35 million for KU. As of December 31, 2019, the balances were $51 million for PPL and LKE, $29 million for LG&E and $22 million for KU.\n\n## (All Registrants)\n\n## Storm Costs\n\nPPL Electric, LG&E and KU have the ability to request from the PUC, KPSC and VSCC, as applicable, the authority to treat expenses related to specific extraordinary storms as a regulatory asset and defer such costs for regulatory accounting and reporting purposes. Once such authority is granted, LG&E and KU can request recovery of those expenses in a base rate case and begin amortizing the costs when recovery starts. PPL Electric can recover qualifying expenses caused by major storm events, as defined in its retail tariff, over three years through the Storm Damage Expense Rider commencing in the application year after the storm occurred. PPL Electric's regulatory assets for storm costs are being amortized through 2021. LG&E's and KU's regulatory assets for storm costs are being amortized through various dates ending in 2029.\n\n## Unamortized Loss on Debt\n\nUnamortized loss on reacquired debt represents losses on long-term debt reacquired or redeemed that have been deferred and will be amortized and recovered over either the original life of the extinguished debt or the life of the replacement debt (in the case of refinancing). Such costs are being amortized through 2029 for PPL Electric, through 2042 for KU, and through 2044 for LG&E.\n\n## Accumulated Cost of Removal of Utility Plant y\n\nLG&E and KU charge costs of removal through depreciation expense with an offsetting credit to a regulatory liability. The regulatory liability is relieved as costs are incurred.\n\nPPL Electric does not accrue for costs of removal. When costs of removal are incurred, PPL Electric records the costs as a regulatory asset. Such deferral is included in rates and amortized over the subsequent five-year period.\n\n## Net Deferred Taxes\n\nRegulatory liabilities associated with net deferred taxes represent the future revenue impact from the adjustment of deferred income taxes required primarily for excess deferred taxes and unamortized investment tax credits, largely a result of the TCJA enacted in 2017.",

        "page_content": "## (PPL and PPL Electric)\n\n## Generation Supply Charge (GSC)pp y g ( )\n\nThe GSC is a cost recovery mechanism that permits PPL Electric to recover costs incurred to provide generation supply to PLR customers who receive basic generation supply service. The recovery includes charges for generation supply, as well as administration of the acquisition process. In addition, the GSC contains a reconciliation mechanism whereby any over- or under-recovery from prior periods is refunded to, or recovered from, customers through the adjustment factor determined for the subsequent rate filing period.\n\n## Transmission Service Charge (TSC) g ( )\n\nPPL Electric is charged by PJM for transmission service-related costs applicable to its PLR customers. PPL Electric passes these costs on to customers, who receive basic generation supply service through the PUC-approved TSC cost recovery mechanism. The TSC contains a reconciliation mechanism whereby any over- or under-recovery from customers is either refunded to, or recovered from, customers through the adjustment factor determined for the subsequent year.\n\n## Transmission Formula Rate\n\nPPL Electric's transmission revenues are billed in accordance with a FERC-approved Open Access Transmission Tariff that utilizes a formula-based rate recovery mechanism. Under this formula, rates are put into effect in June of each year based upon prior year actual expenditures and current year forecasted capital additions. Rates are then adjusted the following year to reflect ff actual annual expenses and capital additions, as reported in PPL Electric's annual FERC Form 1, filed under the FERC's Uniform System of Accounts. Any difference between the revenue requirement in effect for the prior year and actual expenditures incurred for that year is recorded as a regulatory asset or regulatory liability.\n\n## Storm Damage Expense Rider (SDER)g p ( )\n\nThe SDER is a reconcilable automatic adjustment clause under which PPL Electric annually will compare actual storm costs to storm costs allowed in base rates and refund or recover any differences from customers. In the 2015 rate case settlement approved by the PUC in November 2015, it was determined that reportable storm damage expenses to be recovered annually through base rates will be set at $20 million. The SDER will recover from or refund to customers, as appropriate, only applicable expenses from reportable storms that are greater than or less than $20 million recovered annually through base rates. Storm costs incurred in PPL Electric's territory from a March 2018 storm are being amortized through 2021.\n\n## Act 129 Compliance Riderp\n\nIn compliance with Pennsylvania's Act 129 of 2008 and implementing regulations, PPL Electric is currently in Phase III of the energy efficiency and conservation plan which was approved in June 2016. Phase III allows PPL Electric to recover the maximum $313 million over the five-year period, June 1, 2016 through May 31, 2021. The plan includes programs intended to reduce electricity consumption. The recoverable costs include direct and indirect charges, including design and development costs, general and administrative costs and applicable state evaluator costs. The rates are applied to customers who receive distribution service through the Act 129 Compliance Rider. The actual Phase III program costs are reconcilable after each 12 month period, and any over- or under-recovery from customers will be refunded or recovered over the next rate filing period.\n\n## Smart Meter Rider (SMR) ( )\n\nAct 129 requires each electric distribution company (EDC) with more than 100,000 customers to have a PUC approved Smart Meter Technology Procurement and Installation Plan (SMP). As of December 31, 2019, PPL Electric replaced substantially all of its old meters with meters that meet the Act 129 requirements under its SMP. In accordance with Act 129, EDCs are able to recover the costs and earn a return on capital of providing smart metering technology. PPL Electric uses the SMR to recover the costs to implement its SMP. The SMR is a reconciliation mechanism whereby any over- or under-recovery from prior years is refunded to, or recovered from, customers through the adjustment factor determined for the subsequent quarters.\n\n## Universal Service Rider (USR)( )\n\nThe USR provides for recovery of costs associated with universal service programs, OnTrack and Winter Relief Assistance Program (WRAP), provided by PPL Electric to residential customers. OnTrack is a special payment program for low-income households and WRAP provides low-income customers a means to reduce electric bills through energy saving methods. The",

        "page_content": "USR rate is applied to residential customers who receive distribution service. The actual program costs are reconcilable, and any over- or under-recovery from customers will be refunded or recovered annually in the subsequent year.\n\n## TCJA Customer Refund\n\nAs a result of the reduced U.S federal corporate income tax rate as enacted by the TCJA, the PUC ruled that these tax benefits should be refunded to customers. Timing differences between the recognition of these tax benefits and the refund of the benefit to the customer creates a regulatory liability.\n\nPPL Electric's liability related to the period of July 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020 is being credited back to distribution customers through a negative surcharge. The liability related to the period of January 1, 2018 through June 30, 2018 was $43 million and was credited back to customers over the period of January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020 utilizing the same negative surcharge mechanism referred to above, as approved by the PUC in November 2019.\n\n(PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU)\n\n## Environmental Cost Recoveryy\n\nKentucky law permits LG&E and KU to recover the costs, including a return of operating expenses and a return of and on capital invested, of complying with the Clean Air Act and those federal, state or local environmental requirements, which apply to coal combustion wastes and by-products from coal-fired electricity generating facilities. The KPSC requires reviews of the past operations of the environmental surcharge for six-month and two-year billing periods to evaluate the related charges, credits and rates of return, as well as to provide for the roll-in of ECR amounts to base rates each two-year period. The KPSC has authorized returns on equity of 9.2% and 9.725% for existing approved ECR projects. The ECR regulatory asset or liability represents the amount that has been under- or over-recovered due to timing or adjustments to the mechanism and is typically recovered or refunded within 12 months.\n\n## Fuel Adjustment Clauses j\n\nLG&E's and KU's retail electric rates contain a fuel adjustment clause, whereby variances in the cost of fuel to generate electricity, including transportation costs, from the costs embedded in base rates are adjusted in LG&E's and KU's rates. The KPSC requires formal reviews at six-month intervals to examine past fuel adjustments and at two-year intervals to review past operations of the fuel adjustment clause and, to the extent appropriate, may conduct public hearings and reestablish the fuel charge included in base rates. The regulatory assets or liabilities represent the amounts that have been under- or over-recovered due to timing or adjustments to the mechanism and are typically recovered within 12 months.\n\nKU also employs a levelized fuel factor mechanism for Virginia customers using an average fuel cost factor based primarily on projected fuel costs and load for the fuel year (12 months ending March 31). The Virginia levelized fuel factor allows fuel recovery based on projected fuel costs for the fuel year plus an adjustment for any under- or over-recovery of fuel expenses from the prior fuel year. The regulatory assets or liabilities represent the amounts that have been under- or over-recovered due to timing or adjustments to the mechanism and are typically recovered or refunded within 12 months.\n\n## AROs\n\nAs discussed in Note 1, for LKE, LG&E and KU, all ARO accretion and depreciation expenses are reclassified as a regulatory asset. ARO regulatory assets associated with certain CCR projects are amortized to expense in accordance with regulatory approvals. For other AROs, at the time of retirement, the related ARO regulatory asset is offset against the associated cost oft removal regulatory liability, PP&E and ARO liability.\n\n## Power Purchase Agreement - OVEC g\n\nAs a result of purchase accounting associated with PPL's acquisition of LKE, the fair values of the OVEC power purchase agreement were recorded on the balance sheets of LKE, LG&E and KU with offsets to regulatory liabilities. The regulatory liabilities are being amortized using the units-of-production method until March 2026, the expiration date of the agreement at the date of the acquisition. LG&E's and KU's customer rates continue to reflect the original contracts. See Notes 14 and 19 for additional discussion of the power purchase agreement.",

        "page_content": "## Interest Rate Swaps p\n\nLG&E's unrealized gains and losses are recorded as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities until they are realized as interest expense. Interest expense from existing swaps is realized and recovered over the terms of the associated debt, which matures through 2033.\n\n## Terminated Interest Rate Swapsp\n\nNet realized gains and losses on all interest rate swaps are probable of recovery through regulated rates. As such, any gains aa nd losses on these derivatives are included in regulatory assets or liabilities and are primarily recognized in \"Interest Expense\" on the Statements of Income over the life of the associated debt.\n\n## Plant Outage Costs g\n\nSince July 1, 2017, plant outage costs in Kentucky have been normalized for ratemaking purposes based on an average level of expenses. Plant outage expenses that are greater or less than the average are collected from or returned to customers, through future base rates. Effective May 1, 2019 plant outage costs are normalized based on a five-year average of historical expenses with over or under recoveries collected or returned over an eight-year period.\n\n## Gas Supply Clause (PPL, LKE and LG&E) pp y\n\nLG&E's natural gas rates contain a gas supply clause, whereby the expected cost of natural gas supply and variances between actual and expected costs from prior periods are adjusted quarterly in LG&E's rates, subject to approval by the KPSC. The gas supply clause also includes a separate natural gas procurement incentive mechanism, which allows LG&E's rates to be adjusted annually to share savings between the actual cost of gas purchases and market indices, with the shareholders and the customers during each performance-based rate year (12 months ending October 31). LG&E currently has a proceeding pending with the KPSC in which LG&E proposed renewal of and modification to its natural gas procurement incentive mechanism, which is currently approved through September 1, 2021. LG&E cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding. The regulatory assets or liabilities represent the total amounts that have been under- or over-recovered due to timing or adjustments to the mechanisms and are typically recovered or refunded within 18 months.\n\n## Generation Formula Rate (PPL, LKE and KU)\n\nKU provides wholesale requirements service to its municipal customers and bills for this service pursuant to a FERC approved generation formula rate. Under this formula, rates are put into effect each July utilizing a return on rate base calculation and actual expenses from the preceding year. The regulatory asset or liability represents the difference between the revenue requirement in effect for the current year and actual expenditures incurred for the current year. Amounts are included in other current regulatory assets for 2020 and other current regulatory liabilities for 2019 in the table above.\n\n## Regulatory Matters\n\n## Kentucky Activities (PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU) y\n\n## Rate Case Proceedings\n\nOn November 25, 2020, LG&E and KU filed requests with the KPSC for an increase in annual electricity and gas revenues of approximately $331 million ($131 million and $170 million in electricity revenues at LG&E and KU and $30 million in gas revenues at LG&E). The revenue increases would be an increase of 11.6% and 10.4% in electricity revenues at LG&E and KU, and an increase of 8.3% in gas revenues at LG&E. LG&E and KU are also requesting approval of a one-year billing credit which will credit customers approximately $53 million ($41 million at LG&E and $12 million at KU). The billing credit represents the return to customers of certain regulatory liabilities on LG&E's and KU's balance sheets and serves to partially mitigate the rate increases during the first year in which the new rates are in effect.\n\nLG&E's and KU's applications also include a request for a CPCN to deploy Advanced Metering Infrastructure across LG&E's and KU's service territories in Kentucky.\n\nThe applications are based on a forecasted test year of July 1, 2021 through June 30, 2022 and request an authorized return on equity of 10.0%. Subject to KPSC approval, the requested rates, decreased by the amount of the billing credit, are expected to",

Data discovery and the filing of written testimony will continue through April 2021 and a hearing is expected to occur during the second quarter of 2021. PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings.\n\n## ECR Filings\n\nOn March 31, 2020, LG&E and KU submitted applications to the KPSC for ECR rate treatment regarding upcoming environmental construction projects relating to the EPA's regulations addressing ELGs. The construction projects are expected to begin in 2021 and continue through 2024 and are estimated to cost approximately $405 million ($153 million at LG&E and $252 million at KU). The applications requested an authorized 9.725% return on equity with respect to these projects consistent with the authorized return on equity approved for the 2018 Kentucky rate cases in April 2019. On September 29, 2020, the KPSC issued orders approving the ECR applications, permitting an authorized return on equity of 9.2% for the applicable projects.\n\n## Pennsylvania Activities (PPL and PPL Electric) y\n\n## Act 129\n\nAct 129 requires Pennsylvania Electric Distribution Companies (EDCs) to meet, by specified dates, specified goals for UHGXFWLRQglyph<c=3,font=/LNBOEE+TimesNewRomanPSMT>LQglyph<c=3,font=/LNBOEE+TimesNewRomanPSMT>FXVWRPHUglyph<c=3,font=/LNBOEE+TimesNewRomanPSMT>HOHFWULFLW\\glyph<c=3,font=/LNBOEE+TimesNewRomanPSMT>XVDJHglyph<c=3,font=/LNBOEE+TimesNewRomanPSMT>DQGglyph<c=3,font=/LNBOEE+TimesNewRomanPSMT>SHDNglyph<c=3,font=/LNBOEE+TimesNewRomanPSMT>GHPDQGglyph<c=17,font=/LNBOEE+TimesNewRomanPSMT>glyph<c=3,font=/LNBOEE+TimesNewRomanPSMT>('&Vglyph<c=3,font=/LNBOEE+TimesNewRomanPSMT>QRWglyph<c=3,font=/LNBOEE+TimesNewRomanPSMT>PHHWLQJglyph<c=3,font=/LNBOEE+TimesNewRomanPSMT>WKHglyph<c=3,font=/LNBOEE+TimesNewRomanPSMT>UHTXLUHPHQWVglyph<c=3,font=/LNBOEE+TimesNewRomanPSMT>RIglyph<c=3,font=/LNBOEE+TimesNewRomanPSMT>$FW\u0bd7glyph<c=20,font=/LNBOEE+TimesNewRomanPSMT>glyph<c=21,font=/LNBOEE+TimesNewRomanPSMT>glyph<c=28,font=/LNBOEE+TimesNewRomanPSMT>glyph<c=3,font=/LNBOEE+TimesNewRomanPSMT>DUHglyph<c=3,font=/LNBOEE+TimesNewRomanPSMT>VXEMHFWglyph<c=3,font=/LNBOEE+TimesNewRomanPSMT>WR VLJQLILFDQWglyph<c=3,font=/LNBOEE+TimesNewRomanPSMT>SHQDOWLHVglyph<c=17,font=/LNBOEE+TimesNewRomanPSMT>glyph<c=3,font=/LNBOEE+TimesNewRomanPSMT>33/\u0bd7(OHFWULFglyph<c=3,font=/LNBOEE+TimesNewRomanPSMT>ILOHGglyph<c=3,font=/LNBOEE+TimesNewRomanPSMT>ZLWKglyph<c=3,font=/LNBOEE+TimesNewRomanPSMT>WKHglyph<c=3,font=/LNBOEE+TimesNewRomanPSMT>38&glyph<c=3,font=/LNBOEE+TimesNewRomanPSMT> its Act 129 Phase IV Energy Efficiency and Conservation Plan on 1RYHPEHUglyph<c=3,font=/LNBOEE+TimesNewRomanPSMT>glyph<c=22,font=/LNBOEE+TimesNewRomanPSMT>glyph<c=19,font=/LNBOEE+TimesNewRomanPSMT>glyph<c=15,font=/LNBOEE+TimesNewRomanPSMT>glyph<c=3,font=/LNBOEE+TimesNewRomanPSMT>glyph<c=21,font=/LNBOEE+TimesNewRomanPSMT>glyph<c=19,font=/LNBOEE+TimesNewRomanPSMT>glyph<c=21,font=/LNBOEE+TimesNewRomanPSMT>glyph<c=19,font=/LNBOEE+TimesNewRomanPSMT>glyph<c=15,font=/LNBOEE+TimesNewRomanPSMT>\u0bd7IRUglyph<c=3,font=/LNBOEE+TimesNewRomanPSMT>WKHglyph<c=3,font=/LNBOEE+TimesNewRomanPSMT> I LYH -\\HDUglyph<c=3,font=/LNBOEE+TimesNewRomanPSMT>SHULRGglyph<c=3,font=/LNBOEE+TimesNewRomanPSMT>VWDUWLQJglyph<c=3,font=/LNBOEE+TimesNewRomanPSMT>-XQHglyph<c=3,font=/LNBOEE+TimesNewRomanPSMT>glyph<c=20,font=/LNBOEE+TimesNewRomanPSMT>glyph<c=15,font=/LNBOEE+TimesNewRomanPSMT>glyph<c=3,font=/LNBOEE+TimesNewRomanPSMT>glyph<c=21,font=/LNBOEE+TimesNewRomanPSMT>glyph<c=19,font=/LNBOEE+TimesNewRomanPSMT>glyph<c=21,font=/LNBOEE+TimesNewRomanPSMT>glyph<c=20,font=/LNBOEE+TimesNewRomanPSMT>glyph<c=3,font=/LNBOEE+TimesNewRomanPSMT>DQGglyph<c=3,font=/LNBOEE+TimesNewRomanPSMT>HQGLQJglyph<c=3,font=/LNBOEE+TimesNewRomanPSMT>RQglyph<c=3,font=/LNBOEE+TimesNewRomanPSMT>0D\\glyph<c=3,font=/LNBOEE+TimesNewRomanPSMT>glyph<c=22,font=/LNBOEE+TimesNewRomanPSMT>glyph<c=20,font=/LNBOEE+TimesNewRomanPSMT>glyph<c=15,font=/LNBOEE+TimesNewRomanPSMT>glyph<c=3,font=/LNBOEE+TimesNewRomanPSMT>glyph<c=21,font=/LNBOEE+TimesNewRomanPSMT>glyph<c=19,font=/LNBOEE+TimesNewRomanPSMT>glyph<c=21,font=/LNBOEE+TimesNewRomanPSMT>glyph<c=25,font=/LNBOEE+TimesNewRomanPSMT>glyph<c=17,font=/LNBOEE+TimesNewRomanPSMT>\u0bd7+HDULQJVglyph<c=3,font=/LNBOEE+TimesNewRomanPSMT>ZHUHglyph<c=3,font=/LNBOEE+TimesNewRomanPSMT>KHOGglyph<c=3,font=/LNBOEE+TimesNewRomanPSMT>)HEUXDU\\glyph<c=3,font=/LNBOEE+TimesNewRomanPSMT>glyph<c=27,font=/LNBOEE+TimesNewRomanPSMT> glyph<c=15,font=/LNBOEE+TimesNewRomanPSMT> 2021. This proceeding remains pending before the PUC. PPL Electric cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding.\n\nAct 129 also requires EDCs to act as a default service provider (DSP), which provides electricity generation supply service to customers pursuant to a PUC-approved default service procurement plan. A DSP is able to recover the costs associated with its default service procurement plan.\n\nIn March 2020, PPL Electric filed a Petition for Approval of a new default service program and procurement plan with the PUC for the period June 1, 2021 through May 31, 2025. Hearings were held in August 2020. PPL Electric received a Recommended Decision from the Administrative Law Judge on October 13, 2020. Several parties filed Exceptions and Reply Exceptions on October 26, 2020 and November 2, 2020, respectively. On December 17, 2020, the PUC issued a final Order approving the partial settlement reached by parties, including the PPL Electric default service plan for the period of June 2021 through May 2025, and ruling on the issues reserved for litigation. This matter is not expected to have a significant impact on the financial condition of PPL Electric.\n\n## Federal Matters\n\n## Challenge to PPL Electric Transmission Formula Rate Return on Equity\n\n## (PPL and PPL Electric)\n\nOn May 21, 2020, PP&L Industrial Customer Alliance (PPLICA) filed a complaint with the FERC alleging that PPL Electric's base return on equity (ROE) of 11.18% used to determine PPL Electric's formula transmission rate is unjust and unreasonable, and proposing an alternative ROE of 8.00% based on its interpretation of FERC Opinion No. 569. However, also on May 21, 2020, the FERC issued Opinion No. 569-A in response to numerous requests for rehearing of Opinion No. 569, which revised the method for analyzing base ROE. On June 10, 2020, PPLICA filed a Motion to Supplement the May 21, 2020 complaint in which PPLICA continued to allege that PPL Electric's base ROE is unjust and unreasonable, but revised its analysis of PPL Electric's base ROE to reflect the guidance provided in Opinion No. 569-A. The amended complaint proposed an updated alternative ROE of 8.50% and also requested that the FERC preserve the original refund effective date as established by the filing of the original complaint on May 21, 2020. Several parties have filed motions to intervene, including one party who filed Comments in Support of the original complaint.\n\nOn July 10, 2020, PPL Electric filed its Answer and supporting Testimony to the PPLICA filings arguing that the FERC should deny the original and amended complaints as they are without merit and fail to demonstrate the existing base ROE is unjust and unreasonable. In addition, PPL Electric contended any refund effective date should be set for no earlier than June 10, 2020 and PPLICA's proposed replacement ROE should be rejected.",

        "page_content": "On October 15, 2020, the FERC issued an order on the PPLICA complaints which established hearing and settlement procedures, set a refund effective date of May 21, 2020 and granted the motions to intervene. On November 16, 2020, PPL Electric filed a request for rehearing of the portion of the October 15, 2020 Order that set the May 21, 2020 refund effective date. On December 17, 2020, the FERC issued a Notice of Denial of Rehearing by Operation of Law and Providing for Further Consideration. On February 16, 2021, PPL Electric filed a Petition for Review with the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit of the portion of the October 15, 2020 Order that set the May 21, 2020 refund effective date.\n\nPPL Electric continues to believe its ROE is just and reasonable and that it has meritorious defenses against the original and amended complaints. At this time, PPL Electric cannot predict the outcome of this matter or the range of possible losses, if any, that may be incurred. However, revenue earned from May 21, 2020 through the settlement of this matter may be subject to refund. A change of 50 basis points to the base ROE would impact PPL Electric's net income by approximately $12 million on an annual basis.\n\n## (PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU)\n\n## FERC Transmission Rate Filing\n\nIn 2018, LG&E and KU applied to the FERC requesting elimination of certain on-going credits to a sub-set of transmission customers relating to the 1998 merger of LG&E's and KU's parent entities and the 2006 withdrawal of LG&E and KU from the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, Inc. (MISO), a regional transmission operator and energy market. The application sought termination of LG&E's and KU's commitment to provide certain Kentucky municipalities mitigation for certain horizontal market power concerns arising out of the 1998 LG&E and KU merger and 2006 MISO withdrawal. The amounts at issue are generally waivers or credits granted to a limited number of Kentucky municipalities for either certain LG&E and KU or MISO transmission charges incurred for transmission service received. Due to the development of robust, accessible energy markets over time, LG&E and KU believe the mitigation commitments are no longer relevant or appropriate. In March 2019, the FERC granted LG&E's and KU's request to remove the ongoing credits, conditioned upon the implementation by LG&E and KU of a transition mechanism for certain existing power supply arrangements, subject to FERC review and approval. In July 2019, LG&E and KU proposed their transition mechanism to the FERC and in September 2019, the FERC rejected the proposed transition mechanism and issued a separate order providing clarifications of certain aspects of the March order. In October 2019, LG&E and KU filed requests for rehearing and clarification on the two September orders. In September 2020, the FERC issued its orders in the rehearing process that modified the discussion in, and set aside portions of, the September 2019 orders including adjusting factors impacting the proposed transition mechanism. In October 2020, both LG&E and KU and other parties filed separate motions for rehearing and clarification regarding FERC's September 2020 orders. In November 2020, the FERC denied the parties' rehearing requests. In November 2020 and January 2021, LG&E and KU and other parties filed for appeal of the September 2020 and November 2020 orders with the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, where certain additional prior petitions for review relating to the proceedings are also pending. On January 15, 2021, LG&E and KU made a filing seeking FERC acceptance of a new proposal for a transition mechanism. LG&E and KU cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings. LG&E and KU currently receive recovery of the waivers and credits provided through other rate mechanisms.\n\n## (All Registrants)\n\n## TCJA Impact on FERC Rates\n\nIn November 2019, the FERC published Final Rules providing that public utility transmission providers include mechanisms in their formula rates to deduct excess ADIT from, or add deficient ADIT to, rate base and adjust their income tax allowances by amortized excess or deficient ADIT, and to make a related compliance filing.\n\nIn February 2019, PPL Electric filed with the FERC proposed revisions to its transmission formula rate template pursuant to Section 205 of the Federal Power Act and Section 35.13 of the FERC Rules and Regulations. Specifically, PPL Electric proposed to modify its formula rate to permit the return or recovery of excess or deficient ADIT resulting from the TCJA and permit PPL Electric to prospectively account for the income tax expense associated with the depreciation of the equity component of the AFUDC. In April 2019, the FERC accepted the proposed revisions to the formula rate template, which were effective June 1, 2019, as well as the proposed adjustments to ADIT, effective January 1, 2018.\n\nIn February 2019, in connection with the requirements of the TCJA and Kentucky HB 487, LG&E and KU filed a request with the FERC to amend their transmission formula rates resulting from the laws' reductions to corporate income tax rates. The FERC approved this request effective June 1, 2019. In 2020, LG&E and KU submitted a compliance filing addressing excess",

The alternative electricity suppliers have no continuing involvement or interest in the purchased accounts receivable. Accounts receivable that are acquired are initially recorded at fair value on the date of acquisition. During 2020, 2019 and 2018, PPL Electric purchased $1.1 billion, $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion of accounts receivable from alternative suppliers.\n\n## 8.

The ATM program expires in February 2021.\n\n## Distributions and Related Restrictions\n\nIn November 2020, PPL declared its quarterly common stock dividend, payable January 4, 2021, at 41.50 cents per share (equivalent to $1.66 per annum). Future dividends, declared at the discretion of the Board of Directors, will depend upon future earnings, cash flows, financial and legal requirements and other factors.\n\nNeither PPL Capital Funding nor PPL may declare or pay any cash dividend or distribution on its capital stock during any period in which PPL Capital Funding defers interest payments on its 2007 Series A Junior Subordinated Notes due 2067 or 2013 Series B Junior Subordinated Notes due 2073. At December 31, 2020, no interest payments were deferred.\n\nWPD subsidiaries have financing arrangements that limit their ability to pay dividends. However, PPL does not, at this time, expect that any of such limitations would significantly impact PPL's ability to meet its cash obligations.",

        "page_content": "## (All Registrants)\n\nPPL relies on dividends or loans from its subsidiaries to fund PPL's dividends to its common shareholders. The net assets of certain PPL subsidiaries are subject to legal restrictions. LKE primarily relies on dividends from its subsidiaries to fund its distributions to PPL. LG&E, KU and PPL Electric are subject to Section 305(a) of the Federal Power Act, which makes it unlawful for a public utility to make or pay a dividend from any funds \"properly included in capital account.\" The meaning of this limitation has never been clarified under the Federal Power Act. LG&E, KU and PPL Electric believe, however, that this statutory restriction, as applied to their circumstances, would not be construed or applied by the FERC to prohibit the payment from retained earnings of dividends that are not excessive and are for lawful and legitimate business purposes. In February 2012, LG&E and KU petitioned the FERC requesting authorization to pay dividends in the future based on retained earnings balances calculated without giving effect to the impact of purchase accounting adjustments for PPL's 2010 acquisition of LKE. In May 2012, the FERC approved the petitions with the further condition that each utility may not pay dividends if such payment would cause its adjusted equity ratio to fall below 30% of total capitalization. Accordingly, at December 31, 2020, net assets of $3 billion ($1.3 billion for LG&E and $1.7 billion for KU) were restricted for purposes of paying dividends to LKE, and net assets of $3.7 billion ($1.7 billion for LG&E and $2.0 billion for KU) were available for payment of dividends to LKE. LG&E and KU believe they will not be required to change their current dividend practices as a result of the foregoing requirement. In addition, under Virginia law, KU is prohibited from making loans to affiliates without the prior approval of the VSCC. There are no comparable statutes under Kentucky law applicable to LG&E and KU, or under Pennsylvania law applicable to PPL Electric. However, orders from the KPSC require LG&E and KU to obtain prior consent or approval before lending amounts to PPL.\n\n## 9. Acquisitions, Development and Divestitures\n\n(PPL)\n\nOn August 10, 2020, PPL announced that it initiated a formal process to sell its U.K. utility business. PPL noted that there can be no assurance of any specific outcome, including whether the sale process will result in the completion of any potential transaction, the timing or terms thereof, the value or benefits that may be realized or the effect that any potential transaction will have on future financial results.\n\nAs a result of the potential sale, PPL assessed the recoverability of the assets of its U.K. utility business. PPL prepared probability-weighted undiscounted cash flow estimates as of December 31, 2020 and September 30, 2020 that considered the likelihood of the possible outcomes of the sale process, including the possibility of not selling the U.K. utility business. Thf e resulting cash flow analyses exceeded the carrying value of the assets of the U.K. utility business. A change in the possible outcomes of the sale process could result in the carrying value of the assets of the U.K. utility business not being recoverable, which could result in an impairment in future periods. The U.K. utility business will continue to be classified as held and used until it meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale, which includes management obtaining a commitment to a plan to sell from its Board of Directors.\n\nShould the U.K. utility business meet the criteria to be classified as held for sale in a future period, PPL will be required at that aa time to compare the estimated fair value of its investment in the U.K. utility business, less costs to sell, to its carrying value,a including accumulated other comprehensive losses related to the U.K. utility business, for impairment purposes. The resulting measurement may result in a loss. In addition, PPL will reassess its assertion of the indefinite reinvestment of the unremitted earnings of the U.K. utility business. See Note 21 for additional information on accumulated other comprehensive income and losses. See Note 6 for additional information on income taxes.\n\n## 10. Leases\n\n## (All Registrants)\n\nThe Registrants determine whether contractual arrangements contain a lease by evaluatt ting whether those arrangements either implicitly or explicitly identify an asset, whether the Registrants have the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset throughout the term of the arrangement, and whether the Registrants have the right to direct the use of the asset. Renewal options are included in the lease term if it is reasonably certain the Registrants will exercise those options. Periods for which the Registrants are reasonably certain not to exercise termination options are also included in the lease term. The Registrants have certain agreements with lease and non-lease components, such as office space leases, which are generally accounted for separately.",

The leases generally have fixed payments with expiration dates ranging from 2021 to 2025, some of which have options to extend the leases from one year to ten years and some have options to terminate at LKE's, LG&E's and KU's discretion.\n\nPPL has also entered into various operating leases primarily for office space, land easements, telecom assets and warehouse space. These leases generally have fixed payments with expiration dates ranging from 2020 through 2029, except for the land agreements which extend through 2116.\n\nPPL Electric also has operating leases which do not have a significant impact to its operations.\n\n## Short-term Leases\n\nShort-term leases are leases with a term that is 12 months or less and do not include a purchase option or option to extend the initial term of the lease to greater than 12 months that the Registrants are reasonably certain to exercise. The Registrants haveaa made an accounting policy election to not recognize the ROU asset and the lease liability arising from leases classified as shortterm. Expenses related to short-term leases are included in the tables below.\n\n## Discount Rate\n\nThe discount rate for a lease is the rate implicit in the lease unless that rate cannot be readily determined. In that case, the Registrants are required to use their incremental borrowing rate, which is the rate the Registrants would have to pay to borrow, ww on a collateralized basis over a similar term, an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment.\n\nThe Registrants receive secured borrowing rates from financial institutions based on their applicable credit profiles. The Registrants use the secured rate which corresponds with the term of the applicable lease.\n\n(PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU)\n\n## Lessee Transactions\n\nThe following table provides the components of lease cost for the Registrants' operating leases for the years ended December 31:\n\n|                       | 2020   | 2020   | 2020   | 2020   |\n|-----------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n|                       | PPL    | LKE    | LG&E   | KU     |\n| Lease cost:           |        |        |        |        |\n| Operating lease cost  | $ 30   | $ 22   | $ 8    | $ 13   |\n| Short-term lease cost | 9      | 2      | 1      | 1      |\n| Total lease cost      | $ 39   | $ 24   | $ 9    | $ 14   |\n\n|                       | 2019   | 2019   | 2019   | 2019   |\n|-----------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n|                       | PPL    | LKE    | LG&E   | KU     |\n| Lease cost:           |        |        |        |        |\n| Operating lease cost  | $ 33   | $ 25   | $ 12   | $ 13   |\n| Short-term lease cost | 7      | 2      | 1      | 1      |\n| Total lease cost      | $ 40   | $ 27   | $ 13   | $ 14   |\n\nThe following table provides other key information related to the Registrants' operating leases at December 31:\n\n2020\n\n|                                                                             | PPL   | LKE   | LG&E   | KU   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|-------|--------|------|\n| Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities:     |       |       |        |      |\n| Operating cash flows from operating leases                                  | $ 26  | $ 18  | $ 7    | $ 11 |\n| Right-of-use asset obtained in exchange for new operating lease liabilities | 17    | 16    | 6      | 9    |",

Lease payments are fixed or are determined based on the amount of refined coal used in electricity generation at the facility. Payments received are primarily recorded as a regulatory liability and are amortized in accordance with regulatory approvals.\n\nWPD leases property and telecom assets to third parties, which generally expire through 2029. These leases are operating leases.

These additional restricted stock units are deferred and payable in shares of PPL common stock at the end of the restriction period. Dividend equivalents on restricted stock unit awards granted under the ICPKE are currently paid in cash when dividends are declared by PPL.\n\nThe fair value of restricted stock units granted is recognized on a straight-line basis over the restriction period or through the date at which the employee reaches retirement eligibility. The fair value of restricted stock units granted to retirement-eligible ii employees is recognized as compensation expense immediately upon the date of grant. Recipients of restricted stock units granted under the ICPKE may also be granted the right to receive dividend equivalents through the end of the restriction period or until the award is forfeited. Restricted stock units are subject to forfeiture or accelerated payout under the plan provisions for termination, retirement, disability and death of employees.

Performance units represent a target number of shares (Target Award) of PPL's common stock that the recipient would receive upon PPL's attainment of the applicable performance goal. Performance is determined based on TSR during a three-year performance period. At the end of the period, payout is determined by comparing PPL's performance to the TSR of the companies included in the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Utility Index. Awards are payable on a graduated basis based on thresholds that measure PPL's performance relative to peers that comprise the applicable indext on which each year's awards are measured. Awards can be paid up to 200% of the Target Award or forfeited with no payout if performance is below a minimum established performance threshold. Dividends payable during the performance cycle accumulate and are converted into additional performance units and are payable in shares of PPL common stock upon completion of the performance period based on the Compensation Committee's determination of achievement of the performance goals. Under the plan provisions, TSR performance units are subject to forfeiture upon termination of employment other than retirement, one year or more fromf commencement of the performance period, disability or death of an employee.\n\nThe fair value of TSR performance units granted to retirement-eligible employees is recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over a one-year period, the minimum vesting period required for an employee to be entitled to payout of the awards with no proration. For employees who are not retirement-eligible, compensation expense is recognized over the shorter of the three-year performance period or the period until the employee is retirement-eligible, with a minimum vesting and",

Performance units vest on a pro rata basis, in certain situations, as defined by each of the Plans.\n\nThe fair value of each performance unit granted was estimated using a Monte Carlo pricing model that considers stock beta, a risk-free interest rate, expected stock volatility and expected life. The stock beta was calculated comparing the risk of the individual securities to the average risk of the companies in the index group. The risk-free interest rate reflects the yield on a U.S. Treasury bond commensurate with the expected life of the performance unit. Volatility over the expected term of the performance unit is calculated using daily stock price observations for PPL and all companies in the index group and is evaluated with consideration given to prior periods that may need to be excluded based on events not likely to recur that had impacted PPL and the companies in the index group. PPL uses a mix of historic and implied volatility to value awards.\n\nThe weighted-average assumptions used in the model were:\n\n|                           | 2020    | 2019    | 2018    |\n|---------------------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Expected stock volatility | 15.64%  | 17.57%  | 17.60%  |\n| Expected life             | 3 years | 3 years | 3 years |\n\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of TSR performance units granted was:\n\n|              | 2020    | 2019    | 2018    |\n|--------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| PPL          | $ 37.63 | $ 35.83 | $ 38.26 |\n| PPL Electric | 38.64   | 35.68   | 38.37   |\n| LKE          | 37.73   | 35.93   | 38.32   |\n\nTSR performance unit activity for 2020 was:\n\n|                                  | TSR  Performance  Units   | Weighted- Average  Grant Date Fair  Value Per Share   |\n|----------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|\n| PPL                              |                           |                                                       |\n| N Nonvested, beginning of period | 739,392                   | $ 37.50                                               |\n| Granted                          | 261,891                   | 37.63                                                 |\n| Forfeited (a)                    | (375,029)                 | 38.46                                                 |\n| N Nonvested, end of period       | 626,254                   | 36.98                                                 |\n| PPL Electric                     |                           |                                                       |\n| N Nonvested, beginning of period | 66,799                    | $ 37.43                                               |\n| Granted                          | 21,416                    | 38.64                                                 |\n| Forfeited (a)                    | (26,408)                  | 38.37                                                 |\n| N Nonvested, end of period       | 61,807                    | 37.44                                                 |\n| LKE                              |                           |                                                       |\n| N Nonvested, beginning of period | 130,533                   | $ 37.60                                               |\n| Granted                          | 35,538                    | 37.73                                                 |\n| Forfeited (a)                    | (66,459)                  | 38.23                                                 |\n| N Nonvested, end of period       | 99,612                    | 37.23                                                 |\n\nThere were no TSR performance units vesting for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.

ROE performance units are intended to further align compensation with the company's strategy and reward for future corporate performance.\n\nPayout of these performance units will be based on the calculated average of the annual corporate ROE for each year of the three-year performance period for PPL Corporation. ROE performance units represent a target number of shares (Target Award) of PPL's common stock that the recipient would receive upon PPL's attainment of the applicable ROE performance goal. ROE performance units can be paid up to 200% of the Target Award or forfeited with no payout if performance is below a minimum established  performance  threshold.  Dividends  payable  during  the  performance  cycle  accumulate  and  are  converted  into additional performance units and are payable in shares of PPL common stock upon completion of the performance period based L on the Compensation Committee's determination of achievement of the performance goals. Under the plan provisions, these performance units are subject to forfeiture upon termination of employment other than retirement, disability or death of an f employee.\n\nThe fair value of each ROE performance unit is based on the closing price of PPL Common Stock on the date of grant. The fair value of ROE performance units is recognized on a straight-line basis over the service period or through the date at which the employee reaches retirement eligibility. The fair value awards granted to retirement-eligible employees is recognized as compensation expense immediately upon the date of grant.

Retirement and Postemployment Benefits\n\n(All Registrants)\n\n## Defined Benefits\n\nCertain employees of PPL's domestic subsidiaries are eligible for pension benefits under non-contributory defined benefit pension plans with benefits based on length of service and final average pay, as defined by the plans. Effective January 1, 2012, PPL's primary defined benefit pension plan was closed to all newly hired salaried employees. Effective July 1, 2014, PPL's primary defined benefit pension plan was closed to all newly hired bargaining unit employees. Newly hired employees are eligible to participate in the PPL Retirement Savings Plan, a 401(k) savings plan with enhanced employer contributions.\n\nThe defined benefit pension plans of LKE and its subsidiaries were closed to new salaried and bargaining unit employees hired after December 31, 2005. Employees hired after December 31, 2005 receive additional company contributions above the standard matching contributions to their savings plans. The pension plans sponsored by LKE and LG&E were merged effective January 1, 2020 into the LG&E and KU Pension Plan. The merged plan is sponsored by LKE. LG&E and KU participate in this plan.\n\nEffective April 1, 2010, the principal defined benefit pension plan applicable to WPD (South West) and WPD (South Wales) was closed to most new employees, except for those meeting specific grandfathered participation rights. WPD Midlands' defined benefit plan had been closed to new members, except for those meeting specific grandfathered participation rights, prior to acquisition. New employees not eligible to participate in the plans are offered benefits under a defined contribution plan.\n\nPPL and certain of its subsidiaries also provide supplemental retirement benefits to executives and other key management employees through unfunded nonqualified retirement plans.\n\nCertain employees of PPL's domestic subsidiaries are eligible for certain health care and life insurance benefits upon retirement through contributory plans. Effective January 1, 2014, the PPL Postretirement Medical Plan was closed to all newly hired salaried employees. Effective July 1, 2014, the PPL Postretirement Medical Plan was closed to all newly hired bargaining unit employees. Postretirement health benefits may be paid from 401(h) accounts established as part of the PPL Retirement Plan and the LG&E and KU Pension Plan within the PPL Services Corporation Master Trust, funded VEBA trusts and company funds. WPD does not sponsor any postretirement benefit plans other than pensions.",

In 2019, PPL, LKE and LGE used RP-2014 base tables with collar and factor adjustments, where applicable, and the MP-2017 mortality improvement scale from 2006 on a generational basis. In 2020, PPL and LKE updated to the Pri-2012 base table and the MP-2020 projection scale with varying adjustment factors based on the underlying demographic and geographic differences and experience of the plan participants.\n\nThe following weighted-average assumptions were used in the valuation of the benefit obligations at December 31.

The investment strategy for the Master Trust is to achieve a risk-adjusted return on a mix of assetr s that, in combination with PPL's funding policy, will ensure that sufficient assets are available to provide long-term growth and liquidity for benefit payments, while also managing the duration of the assets to complement the duration of the liabilities. The Master Trust benefits from a wide diversification of asset types, investment fund strategies and external investment fund managers, and therefore has no significant concentration of risk.\n\nThe investment policy of the Master Trust outlines investment objectives and defines the responsibilities of the EBPB, externalt investment managers, investment advisor and trustee and custodian. The investment policy is reviewed annually by PPL's Board of Directors.\n\nThe EBPB created a risk management framework around the trust assets and pension liabilities. This framework considers the trust assets as being composed of three sub-portfolios: growth, immunizing and liquidity portfolios. The growth portfolio is comprised of investments that generate a return at a reasonable risk, including equity securities, certain debt securities and alternative investments. The immunizing portfolio consists of debt securities, generally with long durations, and derivative positions. The immunizing portfolio is designed to offset a portion of the change in the pension liabilities due to changes in interest rates. The liquidity portfolio consists primarily of cash and cash equivalents.\n\nTarget allocation ranges have been developed for each portfolio based on input from external consultants with a goal of limiting funded status volatility. The EBPB monitors the investments in each portfolio, and seeks to obtain a target portfolio that emphasizes reduction of risk of loss from market volatility. In pursuing that goal, the EBPB establishes revised guidelines from time to time. EBPB investment guidelines as of the end of 2020 are presented below.",

The fair value measurements of equity securities y (excluding commingled funds), which are generally classified as Level 1, are based on quoted prices in active markets. These securities represent actively and passively managed investments that are managed against various equity indices.\n\nInvestments in commingled equity and debt funds are categorized as equity securities. Investments in commingled equity funds include funds that invest in U.S. and international equity securities. Investments in commingled debt funds include funds that invest in a diversified portfolio of emerging market debt obligations, as well as funds that invest in investment grade longduration fixed-income securities.\n\nThe fair value measurements of debt securities are generally based on evaluations that reflect observable market information, such as actual trade information for identical securities or for similar securities, adjusted for observable differences. The fair ff value of debt securities is generally measured using a market approach, including the use of pricing models, which incorporate observable inputs. Common inputs include benchmark yields, relevant trade data, broker/dealer bid/ask prices, benchmark securities and credit valuation adjustments. When necessary, the fair value of debt securities is measured using the income approach, which incorporates similar observable inputs as well as payment data, future predicted cash flows, collateral performance and new issue data. For the Master Trust, these securities represent investments in securities issued by U.S. Treasury and U.S. government sponsored agencies; investments securitized by residential mortgages, auto loans, credit cards and other pooled loans; investments in investment grade and non-investment grade bonds issued by U.S. companies across several industries; investments in debt securities issued by foreign governments and corporations.",

        "page_content": "Investments in real estate represent an investment in a partnership whose purpose is to manage investments in core U.S. real estate properties diversified geographically and across major property types (e.g., office, industrial, retail, etc.). The strategy is focused on properties with high occupancy rates with quality tenants. This results in a focus on high income and stable cash flows with appreciation being a secondary factor. Core real estate generally has a lower degree of leverage when compared with more speculative real estate investing strategies. The partnership has limitations on the amounts that may be redeemed based on available cash to fund redemptions. Additionally, the general partner may decline to accept redemptions when necessary to avoid adverse consequences for the partnership, including legal and tax implications, among others. The fair value of the investment is based upon a partnership unit value.\n\nInvestments in private equity represent interests in partnerships in multiple early-stage venture capital funds and private equity fund of funds that use a number of diverse investment strategies. The partnerships have limited lives of at least 10 years, after which liquidating distributions will be received. Prior to the end of each partnership's life, the investment cannot be redeemed with the partnership; however, the interest may be sold to other parties, subject to the general partner's approval. At December 31, 2020, the Master Trust has unfunded commitments of $45 million that may be required during the lives of the f partnerships. Fair value is based on an ownership interest in partners' capital to which a proportionate share of net assets is attributed.\n\nInvestments in limited partnerships include Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) funds. The Master Trust received notice that the TALF funds are liquidating in an orderly manner and distributing capital back to the partners.a Therefore, the Master Trust has no unfunded commitment related to the TALF funds. Fair value of the funds is based on an ownership interest in partners' capital to which a proportionate share of net assets is attributed.\n\nInvestments in hedge funds represent investments in a fund of hedge funds. Hedge funds seek a return utilizing a number of diverse investment strategies. The strategies, when combined aim to reduce volatility and risk while attempting to deliver positive returns under most market conditions. Major investment strategies for the fund of hedge funds include long/short equity, tactical trading, event driven, and relative value. Shares may be redeemed with 45 days prior written notice. The fund is subject to short term lockups and other restrictions. The fair value for the fund has been estimated using the net asset value per share.\n\nThe fair value measurements of derivative instruments utilize various inputs that include quoted prices for similar contracts or market-corroborated inputs. In certain instances, these instruments may be valued using models, including standard option valuation models and standard industry models. These securities primarily represent investments in treasury futures, total return swaps, interest rate swaps and swaptions (the option to enter into an interest rate swap), which are valued based on quoted prices, changes in the value of the underlying exposure or on the swap details, such as swap curves, notional amount, index and term of index, reset frequency, volatility and payer/receiver credit ratings.\n\nIn 2019, obligations underlying an investment in an immediate participation guaranteed group annuity contract, classified as Level 3, were assumed by the insurance company, with a residual amount remaining in the general account of the insurer that was paid into the master trust or distributed to participants in 2020.\n\n## Plan Assets - U.S. Other Postretirement Benefit Plans\n\nThe investment strategy with respect to other postretirement benefit obligations is to fund VEBA trusts and/or 401(h) accounts ff with voluntary contributions and to invest in a tax efficient manner. Excluding the 401(h) accounts included in the Master Trust, other postretirement benefit plans are invested in a mix of assets for long-term growth with an objective of earning returns that provide liquidity as required for benefit payments. These plans benefit from diversification of asset types, investment fund strategies and investment fund managers and, therefore, have no significant concentration of risk. Equity securities include investments in domestic large-cap commingled funds. Ownership interests in commingled funds that invest entirely in debt securities are classified as equity securities, but treated as debt securities for asset allocation and target allocation purposes. Ownership interests in money market funds are treated as cash and cash equivalents for asset allocation and target allocation purposes. The asset allocation for the PPL VEBA trusts, excluding LKE, and the target allocation, by asset class, at December 31 are detailed below.",

The trustees' primary focus is to ensure that assets are sufficient to meet members' benefits as they fall due with a longer term objective to reduce investment risk. The investment strategy is intended to maximize investment returns while not incurring excessive volatility in the funding position. WPD's plans are invested in a wide diversification of asset types, fund strategies and fund managers; and therefore, have no significant concentration of risk. Commingled funds that consist entirely of debt securities are traded as equity units, but treated by WPD as debt securities for asset allocation and target allocation purposes. These include investments in U.K. corporate bonds and U.K. gilts.\n\nThe asset allocation and target allocation at December 31 of WPD's pension plans are detailed below.\n\n|                                  | Percentage of plan assets   | Percentage of plan assets   | Target Asset Allocation   |\n|----------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------|\n|                                  | 2020                        | 2019                        | 2020                      |\n| Asset Class                      |                             |                             |                           |\n| Cash and cash equivalents        | 4 %                         | 2 %                         | -

The fair value measurement of the fund is based upon a net asset value per share, which is based on the value of underlying properties that are independently appraised in accordance with Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors valuation standards at least annually with quarterly valuation updates based on recent sales of similar properties, leasing levels, property operations and/or market conditions. The fund may be subject to redemption restrictions in the unlikely event of a large forced sale in order to ensure other unit holders are not disadvantaged.\n\n## Expected Cash Flows - U.S. Defined Benefit Plans (PPL)\n\nWhile PPL's U.S. defined benefit pension plans have the option to utilize available prior year credit balances to meet current and future contribution requirements, PPL contributed $30 million in January 2021 to its U.S. pension plans. No additional contributions are expected in 2021.\n\nPPL sponsors various non-qualified supplemental pension plans for which no assets are segregated from corporate assets. PPL expects to make approximately $18 million of benefit payments under these plans in 2021.\n\nPPL is not required to make contributions to its other postretirement benefit plans but has historically funded these plans in amounts equal to the postretirement benefit costs recognized. Continuation of this past practice would cause PPL to contribute $35 million to its other postretirement benefit plans in 2021.\n\nThe following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid by the plans and the following federal subsidy payments are expected to be received by PPL.\n\n|           |         | Other Postretirement   | Other Postretirement     |\n|-----------|---------|------------------------|--------------------------|\n|           | Pension | Benefit Payment        | Expected Federal Subsidy |\n| 2021      | $ 296   | $ 49                   | $ 1                      |\n| 2022      | 284     | 47                     | -                        |\n| 2023      | 279     | 46                     | -                        |\n| 2024      | 275     | 44                     | -                        |\n| 2025      | 273     | 43                     | -                        |\n| 2026-2030 | 1,273   | 194                    | 1                        |\n\n## (LKE)\n\nEffective January 1, 2020, the LKE and LG&E defined benefit pension plans were merged into a combined defined benefit pension plan.",

In June 2014, PPL and PPL Energy Supply, the parent company of PPL Montana, entered into various definitive agreements with affiliates of Riverstone to spin off PPL Energy Supply and ultimately combine it with Riverstone's competitive power generation businesses to form a stand-alone company named Talen Energy. In November 2014, after executing the spinoff agreements but prior to the closing of the spinoff transaction, PPL Montana closed the sale of its hydroelectric generating facilities. Subsequently, on June 1, 2015, the spinoff of PPL Energy Supply was completed. Following the spinoff transaction, PPL had no continuing ownership interest in or control of PPL Energy Supply. In connection with the",

        "page_content": "spinoff transaction, PPL Montana became Talen Montana, LLC (Talen Montana), a subsidiary of Talen Energy. Talen Energy Marketing also became a subsidiary of Talen Energy as a result of the June 2015 spinoff of PPL Energy Supply. Talen Energy has owned and operated both Talen Montana and Talen Energy Marketing since the spinoff. At the time of the spinoff, affiliates of Riverstone acquired a 35% ownership interest in Talen Energy. Riverstone subsequently acquired the remaining interests in Talen Energy in a take private transaction in December 2016.\n\n## Talen Montana Retirement Plan and Talen Energy Marketing, LLC, Individually and on Behalf of All Others Similarly Situated v. PPL Corporation et al.\n\nOn October 29, 2018, Talen Montana Retirement Plan and Talen Energy Marketing filed a putative class action complaint on behalf of current and contingent creditors of Talen Montana who allegedly suffered harm or allegedly will suffer reasonably foreseeable harm as a result of the November 2014 distribution of proceeds from the sale of then-PPL Montana's hydroelectric generating facilities. The action was filed in the Sixteenth Judicial District of the State of Montana, Rosebud County, against PPL and certain of its affiliates and current and former officers and directors (Talen Putative Class Action). Plaintiff asserts claims for, among other things, fraudulent transfer, both actual and constructive; recovery against subsequent transferees; civil conspiracy; aiding and abetting tortious conduct; and unjust enrichment. Plaintiff is seeking avoidance of the purportedly fraudulent transfer, unspecified damages, including punitive damages, the imposition of a constructive trust, and other relief. In December 2018, PPL removed the Talen Putative Class Action from the Sixteenth Judicial District of the State of Montana to the United States District Court for the District of Montana, Billings Division (MT Federal Court). In January 2019, the plaintiff moved to remand the Talen Putative Class Action back to state court, and dismissed without prejudice all current and former PPL Corporation directors from the case. In September 2019, the MT Federal Court granted plaintiff's motion to remand the case back to state court. Although, the PPL defendants petitioned the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals to grant an appeal of the remand decision, in November 2019, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals denied that request and in December 2019, Talenf Montana Retirement Plan filed a Second Amended Complaint in the Sixteenth Judicial District of the State of Montana, Rosebud County, which removed Talen Energy Marketing as a plaintiff. In January 2020, PPL defendants filed a motion to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint or, in the alternative, to stay the proceedings pending the resolution of the below mentioned Delaware Action. The Court held a hearing on June 24, 2020 regarding the motion to dismiss. On September 11, 2020, the Court granted PPL defendants' alternative Motion for a Stay of the proceedings.\n\n## PPL Corporation et al. vs. Riverstone Holdings LLC, Talen Energy Corporation et al.\n\nOn November 30, 2018, PPL, certain PPL affiliates, and certain current and former officers and directors (PPL plaintiffs) filed a complaint in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware seeking various forms of relief against Riverstone, Talen Energy and certain of their affiliates (Delaware Action), in response to and as part of the defense strategy for an action filed by Talen Montana, LLC (the Talen Direct Action, since dismissed) and the Talen Putative Class Action described above (together, the Montana Actions) originally filed in Montana state court in October 2018. In the complaint, the PPL plaintiffs ask the Delaware Court of Chancery for declaratory and injunctive relief. This includes a declaratory judgment that, under the separation agreement governing the spinoff of PPL Energy Supply, all related claims that arise must be heard in Delaware; that the statute of limitations in Delaware and the spinoff agreement bar these claims at this time; that PPL is not liable for the claims in either ii the Talen Direct Action or the Talen Putative Class Action as PPL Montana was solvent at all relevant times; and that the separation agreement requires that Talen Energy indemnify PPL for all losses arising from the debts of Talen Montana, among other things. PPL's complaint also seeks damages against Riverstone for interfering with the separation agreement and against Riverstone affiliates for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The complaint was subsequently amended on January 11, 2019 and March 20, 2019, to include, among other things, claims related to indemnification with respect to the Montana Actions, request a declaration that the Montana Actions are time-barred under the spinoff agreements, and allege additional facts to support the tortious interference claim. In April 2019, the defendants filed motions to dismiss the amended complaint. In July 2019, the Court heard oral arguments from the parties regarding the motions to dismiss, and in October 2019, the Delaware Court of Chancery issued an opinion sustaining all of the PPL plaintiffs' claims except for the claim for breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. As a result of the dismissal of the Talen Direct Action in December 2019, in January 2020, Talen Energy filed a new motion to dismiss five of the remaining eight claims in the amended complaint. The Court heard oral argument on the motion to dismiss on May 28, 2020, and on June 22, 2020, issued an opinion denying the motion in its entirety. Discovery is proceeding, and a trial has been scheduled for February 2022.\n\nWith respect to each of the Talen-related matters described above, PPL believes that the 2014 distribution of proceeds was made in compliance with all applicable laws and that PPL Montana was solvent at all relevant times. Additionally, the agreements entered into in connection with the spinoff, which PPL and affiliates of Talen Energy and Riverstone negotiated and executed prior to the 2014 distribution, directly address the treatment of the proceeds from the sale of PPL Montana's hydroelectric generating facilities; in those agreements, Talen Energy and Riverstone definitively agreed that PPL was entitled to retain the proceeds.",

In July 2014, the U.S. District Court dismissed the RCRA claims and all but one Clean Air Act claim, but declined to dismiss the common law tort claims. In February 2017, the U.S. District Court dismissed PPL as a defendant and dismissed the final federal claim against LG&E, and in April 2017, issued an Order declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction on the state law claims dismissing the case in its entirety. In June 2017, the plaintiffs filed a class action complaint in Jefferson County, Kentucky Circuit Court, against LG&E alleging state law nuisance, negligence and trespass tort claims. The plaintiffs seek compensatory and punitive damages for alleged property damage due to purported plant emissions on behalf of a class of residents within one to three miles of the plant. On January 8, 2020, the Jefferson Circuit Court issued an order denying the plaintiffs' request for class certification. On January 14, 2020, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal in the Kentucky Court of Appeals. On December 11, 2020, the Court of Appeals issued an order affirming the lower court's denial of class certification. In December 2020, plaintiffs filed a petition for discretionary review with the Kentucky Supreme Court. PPL, LKE and LG&E cannot predict the outcome of this matter and an estimate or range of possible losses cannot be determined.\n\n(PPL, LKE and KU)\n\n## E.W. Brown Environmental Claims\n\nIn July 2017, the Kentucky Waterways Alliance and the Sierra Club filed a citizen suit complaint against KU in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky (U.S. District Court) alleging discharges at the E.W. Brown plant in violation of the Clean Water Act and the plant's water discharge permit and alleging contamination that may present an imminent and substantial endangerment in violation of the RCRA. The plaintiffs' suit relates to prior notices of intent to file a citizen suit submitted in October and November 2015 and October 2016. These plaintiffs sought injunctive relief ordering KU to take all actions necessary to comply with the Clean Water Act and RCRA, including ceasing the discharges in question, abating effects associated with prior discharges and eliminating the alleged imminent and substantial endangerment. These plaintiffs also sought assessment of civil penalties and an award of litigation costs and attorney fees. In December 2017, the U.S. District Court issued an Order dismissing the Clean Water Act and RCRA complaints against KU in their entirety. In January 2018, the plaintiffs appealed the dismissal Order to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. In September 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit issued its ruling affirming the lower court's decision to dismiss the Clean Water Act claims but reversing its dismissal of the RCRA claims against KU and remanding the latter to the U.S. District Court. In October 2018, KU filed a petition for rehearing to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit regarding the RCRA claims. In November 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit denied KU's petition for rehearing regarding the RCRA claims. In January 2019, KU filed an answer to plaintiffs' complaint in the U.S. District Court. Discovery is complete and the parties' motions for partial summary judgment are pending. In December 2020, the U.S. District Court delayed the trial scheduled for February 2, 2021 indefinitely due to pandemic considerations. PPL, LKE and KU cannot predict the outcome of these matters and an estimate or range of possible losses cannot be determined.\n\nKU is undertaking extensive remedial measures at the E.W. Brown plant including work preparing for closure of the former ash pond, implementation of a groundwater remedial action plan and performance of a corrective action plan including aquatic study of adjacent surface waters and risk assessment. The aquatic study and risk assessment are being undertaken pursuant to a 2017 agreed Order with the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet (KEEC). KU conducted sampling of Herrington Lake in 2017 and 2018. In June 2019, KU submitted to the KEEC the required aquatic study and risk assessment, conducted by an independent third-party consultant, finding that discharges from the E.W. Brown plant have not had any significant impact on Herrington Lake and that the water in the lake is safe for recreational use and meets safe drinking water standards. However, until the KEEC assesses the study and issues any regulatory determinations, PPL, LKE and KU are unable to determine whether additional remedial measures will be required at the E.W. Brown plant.",

        "page_content": "## Air\n\n## Sulfuric Acid Mist Emissions (PPL, LKE and LG&E)\n\nIn June 2016, the EPA issued a notice of violation under the Clean Air Act alleging that LG&E violated applicable rules relating to sulfuric acid mist emissions at its Mill Creek plant. The notice alleges failure to install proper controls, failure to operate therr facility consistent with good air pollution control practice, and causing emissions exceedingaa applicable requirements or constituting a nuisance or endangerment. LG&E believes it has complied with applicable regulations during the relevant time period. On July 31, 2020, the U.S. Department of Justice and Louisville Metro Air Pollution Control District filed a complaint tt in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky alleging violations specified in the EPA notice of violation and seeking civil penalties and injunctive relief. In October 2020, LG&E filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. In December 2020, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Louisville Metro Air Pollution Control District filed an amended complaint. In February 2021, LG&E filed a renewed motion to dismiss regarding the amended complaint. PPL, LKE and LG&E are unable to predict the outcome of this matter or the potential impact on operations of the Mill Creek plant, including increased capital or operating costs, and potential civil penalties or remedial measures, if any. An estimate or range of possible losses cannot be determined.\n\n## Water/Waste\n\n(PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU)\n\n## ELGs\n\nIn 2015, the EPA finalized ELGs for wastewater discharge permits for new and existing steam electricity generating facilities. These guidelines require deployment of additional control technologies providing physical, chemical and biological treatment and mandate operational changes including \"no discharge\" requirements for certain wastewaters. The implementation date for individual generating stations was to be determined by the states on a case-by-case basis according to criteria provided by the EPA. Legal challenges to the final rule were consolidated before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. In April 2017, the EPA announced that it would grant petitions for reconsideration of the rule. In September 2017, the EPA issued a rule to postpone the compliance date for certain requirements. On October 13, 2020, the EPA published final revisions to its best available technology standards for certain wastewaters and potential extensions to compliance dates. The rule will be implemented by the states or applicable permitting authorities in the course of their normal permitting activities. LG&E and KU have developed responsive compliance strategies and schedules. Certain aspects of these compliance plans and estimates relate to developments in state water quality standards, which are separate from the ELG rule or its implementation. Certain costs are included in the Registrants' capital plans and expected to be recovered from customers through rate recovery mechanisms, but additional costs and recovery will depend on further regulatory developments at the state level. See Note 7 for additional information regarding LG&E's and KU's applications for ECR rate treatment of construction costs relating to regulations addressing ELGs.\n\n## CCRs\n\nIn 2015, the EPA issued a final rule governing management of CCRs which include fly ash, bottom ash and sulfur dioxide scrubber wastes. The CCR Rule imposes extensive new requirements for certain CCR impoundments and landfills, including public notifications, location restrictions, design and operating standards, groundwater monitoring and corrective action requirements, and closure and post-closure care requirements, and specifies restrictions relating to the beneficial use of CCRs. In July 2018, the EPA issued a final rule extending the deadline for closure of certain impoundments and adopting other substantive changes. In August 2018, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals vacated and remanded portions of the CCR Rule. In December 2019, the EPA addressed the deficiencies identified by the court and proposed amendments to change the closure deadline. In August 2020, the EPA published a final rule extending the deadline to initiate closure to April 11, 2021, while providing for certain extensions. The EPA is conducting ongoing rulemaking actions to adopt various other amendments to the rule. PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU are unable to predict the outcome of the ongoing litigation and rulemaking or potential impacts on current LG&E and KU compliance plans. The Registrants are currently finalizing closure plans and schedules.\n\nIn January 2017, Kentucky issued a new state rule relating to CCR management, effective May 2017, aimed at reflecting the requirements of the federal CCR rule. As a result of a subsequent legal challenge, in January 2018, the Franklin County, Kentucky Circuit Court issued an opinion invalidating certain procedural elements of the rule. LG&E and KU presently operate their facilities under continuing permits authorized under the former program and do not currently anticipate material impacts as a result of the judicial ruling. The Kentucky Energy and Environmental Cabinet has announced it intends to propose new state rules aimed at addressing procedural deficiencies identified by the court and providing the regulatory framework",

Associated costs are expected to be subject to rate recovery.\n\nLG&E and KU received KPSC approval for a compliance plan providing for the closure of impoundments at the Mill Creek, Trimble County, E.W. Brown, and Ghent stations, and construction of process water management facilities at those plants. In addition to the foregoing measures required for compliance with the federal CCR rule, KU also received KPSC approval for its plans to close impoundments at the retired Green River, Pineville and Tyrone plants to comply with applicable state law. Since 2017, LG&E and KU have commenced closure of many of the subject impoundments and have completed closure of some of their smaller impoundments. LG&E and KU expect to commence closure of the remaining impoundments no later than April 2021. LG&E and KU generally expect to complete impoundment closures within five years of commencement, although a longer period may be required to complete closure of some facilities. Associated costs are expected to be subject to rate recovery.\n\nIn connection with the final CCR rule, LG&E and KU recorded adjustments to existing AROs beginning in 2015 and continue to record adjustments as required. See Note 19 for additional information. Further changes to AROs, current capital plans or operating costs may be required as estimates are refined based on closure developments, groundwater monitoring results, and regulatory or legal proceedings. Costs relating to this rule are subject to rate recovery.\n\n## (All Registrants)\n\n## Superfund and Other Remediationp\n\nPPL Electric, LG&E and KU are potentially responsible for investigating and remediating contamination under the federal Superfund program and similar state programs. Actions are under way at certain sites including former coal gas manufacturing plants in Pennsylvania and Kentucky previously owned or operated by, or currently owned by predecessors or affiliates of, PPL Electric, LG&E and KU. PPL Electric is potentially responsible for a share of clean-up costs at certain sites including the Columbia Gas Plant site and the Brodhead site. Cleanup actions have been or are being undertaken at all of these sites, the costs of which have not been and are not expected to be significant to PPL Electric.\n\nAt December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, PPL Electric had a recorded liability of $10 million representing its best estimate of the probable loss incurred to remediate the sites identified above. Depending on the outcome of investigations at identified sites where investigations have not begun or been completed, or developments at sites for which information is incomplete, additional costs of remediation could be incurred. PPL Electric, LG&E and KU lack sufficient information about such additional sites to estimate any potential liability or range of reasonably possible losses, if any, related to these sites. Such costs, however, are not currently expected to be significant.\n\nThe EPA is evaluating the risks associated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and naphthalene, chemical by-products of coal gas manufacturing. As a result, individual states may establish stricter standards for water quality and soil cleanup, that aa could require several PPL subsidiaries to take more extensive assessment and remedial actions at former coal gas manufacturing plants. PPL, PPL Electric, LKE, LG&E and KU cannot estimate a range of possible losses, if any, related to f these matters.\n\n## Regulatory Issues\n\nSee Note 7 for information on regulatory matters related to utility rate regulation.\n\n## Electricity - Reliability Standardsy y\n\nThe NERC is responsible for establishing and enforcing mandatory reliability standards (Reliability Standards) regarding the bulk electric system in North America. The FERC oversees this process and independently enforces the Reliability Standards.\n\nThe Reliability Standards have the force and effect of law and apply to certain users of the bulk electric system, including electric utility companies, generators and marketers. Under the Federal Power Act, the FERC may assess civil penalties for certain violations.\n\nPPL Electric, LG&E and KU monitor their compliance with the Reliability Standards and self-report or self-log potential violations of applicable reliability requirements whenever identified, and submit accompanying mitigation plans, as required. The resolution of a small number of potential violations is pending. Penalties incurred to date have not been significant. Any",

Examples of such agreements include: guarantees, stand-by letters of credit issued by financial institutions and surety bonds issued by insurance companies. These agreements are entered into primarily to support or enhance the creditworthiness attributed to a subsidiary on a stand-alone basis or to facilitate the commercial activities in which these subsidiaries engage.\n\n## (PPL)\n\nPPL fully and unconditionally guarantees all of the debt obligations of PPL Capital Funding.\n\n## (All Registrants)\n\nThe table below details guarantees provided as of December 31, 2020. \"Exposure\" represents the estimated maximum potential amount of future payments that could be required to be made under the guarantee.

The exposure noted only includes those cases where the agreements provide for specific limits.\n\nIn connection with their sales of various businesses, WPD and its affiliates have provided the purchasers with indemnifications that are standard for such transactions, including indemnifications for certain pre-existing liabilities and environmental and tax matters or have agreed to continue their obligations under existing third-party guarantees, either for a set period of time following the transactions or upon the condition that the purchasers make reasonable efforts to terminate the guarantees. Additionally, WPD and its affiliates remain secondarily responsible for lease payments under certain leases that they have assigned to third parties.\n\nThe Registrants provide other miscellaneous guarantees through contracts entered into in the normal course of business. These guarantees are primarily in the form of indemnification or warranties related to services or equipment and vary in duration. The amounts of these guarantees often are not explicitly stated, and the overall maximum amount of the obligation under such aa guarantees cannot be reasonably estimated. Historically, no significant payments have been made with respect to these types of guarantees and the probability of payment/performance under these guarantees is remote.\n\nPPL, on behalf of itself and certain of its subsidiaries, maintains insurance that covers liability assumed under contract for bodily injury and property damage. The coverage provides maximum aggregate coverage of $225 million. This insurance may be applicable to obligations under certain of these contractual arrangements.\n\n## Risks and Uncertainties (All Registrants)\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the U.S. and global economies and continues to present extraordinary challenges to businesses, communities, workforces and markets. In the U.S. and throughout the world, governmental authorities have taken urgent and extensive actions to contain the spread of the virus and mitigate known or foreseeable impacts. In the Registrants' service territories, mitigation measures have included quarantines, stay-at-home orders, travel restrictions, reduced operations or closures of businesses, schools and governmental agencies, and legislative or regulatory actions to address health or other pandemic-related concerns, all of which have the potential to adversely impact the Registrants' business and operations, especially if these measures remain in effect for a prolonged period of time.\n\nTo date, there has been no material impact on the Registrants' operations, financial condition, liquidity or on their supply chain as a result of COVID-19; however, the duration and severity of the outbreak and its ultimate effects on the global economy, the financial markets, or the Registrants' workforce, customers and suppliers are uncertain. A protracted slowdown of broad sectors of the economy, prolonged or pervasive restrictions on businesses and their workforces, or significant changes in legislation or regulatory policy to address the COVID-19 pandemic all present significant risks to the Registrants. These or other unpredictable events resulting from the pandemic could further reduce customer demand for electricity and gas, impact the Registrants' employees and supply chains, result in an increase in certain costs, delay payments or increase bad debts, or result in changes in the fair value of their assets and liabilities, which could materially and adversely affect the Registrants' business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.",

Related Party Transactions\n\n## Wholesale Sales and Purchases (LG&E and KU)\n\nLG&E and KU jointly dispatch their generation units with the lowest cost generation used to serve their retail customers. When LG&E has excess generation capacity after serving its own retail customers and its generation cost is lower than that of KU, KU purchases electricity from LG&E and vice versa. These transactions are reflected in the Statements of Income as \"Electric revenue from affiliate\" and \"Energy purchases from affiliate\" and are recorded at a price equal to the seller's fuel cost plus any split savings. Savings realized from such intercompany transactions are shared equally between both companies. The volume of energy each company has to sell to the other is dependent on its retail customers' needs and its available generation.\n\n## Support Costs (PPL Electric, LKE, LG&E and KU)\n\nPPL Services, PPL EU Services and LKS provide PPL, PPL Electric and LKE, their respective subsidiaries, including LG&E and KU, and each other with administrative, management and support services. For all services companies, the costs of directly assignable and attributable services are charged to the respective recipients as direct support costs. General costs that cannot be directly attributed to a specific entity are allocated and charged to the respective recipients as indirect support costs. PPL Services and PPL EU Services use a three-factor methodology that includes the applicable recipients' invested capital, operation and maintenance expenses and number of employees to allocate indirect costs. PPL Services may also use a ratio of overall direct and indirect costs or a weighted average cost ratio. LKS bases its indirect allocations on the subsidiaries' number of employees, total assets, revenues, number of customers and/or other statistical informf ation. PPL Services, PPL EU Services and LKS charged the following amounts for the years ended December 31, including amounts applied to accounts that are further distributed between capital and expense on the books of the recipients, based on methods that are believed to be reasonable.\n\n|                                   | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   |\n|-----------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| PPL Electric from PPL Services    | $ 50   | $ 59   | $ 59   |\n| LKE from PPL Services             | 27     | 28     | 26     |\n| PPL Electric from PPL EU Services | 176    | 152    | 148    |\n| LG&E from LKS                     | 170    | 160    | 151    |\n| KU from LKS                       | 180    | 178    | 169    |\n\nIn addition to the charges for services noted above, LKS makes payments on behalf of LG&E and KU for fuel purchases and other costs for products or services provided by third parties. LG&E and KU also provide services to each other and to LKS. Billings between LG&E and KU relate to labor and overheads associated with union and hourly employees performing work y for the other company, charges related to jointly-owned generating units and other miscellaneous charges. Tax settlements between LKE and LG&E and KU are reimbursed through LKS.\n\n## Intercompany Borrowings\n\n## (PPL Electric)\n\nPPL Energy Funding maintains a $650 million revolving line of credit with a PPL Electric subsidiary. No balance was outstanding at December 31, 2020 and 2019. The interest rates on borrowings are equal to one-month LIBOR plus a spread. Interest income is reflected in \"Interest Income from Affiliate\" on the Income Statements.\n\n## (LKE)\n\nLKE maintains a $375 million revolving line of credit with a PPL Energy Funding subsidiary whereby LKE can borrow funds on a short-term basis at market-based rates. The interest rates on borrowings are equal to one-month LIBOR plus a spread. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, $251 million and $150 million were outstanding and reflected in \"Notes payable with affiliates\" on the Balance Sheets. The interest rate on the outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2020 and 2019 were 1.65% and 3.20%. Interest expense on the revolving line of credit was not significant for 2020, 2019 or 2018.\n\nLKE maintains an agreement with a PPL affiliate that has a $300 million borrowing limit whereby LKE can loan funds on a short-term basis at market-based rates. No balance was outstanding at December 31, 2020 and 2019. The interest rate on the loan based on the PPL affiliates credit rating is currently equal to one-month LIBOR plus a spread.\n\nLKE maintains 10-year notes with a combined value of $1.2 billion with a PPL affiliate with a weighted-average interest rate of 3.9% and maturities ranging from 2026 to 2030.

Based on PPL Electric's participation in PPL's Other Postretirement Benefit plan, PPL Electric was allocated a portion of the excess funds from PPL Services. These funds have been recorded as an intercompany receivable on the Balance Sheets. The receivable balance decreases as PPL Electric pays incurred medical claims and is reimbursed by PPL Services. The intercompany receivable balance associated with these funds was $22 million as of December 31, 2020, of which $10 million was reflected in \"Accounts receivable from affiliates\" and $12 million was rea flected in \"Other noncurrent assets\" on the Balance Sheets. The intercompany receivable balance associated with these funds was $32 million as of December 31, 2019, of which $10 million was reflected in \"Accounts receivable from affiliates\" and $22 million was reflected in \"Other noncurrent assets\" on the Balance Sheets.\n\n## Other (PPL Electric, LKE, LG&E and KU)\n\nSee Note 1 for discussions regarding the intercompany tax sharing agreement (for PPL Electric, LKE, LG&E and KU) and intercompany allocations of stock-based compensation expense (for PPL Electric and LKE).

Fair Value Measurements\n\n(All Registrants)\n\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (an exit price). A market approach (generally, dataaa from market transactions), an income approach (generally, present value techniques and option-pricing models), and/or a cost approach (generally, replacement cost) are used to measure the fair value of an asset or liability, as appropriate. These valuation approaches incorporate inputs such as observable, independent market data and/or unobservable data that management believes are a predicated on the assumptions market participants would use to price an asset or liability. These inputs may incorporate, as applicable, certain risks such as nonperformance risk, which includes credit risk. The fair value of a group of financial assets and liabilities is measured on a net basis.

In 2018, PPL received a favorable private letter ruling from the IRS permitting a transfer of excess funds from the PPL Bargaining Unit Retiree Health Plan VEBA to a new subaccount within the VEBA to be used to pay medical claims of active bargaining unit employees.

To manage foreign currency exchange risk, PPL uses foreign currency contracts such as forwards, options, and cross-currency swaps that contain characteristics of both interest rate and foreign currency contracts. An income approach is used to measure the fair value of these contracts, utilizing readily observable inputs, such as forward interest rates (e.g., LIBOR and government security rates) and forward foreign currency exchange rates (e.g., GBP), as well as inputs that may not be observable, such as credit valuation adjustments. In certain cases, market information cannot practicably be obtained to value credit risk and therefore internal models are relied upon. These models use projected probabilities of",

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\n\n## Risk Management Objectives\n\n## (All Registrants)\n\nPPL has a risk management policy approved by the Board of Directors to manage market risk associated with commodities, interest rates on debt issuances and foreign exchange (including price, liquidity and volumetric risk) and credit risk (including non-performance risk and payment default risk). The Risk Management Committee, comprised of senior management and chaired by the Senior Director-Risk Management, oversees the risk management function. Key risk control activities designed to ensure compliance with the risk policy and detailed programs include, but are not limited to, credit review and approval, validation of transactions, verification of risk and transaction limits, value-at-risk analyses (VaR, a statistical model that attempts to estimate the value of potential loss over a given holding period under normal market conditions at a given confidence level) and the coordination and reporting of the Enterprise Risk Management program.\n\n## Market Risk\n\nMarket risk includes the potential loss that may be incurred as a result of price chant ges associated with a particular financial or commodity instrument as well as market liquidity and volumetric risks. Forward contracts, futures contracts, options, swaps and structured transactions are utilized as part of risk management strategies to minimize unanticipated fluctuations in earnings caused by changes in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Many of these contracts meet the definition of a derivative. All derivatives are recognized on the Balance Sheets at their fair value, unless NPNS is elected.\n\nThe following summarizes the market risks that affect PPL and its subsidiaries.\n\n## Interest Rate Risk\n\n- \u00b7 PPL and its subsidiaries are exposed to interest rate risk associated with forecasted fixed-rate and existing floating-rate debt issuances. PPL and WPD hold over-the-counter cross currency swaps to limit exposure to market fluctuations on interest and principal payments from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. PPL, LKE and LG&E utilize over-the-counter interest rate swaps to limit exposure to market fluctuations on floating-rate debt. PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU utilize forward starting interest rate swaps to hedge changes in benchmark interest rates, when appropriate, in connection with future debt issuances.\n- \u00b7 PPL and its subsidiaries are exposed to interest rate risk associated with debt securities and derivatives held by defined benefit plans. This risk is significantly mitigated to the extent that the plans are sponsored at, or sponsored on behalf of, tt he regulated domestic utilities and for certain plans at WPD due to the recovery methods in place.",

Potential commodity price risk is insignificant and mitigated through its PUC-approved cost recovery mechanism and full-requirement supply agreements to serve its PLR customers which transfer the risk to energy suppliers. ff\n- \u00b7 LG&E's and KU's rates include certain mechanisms for fuel, fuel-related expenses and energy purchases. In addition, LG&E's rates include a mechanism for natural gas supply expenses. These mechanisms generally provide for timely recovery of market price fluctuations associated with these expenses.\n\n## Volumetric Risk\n\nVolumetric risk is the risk related to the changes in volume of retail sales due to weather, economic conditions or other factors. PPL is exposed to volumetric risk through its subsidiaries as described below.\n\n- \u00b7 WPD is exposed to volumetric risk which is significantly mitigated as a result of the method of regulation in the U.K. Under the RIIO-ED1 price control regulations, recovery of such exposure occurs on a two year lag. See Note 1 for additional information on revenue recognition under RIIO-ED1.\n- \u00b7 PPL Electric, LG&E and KU are exposed to volumetric risk on retail sales, mainly due to weather and other economic conditions for which there is limited mitigation between rate cases.\n\n## Equity Securities Price Risk\n\n- \u00b7 PPL and its subsidiaries are exposed to equity securities price risk associated with the fair value of the defined benefit plans' assets. This risk is significantly mitigated at the regulated domestic utilities and for certain plans at WPD due to the recovery methods in place.\n- \u00b7 PPL is exposed to equity securities price risk from future stock sales and/or purchases.k\n\n## Credit Risk\n\nCredit risk is the potential loss that may be incurred due to a counterparty's non-performance.\n\nPPL is exposed to credit risk from \"in-the-money\" transactions with counterparties, as well as additional credit risk through certain of its subsidiaries, as discussed below.\n\nIn the event a supplier of PPL Electric, LG&E or KU defaults on its obligation, those Registrants would be required to seek replacement power or replacement fuel in the market. In general, subject to regulatory review or other processes, appropriate incremental costs incurred by these entities would be recoverable from customers through applicable rate mechanisms, thereby mitigating the financial risk for these entities.\n\nPPL and its subsidiaries have credit policies in place to manage credit risk, including the use of an established credit approval process, daily monitoring of counterparty positions and the use of master netting agreements or provisions. These agreements generally include credit mitigation provisions, such as margin, prepayment or collateral requirements. PPL and its subsidiaries may request additional credit assurance, in certain circumstances, in the event that the counterparties' credit ratings fall below investment grade, their tangible net worth falls below specified percentages or their exposures exceed an established credit limit.\n\n## Master Netting Arrangements (PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU)\n\nNet derivative positions on the balance sheets are not offset against the right to reclaim cash collateral (a receivable) or the obligation to return cash collateral (a payable) under master netting arrangements.",

        "page_content": "PPL had an immaterial amount and $14 million obligation to return cash collateral under master netting arrangements at December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n\nPPL had no obligation to post cash collateral under master netting arrangements at December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n\nLKE, LG&E and KU had no obligation to return cash collateral under master netting arrangements at December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n\nLKE, LG&E and KU had no cash collateral posted under master netting arrangements at December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n\nSee \"Offsetting Derivative Instruments\" below for a summary of derivative positions presented in the balance sheets where a right of setoff exists under these arrangements.\n\n## Interest Rate Risk\n\n## (All Registrants)\n\nPPL and its subsidiaries issue debt to finance their operations, which exposes them to interest rate risk. A variety of financial derivative instruments are utilized to adjust the mix of fixed and floating interest rates in their debt portfolios, adjust the duration of the debt portfolios and lock in benchmark interest rates in anticipation of future financing, when appropriate. Risk limits under PPL's risk management program are designed to balance risk exposure to volatility in interest expense and changes in the fair value of the debt portfolio due to changes in benchmark interest rates. In addition, the interest rate risk of certain subsidiaries is potentially mitigated as a result of the existing regulatory framework or the timing of rate cases.\n\n## Cash Flow Hedges (PPL) g\n\nInterest rate risks include exposure to adverse interest rate movements for outstanding variable rate debt and for future anticipated financings. Financial interest rate swap contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges may be entered into to hedge floating interest rate risk associated with both existing and anticipated debt issuances. PPL had no such contracts at December 31, 2020.\n\nAt December 31, 2020, PPL held an aggregate notional value in cross-currency interest rate swap contracts of $702 million that range in maturity from 2021 through 2028 to hedge the interest payments and principal of WPD's U.S. dollar-denominated senior notes.\n\nCash flow hedges are discontinued if it is no longer probable that the original forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the f originally specified time period and any amounts previously recorded in AOCI are reclassified into earnings once it is determined that the hedged transaction is not probable of occurring.\n\nFor 2020, 2019 and 2018, PPL had no cash flow hedges reclassified into earnings associated with discontinued cash flow hedges.\n\nAt December 31, 2020, the amount of accumulated net unrecognized after-tax gains (losses) on qualifying derivatives expected to be reclassified into earnings during the next 12 months is insignificant. Amounts are reclassified as the hedged interest expense is recorded.\n\n## Economic Activity (PPL, LKE and LG&E) y\n\nLG&E enters into interest rate swap contracts that economically hedge interest payments. Because realized gains and losses from the swaps, including terminated swap contracts, are recoverable through regulated rates, any subsequent changes in fair value of these derivatives are included in regulatory assets or liabilities until they are realized as interest expense. Realizr ed gains and losses are recognized in \"Interest Expense\" on the Statements of Income at the time the underlying hedged interest expense is recorded. At December 31, 2020, LG&E held contracts with a notional amount of $64 million that mature in 2033.",

        "page_content": "## Foreign Currency Risk\n\n(PPL)\n\nPPL is exposed to foreign currency risk, primarily through investments in and earnings of U.K. affiliates. PPL has adopted a foreign currency risk management program designed to hedge certain foreign currency exposures, including firm commitments, recognized assets or liabilities, anticipated transactions, including the previously announced potential sale of its U.K utility tt business and net investments. In addition, PPL enters into financial instruments to protect against foreign currency translation risk of expected GBP earnings.\n\n## Net Investment Hedgesg\n\nPPL enters into foreign currency contracts on behalf of a subsidiary to protect the value of a portion of its net investment in WPD. There were no contracts outstanding at December 31, 2020.\n\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, PPL had $33 million and $32 million of accumulated net investment hedge after tax gains (losses) that were included in the foreign currency translation adjustment component of AOCI.\n\n## Economic Activity y\n\nPPL enters into foreign currency contracts on behalf of a subsidiary to economically hedge GBP-denominated anticipated earnings and anticipated transactions, including the previously announced potential sale of its U.K. utility business. At December 31, 2020, the total exposure hedged by PPL was approximately \u00a34 billion.\n\n## Accounting and Reporting\n\n(All Registrants)\n\nAll derivative instruments are recorded at fair value on the Balance Sheet as an asset or liability unless NPNS is elected. NPNS contracts include certain full-requirement purchase contracts and other physical purchase contracts. Changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated as NPNS are recognized in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met and designated as such, except for the changes in fair values of LG&E's interest rate swaps that are recognized as regulatory assets or t regulatory liabilities. See Note 7 for amounts recorded in regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities at December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n\nSee Note 1 for additional information on accounting policies related to derivative instruments.\n\n(PPL)\n\nThe following table presents the fair value and location of derivative instruments recorded on the Balance Sheets:",

Most of these features would require the transfer of additional collateral or permit the counterparty to terminate the contract if the applicable credit rating were to fall below investment grade. Some of these features also would allow the counterparty to require additional collateral upon each downgrade in credit rating at levels that remain above investment grade.

Asset Retirement Obligations\n\n(PPL)\n\nWPD has recorded conditional AROs required by U.K. law related to treated wood poles, gas-filled switchgear and fluid-filled cables.\n\n## (PPL and PPL Electric)\n\nPPL Electric has identified legal retirement obligations for the retirement of certain transmission assets that could not be reasonably estimated due to indeterminable settlement dates. These assets are located on rights-of-way that allow the grantor tff o require PPL Electric to relocate or remove the assets. Since this option is at the discretion of the grantor of the right-of-way, PPL Electric is unable to determine when these events may occur.\n\n## (PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU)\n\nPPL's LKE's, LG&E's and KU's ARO liabilities are primarily related to CCR closure costs. See Note 14 for information on the CCR rule. LG&E also has AROs related to natural gas mains and wells. LG&E's and KU's transmission and distribution lines largely operate under perpetual property easement agreements, which do not generally require restoration upon removal of the property. Therefore, no material AROs are recorded for transmission and distribution assets. For LKE, LG&E and KU, all ARO accretion and depreciation expenses are reclassified as a regulatory asset. ARO regulatory assets associated with certain CCR projects are amortized to expense in accordance with regulatory approvals. For other AROs, at the time of retirement, the related ARO regulatory asset is offset against the associated cost of removal regulatory liability, PP&E and ARO liability. d",

PPL's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance to PPL's management and Board of Directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposf es in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.\n\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in \"Internal Control - Integrated Framework\" (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in \"Internal Control - Integrated Framework\" (2013), our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective December 31, 2020. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm.",
