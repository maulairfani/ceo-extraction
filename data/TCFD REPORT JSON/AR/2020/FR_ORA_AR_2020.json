        "page_content": "1 -\n\n## 1.1.4 History\n\nOrange,  formerly  France  Telecom,  is  France's  incumbent telecommunications operator. The Group has its origins in the Ministry for Mail, Telegraphs and Telephone, later to become the General Directorate of Telecommunications, which in 1990 was accorded the status of independent public entity and, on January 1, 1991, renamed France Telecom. On December 31, 1996, France Telecom became a soci\u00e9t\u00e9 anonyme (limited  company).  In  October  1997, France Telecom shares were listed on the Paris and New York stock exchanges, allowing the French government the disposal of 25% of  its  shares  to  the  public  and  Group  employees.  Subsequently, the public sector gradually reduced its holding to 53%. The law of December 31, 2003 authorized the transfer of the Company to the private sector and between 2004 and 2008 the public sector sold a further 26% of the capital, and then again 4% in 2014 and 2015. On December 31, 2020, the French State retained 22.95% of the share capital, held either directly or jointly with Bpifrance Participations.\n\nFrance Telecom's area of activity and its regulatory and competitive environment have undergone significant changes since the 1990s. In a context of increased deregulation and competition, the Group has, over that period, undertaken several strategic investments, in particular the acquisition of the mobile operator Orange Plc and its brand created in 1994, and the acquisition of a controlling stake in Poland's incumbent operator, Telekomunikacja Polska.\n\nSince  2005,  the  Group  has  expanded  strategically  in  Spain  by acquiring the mobile operator Amena, then in 2015 the fixed-line operator Jazztel.\n\nOver the l a s t  fi f t e e n  y e a r s ,  t h e  G r o u p  h a s  p u r s u e d  a  p o l i c y  o f  s e l e c t i v e , value-creating  acquisitions  by  concentrating  on  the  markets  in which it is already present. Mainly targeting the emerging markets of Africa and the Middle East where the Group is historically present (in  particular  Cameroon,  C\u00f4te  d'Ivoire,  Guinea,  Jordan,  Mali  and Senegal), this strategy was implemented through the acquisition of Mobinil in Egypt (2010) and of M\u00e9ditel in Morocco (2015) and more recently  by  the  acquisition  of  a  number  of  African  operators  (in\n\nLiberia, Burkina Faso, Sierra Leone and the Democratic Republic of the Congo) (2016).\n\nIt  also  resulted  in  the  joint  venture  with  Deutsche  Telekom  that combined UK activities under the EE brand (2010) followed by the disposal of EE in 2016, as well as the disposal of Orange Suisse (2012),  Orange  Dominicana  (2014),  Orange  Armenia  (2015)  and Telkom Kenya (2016).\n\nAs part of its corporate services and since the acquisition of Equant in  2000,  Orange  has  been  pursuing  its  strategy  of  becoming  a global player in digital transformation and has accelerated its shift to services through a number of targeted acquisitions, notably in the fields of cyber security and Cloud services, such as those of Business & Decision and Basefarm in 2018 and SecureLink and SecureData in 2019.\n\nBusiness diversifi c ati o n i s  o n e  o f  t h e  m a j o r  p i l l a r s  o f  O r a n g e 's  s t r a t e g y. The acquisition of Groupama Banque, now Orange Bank, in 2016, which launched its new banking offer in November 2017, illustrates the goal of diversifying into the mobile financial services sector.\n\nIn  2006,  Orange  became  the  Group's  main  brand  for  Internet, television and mobile telephony services in the majority of countries where it operated, most importantly France and Spain. In 2013, the Company adopted the Orange name, offering the full range of its telephony services in France under the Orange brand. This policy continued with the adoption of the Orange brand by Telekomunikacja Polska in 2013, by Mobinil in Egypt, Mobistar in Belgium and M\u00e9ditel in Morocco in 2016, and by several of the Group's subsidiaries in Africa in 2017. Corporate services in the world are offered primarily under the brand Orange Business Services.\n\nIn  December  2019,  the  Group  presented  its  new  strategic  plan, Engage 2025, which looks to reinvent its operator model, guided by exemplary social and environmental conduct. For more information on Orange's strategic plan and its business model, see Section 1.2 Market, strategy and business model.\n\n## 1.2 Market, strategy and business model\n\n## 1.2.1 The global digital services market\n\nThe digital services market is a subsector of the broader Information and  Communication  Technologies  (ICT)  sector.  It  combines  IT services  and  software,  telecom  services,  digital  content  TV  and video services, and Internet services. However, it does not include network  equipment  or  telecommunication  devices (1) .  The  digital services market offers significant sources of value creation through the  spread  of  new  services  and  new  uses.  It  has  been  a  vital component  of  the  economy  since  the  start  of  the  health  crisis. Digital technology has become essential to maintaining economic activity and social ties (widespread use of telework during periods of lockdown, maintenance of essential services, entertainment, etc.).\n\nIn 2020, the global digital services market amounted to 3,630 billion euros. The Covid-19 pandemic had a significant impact on market trends,  leaving  it  down  0.8%  over  the  year  (instead  of  the  5.4% growth projected in pre-Covid forecasts). The impact varied greatly from one sector to another. The IT services market, for instance, experienced a sharp drop of 4.8% (compared with projected growth of 7.2% before the pandemic), whereas the impact was close to zero on revenues from telecom services, which remained more or less flat (+0.6%) at 1,161 billion euros. The numbers were more mixed for Internet services (+4.7%) and content services (+0.7%), where strong pressure on advertising revenues was offset by huge demand for entertainment services and e-commerce (2) .  For  a  presentation  of the global business services market, see Section 1.4.5 Enterprise.",

Europe is losing ground, with 23% of the global market, while Africa and the Middle East (4.7%) and Latin America (4.8%) together account for nearly 10%. In Africa and the Middle East, digital market growth is estimated at 2.3% in 2020 (compared with 5.3% in pre-Covid-19 estimates).\n\nThe impact of the Covid-19 pandemic has varied from one region to another. Europe, and even more so North America, have been badly affected, with differences of 7.3 and 8.2 percentage points respectively between pre-Covid forecasts for 2020 and the current IDATE projections, whereas Asia-Pacific lost only 3.3 points between t h e  t w o  m e a s u r e s  -  p r o b a b l y  r e fl e c t i n g  a n  e a r l i e r  r e c o v e r y,  p a r t i c u l a r l y in China. In Africa and the Middle East, the gap is limited to 3 points - and just under 2 points in the region's telecom markets only.\n\nWith Africa projected to account for 25% of the world's population in 2050, up from 17% in 2020, the potential of the Africa and Middle East region, where the Orange group has a broad footprint, is huge.\n\nAccording to the GSMA report, The Mobile Economy, Sub-Saharan Africa  2020,  the  Covid-19  pandemic  has  demonstrated  the importance of a strong and inclusive digital economy, supported by universal access to a fast and reliable Internet network and a range of digital services, for individuals and businesses alike. And with nearly 800 million people in the region still not connected to the mobile I n t e r n e t ,  b r i d g i n g  t h e  d i g i t a l  d i v i d e  h a s  n e v e r  b e e n  m o r e  p r e s s i n g .  T h e report states that 45% of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa had subscribed to mobile services by the end of 2019. That percentage is expected to reach 50% by 2025. In absolute terms, the number of subscribers is set to reach 500 million in 2021 and the number of mobile connections 1 billion in 2024, with a penetration rate of 50% of the population by 2025. Africa thus remains a region of strong growth in connectivity and digital services (2) .\n\n## Key social and environmental trends for 2025\n\nAt  t h e  d e m o g r a p h i c  l e v e l ,  a  d r a m a t i c  i n c r e a s e  i n  t h e  A f r i c a n  p o p u l a t i o n is expected in the coming years as large numbers of young people will reach adult age.\n\nWith the increase in the number of extreme weather and climatic events, the immediate impacts of climate change have become more tangible. The tech industry, which consumes a great amount of data, is directly concerned: the boom in data could account for nearly 20% of global electricity consumption by 2025 (source: ICT Footprint EU,\n\nEuropean Framework Initiative for Energy & Environmental Efficiency in the ICT Sector). However, digital technology is also a tool for the energy transition, because it provides other sectors with innovative solutions to reduce their environmental impact (mobility, industry, a g r i c u l t u r e ,  h o u s i n g ,  e n e r g y ) .  I n  t h e  y e a r s  t o  2 0 2 5 ,  m a j o r  t e c h n o l o g i c a l developments (AI, Data, Cloud, 5G, etc.) are poised to transform all business sectors, affecting professions across the board and laying down new skills and expertise challenges to businesses.\n\n## Key changes in telecom services\n\n## Network development and growth in telecommunication uses worldwide\n\nWhile Internet access networks are expanding mainly through the rollout of mobile 4G networks in Africa and the Middle East, network investments in Europe are focused on very high-speed broadband access,  with  the  development  of  fiber  in  the  fixed-line  segment, improved  performance  of  4G  mobile  networks  and  commercial l aunches of 5G. At the same time, operators are constantly upgrading their networks in a bid to make them more agile and easier to manage (through the virtualization of network functions and automation), and to optimize their value through pooling.\n\nConstraints  related  to  the  pandemic  (lockdown  measures, widespread telework, heightened need for cybersecurity) have greatly accelerated the take-up of new uses accessible via a multiplicity of screens (computers, smartphones, tablets, connected TV), thanks to  the  resilience  and  increased  capacity  of  existing  networks and the penetration  of  smartphones.  Lastly,  the  development  of 5G technology has prompted the emergence of new use cases, both for companies, for which 5G is already a real breakthrough (optimization  of  production  times,  remote  control  of  machines, predictive maintenance, etc.), and for the general public (immersive videos, Cloud gaming).\n\n## Consumer and company expectations\n\nThe health crisis and global lockdown have turned connectivity into a v i t a l  n e e d .  M o r e  t h a n  s i m p l y  p r o v i d i n g  s e r v i c e s  f o r  d a i l y  l i f e ,  t h e  I n t e r n e t is now essential for individuals to work, eat, look after themselves and maintain social ties, and for companies to ensure their survival or growth, by accelerating their digitization (telework, e-commerce, etc.). With the expansion of telework, business customers now see cybersecurity  as  a  vital  means  of  addressing  the  shifting  types of  attacks  and  phishing  maneuvers.  The  need  for  cybersecurity is  now  critical  for  people,  companies  and  governments.  Gartner sees the cybersecurity market representing 186 billion US dollars in 2024 (source: Gartner - Forecast: Information Security and Risk Management Worldwide, July 2020).\n\nMore than ever, customers expect quality coverage and continuous network  reliability  everywhere,  but  also  the  protection  of  their personal data based on a relationship of trust with their operator. On top of those expectations, society is increasingly demanding greater transparency from companies, more commitment in respect of major environmental and social issues, and a greater presence in the regions and other areas.\n\n## Transformation of the telecom industry\n\nAgainst this new backdrop, the transformation of the telecom industry has gathered pace. OTT players have continued to gain ground, and are more than ever leveraging the digital services they offer in the B2C and B2B markets. They have become increasingly important, particularly  in  communication  services  for  companies  (telework), e-commerce and entertainment. Moreover, the major digital players are  speeding  up  the  development  of  their  own  infrastructure  by building new Data centers and international networks that they are promoting in the B2B and wholesale markets.\n\n- 1\n\n1",

This  imposes  significant financial  constraints  on  the  entire  industry,  leading  operators  to\n\n## 1.2.2 The Orange group strategy\n\nThe  Engage  2025  strategic  plan,  which  combines  growth  and responsibility, is based on an environmental and social commitment and four ambitions:\n\n- 1. Reinventing Orange's operator model;\n- 2. Accelerating in growth areas;\n- 3. Placing data and AI at the heart of the innovation model;\n- 4. Co-creating a future-facing company.\n\nIn this plan for 2025, launched in December 2019, Orange has for the first time made the clear and committed choice to place its social responsibility at the heart of its strategic vision. With Engage 2025, the Group aims to play its part in building a more sustainable and inclusive world by focusing its CSR initiatives on two main areas: the fight against global warming and digital exclusion.\n\n## A strong commitment guided by social and environmental responsibility\n\nThe Group has adopted a business model that is committed and accountable to its employees, its customers and society as a whole. And it is giving itself the resources to finance its environmental and social plans with the completion of an inaugural 500 million euro sustainable bond issue in September 2020 and the announcement that some of the 2.2 billion euros in funding received in December will be used to ramp up a number of projects including the rollout of  Orange Digital Centers and the financing of carbon sinks (see Section 1.3 Significant events).\n\n## Commitment to inclusion\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has confirmed the pressing need for this commitment, as the economic crisis is likely to exacerbate inequalities in access to digital technology. In addition to its ambitions for the digital coverage of regional areas, Orange trains and supports the digitally  excluded so that everybody can reap the benefits of the digital revolution. The Group has thus opened its first three Orange Digital Centers to promote more inclusive digital uses. Since June 15, 2020, Orange Polska has been holding free webinars on the digital world for th e e l d e r l y  w i t h  t h e  S e n i o r  E c o n o m y  I n s t i t u t e  i n  P o l a n d .  A f t e r gigas solidarios in Spain, and the coup de pouce offer in France, a new offer for low-income households, Tarifa social, was launched in Spain in September. 2020 also saw Orange join forces with Google to launch the Orange Sanza Touch, the most affordable advanced Android 4G smartphone on the market, thereby improving access to the mobile Internet in Africa.\n\n## Environmental commitment\n\nIn response to the challenge of climate change, the Group has set itself the goal of bringing forward the GSMA objectives by 10 years, reaching Net Zero Carbon (1) by 2040, despite the surge in network data,  which  has  been  compounded  by  the  health  crisis.  To  that end, the Group is making unprecedented efforts to improve energy efficiency, increase the use of renewable energies and adopt circular economy principles. In July 2020, Orange signed its first renewable electricity  purchase  agreement  in  France  with  Boralex  Europe,\n\nmake structuring decisions in their choice of telecom infrastructure. To better capitalize on them, operators will have to further pool or share their networks, and even sell part or all of their infrastructure to financial funds and/or infrastructure companies.\n\nthe  leading  independent  French  producer  of  onshore  wind  (see Section 1.3 Significant events). In September, with its 're' program in France, the Group undertook to recycle, return and recondition mobile phones. Lastly, Orange Polska has launched a pilot project to monitor air quality in schools, completed the Warsaw Data Hub, a new data center built to demanding safety standards and equipped with the latest technologies and sustainable solutions, and installed two wind farms near Pozna\u0144 to supply itself with clean energy. Since 2015, the Group has reduced its CO2 emissions by 12%.\n\nFor more information, see Section 2.2.4.4.1 Orange's environmental commitment.\n\n## Four bold ambitions to tackle a changing ecosystem\n\n## Reinventing its operator model by capitalizing on its leading position in networks\n\nDespite  the  effects  of  an  unprecedented  health  and  economic crisis, Orange has begun rolling out its Engage 2025 strategic plan, demonstrating the robustness of its networks and its resilience in all of its markets. During the crisis, society's increasing digitization allowed Orange customers to continue to work, play, train, learn and stay in touch, highlighting the value of the Group's networks. At the end of 2020, Orange's mobile network was ranked by Arcep as the best in mainland France for the tenth consecutive year, and the best in rural areas in France (see Section 1.3 Significant events).\n\nIn 2020, the Group stepped up the rollout of its fixed and mobile broadband  networks,  benefiting  from  joint  funding  of  the  fiber network in France driven by a health environment making the quality of connectivity more essential than ever. Whether through its own infrastructure or the use of third-party networks, Orange aims to be able to offer its FTTH packages to more than 65 million households in  Europe  by  2023,  thereby  entrenching  its  leadership  in  fiber  in Europe. See Section 1.3 Significant events.\n\nIn  November,  Orange  acquired  54%  of  Telekom  Romania Communications, Romania's second-largest fixed-line operator, a major step towards becoming the leading convergent player in that country (see Section 1.3 Significant events).\n\n## Faster digital development for regional communities\n\nThe  Group  continues  to  improve  mobile  coverage  in  France:  in 2020, for instance, thousands of kilometers of motorway and 100% of the metro networks in Paris, Toulouse, Rennes and Lyon were covered by 4G. The agreement signed with Eutelsat in July (see Section 1.3 Significant events) also makes it possible to provide very high-speed satellite broadband throughout France, even in the most remote areas. The creation of Orange Concessions in January 2021 (see below) gives the Group the means to continue to expand fiber networks in rural areas by winning new public initiative networks or by taking part in market consolidation. With the aim of holding more than 4.5 million FTTH connections by 2025, Orange Concessions will be the leading operator of fiber networks in rural areas.",

The Group now offers new services: around the connected home via a partnership in France with Somfy, world leader in the automation of home and building openings and closures, as well as in content. Partnering with Amazon, it launched the Prime Video app on Orange TV in September.

After Romania, the Group launched its 5G offers in Poland, Spain and then France, where it acquired the largest block of spectrum in October 2020 and rolled out its 5G network in Marseille, Toulouse, Nice, Strasbourg and Le Mans in December (160 municipalities by the end of 2020). The technical performance of 5G will allow the emergence of countless use cases. For  the  general  public,  the  immersive  and  personalized  videos displayed at the French Open in September foreshadow what can be expected at similar events in the future. For companies, 5G is an accelerator  of  digital  transformation,  helping  optimize  production times, facilitating remote machine control and promoting predictive maintenance. In France, the Group is testing the industrial uses of 5G on two factory  of  the  future  projects  with  Schneider  Electric (Eure) and Lacroix Group (Maine-et-Loire). On the Orange Industry 4.0 Campus in the port of Antwerp (Belgium), it is testing network slicing (prioritizing certain parts of the network to cover critical uses or specific needs). For more information on 5G, see Section 1.6.1 Research and innovation.\n\nLastly, the Group is intensifying its investments to develop national and  international  networks  and  extract  value  from  them  on  the wholesale market. In July, Orange Wholesale France was the first wholesale  operator  in  France  to  offer  the  eSIM  (see  Section  1.3 Significant events). In July, the Group also launched the Montblanc Summit 2+ cellular watch, a pioneer in eSIM connectivity with Wear OS by Google.\n\nIn Africa, Orange has invested in facilitating access to connectivity for operators and companies by supporting the 'One Africa Network' project and building a new secure international backbone linking eight West African countries. Lastly, Orange is the majority investor in  more  than  40  submarine  cables.  In  February  2020,  it  joined forces  with  a  Telef\u00f3nica  subsidiary  to  extend  the  terrestrial  links of  Google's  Dunant  transatlantic  cable;  in  May,  it  partnered  with international and African players on 2Africa, the innovative submarine cable linking 23 countries in Africa, the Middle East and Europe. It  also  launched  the  Urbano  Monti,  its  new  vessel  dedicated  to laying submarine cables. The Group is also helping improve access to quality content delivery services in Africa by providing its CDN content delivery solution (which replaces satellite broadcasting) to C\u00f4te Ouest Audiovisuel, a leading content provider in West Africa. See Section 1.3 Significant events.\n\n## Monetization of the networks and execution of the infrastructure strategy\n\nTo d e v e l o p  i t s  n e t w o r k s  w h i l e  k e e p i n g  a  r e i n  o n  i t s  i n v e s t m e n t s ,  O r a n g e is reinventing its business model. Acknowledging the transformation of  t h e  t e l e c o m  i n d u s t r y  i n  E u r o p e ,  O r a n g e  i s  e n t r e n c h i n g  i t s  l e a d e r s h i p in more open and better valued infrastructure, while retaining control of its strategic assets. For its FTTH infrastructure, Orange continues to invest in its own infrastructure, in order to fulfill its commitments outside  of  very  densely  populated  areas  (especially  in  France), while working with partners to pursue industrial efforts in certain areas. The Group has thus launched the projects needed to set up\n\nFiberCos in rural areas in both France and Poland. In France, the Group took a step forward in the development of its infrastructure in January 2021 by partnering with long-term investors Banque des Territoires (Caisse des d\u00e9p\u00f4ts), CNP Assurances and EDF Invest to create Orange Concessions (see above and Section 1.3 Significant events - Optimization, development et valorization of infrastructure).\n\nIn addition, co-financing of fiber optic networks in France by other operators is expected to continue in the coming years. It is clearly a means of making investments profitable.\n\nOrange  can  now  seize  potential  opportunities  to  develop  or consolidate its positions in this market. It anticipates the signing of agreements in the first half of 2021, with a view to creating dedicated structures that will be up and running in both France and Poland in 2021.\n\nTo optimize the rollout of its mobile infrastructure, particularly in 5G, in  terms  of  pace,  coverage  and  financial  capacity,  Orange  plans to  rely  on  RAN-sharing  agreements,  while  maintaining  areas  of differentiation, in keeping with the agreements already existing in Poland and Romania, and those signed in 2019 in Spain and Belgium.\n\nAt the same time, to better understand and extract value from the 40,000 towers of its own mobile network in Europe, the Group has launched its European TowerCo plans. In February 2021, Orange took a major step forward in its Engage 2025 strategic plan with the creation of its European TowerCo TOTEM, which will initially operate around 25,500 sites in France and Spain. See section 1.3 Significant events - Optimization, development and valorization of infrastructure.\n\n## Accelerating its development in three growth areas: Africa and the Middle East, B2B services and financial services\n\n## Making Orange the benchmark digital operator in Africa and the Middle East\n\nOrange has considerably expanded its activities in Africa and the Middle East, where its operations go back more than 20 years: the Africa and Middle East region has more than doubled its contribution to the Group's revenue in 10 years. In January 2020, Orange set up t h e  n e w  h e a d q u a r t e r s  o f  i t s  s u b s i d i a r y  O r a n g e  M i d d l e  E a s t  a n d  A f r i c a in Morocco, thereby confirming its commitment to Africa, with the aim of becoming the benchmark digital operator in Africa and the Middle East. The Group's target for the 2020-2023 period is average annual revenue growth (CAGR) of approximately 5% across the region.\n\nIt  aims  to  achieve  that  target  by  virtue  of  growth  in  mobile  data driven by the increase in the smartphone penetration rate and the rollout of 4G. At the end of 2020, the 4G network covered 33 million customers,  an  increase  of  39%  over  the  year,  out  of  a  total  of 128 million mobile customers. In 2020, Orange will thus have rolled out 4G in almost all countries, using RAN-sharing agreements and innovative  technologies  (lighter  masts  for  example)  to  extend  its coverage in rural areas. At the same time, the Group is pursuing its multi-service strategy, with the development of content, e-health and energy offers. The aim is for these services to account for 20% of  regional  revenue  by  2025.  In  September,  it  launched  Orange Campus  Africa,  the  new  African  e-learning  platform.  That  was followed in November by a partnership with Greenlight Planet, the largest provider of prepaid energy services, to provide customers with clean energy solutions in several African countries.\n\n## Financial services in the MEA region\n\nConfirming the Group's ranking as a major player in mobile money in Africa and the Middle East, Orange Money was rolled out in Jordan (where 70% of the population is unbanked) in January 2020, and then Morocco in March. In May 2020, two new money transfer corridors via Orange Money were opened from France to Burkina Faso and Morocco, after C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Guinea, Madagascar and Mali.\n\n- 1\n\n1",

New for Orange in Africa, the banking activity is part of the Group's multi-service operator strategy, and confirms its  determination  to  facilitate  access  to  financial  services  and strengthen  the  financial  inclusion  of  populations  in  West  Africa, offering customers a fully digital credit and savings offer.\n\nI n  fi n a n c i a l  s e r v i c e s ,  O r a n g e  M o n e y ' s  g o a l  i s  t o  g e n e r a t e  a p p r o x i m a t e l y 900 million euros in revenue by 2023 and at the same time to continue developing content, e-health and energy offers. The Group plans to achieve average annual revenue growth (CAGR) of around 5% across the region between 2020 and 2023.\n\n## Accelerating the development of IT services for B2B customers and scaling up cybersecurity\n\nDuring the Covid crisis, digital technology in general and Orange's networks in particular helped ensure the continuity of economic life by supporting initiatives by companies and public authorities. The crisis has also opened up opportunities stemming from the acceleration of the digital transformation of companies, in line with Orange's B2B strategy of opening up to IT businesses and services. It focuses on  four  categories  of  services  related  to  our  legacy  business  as an operator (Cloud services, cybersecurity, digital and data, smart mobility), as well as four priority sectors, namely health, industry, automotive and smart cities. In 2020, IT services accounted for more than 39% of Orange Business Services revenue.\n\nFaced with unprecedented demand since March 2020, Orange is helping VSEs and SMEs with the development of new digital solutions for e-commerce and the digitization of strategic business processes. In October, Orange Business Services merged its activities into a Health division within its Enovacom subsidiary. In November, Orange Business Services signed a strategic global partnership agreement with Amazon Web Services to help companies accelerate their digital transformation and leverage the benefits of the Cloud to adapt more quickly to market developments and user needs. KDDI, a Japanese telecommunication services provider, has chosen Orange Business Services to equip more than 1 million vehicles in 63 countries and regions in Europe with connected device services. Orange Business Services ranked among the leaders in the March 2020 edition of the Gartner Institute's Magic Quadrant for Global Net work Ser vices for its more flexible SD-WAN customer projects, and its smart end-to-end multi-cloud, multi-service and multi-access networks.\n\nCybersecurity is a fast-growing sector. Its new organization (which includes the acquisitions of SecureLink and Secure Data in 2019) under the Orange Cyberdefense (OCD) brand has seen the Group provide assistance to some 50 French healthcare establishments, which were a prime target of cybercriminals when the health crisis peaked between March and June 2020. It has also supported its business customers in the face of the increase in the number of cyberattacks and phishing maneuvers. The spread of telework has made cybersecurity a core concern for most companies, prompting the shift to a fresh approach. The Group aims to exceed 1 billion euros in revenue and to be the European leader in this area in 2023.\n\nT h e  G r o u p 's  t a r g e t  i s  t h a t  m o r e  t h a n  h a l f  o f  i t s  r e v e n u e  i n  t h e  E n t e r p r i s e segment comes from new connectivity services (SD-WAN, 5G) and IT services in 2023.\n\n## Continuing its expansion in financial services across its footprint\n\nThe Engage 2025 strategic plan underscores Orange's determination to accelerate its growth in financial services. The pertinence of its growth path is backed up by the push towards digitization across all sectors on the back of the health crisis.\n\nThe Group aims to capitalize on the success of Orange Bank in European countries, and of Orange Money in Africa where demand\n\nin countries with limited banking access is very strong. Orange Bank now extends out of France and into Spain, highlighting the strategy of  expanding  into  other  European  countries.  In  order  to  support this phase of development, the Group is looking for a new banking partner  to  possibly  replace  Groupama:  a  partner  who  shares  its ambitions, contributes to the industrial project, and is likely to provide its expertise and possibly its assets.\n\nThe Group's multi-service diversification around payments, credit and i nsurance is under way. The July 2020 acquisition of Orange Cour tage made Orange Bank an insurance broker. With BNP Paribas Cardif, it now offers insurance covering smartphones, tablets and connected devices. In November 2019, Orange Bank partnered with Wirecard to offer a practical mobile payment solution with Google Pay for all Android users in France. To mark its third anniversary, Orange Bank launched an innovative offer for families, featuring new-generation cards for the secure and autonomous management of children's pocket money. Orange Bank has also gained a foothold in the VSE/ SME market with the acquisition of Anytime, a neobank dedicated to the needs of professionals, companies and associations. Lastly, in Romania, Orange Money has launched its currency transfer service to all types of accounts in Romania or internationally.\n\nOrange Bank aims to break even in Europe towards the end of 2023, with nearly 5 million customers and around 400 million euros in net banking income. Orange Bank Africa aims to have nearly 10 million customers by 2023, with NBI of about 100 million euros.\n\n## Crossing a new milestone in its digital transformation by placing AI and data at the heart of its innovation model\n\nThe Covid crisis has demonstrated Orange's ability to move very quickly on the digitization of certain processes and to step up the pace  of  its  transformation.  By  combining  digital  resources  and human  interaction,  the  Group  uses  new  technologies  to  offer  a simple, expert and responsible customer experience. It is based on  digital  acceleration  (chatbots,  robotic  process  automation) combined with the redesign of stores as Smart Stores, essential for customer proximity. Orange aims to increase the share of the digital channel in its day-to-day relationship with its customers, and to  reduce the number of contacts with call centers in Europe by 55% by 2023. In December 2020, Orange Polska became the first entity to receive Customer Operations Performance Center (COPC) 'Operational  Excellence'  certification  for  the  improvement  of  its operational  efficiency  and  quality  of  service.  In  May,  the  Orange Fixbox, which allows our Tunisian customers to benefit from unlimited Internet access at home, was voted 2020 Product of the Year in the 'Broadband Internet' category. Building on more streamlined customer journeys and better customer insight, the Group is aiming to  have  nine  out  of  ten  customers  recommend  Orange  in  all  its countries by 2025. It also hopes to double the number of users of the My Orange app by 2023, bringing the number of users to nearly 50 million.\n\nIn 2020, research and innovation activities were reorganized on three pillars:  guaranteeing  the  quality  and  availability  of  networks  and services, shedding light on developments in the digital world and the Group's vision, and creating value by prioritizing innovation choices as close as possible to its markets. Orange has accordingly revisited the development strategy for Djingo, its voice interface, by stopping the marketing of the speaker in an overly crowded market. At the same time, the Group plans to use the embedded voice recognition technology to develop new services in the world of the connected home. In July 2020, Orange and Google Cloud announced a strategic co-innovation  partnership  to  accelerate  Orange's  IT  and  digital transformation and develop new Cloud services, particularly in edge computing (i.e. services located as close as possible to customers' processing needs).",

        "page_content": "In addition, in 2021, Orange strengthened its innovation in the digital ecosystem  and  venture  capital  investment  by  creating  Orange Ventures, a new investment firm with a budget of 350 million euros that ranks as one of the ten largest corporate venture capital funds in Europe. Orange has partnered with Sanofi, Capgemini and Generali to create a unique e-health ecosystem in Europe to accelerate the development of practical solutions for patients. The Group is also teaming up with the national cybersecurity agency, Atos, Thales and Capgemini, and plans to join the Cyber Campus project initiated by the President of the French Republic to bring together the main national and international players in the field, which is scheduled to open in October 2021.\n\n## Smarter networks and improved operational efficiency\n\nThe Group uses AI and Data to optimize the rollout of new mobile and fiber sites, and to facilitate the maintenance of its networks, back office and internal processes, thereby reducing costs and improving quality of service.\n\nTo  harness  the  full  potential  of  new  technologies,  Orange  keeps a  close  eye  on  the  digital  ecosystem,  giving  its  venture  capital entity the capacity to invest in the future champions of the digital economy  in  Europe,  Africa  and  the  Middle  East.  In  December 2019,  Orange  Ventures  invested  in  InterCloud,  a  leader  in  Cloud application  interconnection,  to  support  its  European  leadership in  Cloud  interconnection,  then  in  native  Cloud  service  provider Weaveworks to help drive the take-up of its GitOps solution in B2B and telecom markets. As global telecom operators prepare to deliver 5G applications and services reliably and on a large scale, GitOps is  facilitating  the  shift  to  native  Cloud  Computing.  Orange  Digital Ventures Africa has launched the MEA Seed Challenge, a new seed i nvestment activit y a i m i n g  t o  f u n d  10 0  s t a r t- u p s  b y  2 0 2 5  i n  C a m e r o o n , C\u00f4te  d'Ivoire,  Egypt,  Jordan,  Morocco,  Senegal  and  Tunisia.  In February, it invested in Ethiopian-based start-up EdTech Gebeya, a pan-African marketplace for the training and placement of African developers to help solve the tech talent shortage, and Youverify, a  Lagos  (Nigeria)  start-up  that  automates  identity  verification  for financial and telecommunication players.\n\n## Creating a future-facing company\n\nThanks to its size and the diversity of its business lines, the Group gives its employees the possibility of improving their skills to keep up with and anticipate market developments, in line with its 'digital and caring' employer promise. To achieve the Group's ambition to be more international, more B2B-oriented and at the cutting edge of new technologies by 2025, Orange has invested more than 1.5 billion euros in a skills enhancement program open to all employees and enhanced the company's attractiveness for new talent while ensuring the social and human consistency of its projects.\n\n## Meeting the skills challenge\n\nThe  context  of  the  health  crisis  makes  new  digital  skills  more necessary  than  ever.  Their  list  includes  technological  expertise, practice and use of data, artificial intelligence (AI) and cybersecurity, plus a broad range of soft skills. The Group plans to use Orange Campus, which has become a networked school for all employees, to train 20,000 employees in network virtualization, artificial intelligence, data, Cloud Computing, coding and cybersecurity. New forms of cooperation,  methods  and  working  environments  are  offered  to Orange  managers  to  foster  cross-cutting  approaches,  promote empowerment and cultivate a sense of service. In October, Orange opened  its  own  Apprentice  Training  Center.  Lastly,  the  Group supports the Grande \u00c9cole du Num\u00e9rique, which has trained nearly 28,000 people in the digital professions in France.\n\n## Ranking among the most attractive employers\n\nIn February 2020, Orange featured in the Top Employers Global 2020 rankings for the fifth consecutive year. This certification recognizes the best human resources practices worldwide. The Group is also certified HappyTrainees, a label which rewards the quality and interest of the tasks assigned to interns and work-study students.\n\nThe Group's challenge is reinforced by the scarcity of tech profiles on the job market. In September, Orange launched a recruitment campaign in nine countries under the slogan 'At Orange you can', focusing  on  the  diversity  of  its  jobs  and  career  paths,  and  on reconciling employees' personal and professional aspirations.\n\n## Supporting everyone in a sustainable and responsible transformation\n\nAgainst a backdrop of upheaval in everyday life due to the health crisis, which is prompting us to rethink the meaning of the collective approach and teamwork, as well as the role of telework, the Group is implementing internal initiatives to better support the transformation and ensure a better quality of life at work, and is committed to a more inclusive society.\n\nThe policy and initiatives dating back many years to promote gender equality in the workplace have made Orange a benchmark in this area. Women account for 36% of the Group's overall workforce, and 31% of the net work of managers and senior executives are women. In both France and Poland, Orange promotes access to scientific and technical jobs for women, including in cybersecurity with the Cercle des Femmes de la Cybersecurit\u00e9 (Cefcys). The Group is involved with the Women's Forum on digital tools for economic development in the MEA region. Lastly, Orange was the first company to receive the GEEIS-AI (Gender Equality European & International StandardArtificial  Intelligence)  label,  created  by  the  Arborus  Endowment Fund, confirming its commitment to Artificial Intelligence designed and developed both responsibly and inclusively. In France, Orange employs more than 4,800 people with disabilities, who are supported when they join the company and in ensuring the accessibility of their work environment by more than 120 correspondents.\n\n## A growth ambition accompanied by an operational efficiency program\n\nTo secure the achievement of its objectives, Orange has launched the Scale-Up operational efficiency program, undertaking to achieve net savings of 1 billion euros by 2023 on an indirect cost base at end-2019 of nearly 14 billion euros in telecom activities excluding high revenue growth areas (MEA and IS/IT services at OBS) at the end of 2019. This commitment is based on a combination of targeted initiatives and various measures focused on the levers of digitization, simplification and pooling:\n\n- -the  transformation  plans  undertaken  by  all  relevant  Group entities, and in particular the support functions, since 2019;\n- -targeted cross-functional initiatives, such as:\n- -the optimization of the real estate master plan,\n- -the digitization of the customer relationship with the rollout of robotic process automation (RPA) at Group level,\n- -the automation of network management and maintenance,\n- -smart  spend  for  the  optimization  of  certain  expenses, including  a  plan  to  rein  in  energy  costs,  which  is  a  real challenge for the future.\n\n## Financial objectives\n\nSee Section 3.2.2 Outlook.\n\n- 1\n\n1",

Such is our purpose, which was integrated into the company's Bylaws in 2020. It resonates particularly strongly in the telecommunications industry as it puts people before technology. Everything we do is framed by this purpose, which illustrates how we take account of the social and environmental priorities we share with our stakeholders. Our purpose feeds into the four ambitions of the Engage 2025 strategic plan and our commitment to promote digital equality and protect the planet. This drive and determination were plain to see in our efforts to maintain network availability and service continuity for our customers in France and around the world throughout the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n## Our business model\n\nOur  infrastructure  provides  enhanced  connectivity  for  our  retail, business  and  wholesale  customers.  Indeed,  we  are  offering faster  speeds  by  rolling  out  fiber-optic  broadband  and  5G  while also developing new home offers (content, at-home services and remote  surveillance).  Alongside  Orange  Business  Services,  our unique expertise as both a network operator and digital services integrator  means  we  combine  the  full  range  of  skills  required  to support businesses all along the digital value chain, with on-demand networks  (software-defined  networking  and  network  functions virtualization), multi-cloud services, data analysis, artificial intelligence, smart mobility services and cybersecurity. Orange Cyberdefense represents the Group's frontline force to anticipate cyber threats, develop  preventive  measures  and  take  action.  Through  Orange Money and Orange Bank, we design mobile financial services that\n\nare innovative, secure and well-suited to people's needs and uses in each of our operating countries. At the same time, we optimize and capitalize on our infrastructure by setting up FiberCos in association with long-term investors in Europe to share future fiber roll-outs, and by putting in place network sharing agreements and TowerCos to manage tower sites, facilitating new mobile network management.\n\n## Helping to create value for everyone\n\nThe following pages present the ways in which Orange is able to harness its assets to create value for its stakeholders. Our greatest strength comes from our employees. Their unwavering commitment means we can continue to provide essential services whatever the circumstances. One of the defining changes that occurred in 2020 was the exponential increase of traffic on our networks - a 29% surge in IP traffic - to support the widespread implementation of remote working. Furthermore, Orange bolstered its Open Innovation strategy by creating Orange Ventures, which has a budget of \u20ac350 million to support start-ups through every stage of their development. Our financial solidity, unaffected by the crisis, enabled us to maintain the trust of our lenders, investors and shareholders. Our suppliers and  partners  are  the  first  to  benefit  from  what  we  do,  which  is why we carefully choose who we work with on the basis of strict environmental,  social  and  governance  criteria.  We  collaborate with  them  in  a  responsible  and  ethical  manner,  for  example  by processing  payments  faster  during  the  pandemic  in  an  effort  to support small suppliers. Reducing digital inequality in terms of both access and usage remains one of our top priorities, as is minimizing our  carbon  footprint.  On  average,  our  4G  network  covers  nearly 99% of the population in our eight operating countries in Europe and is expanding in our 17 countries in the Middle East and Africa. Meanwhile, we reduced our CO2 emissions by 2.3% between 2019 and 2020.",

        "page_content": "1 -\n\n## 1.3 Significant events\n\nIn  June 2020, St\u00e9phane Richard, Chairman and CEO of Orange, announced the reorganization of the Group's E xecutive Committee in order to accelerate the implementation of Engage 2025, the Group's new  strategic  plan.  This  reorganization  has  been  effective  since September 1, 2020 (see Section 5.1 Composition of management and supervisory bodies).\n\n## Impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic on the Group's activities and financial position\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic that affected France and the rest of the world in 2020 had an impact on the Group's activities and financial position, as well as its employees, suppliers, subcontractors, customers and all its stakeholders. Against this backdrop, Orange's priorities were, and still are, to ensure the safety of its employees and to support its customers by providing telecommunication services, which have become more essential than ever. At the start of the pandemic, the Group swiftly put in place a number of actions to adapt to the crisis situation, ensure business continuity and reduce the risks posed by the pandemic. In particular, Orange focused its actions on:\n\n- -business continuity. In countries that have been severely affected by  the  pandemic,  Orange  had  to,  and  must  continue,  as  a provider of essential business services, to ensure the continuity of  its  electronic  communications  services,  in  particular  its critical activities. In accordance with government requirements, Orange  has  implemented,  particularly  in  France,  a  business continuity plan and then a business recovery plan essentially covering  network  and  information  system  supervision  and operation teams, security teams, technical support, data center employees and field-work teams. Neither Orange SA nor most of its subsidiaries in France and worldwide have made use of the special furlough schemes in place during the health crisis.\n\nMoreover,  the  Group  enhanced  the  capacity  of  its  networks and put in place supervision and security measures to cope with the additional load caused by the increase in traffic linked to  the  crisis  and  the  potential  increase  in  cyberattacks.  The quality  and  resilience  of  Orange's  networks  absorbed  the sharp  growth  in  traffic  and  usage.  The  combination  of  fiber, 4G and fixed service-based WiFi networks proved effective in allowing the Group's customers to receive a reliable, efficient service, thus demonstrating the relevance of Orange's strategy concerning  large-scale  investment  in  high-quality  fixed  and mobile broadband networks;\n\n- -health and human safety. Orange puts the health and safety of  its  employees first.  A  coordinator  was appointed to report directly to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer on global developments. Local correspondents were also appointed in the  Group's  different  geographical  regions.  Orange's  activity in the various countries was adapted to comply with the health guidance issued by each government, while ensuring business continuity.  Teleworking  was  widely  adopted  throughout  the Group (around 100,000 employees during the first lockdown), all  locations  combined.  Orange  also  encouraged  shielding measures as early as possible in its instructions to employees and  provided  suitable  personal  protective  equipment  and hygiene supplies;\n- -the launch of specific actions to show solidarity with customers, health workers, teaching professionals and public authorities, and heightened internal and external communication.\n\nThe  consequences  of  the  Covid-19  pandemic  on  the  Group's business and financial position are not easily quantifiable, as these effects are difficult to separate from other development factors (see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). However, in 2020, the main effects of the Covid-19 pandemic were as follows:\n\n## -on the Group's revenue:\n\n- -a  widespread  and  significant  decline  in  revenues  from international roaming (customers and visitors), in all countries and particularly for B2B services, due to travel restrictions and border closures,\n- -a sharp fall in equipment sales (B2C and B2B customers), mainly in France and in Europe, due to the closure of Orange stores during the lockdown in spring 2020 and the lower footfall due to mobility restrictions,\n- -lower-than-expected growth in revenues from fixed services to carriers, due to the slowdown in the construction of public initiative networks marketed, rolled out and operated by Orange in France, despite the partial catch-up in the second half of 2020,\n- -a slowdown in the B2B services activity, with a decline in revenues from IT & integration services in the second and third quarters of 2020 and, on an ancillary basis, of some data services (satellite TV broadcasting) not offset by the growth of some voice services (audioconferencing), and\n- -a general decline in sales activity, due in particular to the closure  of  Orange  stores,  and  in  some  countries,  to  a r e s t r i c t i o n  o n  p o r t a b i l i t y  a n d  a  b a n  o n  a d v e r t i s i n g  c a m p a i g n s , partially offset by lower churn rates overall;\n- -on the operating expenses included in the calculation of the Group's EBITDAaL:\n- -an i n c r e a s e  o f  14 4  m i l l i o n  e u r o s  i n  i m p a i r m e n t s  a n d  l o s s e s  o n trade receivables (see Notes 5.3 and 6.2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), of which 129 million euros related to telecom activities (mainly in France and Spain and for B2B services) and 15 million euros related to Orange Bank. It should be noted that the Covid-19 health crisis has resulted in the provision of economic support measures for companies and individuals in a number of countries. Such measures have  helped  to  partially  reduce  the  risk  of  non-recovery of  trade  receivables  at  December  31,  2020,  but  reduce visibility as to the magnitude of the expected deterioration of the economic environment (including the risk of corporate default),\n- -an  increase  in  external  purchases  (mainly  other  external purchases)  primarily  related  to  (i)  the  costs  of  health measures for 72 million  euros,  (ii)  the  additional  costs  of support measures for some network service providers in France (in order to maintain the activity and offset a portion of their fixed costs) for 19 million euros (see also the effects of  the  Covid-19  pandemic  on  investments  below),  and (iii) donations and philanthropic activities for 9 million euros,\n- -a 10 million euro increase in labor expenses with the payment to  some  employees  of  specific  bonuses  in  connection with  the  health  crisis,  including  bonuses  for  committed employees  who  continued  working  on  site  (internal  or external to Orange), and",

        "page_content": "- -conversely, (i) a significant decline in commercial expenses and equipment costs, with the decrease in purchases of handsets and other products sold, the fall in advertising and promotion  expenses,  and  lower  distribution  commission caused by the downturn in sales activit y, and (ii ) a re d u c ti o n i n overheads, mainly due to travel savings and the cancellation of various events.\n\nIn fiscal year 2020, an amount of 253 million euros was recognized for the main specific additional costs generated by management of the Covid-19 health crisis (see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\n## -on the Group's investments:\n\n- -a significant inflection in investments in the first half of 2020 due to the slowdown in fixed (FTTH) and mobile network rollout during lockdown periods. This continued after each lockdown  had  been  lifted  owing  to  the  measures  and restrictions imposed by the health crisis and the shutdown of several economic sectors. However, in view of the Group's initial forecasts, some of the delays in rollout were made up for in the second half of 2020, particularly in France (see Investments in networks below),\n- -a delay in some structural projects for the Group, such as Orange Concessions, which aims to (i) consolidate the FTTH connections  of  public  initiative  networks  (PIN)  belonging to local authorities in France and for which Orange is the concession  holder,  and  (ii)  take  advantage  of  potential development or consolidation opportunities in this market (see below and section 3.1.2.5.3 Investment projects),\n- -the  recognition  of  additional  costs  related  to  support measures for some network providers in France for 24 million euros (see also the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on external purchases above), and\n- -modifications  or  temporary  delays  in  the  5G  licensing process, particularly in France, Spain and Poland;\n\n## -on organic cash flow from telecom activities:\n\nIn 2020, organic cash flow from telecom activities was impacted by (i) changes in EBITDAaL and economic CAPEX in the context of the Covid-19 health crisis (see above), (ii) the favorable effect of the increase in the level of investments at the end of 2020 (compared  to  the  end  of  2019)  on  economic  CAPEX  trade payables, in particular due to efforts made to catch up on rollout delays caused by the Covid-19 health crisis, and (iii) conversely, the unfavorable effect of the change in working capital (increase in gross trade receivables, decrease in trade payables for other goods and services. See Notes 5.3 and 6.6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\n## -on cash flow and financial debt management:\n\nIn 2020, the Covid-19 health crisis had no impact on the risk management  policy  relating  to  financial  instruments.  The Group therefore continued to put in place and manage hedging instruments in order to limit its exposure to operational and financial interest rate and foreign exchange risks. Existing cash flow  hedges,  in  particular,  were  not  affected  by  the  crisis.  In addition, the Group maintained a diversified financing policy (see Notes 13.5 and 13.6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The financing transactions carried out in 2020 are part of the Orange group's active refinancing policy, aimed at the prudent and forward-looking management of its liquidity by optimizing the cost of its resources and maintaining a high level of cash. As of December 31, 2020, the liquidity position of the telecom activities amounted to 17,243 million euros (see Note 14.3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\n## -on the value of the Group's goodwill and fixed assets:\n\nAt December 31, 2020, the Group reviewed the key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amounts of cash-generating units  (CGUs).  Those  assumptions  include  the  impact  of  the Covid-19  pandemic  on  discount  rates  and  perpetual  growth rates, as well as on business plan trajectories. As a result of this work, the Group did not recognize any impairment losses at December 31, 2020 (see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\n## -on the Orange dividend:\n\nDue to the uncertainties generated by the Covid-19 health crisis, the Orange Shareholders' Meeting of May 19, 2020 decided, on the proposal of the Board of Directors, to distribute a dividend for the 2019 fiscal year of 0.50 euros per share, instead of the previously announced 0.70 euros per share. In view of the interim dividend of 0.30 euros per share paid in December 2019, the balance of the cash dividend paid in June 2020 was 0.20 euros p e r  s h a r e  ( s e e  N o t e  1 5 . 3  t o  t h e  C o n s o l i d a t e d  F i n a n c i a l  S t a t e m e n t s and section 6.3 Dividend distribution policy).\n\nBeyond the health crisis, the Group launched a plan to prioritize digital inclusion, with the aim of continual improvement in networks and acceleration of digitalization. Fixed and mobile networks, network access sharing agreements and optimized network management, which were already part of Orange's core strategy, are and remain major priorities  for  the  Group.  Moreover,  Orange  is  keen  to  help accelerate the digitalization of its customers and to focus on the house/home with more relevant strategic choices. In addition, the Group's objective is to prioritize its future sales activity, secure its supply chains and, as much as possible, catch up on delivery and production delays.\n\n## Settlement of a tax dispute in France in respect of fiscal years 2005-2006 and use of the funds received\n\nOn November 13, 2020, the French Conseil d'\u00c9tat found in favor of Orange SA in a tax dispute in France in respect of fiscal years 2005-2006. This decision terminated the proceedings and allowed Orange to recover the sums paid in July 2013, i.e. a total amount of 2,246 million euros (including 646 million euros in interest). This amount was recognized as tax income in the Consolidated Financial Statements for fiscal year 2020 (see Note 11.2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\nRegarding  the  use  of  these  funds,  the  Board  of  Directors,  at  its meeting on December 2, 2020, looked favorably on the following projects:\n\n- -accelerating the Group's main areas of development to enhance its value creation:\n- -by u s i n g  n e a r l y  a  q u a r t e r  o f  t h e  a m o u n t  r e c e i v e d  t o  s t r e n g t h e n the Group's leadership in French and international networks for the benefit of its customers, as well as projects linked to the environmental transition,\n- -by allocating a quarter of the amount received to support the Group's operational transformation, in particular to improve agility and performance, and\n- -by launching a conditional voluntary public tender offer for Orange Belgium (see Changes in asset portfolio below);\n- -making an additional dividend payment to shareholders of 20 euro cents per share (subject to the approval of the Shareholders' Meeting of May 18, 2021);\n- -encouraging employee shareholding through an offer reserved for employees of around 30 million shares, the aim being that employees will eventually hold 10% of the capital of Orange SA;\n\n- 1\n\n1",

However,  the Group accelerated the rollout of its very high-speed fixed broadband networks  in  2020.  Despite  the  health  crisis,  the  Group  will  have succeeded  in  rolling  out  more  fiber  optic  connections  in  2020 than in 2019, providing an additional 9.0 million FTTH connectable households year-on-year (compared to 7.2 million in the previous year). At December 31, 2020, Orange thus had 47.2 million FTTH connectable  households  worldwide  (and  a  total  of  48.3  million households connectable to very high-speed broadband), up 23.4% year-on-year.  This  included  22.9  million  in  France,  14.9  million  in Spain and 7.8 million in Other European countries. Whether through its own infrastructure or the use of third-party networks, in late 2019 Orange announced its aim to be able to offer its FTTH packages to more than 65 million households in Europe by 2023, to assert its leadership position in Europe in fiber.\n\nIn  France,  in  late  2020,  Orange  was  awarded  the  public  service contract  for  the  very  high-speed  network  in  Haute-Sa\u00f4ne  in  the context of public initiative networks (PIN). This will enable 100% of Haute-Sa\u00f4ne department to have fiber optic broadband by 2023. At the end of 2020, Orange was working with 23 public initiative networks  as  network  operator,  under  various  models,  and  had passed  the  symbolic  milestone  of  one  million  connectable  units across all PINs operated by Orange. Through Orange Concessions, the Group's ambition is to provide more than 4.5 million households and businesses with fiber optic connections (FTTH) within the public initiative networks operated by Orange by 2025 (see Infrastructure optimization, development and enhancement below).\n\nIn  Spain,  in  the  case  of  fixed  access  networks  providing  very high-speed  broadband  Internet  access  (fiber  and  other  very high-speed  technologies),  Orange  wants  to  accelerate  its  rollout and has now set itself the target of connecting 18 million households to very high-speed broadband by the end of 2023 (through several channels, including its own infrastructure).\n\n## Mobile access networks\n\n## Licenses and 5G networks\n\nOrange acquired new 5G licenses (see section 1.7 Regulation) and launched its first offers in several countries in 2020.\n\nIn France, following the auction process for 3.5 GHz frequencies in October 2020, Orange has the highest number of 5G frequencies of any carrier, with 90 MHz of spectrum. Orange has thus strengthened its number one position with the largest portfolio of frequencies in the French market (257 MHz of frequencies in total, with 90 MHz of 3.5 GHz plus 2 X 83.5 MHz in other bands, from August 2021). The acquisition of these frequencies is an essential industrial investment that will maintain and strengthen the position acquired by Orange as a leader in mobile networks and consolidate, with the rollout of a 5G network using these frequencies, its number one position for the benefit of its B2C and B2B customers (see also Digital transformation of business customers below). The total cost of the 90 MHz acquired by Orange was 875 million euros, including 854 million euros in fixed fees (with payment spread over four to 15 years, depending on the bl o c k )  a n d  2 1  m i l l i o n  e u r o s  i n  s p e c t r u m  r e f a r m i n g  c o s t s  r e l a t i n g  t o  t h e\n\nallocation of new frequencies to carriers (see Notes 9.4 and 16.1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\nAfter Romania at the end of 2019, Poland in July 2020 and Spain in September 2020, Orange launched its 5G network in France on December 3, 2020. At the end of 2020, nearly 160 municipalities had 5G coverage. Faced with the sharp increase in data usage in 2020, Orange has chosen to initially cover areas that already have high demand to reduce the risk of network saturation. 5G-compatible plans have been offered to B2C and B2B customers in France since October 8, 2020.\n\nIn Slovakia, Orange also acquired 5G licenses in 2020 for the planned launch of offers in 2021.\n\n## Other mobile networks\n\nIn 2020, the Group continued its efforts to roll out the 4G network. At the end of 2020, nearly 100% of its mobile sites in France offered 4G coverage.\n\nThe quality of the mobile network is a priority for Orange. The results of t h e  a n n u a l  s u r v e y  b y  A r c e p  ( t h e  F r e n c h  e l e c t r o n i c  c o m m u n i c a t i o n s and postal regulator) on the quality of mobile services of French telecom operators, released in December 2020, confirmed for the tenth  year  running  that  Orange  has  the  best  mobile  network  in mainland France. Orange is ranked first or joint first for voice, SMS and  mobile  Internet  on  244  of  the  266  criteria  measured.  More specifically, Orange ranks first or joint first on 51 of the 57 criteria measured in rural areas and offers the best all-uses Internet speed in rural areas. In addition, with regard to the Covid-19 health crisis, which has increased the need for connectivity and seen a sharp increase in teleworking, Orange offers the best indoor quality for mobile Internet and voice calls (first or joint first on 66 of the 71 criteria measured). In mobile Internet, Orange is first or joint first when it comes to Internet  speeds  for  sending  and  receiving  files.  Lastly, Orange is also ranked first or joint first on all 90 criteria concerning transport, video streaming, web browsing excluding transport, and file transfers.\n\nIn February 2020, Orange and Free signed an amendment extending until December 31, 2022 the termination period for Free Mobile's national roaming on Orange's 2G and 3G networks. Arcep approved this amendment in October 2020.\n\n## Transmission networks\n\nIn February 2020, Orange joined forces with Telxius (a subsidiary of  Telef\u00f3nica)  on  the  terrestrial  backhaul  extensions  of  Google's 'Dunant' transatlantic cable. This 6,600 km cable has three times the data transfer capacity of previous generation cables. Orange and Telxius will offer and operate co-location services in their respective cable landing stations located on either side of the Atlantic Ocean. This agreement strengthens the Group's connectivity capabilities for  its  international  customers  in  Europe  and  America  and  its international positioning in the wholesale market. The Dunant cable was commissioned in 2020 for wholesale and B2B customers.\n\nIn addition, in January 2021, Orange announced the signing of a partnership agreement for the new generation AMITIE cable, which should link the United States to France and enter service in early 2022. With fiber pairs on two new generation ultra-high-speed cable systems, Orange will serve the B2C, wholesale and B2B markets in Europe and America with a single low-latency global France - US connectivity solution offering performance and redundancy.\n\nIn May 2020, Orange also announced its participation in the 2Africa proj e c t .  L e d  b y  a n  i n t e r n a t i o n a l  c o n s o r t i u m ,  t h e  p r o j e c t  s h o u l d  e n a b l e a 37,000 km submarine cable to be laid around the coast of Africa to improve Internet access on the African continent and in the Middle East. The cable is due to be commissioned in 2023 or 2024.",

        "page_content": "Orange is thus continuing to invest heavily  in  global  connectivity projects to guarantee and constantly improve the quality of service of its global network with more than 40 submarine cables worldwide. Orange's global network, which serves its customers all over the world, connects more than 300 points of presence via 45,000 km of fiber in Europe, the United States, Africa and Asia.\n\n## Satellite transmission\n\nIn  July  2020,  Orange  announced  the  purchase  from  Eutelsat Communications of all available capacity on the Eutelsat Konnect satellite to cover the whole of France. All Orange B2C customers, including  those  living  in  the  most  isolated  areas,  have  therefore been  able  to  benefit  from  very  high-speed  fixed  broadband  via satellite since January 2021. This agreement is directly in line with the Broadband/Very High-Speed Broadband France Plan adopted by the government with the aim of rolling out broadband services of at least 30 megabytes/second over the whole of France by 2022. The service is distributed by Orange's Nordnet subsidiary, the leading French distributor of satellite Internet services since 2008.\n\nIn  December  2020,  Orange  was  selected  by  the  European Commission  to  be  part,  along  with  satellite  manufacturers  and operators, of a consortium to study the design, development and launch of an independent European space communications system to strengthen Europe's digital sovereignty.\n\n## Infrastructure optimization, development and enhancement (FiberCos - TowerCos)\n\n## FiberCo in France (Orange Concessions) and Poland\n\nOrange has moved forward in its plans to share future fiber network rollouts with its partners via FiberCos.\n\nIn France, in January 2021 Orange announced that it had signed an exclusive agreement with a consortium of long-term investors including  La Banque des Territoires (Caisse des d\u00e9p\u00f4ts),  CNP Assurances and EDF Invest for the sale of 50% of the capital and joint  control  of  Orange  Concessions.  Orange  Concessions  will allow Orange to continue the rollout of fiber in rural areas of France while sharing the investment effort, in line with the ambitions of the strategic plan Engage 2025. With 23 public initiative networks (PIN) representing nearly 4.5 million FTTH connections created or to be created by December 31, 2020, Orange Concessions will be the leading operator in France for Fiber To The Home (FTTH), deployed and  operated  on  behalf  of  local  authorities.  Orange  would  have a future call option enabling it to take control of and consolidate Orange Concessions. The agreement values Orange Concessions at 2.675 billion euros. Subject to the approval of the relevant antitrust authorities and all stakeholders, the transaction is expected to be completed in the second half of 2021 (see Notes 4.3 and 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\nIn Poland, the Group plans to sign an agreement in the first half of 2021 to establish a special purpose entity due to be operational in 2021.\n\n## Creation of the European TowerCo Totem\n\nIn  terms  of  plans  to  upgrade  its  European  mobile  network,  in February  2021  Orange  announced  the  creation  of  Totem,  a European TowerCo intended to create value (i) by operating first-class passive  infrastructure  assets,  (ii)  by  focusing  on  revenue  growth and optimization of operational efficiency, and (iii) by fostering both organic and inorganic growth.\n\nTotem  will  have  a  portfolio  of  assets  with  proven  operational excellence. It will have all the skills and functions needed to create sustainable  value  to  make  the  TowerCo  a  leader  in  the  growing European telecommunication tower market. Initially, it will operate a  portfolio  of  premium  towers  comprising  around  25,500  sites in  France  and  Spain,  the  two  largest  countries  where  Orange  is\n\npresent. After France and Spain, the Group will study the possibility of integrating Orange's other European passive infrastructure assets that could create value for the TowerCo. Based on this scope and under the terms of the Master Service Agreement (MSA) signed with Orange, in 2020 Totem would have generated revenue in excess of 500 million euros and EBITDAaL of almost 300 million euros, around two thirds of which from assets in France.\n\nOne of Totem's core priorities will be organic growth. The TowerCo will  benefit  from  significant  opportunities  to  develop  its  hosting activities  across  its  entire  portfolio.  In  addition,  the  TowerCo  will host and roll out new sites for Orange and other network operators.\n\nTotem also intends to seize opportunities for inorganic growth in Europe. To support this development ambition, Orange will be able to use the flexibility of the new company's capital structure, whether in terms of equity issuance or debt financing. Orange wants to retain control  of  the  TowerCo  to  benefit  from  the  significant  source  of sustainable value creation that it offers the Group.\n\nTotem will be led by a fully independent and dedicated management team. The team will be appointed in the first half of 2021 with a view to the TowerCo becoming operational by the end of 2021.\n\n## Acceleration in growth areas\n\n## Africa & Middle East\n\nIn early January 2020, Orange inaugurated the new headquarters of  its  subsidiary  Orange  Middle  East  and  Africa  in  Casablanca, Morocco. A major player in the Africa region for more than 20 years, Orange hopes to become the preferred multiservice operator for the people. To be successful, Orange must develop its new services in Africa, getting closer to its customers so that it can fulfil their needs and adapt to the local market.\n\nIn  addition,  in  November  2020 Orange announced the entry into service  and  commercial  launch  of  Djoliba,  the  first  pan-African backbone. This infrastructure is based on a terrestrial fiber optic network  of  more  than  10,000  km,  coupled  with  10,000  km  of submarine  cables  offering  secure  very  high-speed  international connectivity from West Africa. The network will cover eight countries (Burkina Faso, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Mali, Nigeria and  Senegal).  With  Djoliba,  Orange  is  catering  for  the  needs  of businesses and telecom players in West Africa, serving a potential 330 million inhabitants.\n\nIn January 2021, Orange announced a partnership with C\u00f4te Ouest Audiovisuel  which  will  distribute  its  TV  and  OTT  (Over-The-Top) content  in  West  Africa  via  Media  Delivery  Boost,  Orange's  CDN (Content Delivery Network) content delivery solution. This solution ensures quality, speed and reliability in content delivery without the need for satellites as used previously.\n\n## Mobile Finance Services\n\nIn Europe, i n J u l y  2 0 2 0  O r a n g e  B a n k  a n n o u n c e d  t h a t  i t  h a d  e x p a n d e d its  services  and  reached  a  new  milestone  in  its  cross-selling policy with Orange by integrating into its business the subsidiary Orange  Courtage,  which  notably  offered  insurance  for  mobile devices to 549,000 B2C customers at December 31, 2020. This integration  allows  Orange  Bank  to  become  an  insurance  broker. In November 2020, Orange Bank also launched new value offers in France (including the Premium Pack for families) and new bank cards  to  celebrate  its  third  anniversary.  Lastly,  in  January  2021 Orange  Bank  announced  the  acquisition  of  Anytime,  a  neobank specializing in business banking. This acquisition will allow Orange to  offer  its  millions  of  business  customers  financial  support  and digital  management  tools.  At  December  31,  2020,  Orange  Bank had nearly 1.2 million customers in France and Spain (this number includes customers of all products sold by Orange Bank: accounts, loans and mobile insurance).\n\n- 1\n\n1",

        "page_content": "1 -\n\nIn Africa, the Orange strategy in mobile financial services seeks to offer solutions accessible to as many people as possible, regardless of their income or where they live. In July 2020, Orange and NSIA, a leader in bancassurance, announced the launch of Orange Bank Africa's  sales  activities  in  Abidjan,  C\u00f4te  d'Ivoire.  Orange  Bank Africa  offers,  through  the  Orange  Money channel, a savings and micro-credit  solution  that  allows  users  to  borrow  instantly  using their  mobile  device.  Orange  Bank  Africa  plans  to  expand  into Senegal, Mali and Burkina Faso. The goal of Orange Bank Africa is to become the leading player for financial inclusion in West Africa. The successful launch of Orange Bank Africa enabled it to acquire 356,000 customers by the end of December 2020 with its pico-credit and savings offers via Orange Money.\n\nIn March 2020, Orange also announced the launch of Orange Money in Morocco. This service enables Moroccans to use their telephones to make payments and transfer money, thereby facilitating trade. The Orange Money service is now available in all countries in Africa & Middle East. Moreover, since May 2020, Orange Money customers have been able to transfer money from France to Morocco or Burkina Faso, in real time and securely, directly through an Orange Money account.  At  December  31,  2020,  Orange  Money  had  more  than 49 million customers, including 22 million active customers using the service each month, in 16 countries (excluding associates and joint ventures).\n\n## Wholesale services\n\nIn July 2020, Orange Wholesale France, the first wholesale operator to launch an e-SIM offer in France for its light mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) customers, signed a partnership agreement with Prixtel. Prixtel has thus become the first French MVNO to be able to offer its customers the option of downloading their digital SIM card  (e-SIM)  to  their  smartphones.  Orange  is  thus  capitalizing on  its  network  and  its  capacity  for  innovation  to  offer  the  best wholesale service on the French market by supporting operators in the digitalization of the customer experience.\n\nIn January 2021, Orange announced a partnership with C\u00f4te Ouest Audiovisuel  which  will  distribute  its  TV  and  OTT  (Over-The-Top) content in West Africa via Media Deliver y Boost (MDB), Orange's CDN (Content Delivery Network) content delivery solution. This solution ensures quality, speed and reliability in content delivery without the need for satellites as used previously. For Orange, the development of CDN is a strategic opportunity for revenue growth, particularly in Africa where the operator already manages the largest network of  this  type  on  the  continent,  enabling  audiovisual  content  to  be delivered to 10 countries.\n\n## Digital transformation of business customers\n\nIn its Engage 2025 strategic plan, Orange has set itself the goal of making artificial intelligence (AI) and data an integral part of improving its operational efficiency and customer experience. In line with this objective,  in  July  2020  Orange  and  Google  Cloud  announced  a strategic partnership focusing on data services, artificial intelligence a n d  e d g e  c o m p u t i n g .  G o o g l e  w i l l  c o n t r i b u t e  i t s  k n o w - h o w  i n  a d v a n c e d Cloud  technologies,  its  data  analysis  and  artificial  intelligence tools, and its proven approach towards supporting transformation. Orange will leverage its expertise in technology and communication services and its international network infrastructure. Thanks to this partnership,  B2C  and  B2B  customers  in  Europe  will  be  offered new Cloud services and Orange Business Services will also see its offerings extended to include Google Cloud solutions in the areas of data analytics and value-added Cloud.\n\nI n  N o v e m b e r  2 0 2 0 ,  O r a n g e  B u s i n e s s  S e r v i c e s  a l s o  s i g n e d  a  s t r a t e g i c global agreement with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to accelerate i nnovation in the business Cloud. Orange and AWS will work together to  provide  businesses  with  new  solutions  for  modernization  and migration, data analytics, innovation and security. The agreement will  help  them  accelerate  their  digital  transformation  and  take advantage of the Cloud to adapt more quickly to market changes and user needs. In addition, a dedicated Cloud center of excellence will train and certify more than 3,000 experts in Cloud Computing, cybersecurity, digital & data from Orange Business Services.\n\nThe healthcare sector is also a key focus of the Engage 2025 strategic plan.  With  that  in  mind,  Orange  Business  Services  decided  to combine its health business within the Enovacom subsidiary from October  1,  2020  in  order  to  intensify  synergies  and  support  the digital  transformation  of  healthcare  players.  Through  Enovacom, Orange aims to become a leader in digital health in France. In this respect, in November 2020 the Orange group decided to invest, via its holding company Orange Digital Investments, in the Digital Health 2 fund managed by LBO France. In January 2021, it announced the creation of a joint venture with Sanofi, Capgemini and Generali aimed at accelerating the development of specific healthcare solutions and their placement on the market for the benefit of patients.\n\nIn 2020, Orange also launched two trials with Schneider Electric and Lacroix Group to test the applications and benefits of industrial 5G  in  their  respective  plants  in  Vaudreuil  and  Pays  de  la  Loire. Thanks to its low latency, very high speed, and eventually, network slicing,  5G  will  be  a  competitive  lever  for  businesses.  It  will  yield significant  improvements  in  industrial  processes  and  practices, particularly through mixed reality (augmented or virtual). To support businesses  more  closely  in  their  5G  projects,  in  February  2021 Orange announced the creation of nine Orange 5G Labs in France and worldwide. These will enable businesses to gain a better insight i nto t h e  o p p o r t u n i t i e s ,  v a l u e  a n d  b e n e fi t s  o f  5 G  b y  t e s t i n g  t h e i r  c u r r e n t solutions in a 5G environment. They will also be able to explore new applications thanks to the Orange 5G Lab ecosystem and Orange's technical experts.\n\nTo  support  fast-growing  companies  in  the  areas  of  connectivity, cybersecurity,  digital  enterprise  and  innovative  financial  services, Orange has also strengthened its venture capital investment activities by creating Orange Venture in early 2021. With a budget of 350 million euros, Orange Venture seeks to identify future technology champions to facilitate the transition to a more digital and responsible world.\n\nLastly,  in  January  2021  Orange  Business  Services  announced  a partnership with BNP Paribas to implement the flexible SD-WAN (Software-Defined  Wide  Area  Network)  solution  in  more  than 1,800  branches  in  France.  This  hybrid,  flexible  and  Cloud-native solution will enable BNP Paribas network administrators to optimize and monitor infrastructure performance.\n\n## Exemplary social and environmental conduct\n\n## Orange, a people-oriented and digital employer\n\nIn  February  2020,  Orange  announced  that  it  planned  to  invest more than 1.5 billion euros in a skills development and professional retraining program. The Group decided to make the skills challenge a central part of the Engage 2025 plan. To address this challenge, it defined three major priorities: enhancing its technical expertise, developing  data  practices  and  applications,  and  offering  each employee the chance to develop their soft skills.",

        "page_content": "## Environmental commitment\n\nOrange is aiming for Net Zero Carbon (1) by 2040, i.e. 10 years sooner than the GSMA (Global System for Mobile Communications) targets, despite the explosion in data and new technologies.\n\nTo  achieve  this  target,  Orange  must  use  renewable  energy.  The Group's aim is that by 2025, renewable energy will make up more than 50% of the electricity it uses. Accordingly, in July 2020, Orange signed a contract with Boralex, the leading independent onshore wind  producer,  for  the  supply  of  renewable  electricity  in  France. From January 1, 2021 and for a period of five years, Boralex will supply Orange with 67 Gigawatt hours (GWh) per year of renewable electricity generated by 26 wind turbines. In February 2021, Orange also announced that it had partnered with ENGIE, the leading solar and wind energy developer in France, to implement a comprehensive renewable energy supply solution in France. This involves creating new  solar  generation  capacity,  managing  the  production  of  all renewable  electricity  capacity  contracted  by  Orange  from  other producers,  and  supplying  additional  volumes  to  cover  Orange's actual consumption. The 15-year power purchase agreement signed by Orange and ENGIE will enable the development of two new solar projects totaling 51 Megawatt-peak (MWp).\n\nMoreover,  by  2025,  Orange  will  strengthen  its  'Green  Program' to reduce the energy consumption of its networks. The Group will also rely more on the circular economy with, for example, products that  have  been  eco-designed,  second-hand  network  equipment and more used handsets. In October 2020, Orange launched the 're' program, a circular economy program based on three pillars: recycling, recovery and reconditioning. The aim of this program is to raise public awareness on the environmental impact of mobile phones  and  to  increase  the  collection  of  mobile  devices.  Over the past 10 years, the Group has collected 15 million telephones, including 8 million by Orange France.\n\nLastly,  in  order  to  finance  environmental  and  social  projects,  in September 2020 Orange successfully completed its first sustainable bond issue for 500 million euros with a maturity of nine years and a coupon of 0.125%. Around 40% of the funds raised will be allocated to digital inclusion projects and around 60% to projects relating to energy efficiency and the circular economy (see Note 13.5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\n## Launch and progress of the Scale Up operational efficiency program\n\nTo  ensure  that  it  achieves  its  objectives,  in  late  2019  Orange committed to net savings of one billion euros by 2023 on a limited scope of indirect  costs  of  13.8  billion  euros  at  end-2019  (limited scope of costs of 13.8 billion euros at end-2019 corresponding to the  Group's  indirect  costs  excluding  (i)  Africa  &  Middle  East  and Mobile Finance Services, and (ii) labor expenses and other network expenses and IT expenses of Enterprise IT & integration services).\n\nTo that end, Orange launched the Scale Up operational efficiency program in 2020. At end-2020, this had resulted in a net saving of nearly 100 million euros on this cost scope. The savings will be\n\nprogressively increased between now and 2023 and will mainly cover labor expenses, overheads, other network expenses, IT expenses, real  estate,  advertising,  marketing  and  customer  service  costs, operating taxes and levies.\n\n## Changes in asset portfolio\n\nAs  regards  Orange  Concessions  (FiberCo  in  France)  and  Totem (European  TowerCo),  see  above  Infrastructure  optimization, development and enhancement (FiberCos - TowerCos).\n\n## Agreement to acquire control of Telekom Romania Communications\n\nIn November 2020, Orange announced the signing of an agreement to  acquire  a  54%  majority  stake  in  Romanian  carrier  Telekom Romania  Communications  (TKR)  and  its  convergent  subscriber base.  Orange  will  pay  268  million  euros,  net  of  debt  and  cash and  subject  to  customary  adjustments  upon  completion  of  the transaction, corresponding to a total enterprise value of 497 million euros for 100% of TKR. TKR, the second-largest fixed operator in Romania, generated revenue of 622 million euros in 2019. As of June 30, 2020, it had 881,000 convergent customers and around five million customers connected to its fixed telephony, broadband and pay television services. Around three million households are connected  to  its  fiber  optic  network.  This  acquisition  will  enable Orange to accelerate its convergent operator strategy in Romania. The completion of the deal remains subject to the approval of the European Commission and the relevant authorities, and is expected in the second half of 2021 (see Note 4.3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\n## Conditional voluntary public tender offer on shares of Orange Belgium\n\nOn December 2, 2020, Orange SA announced its plans to launch a conditional voluntary public tender offer for 47.09% of the capital of Orange Belgium, corresponding to the remaining shares not currently held, at a price of 22 euros per share in cash and with no threshold requirements. It was submitted on January 21, 2021 for approval by the Financial Services and Markets Authority in Belgium (FSMA). Subject to the conditions being met, this offer could then lead to the delisting of the shares of Orange Belgium (see Note 4.3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\n## Acquisition of the remaining shares of Business & Decision\n\nAs announced in February 2020, on May 28, 2020, Orange Business Services launched a mandatory public tender offer for all the shares of Business & Decision not yet held by the Group, representing 6.38% of the capital. This offer closed on July 8, 2020 and was followed by the effective delisting of Business & Decision shares on July 13, 2020. Following this public tender offer, Orange now holds 100% of  Business  &  Decision  shares.  It  acquired  the  remaining  capital in the second half of 2020 for 4 million euros (see Note 4.2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\n- 1\n\n1",

The Group is present as an operator in 26 countries (including two in which it holds a minority interest). In addition to its role as a supplier of connectivity, the Group provides business services, primarily solutions in the fields of digital work, security and improving business line processes.\n\nFor consistency with the segment information in the Consolidated Financial  Statements,  the  Group's  activities  are  presented  below by  operating  segment:  France,  Europe,  Africa  and  Middle  East, Enterprise,  International  Carriers  &  Shared  Services,  and  Mobile Financial  Services.  Following  the  implementation  of  the  Group\n\n## 1.4.1 France\n\nOrange  is  France's  incumbent  telecommunication  operator  (see Section  1.1  Overview).  The  bulk  of  its  business  is  carried  by Orange SA, which is also the parent company of the Orange group.\n\nThe  France  business  segment  includes  all  fixed  and  mobile communication services to consumers and companies with fewer than  50  employees (1) in  France (2) as  well  as  services  to  carriers. Activities developed for companies with more than 50 employees, content  activities  and  mobile  financial  services  are  covered  in Sections 1.4.4, 1.4.5.2 and 1.4.6 of this document respectively.\n\nIn  2020,  the  France  business  segment  generated  42.1%  of  the Group's consolidated revenue.\n\n## The market\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic that hit France in 2020 affected the business and financial position of telecommunication operators despite the sector's considerable resilience. At September 30, 2020, the revenue of  French  telecommunication operators was stable year-on-year, down just 0.3% over 12 rolling months (source: Arcep, Q3 2020). While fixed narrowband telephony revenue continued its downward trend as a result of the steady decline in the number of lines, fixed broadband  revenue  continued  its  growth  due  to  the  increasing number of accesses. Despite intense competition, mobile services revenue was up, driven by sustained growth in access numbers.\n\nThe  French  broadband  and  very  high-speed  broadband  Internet market is dominated by four main operators, which account for over 99% of broadband customers. With market share of 40.0%, down 4 points compared with end-2019, Orange remains market leader, ahead of Free, Altice-SFR and Bouygues Telecom (ranked second, third  and  fourth  respectively  by  number  of  customers)  (source: Orange estimates).\n\nThe French mobile market is dominated by the same four operators as the fixed market, which account for 89% of mobile customers (excluding M2M). With market share of 34.8% in 2020, compared with  35.1%  in  2019,  Orange  also  remains  leader  here,  ahead  of competitors Altice-SFR, Free Mobile and Bouygues Telecom (ranked second, third and fourth respectively by number of mobile customers excluding M2M respectively) and all MVNOs (3) .\n\nExecutive  Committee's new organization on September 1, 2020, Spain  has  joined  the  Europe  aggregate  and  the  Orange  Bank business segment has been renamed Mobile Financial Services to take into account the gradual integration of new activities into that segment (see Section 3.3, Note 1 Definition of business segments and performance indicators).\n\nThe results of Orange's activities in 2020 and its principal operating indicators in its various business segments are set out in Section 3.1 Analysis of the Group's financial position and earnings.\n\nUnless  otherwise  indicated,  the  market  shares  indicated  in  this chapter relate to market shares in terms of volume, and the data related  to  customers  does  not  include  SIM  cards  dedicated  to connected devices (M2M).\n\n## Orange's business activities\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has affected Orange's activities in France, but also all of its stakeholders. As such, Orange's priorities have been to ensure the safety of its employees and to support its customers by providing telecommunication services, which have become more essential than ever. See Section 1.3 Significant events.\n\nOrange France's core business involves the provision of fixed-line telephony, broadband and very high-speed broadband Internet and mobile telephony services for the B2C and Pro-SME markets. Its strategy is based on improving speeds in fixed (fiber) and mobile networks (4G and 5G), promoting the take-up of new services and conquering  new  areas  of  growth,  while  continuing  to  propel  its customer relations to a new level of excellence (see Section 1.2.2 The Orange group strategy).\n\n## Mobile\n\nIn  the  B2C  mobile  market,  Orange  segments  its  offers  into  four main ranges covering all customers, from those looking for just the essentials in terms of communications or Internet connectivity to those wanting the best smartphones and who have very intense connectivity uses in France and internationally. In October 2020, Orange launched its first range of 5G-compatible plans.\n\nOrange is present in all market segments, including the entry-level market, where it offers several types of mobile plans at affordable rates under the Sosh brand, only available online, with no commitment and no handset. At the end of December 2020, Sosh had 4.2 million mobile customers.\n\nSince 2015, all offers  marketed by Orange have been 4G offers, including  so-called  entry-level  offers,  and  some  have  been 5G-compatible since 2020. Orange is continuing its family-focused strategy with the development of multi-line plans through its flagship Open offer. Open mobile offers are available in the same ranges as conventional mobile offers and include the same levels of service.\n\nSegmenting offers on the B2C and Pro-SME markets allows Orange to continue to grow its subscriber base while the decline in prepaid offers  continues.  At  the  same  time,  the  MVNO  customer  base hosted on the Orange network is contracting. See Section 3.1.3.1.6 Additional information - France.",

        "page_content": "## Fixed telephony and Internet\n\nIn the B2C broadband Internet market, Orange segments its offers into two main categories: Livebox, aimed at customers looking for Internet and TV essentials, and Livebox Up, which meets the needs of those wanting the best speeds and a premium TV experience. In terms of equipment, in October 2019 Orange launched a new Livebox 5, designed to have a lower carbon footprint and vastly improved speeds to meet customers' growing needs, and to incorporate the fact that many households share bandwidth.\n\nSosh has also been present on the broadband Internet market since 2018, with affordable offers, available exclusively online and with no commitment.\n\nThe Orange and Sosh broadband Internet access of fers are marketed using FTTH technology in eligible areas, or ADSL otherwise. Orange is the leader in terms of the number of FTTH accesses sold, with a customer base of more than 4.5 million subscribers at the end of 2020.\n\nWith the steady growth in full unbundling, as well as the wholesale of contracts and naked ADSL access to third-party Internet service providers,  the  decline  in  revenue  generated  by  the  conventional telephony  service  business  continues.  When  it  unveiled  its  new strategic  plan,  Orange  announced  the  imminent  start  of  an initial  experimental  phase  of  copper  decommissioning,  with  full implementation planned between 2023 and 2030.\n\nUp until November 27, 2020 Orange has been the operator responsible for the provision of universal services including connection to a fixed network and telephone service. See Section 1.7.1.2.4 Regulation of fixed telephony, broadband and very high-speed broadband Internet.\n\nOrange  also  pursues  advertising  network  activities  through  its websites, which have nearly 28 million unique visitors each month (source:  M\u00e9diam\u00e9trie/NetRatings  -  Audience  Internet  Global, October 2020).\n\nAgainst a backdrop of intense competition, Orange also continues to innovate, notably with the enhancement of its 'Maison Connect\u00e9e' home automation offering.\n\n## Wholesale\n\nOrange also offers services to carriers, an activity that includes the interconnection of competing operators, as well as unbundling and wholesale services (ADSL and fiber optic), regulated by Arcep, and construction and marketing services for very high-speed fiber optic networks.\n\nFor  unbundling,  Arcep  has  slightly  increased  regulated  prices for  the  2021-2023  period  compared  with  their  2020  level  (see Section 1.7.1.2.3 Regulation of fixed telephony, broadband and very high-speed broadband Internet - Rate framework for access to the copper local loop). Revenues from services to carriers for access to the copper network are nevertheless in structural decline.\n\nAccess to the Orange fiber network is marketed to operators in two ways:  line  leasing  or  co-financing.  Co-financing  requires  a  basic investment for third-party operators, plus recurring maintenance fees. Revenues from line co-financing increased significantly in 2020. The increase reflects a fundamental trend among Orange's competitors, which are increasingly opting to convert their fiber line leases into co-financing by creating special-purpose financing vehicles. At the e n d  o f  2 0 2 0 ,  a l l  t h i r d - p a r t y  o p e r a t o r s  h a d  c o - fi n a n c e d  t h e  e q u i v a l e n t  o f their fiber market share in the private sector. However, the cumulative amount of fiber network co-financing received by Orange since 2009 represents less than half of the fixed broadband market share of those operators, as estimated by Orange, which means that it also represents less than half of total long-term co-financing potential.\n\nThe timing of co-financing payments due is highly dependent on the purchasing strategies of third-party operators in connection with the development of fiber and the investment policies of financing vehicles. Orange expects this revenue to be spread mainly over the period from 2020 to 2025.\n\nLastly, since 2011, Orange has been providing Free Mobile with a nationwide roaming service on its 2G and 3G networks. That service was  extended  until  the  end  of  2022  by  an  addendum  signed  in February 2020. See Section 1.7.1.2.2 Regulation of mobile telephony - Infrastructure sharing.\n\n## Distribution\n\nIn 2020, the health crisis profoundly disrupted the sales channel mix.\n\nOrange is pressing ahead with its digital development strategy, with a fully digital customer experience in Orange online stores (available on Orange.fr) and Sosh (via Sosh.fr), with Sosh offers only available on the digital channel. In 2020, a third of sales were digital, an increase of 21% compared with 2019. Orange's My Orange mobile contract management app continued to attract visitors, with 5.6 million unique visitors in 2020.\n\nThe dedicated customer call centers, based on the type of services marketed, accounted for 21.2% of sales (+1%).\n\nThe  network  of  retail  stores  spread  across  France  continues  to roll out the Smart Store concept. At the end of 2020, it consisted of  361  stores  owned  by  Orange  (including  17  Megastores  and 312 Smart Stores) and 196 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Telephone stores (including 160 Smart Stores) and accounted for 40.4% of sales (down 30% due to the health crisis).\n\nLastly,  the  other  channels,  which  include  direct  marketing, door-to-door and the multi-operator network, accounted for 5.7% of sales (+37%).\n\n## The network\n\nOrange's commercial leadership is built partly on its leadership in fixed and mobile networks.\n\nOn the fixed network, Orange continued to ramp up its rollout of very high-speed broadband on its own and third-party networks in 2020. In the space of a year, Orange made 6.6 million households connectable to FTTH (up from 4.5 million in 2019), a new record in France. 63% of fiber optic installations were rolled out by Orange in 2020 (source: Arcep, Q3 2020). At end-2020, Orange had 22.9 million households connectable to FTTH.\n\nActions continued to improve the fixed network speed with a view to  significantly  improving  the  Internet  experience  of  households and professional customers in rural areas, with fiber rolled out in town centers (subscriber connection node opticalization, fiber to sub-distribution frames), and participation in FTTH Public Initiative Networks (PIN) of local and regional authorities. Orange has enjoyed considerable success regarding its expertise in PIN deployment.\n\nIn  addition,  2020 saw Orange continue to work on its subsidiary Orange Concessions, which will eventually combine over 4.5 million FTTH  connections  from  PINs  entrusted  to  Orange,  combining its  industrial  power  with  that  of  leading  financial  partners.  In January 2021, the Group announced that it had signed an agreement with long-term investors (see Section 1.3 Significant events).\n\nFor  the  mobile  network,  the  rollout  of  4G  continued,  with  an unchanged coverage rate of 99% of the French population, still the best 4G rate in the country (source: Orange estimates). By the end of 2020, Orange had installed 25,029 4G sites in France (1) (source: Observatoire ANFr, January 7, 2021).\n\n- 1\n\n1",

        "page_content": "1 -\n\nOperating activities\n\nFor the tenth consecutive year, Orange's mobile network was ranked number one by Arcep in 2020 (see Section 1.3 Significant events).\n\nThis deployment involves the continued extension of coverage in tourist areas, stadiums, trains (LGV and TER), subways and on the motorway network. The health crisis resulted in production delays during the first period of lockdown, but the massive resumption of work in the second half made it possible to clear most of the backlog.\n\nIn 2020, Orange continued its work with a view to creating a French TowerCo to manage the directly-owned portfolio of towers in its mobile network (see Section 1.3 Significant events - Optimization, development and valorization of infrastructure).\n\n## 1.4.2 Europe\n\nOutside France, the Group operates in seven countries in Europe, where it is implementing its convergence strategy through the rollout of very high-speed fixed and mobile broadband, and the launch of new offers. After launching its Love convergence of fers in all countrie s in the Europe business segment in 2018, Orange is now developing its convergence strategy in each country, based on the local context and the strengths of each of its subsidiaries:\n\n- -in Spain, where the Group is number two in the fixed and mobile markets, and operates a multi-brand strategy;\n- -in Poland, where the Group is the incumbent operator, leader in fixed and number two in mobile;\n- -in  Belgium  and  Luxembourg,  where  the  Group  launched  its convergence offers via partnerships; and\n- -in  other  Central  European  countries  (Romania,  Slovakia  and Moldova), where the Group, leader in the mobile segment, is also a convergent player via the rollout of fiber optic, the use of 4G for the development of fixed telephony via LTE, and its partnerships.\n\nIn  2020,  the  Europe  segment  represented  24.8%  of  the  Group's consolidated revenue.\n\n## Spain\n\nThe Group has been present in Spain since the deregulation of the telecom  market  in  1998.  Initially  operating  in  the  fixed  telephony market, it acquired mobile telephony operator Amena in 2005 before adopting the Orange brand in 2006. The acquisition of fixed telephony operator Jazztel in 2015 enabled Orange to consolidate its position in  terms  of  convergence  thanks  to  Jazztel's  fiber  coverage.  The Group has also strengthened its presence in the low-cost market with the acquisitions of MVNO Simyo in 2012 and Rep\u00fablica M\u00f3vil in 2018, thereby consolidating a multi-brand strategy designed to cover all market segments. In 2020, the Group generated 11.6% of its consolidated revenue in Spain.\n\n## The market\n\nSince the consolidation dating back to 2014, four operators have dominated the telecom market: Telef\u00f3nica, the incumbent, which acquired D+ in 2014 and operates under the Movistar brand; Orange; Vodafone, which acquired ONO in 2014; and M\u00e1sM\u00f3vil Ibercom, initially an MVNO, which acquired Yoigo in 2016 and then signed a commercial agreement for access to Orange's fixed and mobile networks.\n\nIn addition to competing in the B2B and B2C segments through their main brands, these four operators also compete via other brands in  the  low-cost  market:  Orange  with  Jazztel,  Amena,  Simyo  and Rep\u00fablica M\u00f3vil; Telef\u00f3nica with Tuenti and O2; Vodafone with Lowi; and M\u00e1sM\u00f3vil with Pepephone.\n\nAs  regards  5G,  the  allocation  of  the  blocks  of  spectrum  in  the 3.4 GHz-3.8 GHz band was delayed due to the health crisis, and the results of the auctions enabled Orange to acquire the largest share of the blocks available for a total of 854 million euros in October 2020. The  rollout  of  5G  has  begun,  with  more  than  160  municipalities covered by the end of 2020. See Section 1.3 Significant events.\n\nAs regards the cluster, transmission, and transport network, Orange carried  on  with  (i)  the  simplification  of  fixed  broadband  access engineering  (vDSL  and  FTTH)  to  accommodate  the  high  growth in  traffic,  and  (ii)  works  aimed  at  the  transition  from  conventional telephony services to IP telephony.\n\nTogether,  the  four  convergent  operators  hold  more  than  90%  of the market, with Telef\u00f3nica ranked first, followed by Orange (whose market share in the third quarter of 2020 was 24.6% for broadband Internet and 24% for mobile), then Vodafone (source: CNMC).\n\nThe Spanish market was down in 2020, impacted by the health crisis  and  a  very  competitive  environment,  with  a  shift  towards low-cost offers driving growth in this market segment and prompting a proliferation of new brands.\n\n## Orange's activities in Spain\n\nIn the Spanish B2C market, Orange is pursuing a multi-brand and multi-service strategy aimed at offering quality services at the best price, including for entry-level offers. In 2020, Orange fine-tuned its of f e r s  t o  m e e t  g r o w i n g  d e m a n d  f o r  d a t a  a n d  s e r v i c e s ,  a n d  d e v e l o p e d a multi-service approach to differentiate itself from its competitors and create value. Within this strategy, 2020 saw Orange:\n\n- -enrich its TV offering with the broadcasting of football matches and  other  additional  content,  including  exclusive  content, via  premium  packages,  and  a  constant  improvement  of functionalities, resulting in an increase in TV usage. The Orange TV offer continued to grow, reaching a penetration rate of 18%;\n- -position its brands at the right price for the most price-sensitive customers. In a competitive environment such as the Spanish market,  where  the  low-cost  segment  is  growing  rapidly,  all Orange brands, including Rep\u00fablica M\u00f3vil and Simyo, already offer fiber-only and convergent offers;\n- -continue  work  to  improve  its  operational  efficiency,  through simplification and digitization, in order to improve the customer experience;\n- -join the insurance market through the launch of Orange Seguros, in partnership with Zurich, which will initially offer products to Orange customers, freelancers and SMEs, ahead of the planned launch in the coming months of a range of products and services for the residential and business markets.\n\nI n  t h e  B 2 B  m a r k e t ,  O r a n g e  f o c u s e d  o n  t h e  l a u n c h  o f  a  u n i fi e d  p o r t f o l i o of simple price-oriented offers as well as 5G offers for the small and medium-sized business segment, including value-added services to  meet  their  digitization  needs  (vpbx,  office365,  antivirus,  etc.). Orange has also continued to demonstrate its commitment to the digitization of public administrations and large companies by helping them improve their processes through technology and by creating innovative business models that enrich their offering to the public at large and customers. Orange also provides data analysis services on travel flows and supports the society with Big Data projects, thereby promoting the development of new applications for the digital society.",

        "page_content": "In  line  with  the  Group's  strategy,  in  2020,  Orange  Spain was the first operator to launch a subsidized offer known as Tarifa Social de Orange, the first rate for convergent offers adapted to the needs and financial capacity of low-income households in Spain.\n\n## The network\n\nIn 2020, Orange continued to roll out its FTTH network, adding nearly 0.6 million connectable households by the end of the year. At the end of 2020, Orange was able to offer an FTTH connection to nearly 15 million Spanish households.\n\nNew  agreements  and  the  improvement  of  existing  agreements have given Orange one of the market's most efficient and profitable net works thanks to the optimization of its inf ra str u c tu re, a n d p r e p a r e d it for the launch of 5G. By the end of 2020, the company had rolled out 5G in 121 cities, thanks to the combination of non-standalone (NSA) 3.5GHz and dynamic spectrum sharing (DSS) technologies.\n\n## Poland\n\nThe Group has been present in Poland since 2000, when it acquired an  interest  in  the  incumbent  operator,  Telekomunikacja  Polska (renamed Orange Polska). In 2006, Orange became the single brand for mobile activities, in accordance with the Group's brand policy. In 2012, it also became the single brand for all fixed telephony services offered by the Group in Poland. Orange owns 50.67% of the shares of Orange Polska, which is listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange. In 2020, the Group generated 6.0% of its consolidated revenue in Poland.\n\nPoland has four main mobile operators: Orange, T-Mobile (owned by Deutsche Telekom), Polkomtel (operating under the Plus brand, owned by the Cyfrowy Polsat group) and P4 (operating under the Play brand). In the second half of 2020, Iliad acquired 96.7% of the shares of Play via a public tender offer. At the end of 2020, these four mobile telephony operators accounted for 98% of the total number of SIM cards in Poland, and Orange was the leading operator with market share of 28.4% at end-December 2020. (1).\n\nIn the broadband Internet market, Orange ranks first, with market share of 28.3% in the fourth quarter of 2020. (2) Its principal competition comes from cable TV operators (mainly UPC Polska and Vectra), as well as from Netia (part of the Cyfrowy Polsat group), a conventional telecommunication operator.\n\nThe Polish telecommunication market remains fragmented, despite recent  consolidation.  The  Cyfrowy  Polsat  group  acquired  Netia in  2018.  In  2020,  Vectra  acquired  Multimedia  Polska,  creating the country's leader in the cable market, and Play completed the acquisition of Virgin Mobile, Poland's biggest MVNO.\n\nThe major development in the competitive landscape in 2020 was the arrival of Iliad in the Polish market. Iliad has expressed the aim of transforming Play into a convergent operator by bringing it into the broadband Internet and convergence market. This confirms the trend observed among a growing number of operators that have opted to adopt a convergent offer strategy in the B2C market. While these developments underscore the merits of Orange's convergent strategy in Poland, they are likely to boost competition.\n\nThe  Covid-19  pandemic  in  2020  highlighted  the  importance  of telecommunication  services.  Demand  for  telecommunication services, particularly broadband Internet, has been relatively strong, while voice and data connectivity has become even more essential for  consumers and businesses. As the 5G auction was delayed, all  operators  have  launched  5G  on  their  existing  spectrum  using dynamic spectrum sharing (DSS) technology; all of them except Plus have included 5G in their premium offers.\n\n## Orange's activities in Poland\n\nIn 2020, Orange Poland finalized the implementation of its Orange. one plan, which was in its final year and was central to its strategic vision as a convergent operator.\n\nConvergence  has  enabled  Orange  to  differentiate  itself  from  its competitors  and  gain  a  larger  share  of  households'  media  and telecommunication budgets. It is also an effective retention tool. In 2020, Orange continued to focus its efforts on its Love convergent offer. Love is a package that includes both fixed and mobile services in its basic formula at an affordable price, and can be extended for higher fixed broadband speed, additional SIM cards, additional TV content and other value-added services.\n\nThe number of convergent customers continued to grow in 2020, reaching 1.48 million and now accounting for 65% of the total number of residential broadband customers. This growth was supported by strong sales for the fiber offer, with fiber customers now accounting for 27% of the base, an increase of 7 points compared with 2019. This  good  performance  was  driven  by  strong  demand  for  fixed broadband, as well as the continued rollout of the FTTH network, particularly  in  small  and  medium-sized  towns  and  cities,  where competition from cable operators is more muted.\n\nIn the B2B market, after the acquisition of BlueSoft in 2019, at the end of 2020 Orange Polska acquired Craftware, Poland's leader in the integration of SalesForce CRM solutions. The deal rounds out Orange Polska's know-how in ICT, enabling it to offer its customers end-to-end  solutions.  As  part  of  its  value  strategy,  Orange  has also introduced new price plans that include various value-added services.\n\nThe number of fixed voice lines continued to decline in 2020, with a net loss of voice customers (conventional PSTN or VoIP) due to structural demographic factors, as well as the growing appeal of mobile telephony services offering unlimited calls across all networks.\n\n## The network\n\nIn 2020, Orange Polska continued to roll out its FTTH network, and by the end of the year had reached its Orange.one plan target of 5 million connectable homes. As part of its strategy of sharing future fiber network rollouts with partners via FiberCos, the Group plans to create a dedicated structure in Poland that should be operational in 2021 (see Section 1.2.2 The Orange group strategy).\n\nWith  regard  to  the  4G  network,  Orange  is  responding  to  strong growth  in  traffic  by  increasing  the  spectrum  allocated  to  4G  (to the detriment of that allocated to 2G and 3G) and the number of sites allowing the grouping of spectrum. At end-2020, Orange's 4G network covered 99.9% of the population. (3)\n\n## Belgium & Luxembourg\n\nIn Belgium and Luxembourg, Orange operates via Orange Belgium and its subsidiary Orange Communications Luxembourg. Orange Belgium  is  listed  on  the  Brussels  Stock  Exchange.  The  Orange group holds 52.9% of the capital. In December 2020, Orange SA announced that it was planning to launch a conditional voluntary public tender offer for all the shares of Orange Belgium that it does not yet hold (see Section 1.3 Significant events).\n\nA long-standing player in the mobile segment in Belgium, Orange launched convergent offers across the entire country based on the regulation of wholesale access to cable in 2016. In 2020, Orange Belgium generated 3.0% of the Group's consolidated revenue.\n\n- 1\n\n1",

The slowdown  in  commercial  activity  during  lockdown  was  followed by a period of intense competition through promotions, innovative multi-card  packages,  attractive  subsidies  and  the  launch  of  new fixed and convergent offers.\n\nLike  the  other  Group  subsidiaries,  Orange  Belgium  announced several  initiatives  in  response  to  the  Covid-19  pandemic  (see Section 1.3 Significant events).\n\nIn  the  mobile market, Orange has two main competitors, namely Proximus (the incumbent, 53.5% owned by the Belgian State) and Telenet (57.9% owned by the Liberty Global Group), which acquired Base in 2016. With market share of 29.5% in the third quarter of 2020, Orange ranks second behind Proximus. (1)\n\nThe competitive structure of the fixed telephony market remained relatively  stable  in  2020,  with  the  predominance  of  incumbent operator Proximus and regional cable operators Telenet and VOO. New wholesale rates came into effect on July 1, 2020. Fiber also became a major issue  in  2020,  with  Telenet  and  Proximus  both announcing agreements with third parties to roll it out in Belgium.\n\nI n  2 0 2 0 ,  O r a n g e  B e l g i u m  c o n t i n u e d  t o  o f f e r  m o r e  v a l u e  t o  i t s  c u s t o m e r s by bringing new offers to the market. As such, the company:\n\n- -launched its new 'GO' mobile portfolio in March, the first family offering in Belgium. Multi-card discounts were also launched to increase the appeal of the convergent Love plan;\n- -increased the speed of its 'Boost' fixed Internet option from 200Mbps to 400Mbps;\n- -reviewed and improved its offers to business customers, with a download speed of 400Mbps, a doubling of data allowances and TV;\n- -launched  an  option  giving  all  customers  access  to  Belgian football channels at a competitive price;\n- -launched an Internet only offer;\n- -continued to improve the customer experience at home, with the launch of WiFi Mesh and its portfolio of Smart Home services.\n\nOrange Belgium also continued its preparations for the implementation of its mobile access sharing agreement with Proximus, announced in 2019. On April 1, 2020, the employees of Proximus and Orange Belgium impacted by the agreement were transferred to MWingz, the 50:50 joint venture.\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2020, Orange Belgium announced that it had selected Nokia for its future mobile network, following a tender process based on technological, operational and financial criteria. Orange Belgium aims to replace its entire existing 2G/3G/4G radio network by 2023.

The  deal  will  enable  the  Group  to accelerate its strategy as a convergent operator in Romania (see Section 1.3 Significant events).\n\n## Orange's activities in Romania\n\nAgainst  the  backdrop  of  the  Covid-19  pandemic,  2020  was another pivotal year for Orange Romania, which is in the process of transitioning from an exclusively mobile operator model to that of an integrated, multi-service operator focusing on its core priorities while transforming itself.",

The company continued to integrate more data into its offers, enabling the rapid adoption of smartphones and significant growth in traffic and revenue from data services, thereby reinforcing its leadership in 4G.\n\nWhile  facing  the  challenges  related  to  the  Covid-19  pandemic, Orange continued to ramp up its 4G operations, the most ex tensive in Romania, with population coverage now reaching 98.27% nationwide a n d  10 0 %  i n  u r b a n  a r e a s  ( s o u r c e :  A N C O M ) .

In 2020, the Group generated 1.3% of its consolidated revenue in Slovakia.\n\nSlovakia's fixed broadband market is dominated by the incumbent operator Slovak Telekom (owned by the Deutsche Telekom group), whose  infrastructure  covers  the  entire  country.  Orange  ranks second, with market share of 15.6%. (1) Nevertheless, the rollout of its proprietary fiber optic network and regulated access to Slovak Telekom's fixed network allow Orange to provide fixed broadband services to a large number of potential customers.\n\nIn the mobile market, Orange is competing with three other operators: O2  (owned  by  Czech  group  PPF),  Slovak  Telekom  (owned  by Deutsche Telekom) and Swan (national operator). 4ka began offering mobile ser vi c e s i n  O c to b e r  2 015,  b u t  t o  d a t e  h a s  r e m a i n e d  a  m a r g i n a l player.

In December 2020, OSK and Slovak Telekom signed an agreement for a new optical network sharing model based on GPON technology.  Orange  can  now  provide  fiber  optic  services even in localities where it does not have a proprietary network. After a  recent  upgrade,  Orange's  mobile  network  was  recognized  as the best in Slovakia, according to the certification issued by Polish company Systemics PAB.\n\n## Moldova\n\nOrange Moldova started operating in 1998 and adopted the Orange brand in 2007. A long-standing player in the mobile segment, Orange launched its fixed and convergent telephony offers in 2017, following the 2016 acquisition of SUN Communications, Moldova's main cable operator. In 2020, the Group generated 0.3% of its consolidated revenue in Moldova.\n\nMoldova's main telecommunication operators are Orange, Moldcell (only  available  in  the  mobile  segment,  part  of  a  Nepal-based conglomerate since 2020) and Moldtelecom. Moldtelecom is the incumbent; its infrastructure provides both fixed and mobile services. It is the leader in the Internet and fixed telephony, and also operates under the Unite brand in mobile. In 2020, with market share of 55.5%, Orange maintained its number one position in the mobile telephony market, followed by Moldcell and Unite (source: Ancreti, Q3 2020).\n\n## Orange's activities in Moldova\n\n2020 was marked by the Covid-19 pandemic. While maintaining its leadership in the mobile market, Orange Moldova continued to implement its convergence strategy by rapidly rolling out fiber to homes in major towns and cities, and improved its positioning with the addition of HD channels to its TV offer, as well as Moldova's first 4K channel. Orange Moldova also focused on the B2C segment with the launch of a convergent offer for businesses (Love Business), the business TV service, and services such as Virtual PBX, Business Internet Security and new Microsoft 365 subscriptions.\n\nAs part of its digitization strategy, Orange Moldova has successfully increased  its  online  sales  activities  through  the  launch  of  a  new e-shop and a chatbot, plus the increasingly popular MyOrange app.\n\nOrange  Moldova  also  continued  to  invest  in  the  country's i nf r a s t r u c t u r e .

Part of the activities of the business segment are structured into sub-groups (Sonatel and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire). In Africa and the Middle East, Orange primarily operates in mobile markets, with the exception of countries where the Group is the incumbent operator (Senegal, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Jordan and Mauritius) and Morocco, where it also provides fixed telephony and Internet services. These markets are mainly prepaid markets, largely driven by the accelerated development of voice and data usage.\n\nOrange is pursuing a 4G rollout strategy in Africa and the Middle East, and is investing in all countries to upgrade and extend their access networks. The Group has also seen rapid development in mobile financial services. Orange Money has increased its reach, and at December 31, 2020 had 49 million customers, including 22 million active customers who use the service each month.\n\nCountries  in  the  Africa  and  Middle  East  business  segment  are generally  tightening  regulations  covering  service  quality  and environmental standards, while the tax burden is rising.\n\nIn  2020,  Africa  and  the  Middle  East  accounted  for  13.4%  of  the Group's consolidated revenue.\n\nAs part of its Engage 2025 strategic plan, Orange aims to become the benchmark digital operator in Africa and the Middle East (see Section 1.2.2 The Orange group strategy).\n\n## 1.4.3.1 Sonatel  sub-group\n\nThe Sonatel sub-group operates under the Orange brand in five countries. With operations in Senegal dating back to 1997, it began its international development in Mali in 2002. It generates 72% of its r e v e n u e  i n  t h o s e  t w o  c o u n t r i e s .

In  2020,  it generated 4.2% of the Group's revenue.\n\nWith mobile market share of 55.6% in Senegal, 58.7% in Guinea, 55.3% in Mali, 48.0% in Guinea-Bissau and 52.2% in Sierra Leone (source:  Orange  estimates),  the  Sonatel  sub-group  is  leader  in Senegal, Mali, Guinea and Sierra Leone, and ranks second in GuineaBissau.\n\nDepending on the country, it has two or three competitors: Free (whose brand was launched on October 1, 2019 to replace Tigo) and Expresso (Sudatel group) in Senegal; Sotelma/Malitel (Maroc Telecom  group)  and  Alpha  Telecom  (Planor-Monaco  Telecom International consortium) in Mali; MTN and Cellcom in Guinea; MTN in  Guinea-Bissau;  Sierratel  (the  incumbent  operator),  Africell  and QCell in Sierra Leone.\n\nThe Sonatel sub-group is continuing the development of very highspeed fixed and mobile broadband based on 4G/4G+, FDD/TDD and fiber.\n\nOrange Money enjoyed good momentum in 2020, marked by growth in the active base and the development of uses. Data services also achieved double-digit growth in all countries.\n\nSonatel demonstrated resilience by improving its results compared with 2019, despite the global health crisis, political instability in certain geographies, the tightening of regulatory measures and increasingly aggressive competition.\n\nThe Sonatel group implements a Corporate Social Responsibility policy in line with the Orange group strategy and the guidelines on sustainable development defined with stakeholders in each host\n\ncountry. Numerous initiatives were taken in the fight against Covid-19 in all host countries. The need for more people to have access to dematerialized means of payment prompted several measures to provide free financial services, reduce prices and ease subscription conditions.\n\n## 1.4.3.2 C\u00f4te d'Ivoire sub-group\n\nThe C\u00f4te d'Ivoire sub-group operates under the Orange brand in three countries. The activity covers C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, where the Group has operated since 1996 and which accounts for 68% of its revenue, and Burkina Faso and Liberia, where it acquired Cellcom Liberia and Airtel  Burkina  Faso  in  2016.  That  represents  an  area  with  a population of more than 50 million. In 2020, it generated 3% of the Group's revenue.\n\nThe  markets  in  which  the  C\u00f4te  d'Ivoire  sub-group  operates experienced contrasting trends in 2020, against the backdrop of the health crisis, the continued deterioration of the security situation in Burkina Faso and elections in all three countries during the final quarter of the year.\n\nThe C\u00f4te d'Ivoire sub-group is the leader in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and Burkina Faso, with mobile market share of 40.1% (source: Artci, Q3 2020) and 43.9% (source: Arcep BF, Q3 2020) respectively. In Liberia, where its market share now stands at 48.2% (source: GSMA, Q4 2020), it ranks second behind MTN. In C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, the sub-group is also the leader in the mobile financial services market.\n\nThe  three  entities  face  the  following  main  competitors  in  their respective  geographies:  MTN  and  Moov  in  C\u00f4te  d'Ivoire;  Onatel and Telecel in Burkina Faso; and MTN in Liberia.\n\nThe  sub-group's  activity  was  characterized  by  strong  resilience in  2020,  against  the  backdrop  of  health,  economic  and  political climates that largely impacted revenues from mobile financial and B2B services. In Liberia, the authorities increased the tax burden in the final quarter of 2020.\n\nThe C\u00f4te d'Ivoire sub-group continued the development of FTTH, tripling  the  size  of  its  customer  base  to  more  than  60,000  active customers at the end of 2020 (out of approximately 215,000 available connections).  It  also  strengthened  its  international  connectivity through  the  Djoliba  network,  West  Africa's  leading  pan-African fiber optic network, launched in November 2020 (see Section 1.3 Significant events).\n\n## 1.4.3.3 Countries in North Africa and the Middle East\n\n## Egypt\n\nThe Orange group entered the Egyptian telecom market in 1998 through a partnership with Orascom and Motorola in the operator Mobinil. It gradually increased its stake following the withdrawal of Motorola in 2000 and Orascom in 2015. Since 2016, all services have been marketed under the Orange brand. In 2018, Orange Egypt was delisted from the Egyptian Exchange. In 2020, the Group generated 2.1% of its consolidated revenue in Egypt.\n\nSince the end of 2017, market momentum by value has been driven by the launch of 4G services by all operators and customers' great appetite  for  mobile  Internet  services.  At  the  same  time,  Telecom Egypt, the incumbent, previously operating only in the fixed market, launched a new mobile operator under the WE brand as part of a r o a m i n g  a g r e e m e n t  w i t h  E t i s a l a t .

Orange is pursuing its development strategy with the aim of extending its international footprint and expertise in this field.\n\nIn  2020,  the  Enterprise  sector  generated  17.5%  of  the  Group's consolidated revenue.\n\n## The market\n\nThe unprecedented global health crisis resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic  had  a  major  impact  on  2020.  Political  decisions  and protective measures implemented in countries across the world had a major impact on economic activity. In business sectors across the board, companies and their employees had to adapt quickly\n\nThe strong growth in 2020 is attributable to continuous improvement in the quality of service and strong sales momentum. The development of B2B and Orange Money activities also accelerated in 2020.\n\n## Mauritius\n\nThe Orange group has been present in Mauritius since 2000 through a partnership with the incumbent operator, Mauritius Telecom, in which it holds 40% of the capital.\n\nMauritius Telecom is the leader in Internet and fixed telecom services in Mauritius, ahead of DCL, and in mobile services ahead of Emtel and MTML, with market share of 50.5% at end-2020 (source: GSMA).\n\nThe operator offers a comprehensive range of fixed and mobile data and voice services. It also offers convergence packages (voice, IP and TV) through its MyT service. The first operator to launch 4G and a mobile payment service in 2012, Mauritius Telecom launched its fiber optic network (FTTH) in 2013 and now covers almost all of the country's households.\n\nThe  main  growth  drivers  for  Mauritius  Telecom  lie  in  content,  in particular with a strategy of investing in premium content, enabling Mauritius Telecom to strengthen its position as the market leader.\n\nThe company also offers international connectivity via fiber optic submarine cables.\n\nand change the way they work, prompting a review of processes and IT infrastructure in a bid to rise to new challenges such as the widespread rollout of telework.\n\nThe year's new challenges and the resulting changes in usage had a significant impact on the communications and IT services market for businesses. While the use of networks, the Cloud and collaborative tools increased significantly, companies' economic circumstances encouraged them to prioritize and reduce their expenses, particularly through  project  postponements  and  cancellations  in  the  field  of IT.  The  business  communication  and  IT  services  market  totaled approximately 1,240 billion euros worldwide in 2020, down 4.3% in constant currency (source: Gartner, Q3 2020). The decline affected all services, both telecom services (-6.8%) and IT services (-3.2%), across all geographies.\n\nThe provision of telecommunication and IT services to companies is a highly competitive market. It is shared by many players, notably telecommunication  operators,  network  integrators,  managed  IT service  providers,  and  Internet  or  digital  players.  Given  the  large number of players, no reliable or pertinent information is available on market shares.\n\nIn the specific cybersecurity services market, Orange now ranks as a major player, with one of the deepest footprints in Europe. Orange Cyberdefense ranked fourth in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region in 2020, and twelfth worldwide (source: Teknowlogy Group study, December 2020).\n\n## Orange Business Services activities\n\nOrange offers a wide range of products and services, including those t h a t  a r e  p a c k a g e d  o r  t a i l o r- m a d e  a n d  u s i n g  d i f f e r e n t  m e t h o d s  s u c h  a s integrated, managed or Cloud, aimed at guiding businesses in their digital transformation, and structured around their main challenges (connectivity,  mobility,  streamlining  of  processes,  smoothness  of exchanges with customers and support for their projects).",

Orange is particularly well  placed  in  terms  of  the  multi-cloud  solutions  that  its customers are increasingly demanding and for which it can share its experience in the construction, management and orchestration of large-scale complex structures,\n- -Digital & data solutions, including the Business & Decision subsidiary,  enable  the  design  of  digital  solutions  for customers  in  the  fields  of  Big  Data,  data  analytics  and artificial  intelligence,  in  addition  to  the  integration  and supply of systems, business applications and application programming  interface  (API).  Through  its  Enovacom subsidiary, Orange also offers healthcare players tailored solutions to meet the challenges of digital transformation,\n- -Cyberdefense  solutions  covering  infrastructure  and users,  in  managed  and  integrated  or  Cloud  mode  (safe work  environments  and  infrastructure,  cyberdefense, management and governance), supervised from a security operations center (see Section 4.1.1.2 Business opportunity: Orange Cyberdefense),\n- -Smart mobility solutions are based not only on mobile technologies, but also on the IoT (Internet of Things),\n- -Unified communication and collaboration services include interoperability between telephony, messaging and video conference solutions, in triple or quadruple play,\n- -Lastly,  advice  and  services  to  customers  include  needs analysis,  solution  architecture,  support  from  rollout  to implementation, user training and administration of services and solutions in a range of areas: transition to all-IP, adopting Machine to Machine and the Internet of Things, supervising and  managing  quality  of  service,  switching  to  Cloud infrastructure  solutions,  and  the  digital  transformation  of companies.\n\nThese  offers  are  also  used  to  develop  cross-sector  business solutions (finance, transport, energy, government and public sector, geolocation and fleet management, etc.).\n\nAs  regards  its  core  business  as  an  operator,  Orange  relies  on international  partners  to  supplement  its  offer  and  geographical coverage  in  areas  where  its  customers  operate  and  where  its presence does not offer a comprehensive solution. The Group is working  to  build  this  type  of  partnership  in  the  most  developed markets, preferably with the leading operator or its direct competitor, like NTT Communications in Japan or AT&T in the United States.\n\nOrange  also  works  in  close  collaboration  with  an  ecosystem  of international  technological  partners,  who  are  leaders  in  their respective  fields  of  connectivity,  unified  communication,  Cloud infrastructure,  effective  data  use  or  cybersecurity.  In  2020,  two strategic partnerships were announced: the first with Google Cloud (around  data  services,  artificial  intelligence,  the  Cloud  and  edge computing) and the second with Amazon Web Services (around innovation in the Enterprise Cloud and digital transformation). For more information on these two partnerships, see Section 1.3 Significant events.  In  addition,  Orange  is  a  founding  member  of  the  Gaia-X European sovereign Cloud project launched in November, which comes at a key moment in the multi-cloud digital transformation of companies.\n\nLastly, Orange is developing partnerships with service operators to develop a common business approach to offer innovative solutions for its customers. For example, in November 2020, this approach prompted Orange to invest in LBO France's Digital Health 2 (DH2) f u n d to speed up the development of e-health in France and Europe.\n\nThe health sector is a key focus of the Engage 2025 strategic plan. With that in mind, Orange Business Services decided to combine its health business within the Enovacom subsidiary from October 1, 2020 in order to intensify synergies and support the digital transformation of healthcare players. Through Enovacom, Orange aims to become a leader in digital health in France.\n\nIn 2020, Orange signed a series of major contracts to support its customers around the world, notably with AkzoNobel to drive its digital transformation through secure end-to-end global connectivity services,  and  with  KDDI,  a  Japanese  telecommunication  service provider, to equip more than 1 million Toyota and Mazda vehicles with  connected  device  services.  Orange  also  co-innovated  with Schneider Electric by launching the first indoor rollout of 5G in the industrial sector in France on experimental spectrum allocated by Arcep as part of a pilot project (see Section 1.3 Significant events).\n\nMeanwhile,  Orange  Cyberdefense  continued  the  integration  of SecureData  and  SecureLink,  two  companies  acquired  in  2019. Its integrated model makes for global presence and local support enabling it to tailor solutions to the needs of its customers.\n\n## 1.4.5 International Carriers & Shared Services\n\nThe  operating  activities  of  the  International  Carriers  &  Shared Services segment include:\n\n- -international  carrier  activities  undertaken  by  the  Wholesale International Networks Division (rollout of the international and long-haul network, sales of international telephony and services to  international  carriers,  and  installation  and  maintenance  of submarine cables); and\n- -the activities of OCS and Orange Studio in content.\n\nThe segment also includes other cross-cutting activities of the Group, in particular research and innovation (see Section 1.6), or real-estate, as well a s s u p p o r t  a n d  s h a r e d  a c t i v i t i e s  i n c l u d i n g  c o r p o r a t e  f u n c t i o n s at the headquarters.\n\nThe operating activities of the segment accounted for 2.2% of the Group's consolidated revenue in 2020.\n\n## 1.4.5.1 International Carrier activities\n\nThe  wholesale  operator  market  comprises  three  categories  of players: global wholesalers, multinational retail operators (including Orange) and regional or specialist players.\n\nThe  wholesale  market's  customer  base  comprises  voice  market specialists (call-shop, prepaid cards), fixed and mobile domestic retail carriers (including MVNOs), Internet access and content providers and OTT players. International carriers also sell wholesale traffic to each other.\n\n- 1\n\n1",

        "page_content": "1 -\n\nWholesale  International  Networks  (WIN)  offers  a  broad  range  of solutions on the international market. Its business is structured on a large infrastructure of long-haul networks. Its presence in both the retail and wholesale markets means it can develop solutions that are particularly well adapted to the needs of the retail operators.\n\nThe  Group  is  notable  for  being  heavily  involved  in  the  design, construction and operation of submarine cables. With its ownership or co-ownership of several cable systems, Orange ranks among the world's largest owners of submarine links. This has enabled it to satisfy the increase in transatlantic traffic.\n\nThe Group's wholesale activity is based on:\n\n- -a seamless global network (1) and  an  IPX  protocol  network (2) supporting voice and data with points of presence throughout the world;\n- -a global network of dedicated IP routes with end users in more than  220  countries,  connections  to  more  than  200  Internet service providers, and connectivity in over 100 countries in a single IP network hop;\n- -99.99% network availability, and centralized network supervision 24/ 7.\n\nIn  2020, IP data traffic increased by 29%, very sustained growth intensified by the health crisis.\n\n## Offers\n\n## Voice services\n\nVoice service solutions enable operators worldwide to transit their customers'  calls  internationally  to  over  1,200  destinations  with 24/7 technical support.\n\n## Services to mobile operators\n\nWith mobile services solutions, Orange offers roaming as a result of direct connections with over 200 mobile operators as well as broad connectivity enabling it to offer messaging services.\n\n## Internet and transmission services\n\nOrange's data and IP network includes terrestrial, submarine and satellite systems which combine to create a vast global network. With its Internet network, Orange offers adjustable solutions to meet the needs of Internet service or content providers.\n\n## Convergence services\n\nOrange provides operators with a multiservice offer to enable them to manage their voice and mobile data ser v i c e s ove r a s i n g l e  c o n n e c t i o n .\n\n## Security and anti-fraud services\n\nTo protect the value of its customers' business, Orange Wholesale International Networks offers solutions covering the protection of identity  and  privacy  and  that  of  its  networks,  mobile  traffic  and voice traffic.\n\nThe  portfolio  of  anti-fraud  and  security  services  relies  on  voice, Internet and mobile service solutions. These offers include audit, detection and protection functions as well as the provision of analysis reports. The portfolio also contains offers that focus on the fight against the dangers of cybercrime. Orange Wholesale International Networks' customers can resell some of these offers to their own customers.\n\n## Orange Marine\n\nOrange  Marine  is  a  major  player  in  submarine  cables,  from  the early research and engineering stage through to the setting up of intercontinental connections and the maintenance of existing cables. In total, Orange Marine has installed more than 265,000 kilometers of s u b m a r i n e  c a b l e s  ( i n c l u d i n g  o v e r  3 0 , 0 0 0  k i l o m e t e r s  o f  b u r i e d  c a b l e s ) across all oceans and carried out surveys on over 80,000 kilometers of seabed. Its vessels carried out more than 850 repairs on defective cables, some of which were performed at a depth of 5,000 meters. Orange Marine has a cable-laying fleet of seven vessels (six cable ships and one submarine research ship). It represents 15% of the global fleet and is one of the most experienced worldwide.\n\nIn  2020,  Orange  Marine  operated  without  significant  interruption despite the global health crisis, with vessels in operation in the Atlantic and Pacific, as well as in the Mediterranean and Indian Ocean. For more information on the announcements made by Orange regarding submarine cables, see Section 1.3 Significant events.\n\n## 1.4.5.2 Content  activities\n\nContent distribution activities (TV, video-on-demand, music, video games) are a key component of Orange's strategy as a multi-service operator, with over 10 million households in Europe connected to its TV universe at the end of 2020. These activities help promote the Group's very high-speed broadband offers.\n\nOrange's  content  strategy  is  primarily  based  on  developing partnerships with rights holders and service publishers. Orange is focused on its role of aggregator and distributor by referencing the best entertainment services available in order to offer them to its customers through its broadband networks.\n\nIn France, Orange is also developing an ambitious policy of producing and co-producing films and series, and broadcasting them via its Orange Studio subsidiary and its premium service, OCS. All OCS programs are available via scheduled programming and on-demand. Most distributors offer OCS and it can be accessed directly online. At end-2020, OCS had nearly 3 million subscribers.\n\nOrange Studio's business was heavily impacted by the Covid-19 health crisis. 2021 was a shortened year, as movie theaters were open for less than seven months, and barely two and a half months under normal operating conditions. Against that backdrop, Orange Studio reduced the number of releases of its films in theaters and turned to platforms. Amazon thus acquired the rights to Kheiron's 'Brutus vs. C\u00e9sar', and Netflix started screening 'Cuban Network' by  Olivier  Assayas.  Among  series,  the  critically  acclaimed  d\u00e9but original production 'Cheyenne and Lola' has been available on OCS since November 2020. Furthermore, 'La Belle Epoque' by Nicolas Bedos picked up three C\u00e9sar awards out of its eight nominations at the ceremony held on February 28, 2020.\n\nIn  Romania,  the  acquisition  of  Telekom  Romania,  announced  in November 2020, will strengthen Orange's position, making it number two in TV in 2021.\n\nIn addition, Deezer, an Orange partner since 2010, continues to grow. Its services, available in France, Romania, Luxembourg and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, have been extended more recently to Egypt and Morocco, and will be rolled out by other subsidiaries in the Africa and Middle East region in 2021. At the same time, Orange continues to roll out Orange Radio, its radio and podcast service available in 18 European and African countries, on mobile, web, TV and connected devices.",

Lastly, the video game market continues its double-digit growth, boosted by\n\n## 1.4.6 Mobile financial services\n\nMobile financial services are a key component of Orange's Engage 2025 strategy. With the expansion of its multiservice activities on the African continent, B2B and IT services, mobile financial services are one of the Group's three growth drivers. The Mobile Financial Services business segment accordingly includes the activities of Orange Bank and Orange Bank Africa. Orange Money's business continues to be driven by geographical segments.\n\n## The banking market\n\nThe European banking sector is currently undergoing far-reaching change, marked by:\n\n- -the  emergence  of  unforeseen  risks,  such  as  the  Covid-19 pandemic,  and  an  uncertain  economic  climate  weighing  on both revenue and cost of risk;\n- -an enduring environment of low interest rates, which undermines the  profitability  of  banks'  lending  activity  by  narrowing  their margins, despite the European Central Bank's accommodating monetary policy;\n- -the need to adapt to regulatory developments (DSP2, GDPR, etc.) in the face of more vigilant regulatory authorities (ACPR, CNIL, etc.);\n- -increased  competition  and  fragmentation  of  supply  (online trading, account aggregators, open banking, etc.);\n- -a  boom  in  digital  uses  that  is  reshaping  customer  behavior (autonomous,  distant,  volatile,  demanding)  towards  banks and  prompting  the  integration  of  new  technologies  (instant payment, data and AI, blockchain, etc.) for greater innovation and performance.\n\nThe very intense competition in this market comes from players in several major categories:\n\n- -the large conventional banking networks, which are gradually adapting  their  offering,  structure  and  workforce  to  the  new environment  (7.6%  of  bank  branches  were  closed  between 2010 and 2019);\n- -online banks, some of which are part of the large incumbent banking  networks,  which  mainly  emerged  in  the  2000s (Boursorama Banque, ING Direct, etc.);\n- -neobanks (such as Orange Bank), which appeared in the 2010s and are based on a mobile application and a simplified customer experience. In competition with online and conventional banks, innovation  is  their  key  means  of  capturing  market  share:  the number of current accounts opened in neobanks has increased by  150%  in  the  space  of  two  years  and  there  are  just  over 3.5 million active accounts in France (source: ACPR 2020 study, 'Neobanks in search of profitability');\n- -fintechs (financing platforms, means of payment and account aggregators);\n- -tech giants offering mobile payment solutions, including Apple Pay, the Facebook Messenger payment function, Samsung Pay, Android Pay, etc. They can offer financial services directly thanks to their banking licenses;\n- -large retailers (Leclerc, Fnac-Darty, etc.), which are aiming to become links in the mobile financial services value chain, and new players from all backgrounds that continue to emerge in the banking market (MafrenchBank, Uber Money, Free, Starling Bank).\n\nIn  the  West  African  Economic  and  Monetary  Union,  the  banking sector experienced an increase in activity indicators (total balance\n\nmultiple periods of lockdown in 2020. In this segment, Orange has strengthened its Cloud Gaming offering on Orange TV in France and its unlimited mobile gaming subscriptions in more than 15 countries.\n\nsheet, resources, uses of funds, portfolio quality, etc.) in the first half  of  2020,  despite  the  unfavorable  economic  climate  resulting from the pandemic.\n\nThe sector was marked by the cut in the BCEAO key interest rates in June 2020, the postponement of the transitional provisions of the Basel II / I I I  r e f o r m  o n  c a p i t a l  r a t i o s  a n d  i n c r e a s e d  c o m p e t i t i o n  i n  d i g i t a l technology. In addition, the BCEAO has announced the launch of its interoperability project in 2021, which will impact the entire mobile money and banking ecosystem.\n\nThe very intense competition in this market comes from:\n\n- -aggregators offering interoperable payment solutions (KKiaPay, Intouch, etc.);\n- -mobile money operators such as MTN with MomoCash; and\n- -conventional banks: all banking institutions are developing their digital channels via mobile applications.\n\n## Mobile Financial Services activities\n\n## Orange Bank\n\nOrange Bank is positioned at the frontier of the banking and telecom sectors.\n\nModeled originally on the mobile uses of customers, in France, the offer carries no conditions related to income, savings or minimum balance. There are no bank charges attached to accounts and their associated bank cards (subject to certain terms and conditions of use).  All  basic  banking  services  are  offered:  bank  account,  bank card, checkbook, authorized overdraft, savings account, \u00e0 la carte insurance  and  personal  loans.  Customers  can  perform  all  their banking operations on a mobile handset. Moreover, when opening a  bank  account,  customers  have  access  to  a  network  of  nearly 300 Orange stores approved as banking operation and payment service intermediaries.\n\nRelying heavily on telecom functions, Orange Bank's innovations offer  customers  the  ability  to  make  contactless  payments  with credit cards or via mobile handsets, immediate access to their bank account balance, temporary blocking and unblocking of their credit card from the application, and to request and send money by text message. Customer relationships are managed by a virtual advisor, available 24/7, with the possibility of using the customer relationship center located in France.\n\n2019  was  dedicated  to  the  launch  of  a  premium  bank  card (which  comes  with  a  price  advantage  in  the  form  of  cashback for  purchases  in  Orange  stores)  and  a  financing  offer  available in  Orange  stores  enabling  customers  to  finance  their  equipment purchases  (smartphones,  phones,  tablets,  connected  devices and accessories). At the same time, significant investments in the continuous improvement of the app resulted in a 1 point increase in the app's rating on stores year-on-year, giving the bank one of the best NPSs in the market (Source: Bain/Dynata global retail banking survey 2019).\n\nIn 2020, Orange Bank consolidated its development with insurance offers that can be taken out on mobile devices 24/7. This change is the result of the integration in the first half-year of Orange Courtage, which  in  particular  sells  insurance  for  mobile  devices  and  had 549,000  individual  customers  at  December  31,  2020.  The  bank has thus reached a new milestone in its cross-selling policy with Orange by becoming an insurance broker, while at the same time increasing the scope to assist its customer base with their equipment purchases.\n\n- 1\n\n1",

This bank, which is 100% mobile, offers Orange customers  a  selection  of  savings  accounts,  checking  accounts, Mastercard  credit  cards,  and  group  management  as  well  as numerous discounts on Orange phone bills. Innovations include the Group management function, which enables funds and expenses to be shared or transferred between several people, giving customers the option to manage joint subscriptions such as water bills or Netflix accounts. Since the summer of 2020, Orange Bank Spain has also been offering consumer credit and a solution for financing purchases of mobile phones in stores. The app is currently rated 4.9 on stores, making it the best-rated in Spain (Source: xxx).\n\nAt December 31, 2020, Orange Bank had nearly 1.2 million customers in France and Spain. This number includes customers who have opened an account with Orange Bank, as well as customers of credit and mobile insurance offers.\n\n## 1.5 Orange's  networks\n\nFor Orange group, the networks are a strategic asset and, as such, are subject to constant supervision, maintenance and modernization. Orange's strategic plan, Engage 2025, launched in December 2019, is based on four key ambitions, including reinventing its operator model by capitalizing on its network advances (see Section 1.2.2 The Orange group strategy).\n\nAt end-2020, the Orange group operated networks in 26 countries to serve its B2C customers and in nearly 200 countries or territories to  serve  its  B2B  customers.  Orange  is  continuing  to  modernize its networks to provide its customers with ever greater and more enhanced connectivity in all its locations.\n\nThe Group's investments in its networks, other than those to maintain their  quality  (pole,  cable  and  mast replacement) are designed to improve these networks in a number of respects:\n\n- -t h e  d e v e l o p m e n t  o f  v e r y  h i g h - s p e e d  fi x e d  a n d  m o b i l e  b r o a d b a n d (FTTH  and  4G/5G),  increased  data  transfer  volumes  and reduced  connection  latency.  These  investments  concern  all networks, from the mobile radio network and household Internet connectivity to submarine cables;\n- -user migration from old technologies (analog telephony, copper networks, 2G, 3G) to new technologies;\n- -gradual virtualization of network control functions ('programmability'  of  networks  so  that  they  can  be  adapted more quickly to new services and uses);\n\n## Orange Bank Africa\n\nIn July 2020, Orange and NSIA, a leading bancassurance provider, announced the launch of Orange Bank Africa's commercial activities in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire after obtaining a banking license from the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) in 2019. Orange Bank Africa aims to meet the needs of a large part of the population excluded from the conventional banking world by enabling them to borrow or save small amounts essential for their daily lives. Orange Bank Africa plans to expand into Senegal, Mali and Burkina Faso.\n\nOrange Bank Africa offers an innovative service:\n\n- -instantly accessible to everyone, regardless of location, time, mobile phone generation or the level of income or savings;\n- -easy to use; and\n- -offering attractive borrowing and savings terms for low-income people.\n\nThe  successful  launch  of  Orange  Bank  Africa  resulted  in  the acquisition of 356,000 customers by the end of December 2020 with its pico-credit and savings offers via Orange Money. More than 467,000 loans were granted in a total amount of 15.5 billion CFA francs, thereby contributing to the economic and social development of the populations concerned. Orange Bank Africa enables the Group to participate more fully in the economic activity of its host countries and  thus  remains  in  perfect  harmony  with  the  regional  financial inclusion strategy promoted by the BCEAO.\n\n- -automation of network operation, which improves the quality of service for customers.\n\nT h e  n e t w o r k s  a r e  v e r y  e x t e n s i v e .

IP transmission and transport networks connect access networks with  each  other  and  with  the  networks  of  other  operators  in  the relevant  country,  as  well  as  with  international  networks.

        "page_content": "## 1.5.1 Access  networks\n\n## Fixed access networks\n\n## Analog access and ADSL/vDSL broadband access\n\nCopper access is made up of a pair of copper wires that connect each customer to a concentration point and give the latter access, via the distribution and transport network, to a local switch. It is used to deliver analog voice services and broadband access services.\n\nOrange operates copper access networks in France and Poland, and in various countries in Africa and the Middle East (C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Jordan, Senegal), to provide analog voice access services and data in the B2C, B2B and wholesale markets.\n\nFixed broadband ADSL /vDSL access (for voice applications, Internet access and television) is available in:\n\n- -France and Poland, with coverage approaching 100% on the incumbent local loop;\n- -countries in the Africa and Middle East region, where Orange is the operator of the copper local loop;\n- -other  countries  (including  Egypt,  Spain  and  Slovakia),  where Orange  uses  the  local  loop  of  incumbent  operators,  either unbundled or via bitstream-type offers;\n- -Belgium and Romania, where broadband offers are marketed using the network of third-party operators;\n- -Moldova, where, following the acquisition of Sun Communications, Orange operates a cable network.\n\nNetworks  and  services  based  on  copper  access  are  used  less and less as users move to very high-speed broadband. They are therefore constantly being optimized and, in France, a timetable has been drawn up for the gradual discontinuation of the analog voice telephone service, and the removal of the copper network:\n\n- -since the end of 2018: end of the marketing of new analog voice telephony lines;\n- -from the end of 2023: technical discontinuation of the analog voice telephony service, by geographical area;\n- -phasing out of the copper access network from 2023, with an estimated completion date of 2030.\n\n## Very high-speed broadband fiber optic access\n\nFTTH (Fiber To The Home) network access extends the available broadband  ADSL/vDSL  service  offer  to  include  upstream  and downstream very high-speed broadband (up to 1 Gbit/s and more), with improved performance, in particular in terms of response time.\n\nIn France, Orange has been deploying FTTH access for over ten years using GPON technology, which can pool several very high-speed broadband accesses on a single fiber without impairing the capacity of  each  access  point's  capacity  to  increase  speed.  The  rollout of the FTTH network started in 2007 in a few major French cities and was then expanded to all large cities. During the years 2011 and  2012,  Orange  entered  into  sharing  arrangements  with  other telecom operators to speed up fiber optic rollout. In 2020, the rollout continued at a steady pace despite the health crisis, and Orange consolidated its leadership in France: a total of 22.9 million homes were connectable to Orange fiber at the end of 2020 (see Section 1.3 Significant events).\n\nOrange is also rolling out fiber in Spain, where its FTTH network covered 14.9 million connectable households at end-2020. An FTTH fiber network has also been rolled out in Poland, with connectivity offered to some 5.0 million households, as well as in Slovakia, with 600,000 connectable households. The rollout of FTTH networks is also underway in Jordan, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Morocco and Senegal.\n\nOrange shares its fixed access network in its three main countries, France, Spain and Poland, and intends to share certain future FTTH rollouts with other operators via FiberCos, possibly involving third parties. See Section 1.2.2 The Orange group strategy - Monetization of the networks and execution of the infrastructure strategy.\n\n## Radio and satellite access\n\nIn various African countries and in Eastern Europe, fixed services are provided through 4G/LTE in addition to copper and fiber optic networks.\n\nOther than copper, fiber and radio access, fixed residential access and satellite  television  services  are  marketed  via  space  capacity rental.\n\n## Mobile access networks\n\nThe GSM (2G), UMTS (3G), LTE (4G) and now 5G access networks support  voice  and  data  communication  services  that  reach average speeds of several tens of Mbit/s and up to several hundred in  optimal conditions, which makes it easier to send and receive voluminous content (audio, photo and video). The Group operates a mobile network in each of the countries where it offers consumer telecommunication services. The network supports GSM, UMTS and LTE technologies in all countries; in Europe, it also supports 5G technology.\n\nTo reduce its environmental impact and operating costs, Orange shares more than half of its radio sites with a competitor. Sharing can be either 'passive' (confined to masts only), or 'active' (masts and acti v e  e q u i p m e n t ) .  S h a r i n g  o f  t h i s  n a t u r e ,  w h i c h  p r e v i o u s l y  c o n c e r n e d 2G/3G/4G technologies, now includes 5G. Passive sharing is in place in almost all of the Group's host countries. Active sharing, which is more effective, has mainly been adopted in the following countries:\n\n- -Poland, for nearly all of the mobile access network;\n- -Spain, where the mobile access network is shared outside major cities (those with more than 175,000 inhabitants);\n- -F r a n c e, for 4G coverage of dead zones including the 2,000 new sites of the New Deal program;\n- -Belgium,  where  an  active  mobile  access  network  sharing agreement  was  signed  with  a  competitor  in  2019.  Work  to consolidate the two networks, which was underway at the end of 2020, will span several years; and\n- -Romania, for sites in rural areas.\n\n2020 was marked by:\n\n- -5G rollouts in European countries, allowing commercial launches to go ahead in Poland, Spain, Luxembourg and France;\n- -the implementation of sharing agreements in Spain and Belgium, and the New Deal agreement in France between the government, Arcep and the four mobile operators to ensure better mobile coverage in rural areas (see section 1.7.1.2.2 Regulation of mobile telephony).\n\n- 1\n\n1",

These networks support voice and data traffic, for fixed and mobile retail (B2C and B2B) and wholesale services. Optical links offer bandwidth of up to 400 Gbit/s per wavelength, and Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) technology makes it possible to have up to 80 wavelengths per fiber. Orange is one of the world leaders in the use of advanced optical functions to obtain a more flexible transmission network.\n\nThe IP network consists of routers connected to the transmission network.  In  France,  an  IP  network  dedicated  to  businesses  is also  in  operation,  in  addition  to  the  network  managing  data  for B2C customers. The main purpose of this network is to connect a company's French sites for internal data exchange on a Virtual\n\n## 1.5.3 International  networks\n\n## Terrestrial network\n\nThe international terrestrial network comprises four main networks, connected via submarine cables:\n\n- -the  European  network,  whose  rollout  began  in  April  2012  in France, and which has been extended to include services in Frankfurt, London, Barcelona and Madrid, as well as submarine cable stations;\n- -the North American backbone served by the two arms of the TAT-14 transatlantic cable system;\n- -the Asian backbone in Singapore served by the SEA-ME-WE3 and SEA-ME-WE4 submarine cables; and\n- -Djoliba, the first pan-African backbone, brought into service in November 2020. This infrastructure is based on a terrestrial fiber optic network coupled with submarine cables, thereby offering secure  international  connectivity  from  West  Africa.  The  new backbone covers eight countries, Burkina Faso, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Mali, Nigeria and Senegal.\n\n## Satellites\n\nOrange uses satellite communications to provide VSAT (Very Small Aperture Terminal) services to Orange Business Services' terrestrial or maritime B2B customers and to ensure connection with isolated mobile sites in Africa and IP or voice connectivity to other operators. To provide those services, Orange uses rented space capacity from satellite operators (such as Eutelsat, Intelsat, SES and Arabsat).\n\nPrivate Network (VPN) and provide it with Internet connectivity. It also provides Voice over IP transport for companies.\n\nThe control network (also known as the signaling network) manages calls  and  data  connections,  updates  of  location  data  for  mobile phones, roaming and SMS. This network is being upgraded to new standards, for example to manage 5G.\n\nIn the countries in which it has fixed operations, Orange operates a switched telephone network (STN) to deliver analog voice and ISDN digital  services.  These  networks  are  continually  being  optimized because of declining usage. In France, Orange stopped marketing its analog voice services at the end of 2018, and announced the first zones where voice services will only be available using IP technology from the end of 2023.\n\nOrange has also rolled out fixed VoIP networks using IMS technology ( I P  M u l t i m e d i a S u b sy s te m) i n m a ny c ountries for B2C and B2B uses.\n\nUntil 2015, all mobile voice traffic was managed in switch mode by t h e  m o b i l e  n e t w o r k  i n  e a c h  c o u n t r y.  I n  2 0 15 ,  O r a n g e  r o l l e d  o u t  m o b i l e IMS infrastructure  in  European  countries  to  offer  VoLTE  services (VoIP over LTE) and VoWiFi (mobile Voice over WiFi). At end-2020, VoLTE and VoWiFi had been rolled out in all of the Group's European networks and were used by millions of customers.\n\n## Submarine cables\n\nTo address the strong growth in international telecommunication traffic  and  in  a  highly  competitive  market,  Orange  is  maintaining its  level  of  investment  in  submarine  cables  and  is  continuing  to develop its network in order to meet the needs of its customers. Due to the high cost of investments required in the construction of cables, such investments are carried out with the different players involved (operators, private companies, GAFAM) and in various forms (consortiums, purchase of user rights, transmission-capacity rental, etc.).\n\nOrange is a partner in some 50 consortiums covering various routes: North Atlantic, Caribbean, Europe-Asia, Europe-Africa. In 2019, the PEACE project was confirmed with the signing of an agreement to lay a new cable linking France with East Africa and Pakistan and to bring it into service in 2021.\n\n## International service control networks\n\nOrange operates an international control network to manage the s i g n a l i n g  a s s o c i a t e d  w i t h  t h e  v o i c e  t r a f fi c ,  r o a m i n g  a n d  t e x t  m e s s a g i n g of  its  mobile  networks  and those of its operator customers. This network is evolving to handle new standards such as 5G.\n\nOrange also operates a network for the supply of voice services for  international  businesses,  based  on  the  international  IP  MPLS network.\n\nIn  addition,  several  centralized  platforms  were  rolled  out  on  the international transit points to provide value-added services to mobile operators.",

In 2020, the\n\nGroup devoted 643 million euros (i.e. 1.5% of revenue) to furthering its research and innovation activities, including employee costs and operating and capital expenditure related to research and innovation for new products and services.\n\n## 1.6.1 Research and innovation\n\nOrange is currently a le ading pr i vate p l aye r i nvo l v e d i n  d i g i t a l  r e s e a r c h i n Fr a n c e .  I n  a  r a p i d l y  c h a n g i n g  w o r l d ,  O r a n g e  a i m s  t o  b e  a  c o m m i t t e d player in current and future transformations including connectivity, especially  with  5G  and  6G,  responsible  artificial  intelligence,  the Internet of Things on a large scale, and digital technology with low environmental impact, synonymous with trust and sovereignty. The Group is developing open research that dif ferentiates Orange from its competitors and offers inclusive innovation that is both accessible to all and focused on a positive vision of progress. Bringing together its acti v i t i e s  a r o u n d  t h e  c r e a t i o n  o f  s t r a t e g i c  i n n o v a t i o n ,  r e s e a r c h  a n d  t h e implementation of technical and data policies for the Orange group, the Technology and Global Innovation (TGI) Division is the driving force behind this innovation. Against the backdrop of rapid changes in our customers' uses and expectations, the TGI Division is building competitive and value-creating assets for the Group. Its mission, ' P r e p a r e  t h e  f u t u r e ,  b u i l d  t h e  p r e s e n t ',  i s  p a r t  o f  t h e  G r o u p 's  s t r a t e g y.\n\nOrange is convinced that using data and artificial intelligence (AI) in a responsible, useful and accessible way will open new prospects for  individuals,  society  and  the  planet.  The  Group  invests  in  the French  and  European  research  and  innovation  ecosystem,  joins forces with many start-ups and industrial partners and participates in the European AI agenda. Its research teams provide support in three priority areas: making networks smarter, improving operational efficiency and reinventing the customer experience. Orange offers a  host  of  skills  development  systems  in  AI  and  Data:  for  people retraining with the 'Microsoft AI School' created in association with Microsoft and Simplon, for apprentices with the Orange Apprentice Training Center and its 'Data' program, and for young people and Group  employees.  Orange  also  supports  initiatives  to  promote responsible and inclusive use of AI. In 2020, for instance, the Group strengthened its support for Impact AI, a think and do tank devoted to the social challenges of AI, and launched an International Charter for  Inclusive  AI  with  the  Arborus  fund.  Orange  was  also  the  first company to obtain the GEEIS-IA label for its initiatives in the design, development and use of inclusive AI.\n\nSupplying its customers with the best connectivity is key to Orange's strategy.  5G  technology  enables  improved  connection  speed  to mobile services, with average speeds 3 to 4 times faster than 4G thanks to smart antennas installed on existing 4G sites. It is initially being rolled out in urban areas where 4G is in high demand and in areas with high levels of economic activity to ease the load on other networks. After an initial commercial launch in Romania at the end of 2019, Orange successively launched 5G in Poland, Spain, Luxembourg and France in 2020. Rollouts will continue gradually in those countries over the 2021-2023 period, as well as in other countries where the Group operates in Europe, Africa and the Middle East, depending on the availability of spectrum. From 2023, when the core networks move to 5G, Orange will be in a position to offer lower latency and network slicing by allocating certain network slices to cover critical usage or specific needs.\n\n5G is an essential lever for the Group to achieve its commitment to be 'Net Zero Carbon by 2040'. It will progressively be more energy efficient than 4G, and up to 10 times more efficient by 2025. For\n\nthe general public, 5G will promote the development of even more interactive, immersive and contextualized experiences for learning, working, communicating, playing and improving daily lives.\n\nIts  technical  performance  will  also  make  5G  a  lever  for  business competitiveness and regional development. Combined with other technologies  like  edge  computing,  artificial  intelligence  and  the Internet of Things, 5G will open up a host of opportunities including the  optimization  of  production  processes  and  better  support  for isolated  workers  during  maintenance  operations.  It  will  make  it possible for the environmental impact of activities in a wide range of sectors including water, energy, waste, transport, buildings and smart  cities  to  be  managed  with  very  high  accuracy.  Advances are also slated for telehealth, thanks to videoconferencing and the real-time transmission of high-definition medical imagery. In 2020, Orange conducted a number of case studies on the future use of 5G with companies in Europe, notably as part of co-innovation projects. The Group is also continuing its initiatives to stimulate innovation and enable start-ups and SMEs to test their existing and future solutions with 5G coverage.\n\nOrange is continuing to roll out dedicated IoT networks in Europe: its LoRaWAN \u00ae network is steadily being extended in Romania and Slovakia,  and  Orange  now  offers  nationwide  LTE-M  coverage  in Poland.  In  the  B2B  market,  Orange  has  developed  its  customer base with the 'Smart Operations' offer, which includes the supply of sensors and secure connectivity to the LoRaWAN \u00ae network and the business line management interface. In the B2C market, Orange has enhanced its Maison Connect\u00e9e home automation offering in France by signing a partnership with Somfy and launched a comprehensive range of smart objects that can be controlled via a mobile app under the 'Smart Home' label in Belgium.\n\nOrange is also focusing its connectivity innovation on the virtualization of network control functions (which allows for the emergence of new services and offers greater flexibility), and their automation. Artificial intelligence algorithms make it possible to automate and optimize various actions such as detecting the cause in the event of a failure on a fiber customer's line or adapting mobile capacity in real time in line with change in traffic volumes during the day. In 2020, Orange signed a strategic partnership with Google to intensify its IT and digital transformation and develop new Cloud services, particularly in edge computing (see Section 1.3 Significant events).\n\nFor the environment, Orange is one of the sector's pioneers, with its green network approach already going back several years. The Green  program,  which  has  already  reduced  the  Group's  energy consumption linked to network and information system operations (see Section 4.4.2.1 Network energy consumption), continues under the Engage 2025 strategic plan. It will build notably on the energy efficiency of 5G and the eco-design of Data centers, as well as the use of data and AI, to further reduce energy consumption caused by  network  elements.  Orange's  commitment  to  green  networks is  also  reflected  in  the  purchase  of  renewable  energy.  In  2020, Orange signed several power purchase agreements (PPA), multi-year contracts for the purchase of electricity produced by solar or wind farms, in Spain, France and Poland.\n\n- 1\n\n1",

Used Group-wide, it requires half the volume of plastic backing of previous cards and can accommodate two chips rather than just one. This approach is further illustrated by the use of fully recycled plastic for the manufacture of Eco-SIM cards.\n\nIn  Africa  and  the  Middle  East,  September  2020  saw  Orange announce the launch of the Sanza Touch, the first Orange 4G Android smartphone (Go edition) at GSMA Thrive Africa 2020. It rounds out the Sanza range that Orange was marketing in 16 countries in the region at year-end 2020. Sanza Touch ranks as one of the most affordable  4G  smartphones  on  the  market,  enabling  Orange  to reaffirm its goal of providing more people with mobile Internet access and promoting digital inclusion. Brought out since October 2020, it was already sold in 4 countries at the end of 2020.\n\nOrange's research and innovation activities are conducted within the framework of an Open Innovation strategy to capture trends, find original solutions and benefit from partners' skills and contributions.\n\nThis is reflected in a number of developments:\n\n- -Orange signed nearly 60 research contracts with the world's top University research centers between 2018 and 2020, and has also set up two joint laboratories: one with INRIA on the virtualization of network functions, and the other on antennas\n\nwit h  t h e  U n i v e r s i t y  o f  N i c e .

Orange also funds five research chairs, including one with Institut MinesT\u00e9l\u00e9com on the values and policies of personal data;\n\n- -many start-ups benefit from Orange's support through a number of schemes including the Orange Fab program, which by the end of 2020 has helped accelerate the development of more than 500 start-ups in 18 countries spanning four continents. Orange is also developing its support for women start-up creators, with #FemmesEntrepreneuses and Women Start, as well as the best positive impact technological projects in Africa and the Middle East with the Orange Award for Social Entrepreneurship in Africa and the Middle East (known by its French acronym, POESAM), which is now in its eleventh year. It is also part of various global networks and events, including the Business France and French Tech networks;\n- -lastly,  Orange  has  an  active  policy  of  forming  strategic partnerships with leading industrial players worldwide, which allows it to enhance its portfolio of products and services and open itself to new ecosystems.\n\n## 1.6.2 Intellectual Property and Licensing\n\nThe  Intellectual  Property  and  Licensing  Department  protects, manages and adds value to Orange's patent portfolio, which is one of the Group's intangible assets. It also adds value to software. It is an asset that sets Orange apart from its academic and industry partners. Its role is also to defend the Group's interests in the event of disputes involving intellectual property.\n\n- At  December  31,  2020,  the  Orange  group  had  a  portfolio  of 8,770 patents or patent applications in France and abroad protecting its innovations. To maximize their value, some patents are licensed through patent pools for patents pertaining to industry standards (e.g.\n\n## 1.6.3 Capital  investment\n\nThe Orange group plays an important role in financing innovation in the IT industry, drawing on various investment vehicles:\n\n- -first, Orange Ventures, wholly owned by the Group: at the end of 2020, Orange strengthened its venture capital activit y by creating Orange Ventures, a new company with a budget of 350 million euros.  That  makes  it  one  of  Europe's  10  largest  corporate venture capital funds. Orange Ventures invests in fast-growing companies  in  Orange's  established  business  areas  such  as connectivity,  cybersecurity,  digital  enterprise  and  innovative financial  services,  as  well  as  in  new  areas  that  the  Group  is exploring, such as e-health;\n\nWith  offices  in  Paris  and  Dakar,  Orange  Ventures  supports start-ups at all stages of their development, from the seed stage in Africa and the Middle East, to more mature phases in Europe and the United States, with unit investments of up to 20 million euros per round of fundraising.\n\nFor Orange, Orange Ventures serves to promote the emergence of future technological champions helping drive the transition to an increasingly digital and responsible world in the service of the greatest number in order to share their innovation capabilities with the Group's 259 million customers worldwide.\n\nNFC, MPEG Audio, WiFi, HEVC). Value maximization also concerns software such as engineering tools for the mobile network.\n\nIn 2020, 225 new inventions were patented, including major technical contributions  to  standardization  (5G,  coding,  video,  etc.).  The Orange Labs network in France and abroad accounts for the bulk of  the  Group's  inventions.  Orange  ranks  seventeenth  among  the top  30  French  applicants  with  the  European  Patent  Office,  and eleventh  in  the  National  Industrial  Property  Institute's  ranking  of French applicants published in 2020.\n\nTo that end, Orange Ventures innovates by envisioning flexible and optional, but nevertheless highly structured processes for creating  synergies  between  Orange  and  start-ups.  Orange Ventures aims to match the financial performance of the best venture  capitalists,  and  will  make  its  investment  decisions independently. The 20-strong Orange Ventures team has been strengthened  with  acknowledged  experts  from  the  world  of venture capital. It has assumed the management of the Orange Digital Ventures portfolio, launched in 2015.\n\n- -external investment funds with holdings in unlisted companies and  managed  by  independent  management  companies,  in which  Orange  has  generally  invested  with  other  investors, mostly  industrial  companies,  but  occasionally  also  involving purely financial firms, include:\n- -the Iris Next fund and the three Orange Publicis Ventures funds (Growth, Global and Early-Stage), created within the framework  of  a  partnership  with  the  Publicis  group,  and managed by Iris Capital Management in which the Group is also involved at governance level,",

Orange  also  faces  specific  regulatory constraints in some countries due to its dominant position in the relevant markets. The risks linked to the regulation of the electronic communications sector are described in Section 2.1.2 Legal risks.\n\n## 1.7.1.1 European  Union\n\n## 1.7.1.1.1 Legal and regulatory framework\n\nThe  European  Union  has  laid  down  a  common  legal  framework aimed at harmonizing the regulation of electronic communications. It is binding on the member states and must be implemented by the National Regulatory Authorities.\n\nThe  general  legal  framework  of  the  European  Union  has  been amended by the European Electronic Communications Code, which came into force on December 20, 2018. It revises and combines four main directives deriving from the 2002 Telecom Package on:\n\n- -a common regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services;\n- -the authorization of electronic communications networks and services;\n- -access to and interconnection of electronic communications networks and associated facilities;\n- -universal  service  and  users'  rights  relating  to  electronic communications networks and services.\n\nFurthermore,  Regulation  (EC)  1211/2009  of  November  25,  2009, c a n c e l e d  a n d  r e p l a c e d  b y  R e g u l a t i o n  ( E U )  2 0 18 / 19 7 1  o f  D e c e m b e r  11, 2018, implemented the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC).\n\nThis  legal  framework  is  supplemented  by  sector-based  texts (international roaming, open Internet, etc.) as well as broader texts aimed at the European digital ecosystem (protection of privacy, etc.).\n\n## 1.7.1.1.2 Main community texts in force\n\n## The European Electronic Communications Code\n\nThe  European  Electronic  Communications  Code  (Directive  (EU) 2018/1972) came into force on December 20, 2018. The Member States then had 24 months to transpose it into national law. However, due to the health crisis, the transposition has not yet been completed in certain countries, particularly in Orange's European countries.\n\nThe Code includes a regulatory objective to support the deployment and  adoption  of  very  high-connectivity  networks  -  in  line  with Orange's wish to see regulator y objectives redirected toward suppor t for investment.\n\nIn  addition,  the  rules  governing access  obligations imposed on  operators  with  significant  market  power  have  been  positively adjusted in relation to the previous framework:\n\n- -access obligations should better target only the relevant fixed access infrastructure so as to address competition issues in the retail market;\n- -emphasis  is  placed  on  promoting  co-investment  in  very high-connectivity  networks.  If  an  operator  in  a  dominant position makes a co-investment offer that complies with certain provisions, it could be exempted from remedies related to its dominant status. Only co-investors will have access to the full capacity of these networks. The other operators will be able to enjoy the same quality of wholesale access as they did before the rollout of these networks. National regulators will need to secure approval from the European Commission for such measures;\n- -the Code also favors the wholesale operator model - not present in the retail market - by exempting it from certain remedies, even in cases of market dominance.\n\nIn  addition,  obligations  for  access  to  fixed  access  infrastructure serving subscribers may be imposed symmetrically on all operators when it is  not  technically  feasible  or  economically  reasonable  to replicate such infrastructure. These obligations are subject to a joint veto by the Commission and BEREC.\n\nConcerning the allocation of radio spectrum needed for mobile services, the Code reinforces European rules aimed at improved harmonization  and  cooperation  between  Member  States, including the minimum 20-year visibility of spectrum licenses. The implementation and in particular the allocation of spectral capacity remains a national affair with only light supervision from Europe. Provisions facilitating the deployment of 'small-area wireless access points' and the availability schedule of the 5G spectrum were also adopted.\n\n- 1\n\n1",

        "page_content": "1 -\n\nRegulation of activities\n\nWith  respect  to the  regulation  of  communication  services , most  of  the  obligations  intended  to  protect  end-users  are  for Internet access service and services using public numbering plan resources, independently of the service provider. Other services, such as interpersonal communication services independent of the numbering plan and signal transport services are only subject to a limited number of obligations.\n\nHowever, regulation of the competitive markets for intra-European cal l s  a n d  S M S  h a s  b e e n  i n t r o d u c e d  w i t h  t h e  C o d e  t h r o u g h  R e g u l a t i o n (EU) 2018-1971 of December 11, 2018, imposing a cap of 19 euro cents/minute and 6 euro cents/SMS, applicable since May 15, 2019.\n\nConcerning universa l service obligations ,  the  Code  abandons the principle of telephone service provision and calls on Member States to ensure the availability of affordable Internet access service, upholding  the  principle  of  potential  designation  should  Member States  consider  that  the  market  does  not  provide  such  services under said conditions, but increasing the burden of proof for Member States. The system of financing the universal service remains in the hands of the Member States, with coverage from public funds or from a fund financed by the sector. In addition, the Code opens the door to an extension of universal service obligations to include the supply of affordable mobile services.\n\nThe Code and its associated regulation on changes in BEREC's responsibilities and governance do not create a European regulator. However, the Code does adopt the principle of full standardization of the rights of end-users, subject to exceptions, and strengthens the  control  exercised  by  the  European  Commission  over  access regulation and over the spectrum.\n\nTo help national regulators implement the Code, and as provided for within it, BEREC has put most of its guidelines out for consultation and published some of them in 2020.\n\n## Harmonization of analyses of relevant markets\n\nOn December 18, 2020, the European Commission published a new recommendation identifying two relevant product and service\n\nmarkets for which National Regulatory Authorities should carry out market  analyses  that  may  lead  to  the  implementation  of  ex-ante regulation:\n\n- -market 1: wholesale provision of local access at a fixed location (formerly market 3a/2014 of recommendation 2014/710/EC);\n- -market 2: wholesale provision of high-quality access at a fixed location (formerly market 4/2014 of recommendation 2014/710/ EC).\n\n## Call termination rates\n\nThe Code provides that fixed and mobile call termination rates will cease to be determined by National Regulatory Authorities but will be  determined  by  the  European  Commission  for  all  countries  of the European Economic Area. This provision concerns European operators for calls terminating in a European country.\n\nTo  that  end,  on  December  21,  2020  the  European  Commission published a Delegated Act determining call termination rates:\n\n- -fixed call termination is set at 0.07 euro cents per minute. As exceptions, a certain number of countries have the possibility of charging higher prices until the end of December 2021 (notably Poland, Belgium, Luxembourg, Romania and Slovakia);\n- -mobile  call  termination  is  set  at  0.2  euro  cents  per  minute. However,  a  glide  path  is  planned  until  the  end  of  2023:  the maximum call termination rate for countries with rates above 0.2 euro cents per minute is 0.7 euro cents per minute in 2021, 0.55 euro cents per minute in 2022 and 0.4 euro cents per minute in 2023. Spain will be able to maintain its mobile call termination rate of 0.64 euro cents per minute in 2021, as it is below the cap of 0.7 euro cents per minute.\n\nThe Delegated Act will come into force the day after its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union, and termination rates will be applied from the first day of the third month after its entry into force, i.e. in principle no earlier than July 1st, 2021.\n\n## / Change in Orange's mobile voice call termination rates in Europe (in euro cents per minute)\n\n|      | 2020   |   2021 (1) | 2022   | 2023   | from 2022 on   |\n|------|--------|------------|--------|--------|----------------|\n| 0.74 | 0.70   |       0.64 |        |        | France         |\n| 0.64 |        |       0.64 |        |        | Spain          |\n| 0.94 |        |       0.64 | 0.55   | 0.40   | 0.20 Poland    |\n| 0.99 | 0.70   |       0.64 |        |        | Belgium        |\n| 0.76 |        |       0.64 |        |        | Romania        |\n|      | 0.82   |       0.64 |        |        | Slovakia       |\n\nSources : Cullen International December 2020 and Delegated act (EU).\n\n(1) rates will enter into force no earlier than July 1st 2021.\n\n## / Change in  Orange's  fixed  voice  call  termination  rates  in Europe (in euro cents per minute)\n\n|          |   31/12/2020 |   2021 (1) |   from 2022 on |\n|----------|--------------|------------|----------------|\n| France   |        0.077 |      0.07  |           0.07 |\n| Spain    |        0.059 |      0.07  |           0.07 |\n| Poland   |        0.599 |      0.111 |           0.07 |\n| Belgium  |        0.116 |      0.093 |           0.07 |\n| Romania  |        0.098 |      0.078 |           0.07 |\n| Slovakia |        0.098 |      0.078 |           0.07 |\n\nSources : Cullen International December 2020 and Delegated act (EU).\n\n- (1) rates will enter into force no earlier than July 1st 2021.",

        "page_content": "## International roaming\n\nRegulation (EU) 2015-2120 of November 25, 2015 (1) , which aims to eliminate surcharges for international roaming within the European Union, and Regulation (EU) 2017/920 of May 17, 2017, which lays down the rules for wholesale roaming markets (2) .\n\n- -impose, in the context of fair usage, the alignment of international roaming  retail  prices  with  national  prices  for  intra-European communications (voice, SMS and data) from June 15, 2017;\n- -expand, for customers using their cellphones outside the EU, pricing  transparency  requirements  and  bill  shock  prevention measures for European operators;\n- -grant a regulated right of access to European roaming services for  MVNOs  and  resellers,  and  sets  new  caps  on  wholesale markets:\n- -voice: 0.032 euros excl. VAT per minute,\n- -SMS: 0.01 euros excl. VAT per SMS,\n- -data (price excl. VAT): 3.5 euros per GB in 2020, 3.0 euros per GB in 2021 and 2.5 euros per GB in 2022.\n\nSuppliers of mobile services subject to the regulation on the pricing of intra-European roaming may apply a reasonable usage policy to their customers in terms of the consumption of these services in order to prevent abnormal or excessive use. Despite this option, in special and exceptional circumstances, when the supply of intraEuropean  roaming  at  the  national  price  threatens  the  viability  of the  supplier's  national  pricing  model,  they  can  ask  the  national regulator for authorization to bill additional charges for the use of intra-European roaming, which are limited to the caps on wholesale roaming prices.\n\nOn February 24, 2021, the European Commission presented a draft new roaming regulation which envisages a further gradual reduction in wholesale prices until 2032. The current regulation, adopted in 2017, will expire on June 30, 2022.\n\n## Regulation of the open Internet\n\nThe TSM Regulation has introduced rules to ensure an open Internet within the European Union. Article 3.3 of the TSM states that in the provision  of  Internet  access  services,  providers  shall  treat  traffic equally  and  without  discrimination,  restriction  or  interference, irrespective  of  sender  and  recipient,  the  content  consulted  or broadcast, the applications or services used or provided, and the terminal equipment used. It is up to the Member States to adapt their national law to comply with this provision.\n\nOn April 30, 2019, the European Commission published a report on the implementation of the net neutrality component of the TSM Regulation. The Commission, in the light of market developments, concluded that the principles of the Regulation are appropriate and that they effectively protect end-users by promoting the Internet as a driver of innovation. The Commission pointed out that operators have correctly applied the regulation governing net neutralit y and that national regulators have imposed very few fines. It does not propose any amendments to this Regulation.\n\nOn the basis of that report, BEREC published a new version of its guidelines in June 2020, clarifying certain points:\n\n- -the scope of the regulation is limited to the part between the interconnection  and  the  customer-side  network  termination point, thus leaving the terminal equipment outside the scope when it is located beyond that termination point;\n\n- -the possible compatibility of 5G slicing technologies with the regulation.\n\n## Protecting personal data\n\nThe  new  General  Data  Protection  Regulation  (GDPR)  came  into effect on May 25, 2018. The GDPR, which replaces a 1995 European directive, is a general-purpose regulation intended for both public and private entities which harmonizes the management of personal data protection in Europe.\n\nGDPR principles include:\n\n- -single rules applicable directly in each European Union country;\n- -application  to  all  Internet  users  and  service  providers  of  the information society intended for the European market;\n- -a single supervisory authority responsible for data protection as the contact point for Internet companies, namely that of the EU country in which they have their main establishment;\n- -unambiguous consent which explicitly covers the processing of personal data;\n- -definition  of  a  pseudonymization  process  whose  use  is encouraged;\n- -strengthening  of  the  obligation  to  provide  information  to consumers;\n- -the introduction of a 'digital right to be forgotten'.\n\nNational authorities for the protection of personal data now have greater  powers.  In  particular,  they  may  impose  administrative penalties of up to 4% of total annual revenue on companies that infringe European rules.\n\nOn June 24, 2020, the European Commission submitted a report to the European Parliament and the Council on the assessment and review of the GDPR. It underlines the fact that European companies have generally achieved good compliance and sets out measures to facilitate the GDPR's future application.\n\nThe entry into force of the GDPR also has indirect effects on the implementation of Directive No. 2002/58/EC of July 12, 2002 on Privacy and electronic communications, given that it changes the meaning of the notion of consent and the penalties to which the 2002 directive refers. The Commission wishes to replace the existing directive with a new regulation governing the sector, but there has been no political agreement on the new text to date.\n\n## Regulation of platforms\n\nRegulation  (EU)  2019/1150  promoting  fairness  and  transparency for  businesses using online intermediation services was adopted on June 20, 2019 and has been applicable from July 12, 2020. It aims to ensure rules for a fair, transparent and predictable trading environment for businesses and vendors on online platforms. This regulation  is  applicable  to  telecommunication  operators  offering Internet  television  services  (IPTV),  provided  that  conditions  are imposed on the streaming provider.\n\n## Digital Services Act and Digital Market Act\n\nOn December 15, 2020, the European Commission published two pieces  of  legislation:  an  update  of  the  e-Commerce  Directive (3) , known as the Digital Services Act (DSA), and a Regulation to combat the role of large online platforms, known as the Digital Market Act (DMA).\n\n- 1\n\n1",

For telecom operators, the DSA brings in very limited changes in relation to the e-Commerce Directive (introduction of a one-stop shop and a limited transparency obligations).\n\n## 1.7.1.2 France\n\n## 1.7.1.2.1 Legal and regulatory framework\n\n## Legal framework\n\nThe electronic  communications sector is mainly governed under national law by the French Postal and Electronic Communications Code (CPCE), as well as by legal provisions relating to electronic commerce, the information society, consumer protection and the protection  of  personal  data,  which  must  comply  with  European directives.\n\nFrance transposed the European Telecom Package, as amended in  2009,  via  a  Government  Order  dated  August  24,  2011  and  a Decree  dated  March  12,  2012  for  the  implementing  regulations. The transposition of the European Code is underway and is to be carried out by means of Government Orders within six months from December 3, 2020, the date of enactment of the law on various provisions to adapt to European Union law in economic and financial matters, except for the provisions concerning the universal service (see  below)  and  the  obligations  related  to  geographical  network coverage surveys, set out in this law.\n\nThe audiovisual communication services produced or distributed by the Orange group come under the specific regulations governing this sector and are governed by Law No. 86/1067 of September 30, 1986 on the Freedom of Communication.\n\n## Regulatory Authorities\n\nThe  Postal,  Electronic  Communications  and  Media  Distribution Regulatory Authority (Arcep) is an independent administrative body created by the Act of July 26, 1996 and is in charge of the nationwide regulation  of  the  electronic  communications  and  postal  sectors. Within the electronic communications sector, Arcep's main missions\n\nFor its part, the DMA ushers in an ex-ante regulatory framework for online platforms acting as gatekeepers, and also gives powers to the European Commission to conduct market investigations. Telecom operators are outside the scope of the regulation.\n\nThe draft texts have to be approved under the same conditions by the two co-legislators, the European Parliament and the Council.\n\nare  to  define  regulations  for  operators  present  in  the  markets  in question. It has powers to sanction non-compliant operators and can rule in particular on disputes between operators over technical and  pricing  conditions  for  network  access  and  interconnection. Arcep also allocates spectrum and numbering resources. Finally, it determines the size of contributions to fund the universal service obligation and oversees the mechanisms for delivering this funding.\n\nThe French Competition Authority is an independent administrative authority  responsible  for  ensuring  open  market  competition  and compliance with public economic policy. It has jurisdiction over all business segments, including the electronic communications sector. It  has  sanction  powers  for  anti-competitive  practices,  as  well  as consultative powers. It is also responsible for overseeing mergers and acquisitions.\n\nThe  ANFr  (Agence nationale des fr\u00e9quences  -  French  national frequency  agency)  is  responsible  for  planning,  managing  and controlling  the  usage  of  radio  spectrum  and  for  coordinating  the establishment of certain radio transmission facilities. The frequency spectrum is divided between eleven controlling authorities: public administrations, Arcep and the French Broadcasting Authorit y (CSA). Arcep and the CSA are in turn responsible for allotting to users the spectrum they control.\n\nThe  CSA  (Conseil  Sup\u00e9rieur  de  l'Audiovisuel)  is  an  independent administrative body created by the law of January 17, 1989. It is tasked with protecting the freedom of audiovisual communication in accordance with the law of September 30, 1986.",

The obligations and commitments made by the operators beyond 2021 were included into the new authorizations granted in December 2018 (Decision No. 2018-1392) for 10 years from the expiry of the previous authorizations.\n\n## 5G\n\nOn  July  16,  2018,  the  Government  and  Arcep  issued  France's r o a d m a p  f o r  5 G ,  i n  p a r t i c u l a r  f o r  t h e  t h r e e  s p e c t r u m  b a n d s  c o n c e r n e d : 3.4-3.8 GHz, 26 GHz and 1.4 GHz. A first consultation was launched on October 26, 2018 on the allocation of new spectrum for 5G in these three bands.\n\nFollowing the issue of spectrum authorizations for the 3.4-3.8 GHz band  in  mainland  France  (see  below),  Arcep  published  a  public consultation  on  December  18,  2020,  proposing  procedures  for allocating  spectrum  in  the  700  MHz  and  3.4-3.8  GHz  bands  in Reunion and the 700 MHz and 900 MHz bands in Mayotte.\n\n3.4-3.8 GHz band in metropolitan France\n\nThe procedure for allocating 5G spectrum in the 3490-3800 MHz band  (i.e.  310  MHz)  was  conducted  by  Arcep,  on  the  basis  of the auction rules published on November 21, 2019 (Decision No. 2019-1386). Qualifying applicants were able to acquire a quantity of  spectrum between a minimum of 40 MHz and a maximum of 100 MHz in a three-stage procedure:\n\nstage 1: applicants were allocated a quantity of 50 MHz at the reserve price of 350 million euros in exchange for the subscription to optional commitments (see below).\n\nstage 2: the remaining spectrum was allocated using purely financial multi-round auctions.\n\nstage 3: the spectrum obtained was assigned after a further auction.\n\nFollowing the three stages of the procedure, Arcep issued spectrum use authorizations on November 12, 2020. They came into force on  November 18, 2020. The spectrum allocated to Orange is in the 3710-3800 MHz band, i.e. a block of 90 MHz in time-division duplexing (TDD) mode. The spectrum is allocated for 15 years, with the possibility of a five-year extension if the licensee agrees to the terms of the extension. The total price of the spectrum allocated to Orange is 854 million euros. Its payment is spread over 15 years for the 350 million euros in respect of the 50 MHz block and over four years for the 504 million euros in respect of the block obtained during the main auction phase.\n\nWith  the  exception  of  the  obligation  to  open  services  in  at  least two cities with populations of over 150,000 before the end of 2020, canceled due to the date of granting of the authorization, all the obligations  contained  in  the  specifications  are  included  in  the authorization.\n\nThe obligations are as follows:\n\n- -the rollout of sites (3,000 sites by the end of 2022, 8,000 by the end of 2024 and 10,500 by the end of 2025), of which 25% of those rolled out by the end of 2024 and the end of 2025 must be located in rural areas or industrial areas outside of very densely populated areas;\n- -widespread availability of a 5G service at all sites by the end of 2030, an obligation that may be met either with the 3.4-3.8 GHz band or another band;\n- -the provision of a speed of at least 240 Mbps per sector from 75% of sites by the end of 2022, 85% of sites by the end of 2024, 90% of si te s by th e e n d of 2025, and 100% of sites by the end of 2030;\n- -coverage of the main highways by the end of 2025, major roads by the end of 2027;\n- -the provision of differentiated services and the activation of the IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6) network protocol.\n\n- 1\n\n1",

        "page_content": "1 -\n\nRegulation of activities\n\nIn addition, the commitments made by Orange to participate in the first stage of the procedure, which allowed it to obtain 50 MHz at a reserve price became obligations in the authorization issued:\n\n- -from the end of 2023, Orange will have to provide a fixed offer from sites using the 3.5 GHz band and a fixed offer to cover premises that benefit from fixed access radio network services;\n- -Orange will have to meet reasonable requests for the provision of  services  from  private  sector  companies  and  public  sector structures,  provide indoor  coverage,  offer  hosting  for  mobile virtual  network operators (MVNOs) and be transparent about network failures and planned rollouts.\n\n## 26 GHz band\n\nThe government and Arcep called for the creation of experimentation platforms by way of an open window in January 2019. Named in October 2019, the ten or so winners of authorizations will be able to experiment with 5G in this spectrum band for a period of three years. Orange has obtained two temporary authorizations, one for the  Chatillon  campus  and  the  other  for  a  project  with  the  SNCF (French Rail) at Rennes station.\n\n## Extension of spectrum authorizations for Reunion and Mayotte\n\nIn  its  Decision  No.  2019/1753,  Arcep  extended  authorizations  to use spectrum allocated to Orange in the 900 MHz band in Mayotte and the 900 MHz and 1800 MHz bands in Reunion. This extension brought the expiry dates of both authorizations into line with those of the other operators in those two areas.\n\n## Mobile coverage\n\n## The New Deal\n\n- -expanding the coverage of metropolitan France by way of the 'targeted coverage' scheme, making it possible for each operator to cover 5,000 new areas (most of which are shared between operators), replacing the existing programs ('town center dead zones', '800 strategic sites' and the 'France Mobile' program), which will now be fully paid for by the operators;\n- -generalizing access to very high-speed broadband by introducing 4G with a power rating in excess of 5W to all their own mobile sites by the end of 2020, and to 75% of the sites in the 'town center dead zones' program by the end of 2020, upping this to 100% by the end of 2022;\n- -accelerating the coverage of transport routes, so that the main highway and rail routes have 4G coverage. The agreement also includes provisions on coverage in regional trains;\n- -improving  coverage  inside  buildings,  with  two  components: progressive availability of voice and SMS services via WiFi with t h e  g o a l  o f  e n a b l i n g  8 0 %  o f  o u r  c u s t o m e r s  w h o  o w n  a  c o m p a t i b l e handset  to  benefit  from  these  services  by  the  end  of  2019; and marketing of an offering allowing public companies and individuals who so request to obtain improved multi-operator indoor coverage of their buildings at a reasonable rate;\n- -improving  reception  quality  throughout  the  country,  and par t i c u l a r l y  i n  r u r a l  a r e a s .  T h e  n e w  p e r f o r m a n c e  s t a n d a r d  a p p l i e d to operator obligations will be that of 'good coverage' defined as the 'ability to be able to call and text SMS outside of buildings in most cases and within buildings in some cases'.\n\nThese obligations have been written into their current authorizations and in the newly allocated 900 MHz, 1800 MHz and 2.1 GHz band authorizations for ten years.\n\nUnder the New Deal, operators are committed to:\n\n## Obligations to deploy and provide 4G coverage in metropolitan areas including that resulting from the New Deal\n\n| (as a % of the population)                                                     | Jan-17        | Oct-19   | Dec-20   | Jan-22                       | Dec-22   | Oct-23   | Jan-24   | Dec-25   |               | Jan-27 End-2030   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|----------|----------|------------------------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|---------------|-------------------|\n| Regional rail network (coverage inside trains in each  region as a % of track) |               |          |          |                              |          |          |          |          | 60%           | 80%               |\n| Regional rail network (national coverage inside  trains as a % of track)       |               |          |          | 60%                          |          |          |          |          | 80%           | 90%               |\n| Regional rail network (national coverage alongside  tracks as a % of track)    |               |          |          |                              |          |          |          | 90%      |               |                   |\n| Priority highways (as a % of highways out of car)                              |               |          | 100%     |                              |          |          |          |          |               |                   |\n| Priority highways (as a % of highways from inside vehicles)                    |               |          |          | 100%                         |          |          |          |          |               |                   |\n| Town centers in the 'dead zones' program  (1)                                  |               |          | 75%      |                              | 100%     |          |          |          |               |                   |\n| In the priority rollout areas  (2)   in very  high-speed mobile broadband  (3) | 40% (800 MHz) |          |          | 90% (800 MHz) 50%  (700 MHz) |          |          |          |          | 92% (700 MHz) | 97.70% (700 MHz)  |\n| In each French department                                                      |               |          |          |                              |          |          | 90%      |          | 95%           |                   |\n| Across the entire mainland France area                                         |               | 60%      |          |                              |          | 75%      |          |          | 98%           | 99.60%            |\n\n- (1) 1% of the population and 3,300 town centers.\n- (2) 18% of the population, 63% of the country.\n- (3) An operator has met its obligation to provide a very high-speed mobile broadband service when the equipment deployed enables a theoretical peak speed of 60 Mbps.",

On July 27, 2019, it issued Orange with formal notice to comply with the first deadline of the 'targeted coverage' scheme relating to the order of July 4, 2018, which requires new sites to be brought into service by June 27, 2020.\n\nPursuant to the provisions of Government Order No. 2020/306 of March 25, 2020 relating to the Covid-19 health crisis, the first deadline for the targeted coverage scheme has been postponed to October 9, 2020. Then, on November 10, 2020, Arcep published new maps showing the progression of 4G mobile phone coverage for each of the 96 departments in mainland France. On this occasion, 'Arcep welcomed the good progress of the Mobile New Deal, thanks to the mobilization of operators, local players and public authorities.' At  end-December 2020, Orange's 4G coverage was 99% of the population and 92% of the country.\n\n## Infrastructure sharing\n\nThe New Deal agreement contains clauses relating to the pooling of networks, including active sharing where all four operators are present on a site as part of the targeted coverage arrangements. A mobile site sharing contract was signed in July 2019 bet ween the four network operators for the deployment of 4G on sites destined to be actively shared. This agreement is gradually being implemented for the sites of the 'Town center dead zones' program and the new sites to be deployed as part of the New Deal's targeted coverage scheme.\n\nIn this context, operators are subject to an obligation to comply with the requests of other operators to ensure passive ex-ante pooling in the priority rollout area. However, the agreement provides that this obligation may be waived if an offer of access to a sufficient number of sites and at a reasonable price, deemed satisfactory by Arcep, proves to be available to significantly improve the coverage of one or more other spectrum holders in rural areas. In this context, Orange and Free signed a pylon co-construction agreement on January 15, 2020, and Orange has asked Arcep to lift the sharing obligations for the new sites in priority rollout areas. Arcep has granted Orange's request and has lifted the network sharing obligation in such areas (Decision No. 2020/1485).\n\nIn  addition,  Arcep  has  issued its  opinion  on  the  extension of  the roaming agreement between Free Mobile and Orange in mainland France, finding that it does not appear necessary to ask the two companies to amend their contract. This amendment extends the national roaming termination period until December 31, 2022, while maintaining the maximum uplink and downlink speeds that roaming customers can reach at 384 Kbps.\n\n## Orange's obligations regarding cost accounting and accounting separation for the mobile business\n\nThe accounting and cost recovery obligations imposed on mobile operators are set out in Arcep Decision No. 2018/0685, published on June 19, 2018. This decision applies to Orange, SFR, Bouygues Telecom, Free Mobile, SRR and Orange Cara\u00efbe.\n\n## Analysis of the wholesale mobile call termination markets\n\nThe fixed and mobile termination markets are regulated by Arcep Decision  No.  2017/1453  for  the  2017-2020  cycle.  The  decision confirms the cost-orientation obligation for call termination rates. The cap levels for c a l l te r m i n a t i o n  w e r e  e l i m i n a t e d  i n  t h e  fi n a l  d e c i s i o n .\n\nMobile operators, including Orange, have left their rates unchanged since 2017.\n\nPursuant to  the  European  Code,  the  European  Commission  has published a Delegated Act setting the level of mobile termination from 2021 (see Section 1.7.1.1 European Union).\n\n## 1.7.1.2.3 Regulation of fixed telephony, broadband and very high-speed\n\n## broadband Internet\n\n## Regulation of fixed broadband and very high-speed broadband networks\n\nAdoption by Arcep of the new fixed broadband and very high-speed broadband market analysis framework for the 2021-2023 period\n\nOn December 17, 2020, Arcep adopted new decisions within the framework of analyses of the fixed broadband and very high-speed broadband markets for the 2021-2023 period.\n\nThey define, on the one hand, the asymmetric regulation (1) of  the fixed broadband and very high-speed fixed broadband markets:\n\n- -a separate civil engineering contract;\n- -market '3a', passive offers;\n- -market '3b' for activated mass market offers;\n- -market '4' for specific activated B2B offers.\n\nArcep  has  also  adopted  a  decision  aimed  at  completing  the framework for symmetrical fiber regulation applicable to all operators operating FTTH networks, as well as a recommendation clarifying the application of this framework. Lastly, Arcep has adopted a decision setting a price framework for access to Orange's local copper loop.\n\nThe  regulatory  changes  focus  on  three  key  objectives:  support the  switch  from  the  existing  copper  network  to  fiber,  continue pro-investment  regulation  to  make  the  FTTH  network  the  new benchmark for fixed infrastructure, and boost the B2B market.\n\n## Existing regulatory framework for the regulation of wholesale offers for the 2021-2023 period\n\n'Civil engineering' market analysis Decision No. 2020/1445 defines a new relevant market for all civil engineering infrastructure for network rollout, and designates Orange as the operator exercising significant influence.  As  such,  Orange  must  grant  reasonable  requests  for access to its civil engineering infrastructure (optical local loop offer) and  associated  resources  and  services  (SAN/OAN  hosting  offer and LFO offer).\n\n'3a' market analysis Decision No. 2020/1446 redefines the relevant market for access to copper and fiber local loop net works (to take into account the new 'civil engineering' market) and designates Orange as the operator exercising significant influence. As such, Orange must grant reasonable requests for access to its copper local loop network and the associated resources and services (unbundling offer).  Orange  must  also  grant,  in  very  dense  areas,  reasonable requests for connection to its FTTH network from companies located in buildings not yet covered by FTTH. This obligation only applies to Orange, unlike the rest of the regulatory framework for the pooling of FTTH networks.\n\n'3b' market analysis Decision No. 2020/1447 maintains the relevant market  for  activated  access  ('bitstream')  to  copper  and  fiber networks for mass market customers and designates Orange as the operator exercising significant influence. As such, Orange must grant reasonable requests for activated access to its copper network (DSL access and bitstream offer).\n\n- 1\n\n1",

As  such,  Orange  must  grant  reasonable requests for high-quality activated access to its copper and fiber networks (DSLE offer/FTTO offers).\n\nThese  decisions  impose  on  Orange  obligations  of  transparency, non-discrimination, quality of service, publication of reference offers, price control and accounting separation.\n\n## Changes in the current regulatory framework for the regulation of FTTH networks\n\nDecision No. 2020-1432 supplements the symmetrical regulatory framework for the pooling of FTTH networks, notably by extending obligations that until now only applied to Orange to all infrastructure operators. Under the new decision, infrastructure operators must notably offer on their FTTH networks an offer with a recovery time guarantee (RTG) of ten hours and an RTG offer for the B2B market, possibly including an adapted architecture (FTTE). This new decision also specifies the obligations related to rollout (in particular for new buildings or buildings that can be connected on request and buildings without  an  address),  reinforces  the  non-discrimination  obligation (particularly  with  regard  to  information  systems)  and  imposes  an accounting reporting obligation.\n\nThe recommendation of December 8, 2020 clarifies a few additional points, in particular with regard to FTTE and the conditions for the renewal of co-funded usage rights.\n\n## Management of FTTH rollouts\n\n## Commitments made by Orange in the AMII zone under Article L. 33-13\n\nIn  early  2018,  Orange  formalized  its  proposed  FTTH  rollout commitments in nearly 3,000 municipalities under Article L. 33-13 of the French Postal and Electronic Communications Code. Orange proposed  that  it  commits  to  ensuring  that,  within  its  FTTH deployment scope in the AMII area: (i) by the end of 2020, 100% of homes and professional premises would have access to FTTH sales offers (including a maximum 8% of premises connectable on demand, excluding refusals by third parties), and (ii) by the end of 2022, 100% of homes and professional premises would be made connectable (excluding refusals by third parties). These commitment proposals took into account the agreement reached at the end of May 2018 by Orange and SFR which led to Orange withdrawing from 236 municipalities to SFR's benefit.\n\nCommitments proposed by Orange (and by SFR) were accepted by the French government on July 26, 2018 (1)\n\n## Calls for expressions of local commitments (AMEL) and 'equity' deployments\n\nIn  December  2017,  the  Government  announced  the  launch  of  a procedure calling for shows of local commitments (AMEL) through which to identify operators wishing to deploy privately-funded FTTH connections beyond the current AMII zone.\n\nOrange  proposed  to  make  commitments  with  respect  to  Article L. 33-13 under AMEL for the French departments of Lot-et-Garonne, Vienne,  Deux-S\u00e8vres  and  Haute-Vienne.  Arcep  has  issued  a favorable  opinion  on  Orange's  proposed  commitments  in  these four departments.\n\nLastly,  Orange  has  offered  the  government  commitments  under Article L. 33-13 in the context of rollout projects using its own funds in other areas. These commitments are currently being examined by the authorities.\n\n## Completeness of FTTH networks\n\nUnder  the  obligation  of  completeness  imposed  in  Decision  No. 2010/1312, all infrastructure operators must have made all housing\n\nand  professional  premises  in  the  rear  area  of  a  pooling  point connectable (except in cases of refusal) within a reasonable period (between  two  and  five  years  depending  on  the  reasons  for  the decision) from the deployment of the pooling point.\n\nAt the end of 2018, then again at the end of 2020, Arcep issued Orange  with  formal  notice  to  comply  within  one  year  with  the completeness obligation for a list of pooling points (PPs) that had been in service for more than five years but had not reached the required completeness rate.\n\n## Price framework for access to the copper local loop\n\nOn December 17, 2020, Arcep adopted Decision No. 2020/1493, which defines a price framework for full unbundling and bitstream DSL access for the years 2021 to 2023. It sets maximum rates:\n\n- -for fully unbundled access, the monthly recurring rate is capped at 9.65 euros from 2021 to 2023;\n- -f o r  b i t s t r e a m  D S L  a c c e s s ,  t h e  m o n t h l y  r e c u r r i n g  r a t e  i s  c a p p e d  a t 13.13 euros in 2021, 13.37 euros in 2022 and 13.53 euros in 2023.\n\n## Regulation of fixed telephony\n\n## New round of market analysis\n\nAs par t  o f  i t s  fi f t h  r o u n d  o f  a n a l y s i s  o f  t h e  r e l e v a n t  fi x e d  m a r k e t s  f o r  n o n residential customers for the 2018-2020 period, on December 21, 2017, Arcep adopted Decision No. 2017/1568, which restricts the obligation to formalize a wholesale offer for access to telephone service to the non-residential market only. Wholesale non-residential line  rental  rates  are  now governed by Decision No. 2018/1523 of December 5, 2018. Contract caps were stable in 2020 compared with previous caps (12.32 euros per month for analog and 18.57 euros per month for digital). The cap for call origination collected at the Operator Connection Point associated with these contracts was 0.6958 euro cents per minute in 2020.\n\nIn July 2020, Arcep published a public consultation on the results of this market analysis and the outlook for the sixth round, for which it  plans  to  set  the  proportion  of  the  intensity  of  regulation  in  line with the challenges of a shrinking market, prioritize the migration of the switched telephone network (STN) directly to FTTH networks, and maintain a level playing field between Orange and alternative operators when the STN is closed. A decision on the sixth round is expected in mid-2021.\n\n## Fixed voice call termination\n\nFollowing  its  Decision  No.  2017/1453  of  December  2017,  Arcep removed the rate caps for the 2018-2020 period. Rates must be based on costs. Operators have left their rates unchanged since 2017.\n\nPursuant to  the  European  Code,  the  European  Commission  has published a Delegated Act setting the level of mobile termination from 2021 (see Section 1.7.1.1 European Union).\n\n## Universal telephony service\n\nThe end of the period of Orange's designation as Universal Service Operator on November 27, 2020 coincides with the transposition into national law of part of the new European Code. With regard to the Universal Service, the transposition was achieved through the promulgation on December 3, 2020 of the law on various provisions for adaptation to European Union economic and financial law.\n\nThe transposition of the European Code should lead to significant changes in the implementation of universal service by the Member States:\n\n- -the  Code  extends  the  scope  of  universal  service  to  include adequate  broadband  Internet  access  at  a  fixed  location  in addition to voice communications;\n- -t h i s  s e r v i c e  m u s t  b e  a v a i l a b l e  a n d  a f f o r d a b l e ,  i n c l u d i n g  f o r  p e o p l e on low incomes or with special social needs;",

The regulator proposes to increase from 66 to 592 the number of municipalities deregulated for fiber access. These 592 municipalities represent approximately two-thirds of the Spanish population.  The  CNMC  also  proposes  maintaining  Telef\u00f3nica's obligations regarding access to civil engineering infrastructure as well as the obligations for unbundled access to the copper pair. However, the consultation does not include wholesale access obligations to Telef\u00f3nica's fiber network.\n\nAs regards the copper network, it is also proposed to deregulate bitstream access in all of these 526 new municipalities, notwithstanding the fact that unbundling (LLU) is no longer available. The final decision is expected in the second half of 2021.\n\n## NEBA reference offers (bitstream)\n\nSince 2018, the CNMC has revised the 'economic replicability test' (ERT)  of  Telef\u00f3nica's  offers,  which  is  used  to  set  the  wholesale price of fiber. This test should confirm that the prices of Telef\u00f3nica's wholesale fiber offers (NEBA-local and NEBA-fiber) allow alternative operators to replicate the main fiber offers offered by the incumbent.\n\nIn this context, on April 25, 2018, the CNMC published the first results of the ERT test of Telef\u00f3nica's offers, which resulted in the monthly fee for the NEBA local offer (local activated offer) and the access part of the NEBA fiber offer (activated offer) being set at 17.57 euros.\n\nOn December 2, 2020, the CNMC published the results of the third ERT review. As a result, Telef\u00f3nica had to lower its access prices to the NEBA and VULA offers to 16.86 euros.\n\n## Fixed voice call termination rates\n\nAs part of its fourth round of fixed call termination market analysis (Market 1/2014), on July 25, 2019, the CNMC published the ANME/ DTSA/003/18/M1-2014  decision  gradually  reducing  fixed  call termination rates.

The European Commission approved the conclusions, while suggesting that the market be monitored.\n\nPursuant to the European Code, on December 21, 2020 the European Commission published a Delegated Act setting the level of mobile termination from 2021 (see Section 1.7.1.1 European Union).\n\n## Cable wholesale broadband markets\n\nThe market review consultation was launched in July 2017 by the Conference  of  Electronic  Communications  Regulators  (CRC) (1) . The review concluded that there were different wholesale markets for  central  access  (copper/fiber  versus  cable)  and  for  television (IPTV versus cable). On May 25, 2018, the European Commission commented on the draft decisions for the wholesale broadband markets (markets 3a and 3b/2014) and on the wholesale television distribution market. The European Commission did not block the proposal to define two central access wholesale markets for the copper and fiber optic networks and for coaxial cable, despite its comments on the measure. After the filing and subsequent dismissal of various appeals in 2019, the CRC submitted its draft decision on the new wholesale cable network access rates in April 2020. It was approved with comments by the European Commission on May 5, 2020. The decision was published by the CRC on May 26, 2020 and has been applicable since July 1, 2020.\n\nRegarding wholesale fiber prices, based on 'cost plus', as well as one-time rates such as activation and installation rates (for both fiber and cable), the public consultation ended on October 30, 2020.",

Licenses in the 700 MHz band are valid for twenty years, until December 31, 2040. Licenses in the 900 MHz and 1800 MHz band will be valid until December 31, 2025. In this context, Orange acquired 2x10 MHz in the 700 MHz spectrum band for 33.6 million euros.\n\n## Mobile voice call termination rates\n\nThe mobile call termination rate of all operators has been 0.818 euro cents per minute since August 1, 2019.\n\nPursuant to the European Code, on December 21, 2020 the European Commission published a Delegated Act setting the level of mobile termination from 2021 (see Section 1.7.1.1 European Union).\n\n## Wholesale broadband and very high-speed fixed broadband markets\n\nThe Slovakian regulator completed its third round of analysis of the 3a, 3b and 4/2014 markets and published its decisions on markets 3a and 3b on January 19, 2018, and on market 4 on November 7, 2016. The regulator eased regulations:\n\n- -in  market  3a,  by  excluding  unbundling  of  the  local  sub-loop, while maintaining unbundling in the local copper loop, and by limiting the regulatory obligations of NGA offers to the economic replicability test and to a technical equivalence of inputs;\n- -in market 3b, by imposing a replicability test of 2P offers and multicast IPTV wholesale access offers, instead of regulated prices;\n- -in  market  4,  by  eliminating  the  sector-based  regulatory obligations, because of the competitive nature of the market.\n\nThe RU published rate caps for access to fixed physical infrastructure (civil engineering) on October 17, 2018.

        "page_content": "## 1.7.2 Regulation of banking activities\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic caused a very high level of volatility in the financial markets, which led to an increase in yields on public debt and consequently unrealized losses on the portfolios of public debt held by banks. Against that backdrop, to give banks the ability to continue financing businesses and households, the European Central Bank (ECB) adopted a set of strong measures (the 'European package') in favor of bank liquidity and good financing of the economy. They include:\n\n- -the  postponement  by  the  Basel  Committee  until  January  1, 2023 of the revision of the requirements in terms of credit risk, operational risk and market risk (Basel III);\n- -the postponement of banking stress tests across the euro zone and an easing of regulatory requirements;\n- -the  easing  of  the  deadlines  and  procedures  for  submitting reporting statements to prudential supervision and resolution authorities, numerous measures relating to capital buffers, and a broad set of measures to ease guarantees;\n- -recommendations to banks not to pay dividends or buy back shares.\n\nAt  the  same  time,  national  governments  took  measures  within each country to implement these decisions and ensure support for SMEs. In France, the government took, among others, the following measures:\n\n- -implementation of a government-guarantee mechanism for loans of up to 300 billion euros granted by credit institutions (decree of March 23, 2020). The government also took measures allowing more favorable prudential treatment by banks of their exposure to SMEs and infrastructure;\n- -simplification  of  the  conditions  for  modifying  the  bank  card payment limit (lifted from 30 euros to 50 euros per transaction in o r d e r  t o  l i m i t  p h y s i c a l  c o n t a c t  b e t w e e n  c u s t o m e r s  a n d  m e r c h a n t s ) and use of digital c h a n n e l s  f o r  b u s i n e s s  c r e d i t  ( G o v e r n m e n t  o r d e r No 2020/534 of May 7, 2020);\n- -extension of deadlines and adjustment of recovery procedures during the health crisis, i n p a r t i c u l a r  w i t h  r e g a r d  t o  t h e  a p p l i c a t i o n of penalty payments, contractual clauses aimed at penalizing non-performance by debtors and deadlines for terminating or opposing the renewal of contracts, by a series of Government orders  (March  25,  2020,  April  15,  2020,  May  13,  2020  and June 3, 2020), which had a significant impact on Orange Bank, in particular for its credit activity.\n\nIn addition, a series of reforms unrelated to the health context were implemented during the year, including:\n\n- -corrigendum  to  Directive  (EU)  2019/878  of  the  European Parliament and of the Council of May 20, 2019 with regard to exempted entities, financial holding companies, mixed financial holding companies, remuneration, supervisory measures and powers, and own capital conservation measures;\n- -European Directive  (EU)  2018/822  of  the  Council  of  May  25, 2018 on the automatic and compulsory exchange of information on  cross-border  arrangements  that  must  be  declared  to  tax authorities. French banks are therefore subject to new reporting obligations from January 31, 2021;\n- -ECB guide to climate and environmental risks for banks. The ECB published the final version of the guide on November 27, 2020, and banks must conduct a self-assessment in early 2021 in relation to its expectations;\n- -Decree No. 2020/889 of July 20, 2020 modifying the conditions for credit institutions' assessment of the financial fragility of their account-holding customers;\n- -Decree  No.  2020-1703  of  December  24,  2020  transposing Directive 2019/879 of the European Parliament and of the Council of  May  20,  2019  on  the  loss  absorbing  and  recapitalization capacity of credit institutions and investment firms.\n\nLastly, with regard to the fight against money laundering and the financing  of  terrorism  (AML/CFT),  a  number  of  regulations  were adopted during the year, in particular:\n\n- -transposition  of  the  fifth  AML  directive  via  the  Government order and decrees of February 12, 2020 amending the French Monetary  and  Financial  Code.  The  major  changes  relate  to customer identification requirements at the start of a relationship and the strengthening of cer tain aspects of the AML /CF T system;\n- -ACPR guidelines of March 16, 2020 specif ying the organizational rules of the AML/CFT systems of banking groups, as well as the controls, procedures and risk classification to be implemented by branches and subsidiaries in order to ensure their consolidated management. In particular, they provide for the appointment of a manager responsible for overseeing the implementation of the rules and for informing managers and supervisory bodies. They also cover the exchange of information between entities and the rules governing internal control;\n- -Government  order  No.  2020-1342  of  November  4,  2020 strengthening the mechanism for freezing and prohibiting the provision of assets.\n\n- 1\n\n1",

Orange's view at the date of this Universal Registration Document is that these risks could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  (i)  on  its  business,  financial position, earnings, reputation or outlook, or (ii) on its stakeholders. In  addition,  other  risks  and  uncertainties,  as  yet  unidentified  or, at the date of this Universal Registration Document, not currently considered to be material by Orange, could have similar adverse effects. Investors could lose all or part of their investment if these risks were to materialize.\n\nIn assessing the materiality of these risks, the results of mitigation policies implemented by Orange are taken into account. Only the risks still  deemed material at Group level, despite these policies, are set out below.\n\nRisks are presented in this section under four categories:\n\n- -for Orange:\n- -operational  risks  relating  to  Orange's  business  activities (see Section 2.1.1),\n- -risks of a legal nature (see Section 2.1.2),\n- -financial risks (see Section 2.1.3);\n- -for Orange and its stakeholders: the main 'non-financial' risks relating  to  the  employee-related,  social  and  environmental consequences  of  Orange's  business  activities,  and  the effects of those activities in terms of respect for human rights, anti-corruption measures and tax evasion (see Section 2.1.4).\n\nThese categories are not presented in order of impor tance. However, within each category, risk factors are presented in descending order of importance as determined by Orange at the date of this Universal Registration Document. Orange may change its view of their relative importance at any time, notably in the event of external or internal developments.\n\nSeveral other sections of this Universal Registration Document also discuss risks in some detail:\n\n## 2.1.1 Operational  risks\n\nOperational risks mainly include risks related to the telecommunication sector,  and  risks  related  to  Orange's  strategy  and  business.  In addition, risks with potentially significant employee-related, social and environmental consequences are presented in Section 2.1.4.\n\nA significant portion of Orange's revenue is generated in highly competitive markets where pricing pressure is strong and regulatory decisions are decisive.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn France and Spain in particular, Orange is facing persistently fierce c o m p e t i t i o n ,  m a i n l y  o n  p r i c e s ,  i n c l u d i n g  i n  t h e  m a r k e t  f o r  n e w  s e r v i c e s . At the same time, the operation of national markets is subject to decisions by industry regulators and competition authorities. Against that backdrop, Orange is pursuing its policy of moving towards a multi-service  operator  model  by  offering  convergent  offers  (very hi g h - s p e e d  fi x e d  a n d  m o b i l e  b r o a d b a n d )  a n d  b y  i m p r o v i n g  t h e  q u a l i t y of its services.\n\n- If Orange were unable to implement this strategy, it could lose market share and see its margins narrow.\n\n- -for the effects on Orange of the continuing health crisis related to the Covid-19 pandemic and its global economic and social consequences, see Section 1.3 Significant events;\n- -for  risks  relating  to  the  global  telecommunication  services market, Orange's overall strategy and its business model, see Section 1.2;\n- -for  risks  relating  to  regulation  and  regulatory  pressure,  see Section 1.7 Regulation of activities and Note 18 Litigation to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Section 3.3);\n- -for risks relating to litigation involving the Group, see also Note 11 Taxes and Note 18 Litigation to the Consolidated Financial Statements and, where applicable, Section 3.2.1 Recent events;\n- -for  risks  relating  to  the  Group's  employee-related,  social  and environmental responsibility, see Section 4;\n- -for financial risks, see:\n- -Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount of the main activities and specific risk factors that may affect this amount,\n- -Notes 9 and 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for asset impairments,\n- -Note  13.8  to  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  for derivatives,\n- -Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the management  of  interest  rate  risk,  foreign  exchange  risk, liquidity risk, covenants, credit risk and counterparty risk, and equity market risk.

See  Section  5.2.2.3 Executive Committee and Group governance committees;\n- -for the insurance plan, see Section 2.2.3.3 Insurance;\n- -more generally, risk management policies throughout the Orange group are discussed in Section 2.2 Activity and risk management framework, which is an integral part of the Management Report.\n\nThe effects of the global macroeconomic situation stemming from the international health crisis are included in the analysis below.\n\nFor further information about competition, see Section 1.4 Operating activities.\n\nThe existence of a high level of consolidation among Orange's critical suppliers poses a risk to the Group's business.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOrange's  critical  suppliers,  particularly  in  the  areas  of  network infrastructure, information systems and mobile devices, operate in highly consolidated markets. Despite Orange's secure purchasing policies, this consolidation poses a risk to the Group's current or f u t u r e  b u s i n e s s  ( f o r  e x a m p l e ,  t h e  s u p p l y  o f  h a r d w a r e  f o r  5 G  n e t w o r k s ) in the event that one of these suppliers were to fail or decided to change its business practices, regardless of the cause, including in the event of international economic sanctions against such critical supplier or its  country  of  origin.  Any  significant  change  in  critical suppliers or their business relationship with Orange may also impact the terms of their partnership with Orange.",

Orange has also made commitments regarding geographic coverage and quality of service to  central  government  and  local  authorities  in  France.  However, Orange's investment capacity is constrained by the availability of human, industrial and financial resources, both its own and those of  its  subcontractors.  Against  that  backdrop,  Orange  is  ramping up  its  strategy  of  co-financing  investments  and  pooling  network infrastructure.\n\nFailure to meet these expectations in a balanced manner could have an adverse effect on Orange's earnings and reputation.\n\nThe shift of Orange's ecosystem towards a more open and fragmented model enables global players to take an increasing share of the service and network value chain.\n\n## High \u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\n\nCompetition  with  Over-The-Top  (OTT)  service  providers  and Internet giants in the provision of value-added services using the networks is spreading to individual access services made possible by technological changes and the growing number of connected objects.  This  competition  could  intensify  with  the  launch  of  5G, and extend to the growth in international  capacity  requirements. Operators such as Orange, for which the direct relationship with customers is a source of value, could be marginalized.\n\nMoreover, the opening up and fragmentation of network ecosystems enables  existing  players  (infrastructure  managers,  non-telecom networked businesses such as railways, local authorities or Cloud service providers) to offer network services, and new players (SDWAN, etc.) to position themselves as aggregators of such services, a role traditionally filled by integrated operators such as Orange.\n\nThese two developments could adversely affect Orange's revenue and outlook.\n\nThe development of mobile financial services activities in an increasing number of countries confronts Orange with risks specific to this sector in each of its host countries.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMobile  financial  services,  including  banking,  expose  Orange  to industry-specific risks such as money laundering, terrorist financing and non-compliance with economic sanctions programs, as well as common risks that are particularly sensitive in mobile financial services, such as fraud, cyberattacks and service disruption.\n\n- 2\n\nIf they were to materialize, these risks could have a material adverse effect on the Group's financial position, the success of its strategy and its reputation.\n\nOrange's broad geographic footprint and the scope of its activities expose it to geopolitical, macroeconomic, fiscal and regulatory risks.\n\nHigh \u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\n\nAgainst the backdrop of a global macroeconomic crisis in which all countries are seeking to keep their economies functioning, political instability, and changes in the economic, regulatory, fiscal or industrial relations environment in Orange's host countries expose Orange to a two-edged threat. First, decisions contrary to its interests could be taken by governmental or judicial authorities, such as new taxes or fi n e s  t h a t ,  i f  c o n t e s t e d ,  c o u l d  l e a d  t h e  a u t h o r i t i e s  t o  d e c i d e  t o  s u s p e n d services. Second, many customers, in particular businesses, may have difficulty maintaining economic activity, pursuing a business relationship or fulfilling their financial obligations towards Orange. In addition, in the emerging countries where the Group operates, its contribution to local economic activity is often significant, whereas its image is sometimes linked to that of the French government. In this uncertain context, the value or sustainability of investments made in certain countries could be negatively impacted by international economic sanctions imposed on those countries.\n\nSuch  situations  could  call  into  question  the  profitability  outlook justifying investment decisions and adversely impact the Group's financial position and earnings.\n\nOrange is exposed to the risk of an interruption of its services.\n\nHigh \u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\n\nDue to the essential nature of telecommunications, compounded by lockdown decisions and the swift and massive take-up of telework with the Covid-19 pandemic, the networks of telecommunications operators are par ti c u l a r l y  e x p o s e d  t o  r i s k s  o f  s e r v i c e  d i s r u p t i o n  l i n k e d to intentional and sometimes criminal acts.\n\nInterruptions to the services provided to customers may occur as a result of malicious human acts (such as infrastructure sabotage) or via cyberattacks, but also at the request of government or judicial authorities.\n\nInterruptions may also be unintentional. They can occur as a result of extreme weather events, human error, such as when subcontractors work on shared infrastructure, in conjunction with the failure of a critical  supplier,  or  when  new  applications  or  software  are  rolled out. Lastly, they can occur as a result of capacity saturation resulting from the uninterrupted development of digital uses, and particularly during periods of intense traffic in the unprecedented and exceptional situation observed over recent months characterized by massive use of digital technology in economic life,\n\nDespite the business continuity and crisis management measures taken  by  Orange  to  protect  and  resize  its  networks,  the  likely sustainability  of  massive  use  of  telework,  the  high  frequency  of cyberattacks, the implementation of all-IP technologies, the increase in the size of service platforms and the consolidation of equipment in a reduced number of buildings mean that service interruptions could affect a larger number of customers and several countries at the same time in the future.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2",

If they were to occur at the level of one or several countries, they could also trigger crisis situations potentially affecting the security of the countries concerned.\n\nOrange is exposed to risks of inappropriate disclosure or modification of stakeholder data in its possession, particularly in the event of cyberattacks.\n\nMedium \u25cf\u25cf\u00b7\n\nOrange's  business  activities  require  the  transmission  through  its networks  and  storage  on  its  infrastructure  of  data  belonging  to business  or  government  customers,  suppliers,  partners  and  all stakeholders  other  than  natural  persons  (see  Section  2.1.4  for information relating to risks regarding personal data). The increasing use of Cloud services and the outsourcing of digital services exposes it to risks of loss, disclosure, unauthorized communication to third parties or inappropriate modification of such data, potentially resulting from (i) the implementation of new services or applications, (ii) the development of new businesses in the field of connected objects, (iii) malicious acts (such as cyberattacks) targeting data in Orange's possession,  or  (iv)  negligence  or  errors  that  may  be  committed within Orange or by Group partners to which certain operations are outsourced.\n\nThe Group could be held liable if these risks were to materialize. Moreover,  even  though  the  Group's  stakeholders  have  high expectations  in  terms  of  security,  given  Orange's  positioning  as a  trusted  operator,  its  reputation  could  be  significantly  adversely affected, which would then materially and adversely affect its future earnings.\n\nOrange's strategy to develop its new growth drivers may fail to yield the expected results in an international context of sustained economic and social crisis.\n\nMedium \u25cf\u25cf\u00b7\n\nOrange's strategy is to develop its business in high-growth regions, with  a  particular  focus  on  mobile  financial  services  (including mobile  banking),  cybersecurity  and  B2B  IT  services.  Although based  on  the  Group's  strengths  (capacity  for  innovation,  digital expertise, distribution strength, broad footprint in the MEA region and brand awareness), the development of these new businesses, which requires significant resources without guaranteeing that the use  of  the  corresponding  services  will  gain  sufficient  traction  to generate  a  return  on  these  investments,  depends  on  the  ability of many economic players, including Orange's current and future customers, to recover from the economic and social consequences of theCovid-19 pandemic.\n\nIf Orange were unable to implement this strategy, it could lose market share and see its margins narrow.\n\nThe  Group's  brand  policy,  combined  with  a  strategy  of geographic expansion and diversification into new businesses, represents a risk for the Orange brand image.\n\nMedium \u25cf\u25cf\u00b7\n\nOrange's strategy of accelerating its business activities in growth areas entails execution risks inherent to new businesses (particularly Mobile Banking  and  cyberdefense)  and  the  countries  into  which the  Group  is  expanding.  If  these  risks  were  to  materialize,  and although  the  Group  pays  great  attention  to  preserving  the  value of the Orange brand, which is a major asset, they could adversely affect the company's reputation, particularly in the mature mobile telephony sector.\n\nIn the event of significant damage to the Orange brand image, the Group's earnings and outlook could be affected.\n\nOrange's  technical  infrastructure  is  vulnerable  to  damage caused by intentional or accidental damage, but also by natural disasters, the frequency of which is increased by climate change.\n\nMedium \u25cf\u25cf\u00b7\n\nNatural  disasters,  intentional  damage  caused  by  war,  terrorism or social unrest, as well as other accidental events such as fires, errors or negligence during civil engineering work on infrastructure could lead to significant destruction of Orange's facilities, resulting in both service interruptions and high repair costs. The frequency and intensity of weather events related to climate change (e.g., floods, storms, heat waves) are increasing, which could aggravate disasters and increase related damage. In the medium term, rising sea levels could affect sites and facilities located near the coast more often. While coverage of claims by insurers could decrease further, the damage caused by major disasters could result in significant costs to Orange, and could thus seriously and adversely affect its financial position and outlook.\n\nThe scope of Orange's business activities and the interconnection of its networks expose the company to a variety of acts of technical fraud, specific to the telecommunication sector.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOrange  faces  various  types  of  fraud  on  its  telecommunication services  activities,  which  may  target  it  directly  or  its  customers.

Orange must also comply with its own regulator y obligations and oversight by authorities seeking to maintain effective market competition, as well as, in some countries, additional constraints owing to its historically dominant position in the fixed telecommunication market.\n\nOrange's  business  and  earnings  could  be  materially  affected  by changes in laws or regulations, some of which may be extraterritorial in nature, or by changes in government policy, including decisions made by regulatory or competition authorities regarding:\n\n- -the modification or renewal under unfavorable conditions, or even the withdrawal, of fixed or mobile operator licenses;\n- -conditions  governing  network  access  (primarily  those  in connection with roaming or infrastructure sharing);\n- -service rates;\n- -the introduction of new taxes or increases in existing taxes on telecommunication  companies,  including  the  introduction  of taxes aimed at facilitating the achievement of countries' carbon neutrality targets (such as taxes on use or handset purchases);\n- -banking and financial supervision, and any related compliance regulations such as laws and regulations on economic sanctions;\n- -non-financial corporate obligations;\n- -data security;\n- -merger and acquisition policy;\n- -regulations affecting operators of competing sectors, such as cable;\n- -consumerism legislation.\n\nSuch decisions could materially adversely af fect the Group's revenue and earnings.\n\nFor further information on regulatory risks, see Section 1.7 Regulation of activities.\n\n## 2.1.3 Financial  risks\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nOrange's earnings and outlook could be affected if conditions of access to capital markets were to become difficult.\n\nMedium \u25cf\u25cf\u00b7\n\nOrange finances itself mainly through the bond markets.

However, it is not able to predict the decisions of supervisory or judicial authorities, which are regularly asked to rule on such issues. If Orange were to be ordered by the competent authorities of a country in which it operates to pay an indemnity or a fine, or to suspend certain of its business activities, based on a breach of applicable regulations, its financial position and earnings could be significantly adversely affected.\n\nIn addition, Orange (particularly in France and Poland) is frequently involved  in  proceedings  with  its  competitors  and  the  regulatory authorities due to its pre-eminent position in certain of the markets where it  operates,  and  the  claims  made  against  Orange  can  be very substantial. In the past, the Group has been fined several tens of millions of euros or even several hundreds of millions euros for cartel practices or for abusing its dominant position. The Group is also  involved  in  substantial  commercial  litigation  with  potentially very  significant  penalties.  The  outcome  of  lawsuits  is  inherently unpredictable.\n\nFor  proceedings  before  the  European  competition  authorities, the  maximum amount of fines provided for by law is 10% of the consolidated revenue of the offending company (or the Group to which it belongs, as the case may be).\n\nLastly, due in particular to its relationships with numerous partners, suppliers and subcontractors, Orange is exposed to a growing risk of  legal  action  by  various  stakeholders  from  civil  society  alleging shortcomings on environmental, employee-related or social matters. That could be the case, for instance, if Orange were to distribute products that are found to contain rare minerals extracted under non-compliant  conditions.  Such  actions  could  cause  significant damage to Orange's reputation.\n\nThe  main  proceedings  involving  Orange  are  described  in  Note 11  Taxes  and  Note  18  Litigation  to  the  Consolidated  Financial Statements.

These items were assessed in relation to non-financial challenges (see Section 2.2.2).\n\nCombating  tax  evasion,  food  waste  and  food  insecurity,  and promoting  respect  for  animal  well-being  and  responsible  food practices were all taken into account in Orange's non-financial risk assessment.

Such  violations  may  relate  to  forced  labor,  modern  slavery  or human trafficking, the rights of children, non-decent, discriminatory or  dangerous  working  conditions,  interference  with  freedom  of association or expression, or privacy. In particular, they could occur in regions where minerals are mined, processed and traded in conflict zones, or areas where human rights are not respected. In addition, the Covic-19 pandemic is hindering Orange's ability to exercise its oversight through on-site audits.\n\nIf they were to materialize, these risks could have a significant adverse impact on Orange, or its suppliers and subcontractors concerned, in terms of image and reputation, and could result in liability for the Group.\n\nMoreover,  Orange  may  be  required,  in  the  countries  where  it operates, to comply with injunctions from local authorities that do not comply with legal or regulatory requirements. These injunctions, the frequency of which is increasing with the growing role played by digital technologies in society, may involve a suspension (in full, in part, or in a given region) of certain networks for which Orange is responsible, or the interception of communications, or the disclosure of personal data to third parties. Complying with such injunctions may therefore infringe upon freedom of expression or other fundamental freedoms.\n\nIf  Orange  were  to  fail  to  enforce  applicable  laws  or  regulations, such injunctions could have a significant impact on the image and reputation of both Orange and the offending countries, and could result in an infringement of freedom of expression and privacy for civil society or the targets of such requests.\n\nOrange and some of its stakeholders are exposed to physical and transitional risks related to climate change.\n\nMedium \u25cf\u25cf\u00b7\n\nI n a d d i t i o n  t o  t h e  i m p a c t s  o n  O r a n g e ' s  i n f r a s t r u c t u r e  ( s e e  S e c t i o n  2 .1.1, Operational risks, Orange's technical infrastructure is vulnerable to damage caused by intentional or accidental damage, but also by natural disasters, the frequency of which is increased by climate change),  climate  change  could  also  have  a  negative  impact  on the  activities  of  its  suppliers  and  subcontractors.

Excessive and inappropriate use of telecommunication services and equipment could also have harmful consequences on health.\n\nMedium \u25cf\u25cf\u00b7\n\nFollowing concerns raised in many countries regarding the possible health  risks  linked  to  exposure  to  electromagnetic  fields  from telecommunication equipment, public authorities have in general approved binding  regulations  and  health  authorities  have  issued various precautions on usage.\n\nThere is a consensus among expert groups and health authorities, including the World Health Organization (WHO), that no health risk has been established to date from exposure to electromagnetic fields below  the  limits  recommended  by  the  International  Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP). However, additional scientific studies are underway on some of the spectrum used for 5G. Orange cannot prejudge the conclusions of future scientific research or future assessments by international organizations and scientific committees mandated to examine these issues. If an adverse health effect were to be scientifically established, it would have a significant adverse effect on Orange's business, brand image and the Group's earnings and financial position. Beyond potential adverse effects on Orange, this could significantly curb the development of the digital society.\n\nPublic perception of a risk to human health or biodiversity could lead to a reduction in the number of customers and their level of use, as well as an increase in litigation, particularly against the installation of antennas for the mobile network.

There could also be a tightening of regulations, resulting in a reduction in areas covered, failure to meet Orange's coverage commitments to the authorities,\n\ndeterioration in the quality of service and an increase in network rollout costs.\n\nThe ubiquity of connected digital equipment may lead to inappropriate use due to overuse or exposure to inappropriate content and online harassment.

If this ubiquity were perceived as a risk for the most vulnerable groups, it could undermine confidence in digital technology and act as a brake on innovation, and, for Orange, a decrease in the use of its services and a deterioration of its image.\n\nIn any event, the Group could be held liable, and Orange's revenue, earnings,  quality  of  service  and  reputation  could  be  adversely affected.\n\nThe rapid development of new uses and technologies may jeopardize the commitments made by Orange with regard to reducing its environmental impact.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDue to th e n a t u r e  o f  i t s  s e r v i c e s  a n d  i t s  s o c i a l  r e a c h ,  O r a n g e  m u s t  o f f e r new solutions to reduce the environmental impact of its customers while limiting its own sources of environmental pollution. Orange has made a 'Net Zero Carbon in 2040' commitment and has set itself the interim target of reducing its CO2 equivalent emissions by 30% by 2025 compared with 2015. As part of its Engage 2025 strategic plan, Orange aims to tighten the control of its energy consumption, step up the implementation of circular economy principles, intensify its use of renewable energies and increase its investments in carbon sinks. If its environmental action plans, particularly during the period of technological transition on the fixed network and the introduction of 5G, prove insufficient or mobilize unavailable resources, Orange could  fail  to  meet  its  commitment,  which  could  have  a  material adverse effect on its image and on the perception of the positive impact of telecommunications services for a carbon-free society.\n\n## 2.2 Activity and risk management framework\n\nOrange's risk management and internal control systems consist of an organization, procedures and management systems implemented by the General Management and all employees under the authority of the Board of Directors. They are designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of operational and strategic objectives, compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and the reliability of financial and non-financial information.\n\nMeasures in place notably enable Orange to meet its obligations under certain laws such as the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act, France's Financial  Security  Law  of  July  17,  2003,  Government  Order 2008-1278 of December 8, 2008 transposing Directive 2006/43/ EC  of  May  17,  2006  on  statutory  audits,  Government  Order  of March 17, 2016 transposing Directive 2014/56/EU, and also French Law  No.  2016-1691  of  December  9,  2016  on  transparency,  the fight  against  corruption,  and  the  modernization  of  economic  life, known as Sapin II, as well as Law No. 2017-399 of March 27, 2017 relating to the duty of Vigilance of parent companies and ordering companies, which requires the implementation of a vigilance plan, and Directive 2014/95/EU of October 22, 2014, known as the Barnier directive, transposed into French law by Decree No. 2017-1265 of August 9, 2017.\n\nThe  activity  and  risk  management  framework  is  steered  by  the General  Management's  Risks  Committee,  and  is  supported  by the work of the other governance committees (see Section 5.2.2.3 Executive Committee and Group governance committees). It is driven in particular by the Group's Audit, Control and Risk Management Department, with a contribution from the Group's Corporate Social Responsibility Department. The systems are in place in all Group entities as part of a continuous improvement process.\n\nThe  activity  and  risk  management  framework  is  based  on  a cross-functional  and  collaborative  structure,  organized  into  three lines of control:\n\n- -the first line provides operational products and services, manages r i s k s  i n  o p e r a t i o n s  i n  l i n e  w i t h  t h e  r e q u i r e m e n t s  o f  t h e  s e c o n d  l i n e ;\n- -the second line defines, deploys, manages and assesses the Group's  risk  management  and  internal  control  systems,  and provides expertise and assistance;\n- -the third line provides independent and objective assurance.",

It is informed about the work of General Control and Internal Audit and may request their input. The Group's Inspector General sits on the Risks Committee, the Ethics Committee and the Investment Committee.\n\nFinally, in accordance with the provisions of Directives 2006/43/EC and 2014/56/EU, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors is tasked with monitoring the effectiveness of internal control and risk management systems, particularly for financial purposes, in addition to reviewing exposure to employee-related and environmental risks, i n a c c o r d a n c e  w i t h  t h e  l a t e s t  a m e n d m e n t s  t o  t h e  r e v i s e d  A f e p - M e d e f Code of June 2018.\n\n## 2.2.1 Group Audit, Control and Risk Management\n\nThe  Group  Audit,  Control  and  Risk  Management  Department (DACRG) reports to the Delegate Chief Executive Officer, Executive Director  Finance,  Performance  and  Development.  It  combines within  a  single  body  the  following  functions:  Internal  Audit,  Risk Management, General Control, Credit Management, Internal Control, Fraud, and Revenue Assurance.\n\nIts role is to define, deploy, manage and assess the Group's activity and ri s k  m a n a g e m e n t  s y s t e m  o n  b e h a l f  o f  G e n e r a l  M a n a g e m e n t  w i t h a view to providing integrated assurance offering the best balance between risks and opportunities, working closely with operational departments and addressing their concerns, capitalizing on a team of experts and co-constructing innovative approaches, in cooperation with the other teams responsible for Group risk management, while preserving audit independence.\n\nAt the heart of the Group's challenges and strategy, through this integrated  assurance, the DACRG supports developments in the Group's activities. To this end, its role is to protect revenue (through revenue assurance and customer risk management), control fraud (prevention, detection and treatment), provide support to the second line  of  control,  but  also  to  strengthen  governance,  while  offering solutions to improve risk control and create value.\n\nThe  continuous  improvement  process  in  risk  management  and internal control is reflected, for instance, in:\n\n- -updates of the fraud prevention processes, the modules of which are distributed and evaluated on a regular basis;\n- -risk  management  training  for  Directors  and  Chief  Executive Officers of subsidiaries;\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 2\n\n2",

They are designed to provide assurance that the internal control system is effective, namely that the main risks have been identified and the appropriate steps taken to limit their potential impact. Internal control reviews are part of the integrated assurance approach between operational departments and functions in charge of risk management.\n\nAs  part  of  the  Engage  2025  strategy,  the  DACRG  and  the  ACR (Audit,  Control  and  Risks)  community,  which  brings  together  all the people involved in these functions within the Group, have been strengthened to support the growth of international activities and their diversification, particularly in mobile financial services.\n\nA charter has also been signed by the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. It sets out the framework for the tasks of the ACR community under  the  guidance  of  the  DACRG,  thereby  strengthening  the integrated assurance approach (synergies between local and central ACR functions and operational departments) to meet the Company's objectives. The charter reiterates the independence of internal audit in its function as a third line of control.\n\nFinally, the DACRG's activities are in line with best practices promoted by the Institut fran\u00e7ais de l'Audit et du Contr\u00f4le Interne (IFACI) and the Association pour le Management des Risques et des Assurances de l'Entreprise (AMRAE).\n\n## ISO 9001 Quality Certification for the DACRG\n\nIn  July  2020,  the  AFAQ/AFNOR  follow-up  audit  confirmed  the DACRG's ISO 9001 certification (renewed in July 2018). This quality approach, which supports the DACRG's aim of becoming a 'trusted business partner' contributes to the improvement and simplification of all processes with a view to adopting best practices that meet the requirements of Orange's stakeholders.\n\nThe  certification  covers  activities  related  to  the  'definition, deployment, coordination and evaluation of the Group's approach to risk management and internal control, as well as those relating to the coordination of the Group's Audit, Control and Risk Management community'.\n\n## Group Internal Audit\n\nGroup Internal Audit has approximately 65 qualified auditors working as a shared service for all Group entities. They are for the most part located in France. Group Internal Audit comprises teams dedicated to  the  IT  system,  the  networks  and  financial  services.  Group Internal  Audit  cooperates  with  local  audit  teams,  in  accordance with  their  governance  rules:  sharing  of  audit  plans,  follow-up  of recommendations, joint audits, and methodological exchanges. This mainly concerns operator subsidiaries that are not wholly owned (in  Europe,  notably  Orange  Polska  and  Orange  Belgium,  and  in Africa, notably Sonatel group). Group Internal Audit, Orange Polska's Internal  Audit  and  Sonatel  group's  Internal  Audit  are  subject  to annual certification by IFACI Certification, in accordance with French professional standards for internal audit (RPAI).\n\nIssues  may  be  referred  directly  to  Group  Internal  Audit  by  the Chairman of the Audit Committee or the Chairman and CEO. The\n\nDirector of Group Audit is authorized to directly inform the Executive Committee and the Audit Committee.\n\nEach year, the audit plan is endorsed by the Risks Committee and approved by the Audit Committee. An annual report, with the main results and findings, is also presented to the Risks Committee and then the Audit Committee.\n\nThe j o i n t  o p e r a t i o n  w i t h  D e u t s c h e  Te l e k o m  ( B u y I n )  i s  s u b j e c t  t o  a u d i t s conducted jointly by the Orange group's and Deutsche Telekom's Internal Audit Departments.\n\nThrough its assignments, Internal Audit helps the Group maintain an appropriate control system by assessing its effectiveness and efficiency  and  issuing  observations  and  recommendations  for  its continuous improvement. The recommendations arising from internal audits are systematically monitored, and give rise to action plans that are drawn up and implemented by the Group's divisions and subsidiaries. These assignments notably include work performed at the request of the Group's Internal Control Department as part of the systematic evaluation of management systems, particularly through cyclical audits of subsidiaries' internal control systems. Internal Audit also contributes to the process of identifying, assessing and treating r i s k s  t h r o u g h  t h e  r e s u l t s  o f  a u d i t  a s s i g n m e n t s  a n d  r e c o m m e n d a t i o n s .\n\n## Risk Management\n\nThe  Group's  Risk  Management  Department  defines  the  strategy and rolls  out  the  Group's  risk  management  approach,  within  the framework of the integrated approach promoted by the ACR charter. To that end:\n\n- -it  leads  the  risk  identification  and  assessment  processes  on behalf of the Risks Committee (see Section 5.2.2.3 Executive Committee and Group governance committees);\n- -it ensures that the corresponding action plans are followed up, with support from Group Internal Control and networks of risk managers and internal controllers of the entities and subsidiaries;\n- -it supports all Group entities in mapping risks of all kinds, including the  Group's  Corporate  Social  Responsibility  Department  for non-financial risks;\n- -it anticipates,  in  collaboration  with  the  Group  Strategy Department, the risks related to the strategic plan.\n\nEach  risk  is  defined  as  a  potential  event,  the  consequences  of which, if it occurred, would prevent Orange or one of its entities from carrying out its missions, meeting its commitments or achieving its objectives, or which could affect Orange's people, assets, earnings and financial position, or the environment or the reputation of the entity or the Group.\n\nThe  various  sources  of  risk  identification  combine  the  views  of management  and  those  of  the  operating  entities.  The  analysis of  causes  and  consequences  complements  and  fine-tunes  the description of the event and influences the risk probability level or risk impact level. The context analysis makes it possible to characterize the  risk  in  each  particular  situation,  to  fine-tune  its  causes  and consequences, and to assess the probability and impacts of the risk in a way that is suited to the area of the organization where the risk is identified. Their inclusion in risk mapping reflects the principle of the prevalence of impact analysis (consequence-related) over probability analysis (cause-related).\n\nGroup management teams identify and assess, at least annually, the risks falling within their scope. This mapping forms the cornerstone on  which  the  management  systems  are  built.  It  also  contains  a description  of  additional  action  plans  aimed  at  stepping  up  the internal control required to address these risks. The list of significant events,  changes  in  risks  and  the  monitoring  of  action  plans  are reviewed during each department's internal control reviews.",

        "page_content": "At Group level, risks are monitored by the General Management's Risks Committee. The assessment of overall risk management is reviewed at least once a year by this committee and presented to the Directors at a joint meeting of the Board of Directors' committees, during  which  major  risks  are  discussed  in  the  presence  of  the Directors concerned. This process includes a review of all the risks described in Section 2.1 Risk factors of this document.\n\n## General Control and investigations\n\nGeneral Control involves, at  the  request  of  Executive  Committee members or their respective Management Committees, or following a report from the ethics whistleblowing mechanism, investigations on matters involving employees that may run counter to the Group's interests. These matters may involve instances of fraud, conflicts of interest, damage to Group assets, behavioral problems and in general any acts by employees that are inconsistent with Group rules. In this respect, General Control works in a complementary manner to the various departments within the DACRG as well as to Group General Inspection. In France, General Control is represented by the investigations unit, which was merged in 2020 into a single team, and at Group level, for international affairs and central functions, by the General Controllers. Some countries, such as Poland, Spain, Romania  and  Senegal,  have  dedicated  internal  structures  and operate in a network with General Control.\n\n## Credit Management\n\nGroup Credit Management is tasked with minimizing financial risks related to credit granted to Group customers. Its objective is to have a  consolidated  view  of  credit  risks  with  customers  and  partners (periodic credit committee) and to implement tools to manage those risks. To do so, it calls on local teams or correspondents and on the processes in place in each operating entity.\n\nIt promotes the credit management culture and supervises customer risk  management  within  the  Group.  It  heads  the  Group  Credit Committee, which meets periodically with the various divisions to review bad debt, which is recognized in other operating income and expenses (see Notes 5.3 Trade receivables and 6.2 Other operating expenses to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\nIn 2020, a special effort was made to harmonize, consolidate and control the financial impact of the health crisis.\n\n## Internal Control\n\nGroup Internal Control develops and conducts the internal control strategy  within  Orange.  To  that  end,  it  defines  a  methodology, processes and the tools necessary for its application. It implements them annually, in particular with:\n\n- -the updating and circulation of the Orange IC Book, a set of policies and practices defined by the Group in association with the relevant Group functions and domains;\n- -internal  control  self-assessment  procedures  based  on  risk analysis  and  the  Orange IC Book,  the  aim  being  to  identify the main improvements to be made in terms of risk coverage and therefore internal control, and to take corrective action as needed. In addition, internal audits confirm the results of the s e l f - a s s e s s m e n t  a n d  e n s u r e  t h e  e f f e c t i v e n e s s  o f  t h e  a c t i o n  p l a n s implemented, if necessary;\n- -risk review procedures and management systems associated with operational processes. Such approaches are based on an end-to-end cross-functional vision. They contribute in particular to the work on Sarbanes-Oxley certification for internal financial control  and  the  accounting  control  requirements  of  France's Sapin II law.\n\nGroup Internal Control coordinates the local internal control functions and the Group functions responsible for the control environmental domains, and coordinates with the other functions of the second line of control, providing them with support and advice on the quality and control of their systems. The role of the local internal control function is to assist the operating managers of their entities in order to help them  structure  and  maintain  an  efficient  internal  control  system meeting both their own needs and those of the Group. To that end, they  apply  the  Group's  activity  and  risk  management  guidelines within their entity, and ensure that the system operates effectively at their level, in coordination with the other functions of the second line of control, in order to capitalize on all existing systems and thus increase their robustness.\n\nGroup Internal Control agrees to an annual action and evaluation program for each scope (domains, divisions, and entities). It assists the  various  departments  through  internal  control  assignments designed to provide reasonable assurance that activities are properly controlled in various areas (e.g. compliance with laws and regulations, governance, operational or decision-making processes, integration of new entities, support for the implementation of action plans, etc.).\n\nAmong its  recurring  actions,  it  follows  up  with  the  heads  of  the governance committees (see Section 5.2.2.3 Executive Committee and Group governance committees) and coordinates the organization of  internal  control  reviews  with  the  members  of  the  Executive Committee,  with  the  assistance  of  the  DACRG,  and  the  Group Security, Group Compliance and CSR Departments.\n\nGroup Internal Control ensures the strengthening of the Group's IC systems by supporting its developments (in particular the internal control services of mobile financial services, Orange Middle East Africa, Orange Business Services and accounting controls under the Sapin II law).\n\nThe  Orange  group  Internal  Control  function  manages  the  GRC (Governance, Risk & Compliance) solution of publisher SAI Global, in  particular  for  internal  control  and  risk  management  system documentation, assessments and action plans, and internal audit recommendations. The GRC solution, which is regularly updated, meets the company's expectations with a view to reinforcing the integrated  assurance  strategy  developed  and  deployed  by  the DACRG.\n\nThe  Internal  Control  evaluation  is  presented  to  the  Group  Risks Committee and then to the Audit Committee.\n\n## Fraud and Revenue Assurance\n\nRevenue recognition in the telecommunication industry is based on data capture, involving various components of network access -  managing and collecting uses - recovery via the IT systems supporting the customer bases and recovery of individual items - and recording via the accounting and financial systems - supporting the production of financial statements. The complexity of this technical and  commercial  architecture  has  led  Orange,  through  its  Fraud and Revenue Assurance Department, to develop its own revenue protection strategy. It is backed up by a methodology ensuring the correct measurement, substance, comprehensiveness and valuation of the individual elements underpinning customer invoicing, through a risk-oriented overview of the entire process chain.\n\nGroup  Fraud  and  Revenue  Assurance  (GFRA)  also  defines  the Group's strategy and approach to fraud prevention and detection. To support the deployment of this strategy, GFRA works very closely with its Internal Control and Risk Management colleagues, along with other corporate and operating entity teams.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 2\n\n2",

GFRA continuously monitors existing and emerging fraud risks as well as any new fraud-related legislation. This enables Orange to adapt its anti-fraud strategy accordingly. GFRA maintains up-to-date mapping of the Group's fraud risks, covering all risks anticipated in this area (including financial statement fraud, technical (cyber) fraud, identity theft and social engineering fraud, missing trader VAT carousels, money laundering and the financing of terrorism).\n\nOrange has implemented preventive controls to reduce the likelihood of the occurrence of fraud that could constitute a major risk.\n\nSince  prevention  cannot  be  100%  effective,  the  Group  has  also defined a control framework designed to detect instances of fraud. Any case or suspicion of fraud identified through these controls is investigated and dealt with in accordance with the law and Orange's ethics principles.\n\nOrange considers that to manage fraud risk and protect revenue effectively, the cost of fraud and revenue leakage must be controlled at  entity  level  and  consolidated  at  Group  level,  allowing  major incidents  to  be  analyzed  and  treated,  and  any  emerging  trends to  be  identified.  With  regard  to  the  production  of  Group  financial information, the approach defined by GFRA includes the relevant\n\nrisks in this area, such as fraud committed by management or fraud in the financial statements.\n\nFraud detection is the responsibility of management, assisted by GFRA and local fraud detection specialists in the Group's entities.\n\nA Group whistleblowing mechanism is in place as provided for under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, France's Sapin II law of December 9, 2016 and the law of March 27, 2017 relating to the duty of Vigilance of parent companies and ordering companies. The system is presented in Section 2.2.4.1.2 Breaches of ethics rules.\n\nWhen internal fraud is strongly suspected, investigations are generally entrusted to specialized services, in particular to General Control. Investigation services are responsible for establishing the materiality of  the  facts.  In  cases  of  internal  fraud,  company  management determines the penalties. For all cases detected (internal or external fraud), the legal, civil or criminal consequences are considered after consulting the company's Legal Department.\n\nAs part of a continuous improvement process, cases of fraud are analyzed by GFRA in order to improve controls and assess measures to be taken, and thus better prevent and detect similar cases.\n\nA summary report on fraud prevention and detection is reviewed at least once a year by the Group Risks Committee and presented at a joint meeting to the Board of Directors' committees.\n\n## 2.2.2 Group Corporate Social Responsibility\n\nThe Orange group's Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activities are  coordinated by a dedicated team, reporting to the Executive Director  CSR,  Diversity  and  Philanthropy.  Deputy  Chair  for  the Orange Foundation. That team reports regularly to the Executive Committee, directly and through the work of the Ethics Committee, whose  functions  have  been  expanded  to  include  management of  the  Group's  performance  on  sustainability  issues,  and  to  the Orange Board of  Directors  through  the  work  of  the  Governance and Corporate Social and Environmental Responsibility Committee (GCSERC). Orange's Executive Committee and Board of Directors are  thus  informed  of  and  take  a  position  on  the  main  options selected in relation to the Vigilance Plan, its implementation report, those constituting the Declaration on Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking and the relevant aspects of the Statement of Non-Financial Performance. They also oversee the Group's actions and priorities on employee-related, social and environmental matters (including those related to climate change). The Group CSR Department collaborates with the Group Audit, Control and Risk Management Department. In particular, it draws on the work on non-financial risks presented by other divisions to Orange's Risks Committee and uses the Group's risk assessment and management methodology. It also uses the Group's methodology for rolling out its risk management approach to the entities and takes part in divisional internal control reviews.\n\nThe  CSR  Department  is  itself  broken  down  into  business  lines (Responsible Marketing, Corporate & Social Issues, Environment) and cross-functional  departments (Communication, Governance, Operations and Per formance); it repor ts on the Group's per formance i n i t s  a r e a s  o f  a c t i v i t y,  i n  p a r t i c u l a r  t h r o u g h  n o n - fi n a n c i a l  r e p o r t i n g ,  a n d on the financial implications stemming from the commitments made in Engage 2025. The entities' CSR activities are thus gradually being integrated into the entity's Business Reviews (analysis of variances between actual and projected per formance in the budgeting process and monitoring of the strategic plan) in conjunction with the Group Finance and Strategy teams. It is supported by networks of CSR experts  and  managers,  as  well  as  managers  responsible  for  the implementation of the Vigilance Plan, led by the Group CSR team, which contribute to the operational implementation of the approach.\n\nIn 2019, Orange chose to adopt a corporate purpose to formalize its  commitment  to  society.  Its  vision,  co-constructed  with  its stakeholders,  is  to  ensure  that  digital  technology  is  thought  out, made available and used in a more human, inclusive and sustainable way in all areas of its activity. To that end, Orange has elected to incorporate its corporate purpose into its Bylaws (see Chapter 4 Non-financial performance, section The Orange corporate purpose). The strategic plan, Engage 2025, embodies this corporate purpose and is itself built on the idea that financial performance is achieved by  leading  by  example  on  social  and  environmental  issues.  The Group's  commitment  is  reflected  in  a  selection  of  Sustainable Development  Goals  (SDG)  established  by  the  member  states  of the  United  Nations,  for  which  the  Orange  Executive  Committee believes that the Group has, or should have, the capacity to make a genuinely positive contribution. The Group's impacts stemming from Orange's environmental commitments are analyzed and measured through  SDG  12  (responsible  production  and  consumption)  and SDG 13 (climate  action),  and  those  for  digital  inclusion  through SDG 9 (industry,  innovation  and  infrastructure)  and  10  (reducing inequalities).  Those  two  areas  of  commitment  and  more  broadly Orange 's business conduct are backed up by SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions) and SDG 17 (partnerships for the goals).\n\nCommitment to digital inclusion:\n\n- -SDG 9: investment in infrastructure and research is essential to  achieving  sustainable  development  and  community empowerment in many countries. Orange's core  business  is to offer its customers connectivity with ever-faster speeds and new related services. Orange is committed to taking action to maximize regional coverage;\n- -SDG  10:  inclusion  to  reduce  inequalities.  In  addition  to  its ambitions for regional digital coverage, Orange aims to work for  inclusion  by  training  the  digitally  excluded,  supporting  its customers, promoting responsible service offers adapted to as many people as possible, and supporting digital entrepreneurship. Orange is also committed to using digital technology to promote development  and  equal  opportunities  for  its  employees  and customers.",

For Orange, leading by example on the environment takes the form of a target of being Net Zero Carbon by 2040, despite a continuous and steady increase in use across its networks. This will require unprecedented effort in terms of energy efficiency for its own emissions and those of its customers, the implementation of circular economy principles and the increased use of renewable energies. To sequester its residual greenhouse gas emissions, the Group will supplement these measures by investing in carbon sinks.\n\nSupporting all commitments:\n\n- -SDGs 16 and 17: the implementation of Orange's commitments is based on a number of principles of action, namely data protection, including  the  protection  of  personal  data,  transparency  and openness,  while  promoting  ethical  behavior  towards  all stakeholders.  Orange  has  also  established  a  Group-wide anti-corruption system. The success of these various initiatives depends  on  close  cooperation  with  the  other  players  in  its ecosystem.\n\nOrange takes into account the principles of inclusion, materiality and responsiveness defined by the AA1000 APS standard (2008), an international benchmark for Corporate Social Responsibility focused on taking into account the expectations of stakeholders. The Group also takes into account the principles defined by ISO 26000 on the social responsibility of organizations, as well as the guidelines laid down by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI - see https://oran.ge/ GRI for the report prepared under the GRI Core option) and aligns its  publications  with  the  recommendations  of  the  Task  Force  on Climate-related  Financial  Disclosures  (TCFD).  Orange  also  takes into account the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) framework, which is gradually being integrated into its publications.\n\nTo  ensure  the  reliability  of  the  indicators  and  monitor  the  proper application of the Group's commitments in the entities, Orange has had an external verification of its CSR approach and achievements carried out for several years by one of its Statutory Auditors, in order to  obtain  a  reasonable  assurance  report  on  a  selection  of  CSR Information (see Section 4.7 Report by one of the Statutory Auditors, designated as an independent third party).\n\n## 2.2.3 Specific financial internal control procedures\n\nThe  specific  financial  internal  control  procedures  relate  to  the preparation and processing of accounting and financial information, and the work on internal control carried out pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In addition, an insurance policy translates certain operational risks into financial commitments.\n\n## 2.2.3.1 Specific internal control procedures pertaining to the preparation and processing of accounting and financial information\n\nThe  Group  Accounting  Department  and  the  Group  Controlling Department,  which  both  report  to  the  Delegate  Chief  Executive Officer, Executive Director Finance, Performance and Development, play a decisive role in the internal control system.\n\nThe  Group  Accounting  Department  and  the  Group  Controlling Department have the following key duties:\n\n- -producing the Group's Consolidated Financial Statements and the Statutory Financial Statements of Orange SA and certain French subsidiaries within timeframes that meet financial market requirements and legal obligations while guaranteeing that the statements  provide  a  true  and  fair  view  of  the  Company  in compliance with the accounting policies adopted by the Group;\n- -preparing  the  management  reports  on  the  Statutory  and Consolidated  Financial  Statements,  and  producing  the documentation necessary for financial communication of results and the summary of management reporting for the Executive Committee;\n- -managing the monthly and quarterly reporting cycle allowing management to measure the Group's performance on a regular basis;\n- -designing and implementing Group accounting and management methods, procedures and standards;\n- -identifying  and  carrying  out  the  necessary  changes  to  the Group's accounting and management information systems.\n\nWithin these departments, internal control of accounting and financial information is organized around the following elements:\n\n- -the Disclosure Committee (see Section 5.2.2.3);\n- -the Group accounting and controlling function;\n- -unified accounting and management reporting; and\n- -G roup-wide accounting standards and methods.\n\n## Unified accounting and management reporting\n\nAll Group entities are part of the Group's management and steering cycle, which has three fundamental components:\n\n- -the  forecast  process  (plan,  budget  and  periodic  internal forecasts);\n- -the process for producing the Group's Statutory and Consolidated Financial Statements; and\n- -the management reporting process.\n\n## Forecast process (plan, budget and periodic internal forecasts)\n\nThe Group's budget process requires regular updates of internal projections,  and  management's  close  involvement.  It  is  applied to  all  of  the  Group's  countries  and  divisions,  business  units  and subsidiaries.\n\nThe budget must reflect the Group's ambitions at each level of the organization. The budget is drawn up annually, between November and December, and is presented to and approved by the Group's governing bodies. Further forecasts are made during the year (in May, September and November) to determine the allocation of resources with a view to achieving the budget objectives.\n\nThe budget dossier is composed of:\n\n- -packages  of  financial  data,  along  with  summary  comments, particularly on major actions;\n- -capital expenditure by nature; and\n- -analysis of risks and opportunities.\n\nAs part of the budget process, the divisions establish and analyze performance measurement indicators. The budget is broken down by month to serve as a reference for the Group's monthly reporting.\n\nThe Group also draws up a multi-year plan for all  countries  and di v i s i o n s ,  s e t t i n g  o u t  m e d i u m - t e r m  fi n a n c i a l  t r a j e c t o r i e s  f o r  t h e  G r o u p .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 2\n\n2",

However,  if  an  entity  applies principles  that  are  not  consistent  with  those  of  the  Group  in  its Statutory Financial Statements and they have a material impact on the assessment of its earnings and assets, the entity concerned will make adjustments to ensure consistency.\n\nEach entity is responsible for identifying, periodically measuring and reconciling differences in accounting methods between the Statutory Financial Statements and the Group standards.\n\nThe  identification  and  assessment  of  unrecognized  contractual commitments are covered by a specific report drawn up annually by the Legal and Finance Departments, working in close collaboration. The main contractual and regulatory commitments of the Group that are liable to have a material impact on its financial position are brought to the attention of the Commitments Committee (see Section 5.2.2.3 Executive Committee and Group governance committees).\n\n## Management reporting process\n\nThe reporting process is a major part of the financial control and information system. It is the preferred tool for monitoring, controlling and steering the Group's General Management. The reconciliation of accounting information with forecast data, combined with monthly analysis at each level of the Group, contributes to the quality and reliability  of  the  information  produced.  This  operating  principle, established  by  the  controlling  and  accounting  functions,  applies to all Group entities and at each level of the organization (business unit, division and Group).\n\nThe Group's reporting content and documents, which are used to track  the  achievement of Group objectives, are established on a regular and consistent basis. The financial data used for reporting are derived mainly from the Group's consolidation and reporting tool, and reporting formats are standardized. The reports are validated by the heads of Controlling in each country.\n\nThis reporting allows for the monitoring of the Group's management and performance indicators, and is based on:\n\n- -reporting  in  the  second  and  third  months  of  each  quarter, including  financial  and  operational  indicators,  identifying  the main variations by reporting segment, country and business line;\n\n- -a quarterly dashboard designed to provide the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Executive Committee with key operational indicators for the Group and major events and aler ts.\n\nBusiness reviews at the Executive Committee level are organized by  country  under  the  authority  of  the  Delegate  Chief  Executive Officer, Executive Director Finance, Performance and Development. Their  purpose  is  to  steer  the  business.  They  bring  together  the Group  Finance  Department  and  the  country  CEO  and  finance function on a monthly basis. The Chairman and CEO participates in the quarterly reviews, which are based on a formalized reporting structure. Gathering of information for these reports is organized for each country in accordance with the Group's reporting instructions.\n\n## Group-wide accounting standards and methods\n\nFor the preparation of projected and actual Consolidated Financial Statements, the Group has opted for the unification principle, which implies:\n\n- -consistency of the reference framework, accounting methods and consolidation rules;\n- -standardization of reporting formats; and\n- -use of a common IT consolidation and reporting tool within the Group.\n\nWithin the Group Accounting Department, the Standards Department is responsible for defining and circulating the Group's accounting policies  under  IFRS.  It  also  monitors  changes  in  standards  and formalizes the Group's accounting policies under IFRS in a systematic and  structured  manner  through  the  Group  accounting  manual, closing instructions and information or training meetings. In 2020, the Standards Department launched the QualIFRS project aimed at ensuring that Orange's main accounting positions are correctly updated under IFRS.\n\nThe  system  is  supplemented  by  the  establishment  of  standards liaison officers in the various countries and divisions. They form a network tasked with identifying accounting issues locally, circulating the  Group's  accounting  policies  among  divisions,  countries  and entities, and accounting departments, and taking into account the training needs of employees responsible for the proper application of Group accounting policies.\n\n## 2.2.3.2 Summary of internal control work implemented pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act\n\nDue to its listing on the New York Stock Exchange, Orange is subject to the provisions of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\n\nPursuant to the provisions of Section 404 of that Act, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Delegate Chief Executive Of ficer, Executive  Director  Finance,  Performance  and  Development  are required to prepare a report in which they make a statement on the effectiveness of internal control procedures relating to the production of  the  Group's  financial  statements  prepared  in  accordance  with I F R S ,  a s  p r e s e n t e d  i n  t h e  a n n u a l  r e p o r t  ( Form 20-F) ,  w h i c h  i s  fi l e d  w i t h the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The Statutory Auditors  conduct  their  own  assessment  of  internal  control.  The management and Statutory Auditors' reports are included in Form 20-F each year.\n\nTo better meet the requirements of Section 404 of the Act, Orange, under  the  guidance  of  the  Group  Internal  Control  Department, implements a permanent program to reinforce the internal control culture across the entire Group.\n\nBy applying principles issued by the SEC, Orange targets its financial internal control system at areas of significant risk, making it both more relevant and more effective, and limiting the assessment work to controls covering those areas.",

        "page_content": "Regarding the reliability of financial  information,  Orange relies  on the internationally recognized 2013 framework of the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the Treadway Commission. Orange classifies the five component parts of the COSO under two headings:\n\n- -control environment (governance committees, overall policies and procedures); and\n- -operational control (flows and processes).\n\nThe annual work program, which covers the control environment and operational control, comprises the following main actions, based on the risks identified:\n\n- -identification of the scope: this concerns the Group's governance committees,  the  control  environment  domains  and  the consolidated entities whose scope is aligned with the audit of the financial statements;\n- -scoping: identification by entity of the relevant control environment domains and flows and information systems supporting those flows;\n- -documentation of the internal control system implemented and assessment of its effectiveness.\n\nThe work relating to the evaluation of financial internal control takes i nto account the work of internal audit and r i s k m a n a g e m e n t a n a l y s e s , as well as work on fraud (prevention, detection and investigation).\n\nThe Statutory Auditors also carry out an independent evaluation of the financial internal control system.\n\nThe process did not reveal  any  major  weaknesses  in  2020.  The Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  the  Delegate  Chief Executive  Officer,  Executive  Director  Finance,  Performance  and Development therefore concluded that the internal control system for the production of the financial statements was operationally effective.\n\n## 2.2.3.3 Insurance\n\nThe  Orange  group's  insurance  policy  is  designed  to  secure  the exposure of the Group's assets and earnings to its main risks. Orange implements a strategy aimed at organizing the transfer of those risks to players whose solvency and management capacity (production and claims) must meet the Group's security requirements and needs in an optimized way as regards the protection/cost ratio.\n\nAn insurance plan has accordingly been negotiated in the insurance and  reinsurance  market  for  risk  financing,  which  is  regularly reassessed in calls for tenders to qualify its brokers and insurers.\n\nThis i n s u r a n c e  p l a n  r e fl e c t s  t h e  n a t u r e  o f  t h e  O r a n g e  g r o u p 's  r i s k s  a n d is adapted to the capacities offered by the markets to international companies of comparable size operating in similar business sectors. The suitability of the Group's existing programs in meeting its needs is confirmed by the publication of regular studies and benchmarks.\n\nNegotiations conducted during the most recent program renewals confirmed the intensification of the situation of hard market impacting the majority of branches (property damage and business interruption losses, cyber risks, financial lines, civil liability, etc.) observed over the last two years.\n\nUnderwriting  policies  adopted  by  the  vast  majority  of  insurance companies are characterized by the systematic application of rate increases accompanied by a drastic reduction in capacity offered and a significant increase in deductibles and retentions payable by policyholders.\n\nBusiness negotiated with insurers is systematically submitted to their referrals, located at their head offices, which apply underwriting rules based on a sector and/or the nature of the business of their client portfolios.  This  practice  can  extend  to  the  outright  withdrawal  of\n\ninsurers in certain risk areas such as natural disasters or Directors' and Officers' liability insurance. This trend in the insurance market could continue for several months.\n\nDespite this context and the market trend, the Group was able to renew  its  main  programs  while  preserving  most  of  the  capacity subscribed.\n\nThis poli c y h a s  a l s o  m a d e  i t  p o s s i b l e  t o  e x t e n d  t h e  s c o p e  o f  i n s u r a n c e coverage to virtually all Group subsidiaries and revenue. Subsidiaries have been gradually integrated into the insurance umbrella taking into account the regulatory developments affecting the regional locations of Group assets and activities.\n\nIn addition, the insurance policy in place includes a risk management strategy designed to identify potential vulnerabilities within the Group and to carry out preventive actions in line with changes in the Group's activities,  sites  and  environment.  This  strategy  is  reflected  in  the organization of regular visits to Orange's main sites in France and internationally,  in  partnership  with  the  engineers  of  the  Group's insurers and brokers. Despite health constraints and their impact on the organization of work, a number of risk visits were nevertheless organized with our insurers' engineers.\n\nF u r t h e r m o r e ,  t h e  G r o u p  I n s u r a n c e  D e p a r t m e n t  w o r k s  w i t h  t h e  r e l e v a n t Group entities, providing expertise and support for contractual loss prevention  techniques  written  into  agreements  with  customers, suppliers and stakeholders.\n\nThe transformation of the core business from telecom operator to that of a multi-service operator generates new risks, requiring it to constantly adapt financing in line with the nature of the business activities.  The  Group's  insurers  and  service  providers  are  kept regularly  informed  of  developments,  and  dedicated  insurance policies are taken out where necessary.\n\nThe  main  insurance  policies  that  make  up  the  current  plan  are designed to protect against the following risks:\n\n- -risks of property damage, and consequential financial losses and technological risks;\n- -third-party  and  customer  civil  liability  risks  incurred  during the management of the Company and the performance of its activities;\n- -risks associated with the Company's vehicle fleets.\n\nThe risk of damage to the telephone poles and open-wire lines of the overhead fixed network due to natural disasters remain self-insured. The  resulting  financial  expense  is  monitored  in  conjunction  with the  Group's  experts  and  the  relevant  broker.  Regarding  these expenses, the Group does not consider the case has been made for an alternative financial solution for these risks, and the traditional markets (insurance and reinsurance) no longer offer an adequate risk transfer solution.\n\nSpecific policies are also negotiated and set up, including:\n\n- -assistance  for  employees  on  business  trips  or  professional assignments, or expatriates;\n- -work site insurance (real-estate or construction projects);\n- -new activities (financial activities, banking).\n\nThe self-brokerage  activities  were  transferred  to  Orange  Bank  in 2020.\n\nThe  total  cost  of  insurance  coverage  under  the  Orange  group program amounts to approximately 0.044% of annual revenue.\n\nLastly,  the  Group  Insurance  Department  applies  internal  control processes to its management, which involves its external partners (experts, brokers) in its various stages, notably encompassing the control environment, governance and ethics. Employees are regularly made aware of ethics and anti-corruption issues.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 2\n\n2",

        "page_content": "## 2.2.4 Framework for the management of non-financial risks\n\nThe specific internal control procedures below, together with the policies and measures implemented, help mitigate the risks identified by the Group in the Statement of Non-Financial Performance (SNPF) and the Vigilance Plan. They are presented as they relate to five issues:\n\n- -the effect of our activities in terms of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms;\n- -the employment-related consequences of our activities;\n- -the social consequences of our activities;\n- -the environmental impacts of our activities;\n- -relations with partners, suppliers and subcontractors.\n\nThese issues were the subject of an initial analysis of their salience in  2019,  in  line  with  the  risk  factors  presented  in  Section  2.1.4 Non-financial risks.\n\nOrange has produced several socioeconomic footprint studies since 2017.  It  is  seeking  to  complement  this  approach  by  developing a  methodology  for  analyzing  the  impacts  of  its  activities  on  its stakeholders.  This  analysis  is  necessary  to  adapt  its  Corporate Social Responsibility policy in a continuous improvement process.\n\nOrange's policies are derived from the definition and criteria used in the Reporting Framework based on the United Nations Guidelines on Human Rights (UNGP) launched in February 2015 on key (human rights) issues (1) to assess its impacts. It is an approach based on:\n\n- -an assessment of the severity of risks in terms of their effects on  people,  independently  of  any  policies  or  action  plans implemented by Orange to mitigate their consequences;\n- -the  probability  of  their  occurrence  given  the  Group's  scope, independently of any policies or action plans implemented by Orange to mitigate their occurrence;\n- -Orange's ability to propose a remedy, i.e. the impact that the policies or action plans developed by Orange may have.\n\nOrange has selected the major SDGs for the Group, around which it has decided to structure its approach and the communication of its impacts. To that end, each of the major SDGs selected (as well as the additional related SDGs) has been broken down by theme applicable to Orange, with associated means and impact indicators t o  m o n i t o r  t r e n d s .

Deputy  Chair  for  the  Orange Foundation. It was presented to the Group Executive Committee and approved by the Ethics Committee and the GCSER Committee.\n\n## 2.2.4.1 Effects of our activities on respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe  framework  for  controlling  breaches  of  human  rights  and fundamental freedoms is a response to SDG 16 and aims to prevent non-financial risks relating to:\n\n- -the inappropriate disclosure or modification, by Orange or its business partners, of the personal data of customers or other third parties, notably during cyberattacks;\n- -exposure to risks of corruption, or individual or collective behavior that  is  not  in  line  with  its  business  ethics,  or  even  fraudulent behavior;\n\n- -the  violation  of  human  rights  and  fundamental  freedoms  by Orange or its business partners towards its employees, its supply chain and more specifically civil society as regards freedom of expression.\n\n## 2.2.4.1.1 Protecting personal data\n\n## Group policy on the protection of personal data\n\nThe protection of personal data is governed by the general data security  framework  implemented  by  Orange,  which  covers  both corporate information and personal data. It is one of the important areas  that  Orange  aims  to  develop  to  support  its  Engage  2025 strategic plan, and is covered by a Security Policy aimed at ensuring the continuous improvement of security based on risk management and assessment (particularly cybersecurity). It is regularly updated to mitigate the impact of incidents, or even crises, depending on the level of threat and changes in the environment.\n\nThe Group applies international standards such as ISO 27001 for information security and ISO 27005 for risk assessments, to guide its actions. The Group holds several certifications, attesting to the quality  of  the  resources  devoted  to  enhancing  the  protection  of Orange's assets and those of its customers. They cover scopes as varied as Orange Money, for African subsidiaries, Plazza, the Group's employee social network, the design, engineering and support of business services for OBS and European subsidiaries, etc.\n\nThese standards help enhance security management at the entity level  by  providing  a  common  Group-level  framework;  security staff can then decide more effectively which measures to take to prevent threats, and even detect them more quickly, contain them and eradicate any that do occur. The technical and organizational mechanisms derived from the overall security policy are formalized in the Group Security Standard, which focuses on essential security requirements to be applied throughout the Group. The following are available for security staff:\n\n- -the Group Security Standard, which sets 80 minimum rules to be implemented in three areas: information security, physical security and personal security in the face of country risks. Each of these rules receives a score of 0% to 100%, and the 80 rules are then averaged to obtain the overall score of the country. Each year, the entities are evaluated to verify compliance with the security standard. The aim is to reach or maintain a score above 90% for the European and MEA countries;\n- -a framework covering the Group Crisis Management Policy;\n- -s e m i n a r s  t o  s h a r e  r e g u l a r l y  u p d a t e d  b e s t  p r a c t i c e s  i n  t h e  a r e a s  o f physical security, data security, crisis management and business continuity, held annually with the countries of Europe and Africa;\n- -a set of provisions enabling the implementation of the Group Security Policy specifically for personal data, taking into account changes in the European regulatory framework.\n\nOrange  has  thus  developed  a  procedure  to  respond  to  any security-related event or incident involving personal data, a Personal Data Security Guide, a Security Guide for Sensitive Orange Data that  presents  elementary  security  rules  and  actions  to  follow  in order to identify sensitive information and secure it from end to end throughout its life.",

        "page_content": "Several security monitoring centers also regularly monitor deviations from security policies and alerts that may be triggered in the event of suspicious activity. Any such alerts are analyzed, and remediation procedures are monitored depending on the level of criticality.\n\nAside from the security of personal data, Orange strives to master all the requirements set for the responsible use of personal data, in a consistent approach.\n\nThe protection framework applies both in intra-Group relationships and with all of the Group's partners and service providers. It aims to prioritize points of attention with regard to the effectiveness of the rights of individuals and the transparency required (the negotiation of partnerships or services or the creation of customer or service user paths).\n\nThe exercise of rights is monitored regularly.\n\nThe  Group  has  established  a  legal  watch  and  has  expertise  in applying  the  recommendations  of  regulatory  authorities.  These elements form a set of documents available to the entities.\n\nThe Group relies on a large net work of several hundred liaison of fice r s with  multidisciplinary  profiles,  including  Data  Protection  Officers (DPOs) tasked with improving the adoption of a culture of personal data protection in all business lines, including when new entities are integrated into the Group.\n\nThe awareness of all employees is raised through internal training courses on data protection principles. In addition, specific training courses have been developed for data protection officers, project managers, HR and Legal Departments.\n\n## Governance and implementation framework\n\nThe Group's data protection security governance is the responsibility of the Executive Director of the Strategy and Cybersecurity Division. It  is  implemented  by  the  Group  Security  Department  under  his authority.  All  documents  and  processes  constituting  the  security\n\npolicy  are  communicated  by  the  Group  Security  Director  to  the community of security officers  in  the  entities  and  to  the  Group's executive directors. On a daily basis, multidisciplinary committees monitor the projects from an operational standpoint.\n\nThe security policy, like that relating to personal data protection, is presented every year to the Group's Risks Committee and during various internal control reviews. Their application is verified as part of the annual assessment of the entities under the authority of the Group Security Department, and any deviations are addressed in action plans managed locally or monitored at Group level when they cover certain subjects such as identity and access management and the encryption of messaging and workstations. The findings of the annual assessments focus on proposed areas of improvement, and help inform management and the relevant members of the Executive Committee. These assessments are supplemented by penetration tests  to  verify  cyber  resilience.  They  are  the  subject  of  a  report, including an action plan, which is sent to the entity's CEO.\n\nTo ensure the protection of personal data, a specific organization and Group-level governance have been established in the entities. Compliance with the European Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is  ensured  through  a  risk-based  approach,  as  promoted  by  that regulatory framework. It is based on the positions of Data Protection Officers (DPOs) or liaison officers. Alongside the Group's security policy, it contributes to creating the conditions for mitigating the risk on personal data processed by Orange through various components: organization, governance, documentation, awareness-raising and training, and checks.\n\nA network of Data Protection Officers and liaison officers has been formed  within  the  entities  to  provide  guidance  on  the  significant changes in European regulations, which affect many of the Group's entities in Europe and, in some cases, entities outside the European Union. This also makes it possible to monitor the status of regulations in the countries where Orange operates.\n\n## 2.2.4.1.2 Breaches of ethics rules (fraud, corruption, tax evasion, breaches of business ethics)\n\n## Risk of breaches of ethics rules\n\nO r a n g e  a p p l i e s  a  c o m p r e h e n s i v e  a p p r o a c h  t o  m a n a g e  r i s k s  o f  u n e t h i c a l behavior (fraud, corruption and influence peddling, tax evasion and\n\nviolations of business ethics), aimed at continuous improvement and built around six steps: Management commitment, Governance, Risk analysis, Policies and procedures, Awareness-raising and training, and Controls.\n\n| Step                                 | Description                                                                                          |\n|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| #1 Setting the tone                  | The tone set by Senior Executives and managers at all levels in the Group                            |\n| #2 Governance                        | The organization and resources to implement risk measurement actions                                 |\n| #3 Risk analysis                     | Risk analysis to define a proportionate approach                                                     |\n| #4 Policies and procedures           | Policies and procedures to ensure their local implementation through appropriate actions             |\n| #5   Awareness-raising  and training | Awareness-raising for all employees through appropriate communication and targeted training programs |\n| #6 Controls                          | Controls to measure the proper implementation and effectiveness of the program                       |\n\nThe  main  components  of  this  approach,  led  by  the  Group's Chairman and Chief Executive Of ficer and the entire Group E xecutive Committee, aim to identify and analyze risks, roll out action plans to limit their effect on operations, make available a set of relevant and effective controls, and inform, train and share best practices.\n\nThis approach stems from Orange's determination to make ethics central  to  its  activities  and  its  relations  with  stakeholders,  going beyond strict adherence to the law on its own.\n\nThe 'tone from the top' promoted  by  Senior  Executives  and managers is unambiguous: already featuring in the Group's Code of Ethics and its Anti-Corruption Policy, this commitment to responsibility and integrity is regularly and publicly reaffirmed.\n\nGovernance established  at  several  levels  of  the  Company  helps control risks of breaches of ethics:\n\n- -at  the  level  of  the  Orange  Board  of  Directors:  the  Group's specialized Board Committees (Audit Committee and GCSER Committee);\n- -at  the  level  of  the  Orange  Executive  Committee:  the  Group Investment  Committee,  in  which  the  Group's  Director  of Compliance participates, and the Risks Committee (including an annual Risks Committee meeting devoted to compliance, attended by the Lead Director);\n- -at the level of the Group's Ethics Committee, whose members are appointed by the Chairman of Orange and are responsible for  handling  ethics  issues  within  the  Group  as  well  as,  since July 2019, the 'management of non-financial performance'.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 2\n\n2",

This department acts under the authority of the Group Chief Compliance Officer, who reports to  the  Orange  General  Secretary.  The  team  is  in  charge  of designing, rolling out, coordinating and controlling Group-wide compliance programs. It is made up of 10 people;\n- -the Compliance network composed of the Chief Compliance Officers (CCOs) and Compliance Officers (COs) in the Group's divisions  and  subsidiaries.  The  CCOs  are  appointed  by  the members of the Executive Committee and have a network of COs reporting to them. They are responsible for coordinating and  supervising  the  rollout  of  compliance  risk  management programs;\n- -the network of Ethics Advisors, appointed by the members of the Executive Committee and the CEOs of the subsidiaries and responsible for driving the transmission of the ethical approach among teams.\n\nNB:  to  perform  their  work,  these  networks  rely  on  the  expertise and resources of the Group Audit, Control and Risk Management Department (DACRG) and the Group Legal Department.\n\nThe  compliance  process  is  monitored  as  part  of  the  Group's internal  control  system  and  by  audits  carried  out  by  the  Group Audit Department (IFACI certified). It is also reviewed by the Statutory Auditors as part of their audits of the control environment and the certification of the financial statements.\n\n## Orange's external commitments\n\nOrange participates in various collective, sector-based or thematic initiatives dedicated to the development and sharing of best integrity practices,  including  the  MEDEF  International  Ethics  Committee, Transparency  International's  Business  Integrity  Forum  and  the Cercle \u00c9thique des Affaires (Business Ethics Circle). Orange's Chief Compliance  Officer  is  involved  in  the  Panth\u00e9on-Assas  University Compliance Officer/Head of Compliance training cycle.\n\n## Orange's ethics and compliance approach\n\nThe Group's ethics approach is enshrined in the Code of Ethics and is based on the four strong commitments of respect, integrity, quality and team spirit. The Code of Ethics describes the principles of action with respect to stakeholders and the principles of individual behavior that  must  guide  the  conduct  of  employees  in  their  professional activities. These principles of action and behavior reflect the same fundamental principles set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and by bodies such as the International Labor Organization (ILO) and the OECD, as well as the commitments upheld by Orange in terms of social responsibility.\n\nThis ethics policy is implemented by the network of Ethics Advisors. It consists of the following:\n\n- -an analysis of the risks of a breach of ethics;\n- -a breakdown of the various components of the Group Code of Ethics, such as the supplier code of conduct;\n- -a Group whistleblowing mechanism with additional local systems;\n- -principles for preventing and managing conflicts of interest;\n- -programs  for  ethics  training  and  raising  awareness  through videos and e-learning;\n- -an annual Ethics and Compliance Day.\n\nThe anti-corruption compliance policy is implemented by the CCOs and the  COs.  It  is  based  on  the  principle  of  zero  tolerance  with respect to corruption and influence peddling, formalized in a letter of commitment signed by the members of the Executive Committee. It includes:\n\n- -analyses of corruption risks as applied to the Group, subsidiaries and  relevant  entities  in  order  to  identify  the  major  risks  and target controls to be put in place according to the Group Risk Management methodology, using a 'risk cluster' approach;\n- -the Group anti-corruption policy (updated in November 2017) with local applications where necessary, as well as its Guiding Principles updated in October 2018;\n- -G r o u p procedures adapted to local situations:\n- -a risk-based fraud and compliance due diligence procedure applied to B2B customers, partners and intermediaries,\n- -a 'Compliance Clause' included in contracts and purchase orders, updated in 2018,\n- -a  'Gifts  and  Invitations'  policy  governing  any  benefits received  or  offered;  dedicated  applications  are  gradually being rolled out in order to trace managerial declarations and validations of possible overruns of established limits;\n- -the whistleblowing mechanism (described above as it relates to the ethics policy) dedicated to gathering reports of violations or fraud in the areas of accounting, internal control and auditing, in  terms  of  corruption  and  influence  peddling  or  conduct  or s i t u a t i o n s  t h a t  c o u l d  c o n s t i t u t e  a  s e r i o u s  v i o l a t i o n  o f  h u m a n  r i g h t s and fundamental freedoms, or affecting the health and safety of people or the environment;\n- -principles for preventing and managing conflicts of interest;\n- -training and awareness-raising tools for corruption prevention: e-learning  and  teaching  materials  for  face-to-face  training sessions are made available to Compliance Officers and Ethics Advisors so that they can organize training and awareness-raising programs  reflecting  the  needs  of  the  entities  and  the  risks identified as closely as possible.\n\n## Compliance with economic sanction programs\n\nBeing an international group implies remaining vigilant in the face of a changing environment and the existence of numerous and changing programs of economic sanctions and embargoes. In 2013, Orange issued a Group policy on economic sanctions, and published a legal and compliance manual on international economic sanctions in order to secure its business and international development. In particular, the Group carries out compliance assessments (or due diligence) of its relationships with its partners, suppliers and customers.\n\nLastly, an economic sanctions committee analyzes changes in the international regulations to which the Group is subject, adjusts the internal system in place accordingly, and supervises reviews aimed at assessing the Group's exposure to this risk.\n\n## Competition law compliance policy\n\nThe Orange group establishes its pricing policy in accordance with the legal and regulatory obligations in force in the countries where the various Group entities operate. In particular, in geographies where Orange is the dominant operator, it ensures that it does not apply predatory pricing in relation to other operators.\n\nIn France, the Group's Legal and Regulatory Affairs Departments are integrated into the tender construction and marketing processes in order to ensure that bids and prices offered in the retail market (B2C or B2B) comply with competition rules.\n\nIn other geographies, Group teams regularly communicate on the rules and processes to be implemented, and support local teams to ensure the same level of compliance. They also provide support to local teams when they require an additional level of reassurance with respect to current or future business practices.",

Orange  pays  taxes  and  duties  in  the countries in which it operates in accordance with the laws of each of those countries. Orange publishes information relating to taxes and operating fees in Note 10 Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, including information on the breakdown of ta xes payable by geography or by tax consolidation group over three fiscal years (see  Section  3.3.1),  and  in  its  annual  Tax  Transparency  report, available on the website at gallery.orange.com.\n\nT h e  G r o u p ' s  a p p r o a c h  t o  t a x  i s  b a s e d  o n  t h r e e  f u n d a m e n t a l  p r i n c i p l e s :\n\n- -comply with the laws of each country;\n- -comply with the OECD principles: Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations;\n- -regularly  assess  practices  and  compare  them  with  existing solutions in the market to ensure their relevance.\n\nOrange in no way seeks to avoid paying taxes and duties, including through  complex  and  opaque  structures.  Orange  publishes  the list  of  countries  in  which  the  Group  has  interests  in  its  Universal Registration Document.\n\nThe Group Tax Director, who reports directly to the Delegate Chief Executive  Officer,  Executive  Director  Finance,  Performance  and Development, has a dedicated team. The Group has drawn up a Code of  Tax  Ethics  that  applies  to  all  Group  tax  specialists  and concerns  all  tax  operations.  The  Code  states  that  'the  Orange group's tax specialists may propose the tax options most favorable to t h e  O r a n g e  g r o u p ,  k n o w i n g  t h a t  t h e i r  p r o p o s a l s  m u s t  b e  m a d e  b a s e d on an analysis that is professional, honest, objective and lawful'.\n\nEach year, the ta x process is subject to a review under the SarbanesOxley Act (see Section 2.2.3.2 Summary of internal control work implemented pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act). This control process covers Orange SA and its main subsidiaries. The work conducted by Orange and the independent assessment of the Statutory Auditors both resulted in satisfactory conclusions for the 2020 fiscal year.\n\nThanks to its tax policy described above, Orange has not identified any  risk  of  tax  evasion  as  liable  to  create  risks  for  the  Group's operations or reputation.\n\n## Lobbying transparency policy\n\nOrange acts transparently in its lobbying activities and is registered with the French High Authority (HATVP (1) ),  in  compliance with the provisions of Article 25 of Law No. 2016-1691 of December 9, 2016 on transparency, the fight against corruption, and the modernization of economic life (known as Sapin II) governing its relationships with nati o n a l  p u b l i c  d e c i s i o n - m a k e r s .  O r a n g e  i s  a l s o  l i s t e d  i n  t h e  E u r o p e a n Union Transparency Register (2) .\n\nPeople performing interest representation activities for the Group are clearly identified and comply with the Group's Code of Ethics, which is supplemented by principles issued by the Group for interest representatives. They accordingly act in compliance with the Code of  Conduct for Interest Representatives before European bodies, and in particular:\n\n- -in full transparency, by declaring their identity and the interests defended;\n- -in compliance with business ethics by refraining from taking any steps to obtain information or decisions by fraudulent means;\n- -by  guaranteeing  the  quality  and  reliability  of  the  information provided to public authorities, without political exclusivity; and\n- -by responding to any request for information.\n\n## 2.2.4.1.3 Breaches of human rights and fundamental freedoms\n\nAny potential or actual breaches of human rights and fundamental freedoms that Orange may have caused are taken into account in Orange's 2020 Vigilance Plan.\n\nOrange aims to conduct a policy to combat breaches of human rights  and  fundamental  freedoms  in  an  approach  based  on  the following scope:\n\n- -internally, towards its employees, through its human resources policy based on structured social dialogue at local, regional and global levels, and in particular the agreement on Quality of Life at Work - see Section 2.2.4.2;\n- -towards the people employed by its supply chain, in compliance with its Code of Conduct - see Section 2.2.4.5;\n- -t o w a r d s  c i v i l  s o c i e t y,  m a i n l y  t h r o u g h  i t s  e n g a g e m e n t  w i t h  t h e  G N I to ensure digital privacy and freedom of expression (see below).\n\n## Orange's commitments to the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms\n\nOrange's policy of respect and promotion of human rights is illustrated by various commitments:\n\n- -Orange was one of the first companies to sign the United Nations Global Compact in 2000. Respect for the fundamental principles set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labor Organization explicitly features in the Group's Code of Eth i c s .

This multi-criteria analysis notably includes corruption risks, breaches of democracy and freedom of expression, the degree of digital inclusion, human security and discrimination. New criteria in respect of government stability and civil security during elections were added in 2020, in response to the increase in violations of freedom of expression and even human security in recent years.\n\nThis analysis, which forms the basis for assessing risk by geography and for targeting the actions to be taken by the Group, is shared with the entities as part of the Vigilance Plan, and gives rise to discussions with the managers of the regions covering the countries most at risk. It sets out the governance and processes implemented by the Group, as well as the GNI principles to which the Group adheres in conducting its business (see below). In particular, the Group has set up a specific business continuity plan for pre-election periods in high-risk countries, including personnel safety and security, critical infrastructure protection, and continuity of service to customers.\n\n## Member of the GNI for the promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms\n\nOrange is strongly committed to promoting freedom of expression and respect for privacy in the ICT sector, in particular within the Global Network Initiative (GNI), a multi-stakeholder platform including Internet  operators,  NGOs,  academics  and  socially  responsible investors.  Orange  and  its  peers  meet  regularly  in  this  body  to exchange best practices in response to government demands in the  telecommunication  sector.  More  specifically,  they  deal  with potential conflicts between the commitment and duty of sovereign governments and the responsibility of telecommunication companies with respect to human rights (network interruptions, illegal Internet content,  etc.).  By  pooling  the  resources  of  every  operator,  it  can perform a complete analysis of the legal and regulatory framework country by country and establish dialogue with governments and international institutions (United Nations, European Commission, the Council of Europe). It is aimed at making recommendations on local policies or laws in the interest of respecting freedom of expression and privacy throughout the world.\n\nThe GNI Principles, updated in 2017, provide a common Group-wide framework for the development of policies and processes related to freedom of expression and privacy in the ICT sector. This framework applies wherever Orange has operational control, and to the extent possible with its business partners, suppliers and distributors. In this respect, Orange ensures that:\n\n- -the  members  of  the  Ethics  Committee  and  the  personnel responsible  for  the  major  decisions  affecting  freedom  of expression and privacy are fully aware of these Principles and the most efficient means to ensure their implementation;\n- -in  circumstances  where  freedom  of  expression  and  privacy may  be  either  compromised  or  promoted,  decisions  taken incorporate these Principles;\n- -the implementation of these Principles ensures the safety and freedom of the company's employees.\n\nOrange reports annually on how the Group applies these principles (see gallery.orange.com).\n\nAny  demands  by  governments  that  could  violate  freedom  of expression or fundamental freedoms are treated locally by Orange, but under the authority of the Group's General Secretary and the Group  Corporate  Social  Responsibility  Department  in  order  to ensure that every demand respects the formal legal or regulatory requirements as analyzed by the GNI. Thus, Orange ensures that an official request in writing has been received by the manager of the relevant entities, and that it is reported internally to the Group. The summary of these elements, as well as the guidelines issued by the Group CSR Committee, are presented to the Ethics Committee.\n\nLike  other  GNI  member  companies,  Orange  is  independently assessed on its progress in implementing the GNI Principles. The purpose of the assessment is to enable the GNI Board of Directors to determine whether each member company is making good faith efforts  to  implement  its  principles  in  a  continuous  improvement process. The independent assessment, which includes both a review of  the  company's  processes  (systems,  policies  and  procedures) and a review of specific case studies, concluded in 2019 that the i mplementation of the GNI Principles is indeed a priorit y for the Group, that  the  principles  are  integrated  into  Orange's  policies,  and  that Orange is making good faith efforts to implement the GNI Principles in a process of continuous improvement. The next assessment will take place in 2022.\n\nBased on its participation in the EDH (Entreprises pour les Droits de l'Homme),  a  body  bringing  together  20  of  France's  largest corporations, Orange has rolled out e-learning modules available in  more  than  90%  of  the  Group's  countries  to  promote  its  main principles among its employees. Within this forum, Orange shares best practices on the implementation of the Vigilance Plan, including the protection of fundamental freedoms.\n\n## Respect for human rights in conflict zones\n\nOrange  recognizes  the  legitimacy  of  concerns  about  sourcing materials from regions plagued by political and social conflict, and is committed to using a socially responsible supply chain. However, the supply chain for these minerals is long and complex, involving many  players.  Orange  does  not  purchase  minerals  directly,  and ensures that its suppliers have performed due diligence to avoid using minerals that may directly or indirectly finance armed groups. As such, Orange requires its suppliers by contract to ensure that they themselves do not use minerals from these areas. This obligation is explicitly included in its Code of Conduct, which is appended to all purchasing contracts, and in the CSR Clause included in such contracts with the suppliers' signature to 'Orange's Responsible Purchasing Commitments'.\n\nOrange also ensures that this contract clause is correctly followed by its suppliers. Supplier evaluations by EcoVadis take into account the issue of non-use of conflict minerals. The same applies to the audits carried out by the JAC, especially those carried out on site, which have a checkpoint on the procedure to ensure the traceability of minerals. Non-compliance on that point results in corrective actions and their follow-up.\n\n## 2.2.4.2 Employment-related  consequences of our activities\n\nThe  framework  for  controlling  non-financial  risks  linked  to  the employment-related consequences of the activities concerns:\n\n- -the difficulty for Orange to obtain and retain the skills needed for its activities;",

An ambitious plan for upskilling and professional retraining  will  be  implemented  over  the  next  five  years  to  enable Orange employees to adopt these new technologies.\n\n## Employment and skills development\n\nThe Orange group's employment/skills policy is based on Strategic Workforce Planning (SWP), the HR version of the Group's strategic plan, together with Employment & Skills Planning (ESP), which are conducted periodically by geographies, based on varying timeframes and degrees of granularity. The identification of skills is based on two standards common to the entire Group:\n\n- -the jobs framework, which has been implemented in the Group's management tools since early 2020;\n- -the  skills  framework,  which  is  being  structured:  strategic areas of expertise have already been identified. They include key  skills  (listening  and  acting,  communicating  with  impact, working  together,  entrepreneurial  spirit,  using  and  securing data,  SoftAware)  and  key  expertise  (data  AI,  cybersecurity, development,  virtualization,  Cloud,  etc.).  On  that  basis,  the strategic  plan  provides  for  the  number  of  experts  to  double by  2025.  A  more  finely  tuned  dimension  of  this  framework, necessary to manage the skills of each employee, is currently being structured.\n\nOrange's skills development and professional retraining program is open to all employees throughout their working lives. It is based on three main priorities:\n\n- -adapt  the  skills  framework  required  to  guarantee  excellence in customer relations and strengthen technological expertise;\n- -develop the use and application of data, artificial intelligence and cybersecurity in all occupations;\n- -offer  everyone  the  opportunity  to  develop  their  human and  cross-functional  skills,  with  the  inclusion  of  social  and environmental issues.\n\nIn France, three levers for the acquisition of new skills are favored:\n\n- -internal mobility, the priority nature of which was reaffirmed by the creation of a mobility/fluidity program in September 2020. This program aims to simplify the process, open up possibilities and boost fluidity within the Group in France by empowering employees in their mobility;\n- -skills  development,  which  is  based  on  identifying  all  of  the employee's professional experiences, beyond training alone;\n- -external recruitment to bring in additional resources in the key areas of expertise identified by the Group. The intergenerational agreement (2019-2021), which constitutes the basis for social di a l o g u e  i n  F r a n c e ,  i n c l u d e s  c o m m i t m e n t s  o n  a  m i n i m u m  n u m b e r of  n e w  h i r e s ,  a  m i n i m u m  p r o p o r t i o n  o f  n e w  h i r e s  f r o m  p r o f e s s i o n a l integration, and the number of people on work-study programs and internships accepted annually within the Group in France.\n\nIn certain activities with less value added for the Group, particularly in the areas of fiber network construction, copper network maintenance and Orange customer services, outsourcing is used in addition to those methods.\n\n## Compensation\n\nCompensation policy is a fundamental component of management, designed to meet the Orange group's strategic objectives, and is consistent with other HR policies (recruitment, career development, training  and  working  conditions).  It  aims  to  acknowledge  the acquisition  of  new  skills  useful  to  the  Group's  ambitions.  In  this respect, in France, the Group relies on a skills and qualifications recognition agreement signed in 2017.\n\nIt is conducted with respect for diversity and professional equality, notably  through  commitments  to  equal  pay  between  men  and women,  as  per  the  global  agreement  on  gender  equality  in  the workplace within the Orange group.\n\nEach  entity's  compensation  policy  takes  into  account  the  local situation, the need to attract and retain talent, and its cost, which must be affordable for the entity.\n\n## 2.2.4.2.2 Occupational health and safety\n\nPotential or actual health and safety violations that Orange may have caused were addressed in the 2020 Vigilance Plan.\n\n## Group occupational health and safety policy\n\nOrange's commitment to occupational health and safety is led by its Chairman and CEO, and is regularly reaffirmed, as it was in the third policy letter on health, safety and quality of life at work dated January  21,  2017.  The  policy  is  based  on  the  global  health  and safety agreement signed in November 2014, the French law with extraterritorial application of March 27, 2017 on the Duty of Vigilance (see Section 4.6 Duty of Vigilance) and the laws and regulations in force in each country.\n\n## The Orange group's global health and safety agreement\n\nSigned in November 2014, the global health and safety agreement lays down a common foundation for the Group in terms of health, safety and quality of life at work and health protection in general.\n\nBased on a participatory approach involving all stakeholders, including social dialogue in the field of occupational health and safety, it also requires particular vigilance with regard to the occupational health and safety policy specific to Orange's partners and subcontractors, which preceded the law on the duty of vigilance and ISO 45001 by several years.\n\nIt  requires  the  introduction  of  an  occupational  health  and  safety management  system  (OHSMS)  complying  with  an  international standard within each Group entity. The choice of standard on which t h e  O H S M S  i s  b a s e d  i s  l e f t  t o  e a c h  e n t i t y :  i t  m a y  b e  t h e  G r o u p  O H S M S standard, itself based on the OHSAS 18001 standard or the new international standard ISO 45001.\n\nThe Group Occupational Quality of Life Department supports its rollout  through  pairs  of  occupational  health  and  safety  officers and operational managers. Their role is to diagnose any shortfall between what the Group expects and what is actually achieved, and to implement corrective action plans. Since 2015, the Group Occupational Quality of Life Department and, in France, the Shared Occupational Safety Area, have been organizing audits every two years, or every three years for ISO 45001-certified audits.\n\nThe  agreement  promotes  any  initiatives  to  participate  in  health protection  programs adapted to the local context and practices. In  particular,  it  ensures  non-discrimination  in  terms  of  health  for employees, with a particular focus on population groups that are vulnerable due to their state of health.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 2\n\n2",

The financing of the construction and maintenance of Orange Villages by the Orange Foundation (active since 2005), with schools, water sources and mother and child health and protection centers, is also part of the health promotion initiatives called for by the global health and safety agreement.\n\nThe application  of  this  agreement  is  based  on  the  monitoring  of quantitative and qualitative criteria; it is carried out on an ongoing basis by the network of health and safety officers and managers, and gives rise to Group reporting organized annually by the Group Occupational Quality of Life Department and quarterly by the Shared Occupational Safety Area in France. Compliance with its application is subject to internal and external audits.\n\nThe analysis of these indicators and the development of action plans are supported, monitored and promoted by the Group Occupational Quality  of  Life  Department,  and  are  presented  annually  to  the Worldwide Works Council and the UNI global union, among other bodies.  Among  other  aspects,  these  indicators  cover  accidents (workplace and commuting accidents), sick leave, the existence of a health and safety policy letter specific to the entity, the establishment of a n  O H S M S  ( a n d  r e l a t e d  t r a i n i n g  i n i t i a t i v e s  t o g e t h e r  w i t h  a u d i t  d a t e s ) and public health campaigns aimed at the Orange population and/ or the general population. It should be noted that accident data are monitored not only within the Group, but also among subcontractors.\n\n## Social dialogue on occupational health and safety\n\nSocial  dialogue  on  occupational  health  and  safety  takes  place within the legal or employee representative bodies, in the form of agreements signed with the social partners.\n\nIn France, a number of agreements promote the implementation of the Group's quality of life at work policy and the active prevention of risks to employee health and safety:\n\n- -the  telework  agreement,  amended  in  2017,  makes  telework part of an overall financial, employee-related and environmental approach, with expected benefits in terms of well-being at work and savings in travel time;\n- -the agreement on the assessment and adaptation of workloads (2016)  sets  out  a  methodological  framework  and  common benchmarks providing a practical understanding of workload issues in relation to changes in the workforce and skills;\n- -the  digital  transformation  support  agreement  (2016)  notably enables the implementation of individual digital use reports;\n- -the agreement on the assessment and prevention of psychosocial risks (2010) notably endorsed the creation of a National Stress Prevention Committee;\n- -the  agreement  on  workplace  gender  equality  and  work-life balance (2018) offers a framework to facilitate the best balance between professional and private life for each employee, whilst enabling them to overcome major life events.\n\nIn France, the Social and Economic Committee (SEC) is responsible for health, safety and working conditions, and is supported by the Commission on Health, Safety and Working Conditions (CHSWC).\n\nInternationally,  each  subsidiary  now  has  a  Health  and  Safety Committee (HSC), and receives ongoing support from the Group Occupational Quality of Life Department.\n\nThe Global Works Council and the European Works Council are also forums for social dialogue on occupational health and safety within the Group.\n\nOr a n g e  i s  a l s o  p r e s e n t  t h r o u g h  t h e  G r o u p  L a b o r  R e l a t i o n s  D e p a r t m e n t and  the  Group  Occupational  Quality  of  Life  Department  in  the Sectoral Social Dialogue Commission of the European Commission's telecommunication  branch.  Occupational  health  and  safety  are central to the work of that body.\n\n## People involved in prevention\n\nIn France, the network of more than 200 prevention officers provides methodological support to the teams and offers advice and local expertise on occupational risk prevention issues.\n\nInternationally,  health  and  safety  managers  play  a  similar  role, and receive support from the Group Occupational Quality of Life Department through regular unilateral contacts or exchanges of best practices, including through the 'Quality of Life at Work by Orange' meetings organized on occupational health and safety topics such as  the  duty  of  care,  harassment  and  violence  in  the  workplace, telework, health crisis management, and international business travel and assignments.\n\nThe  organization  of  occupational  health  services  depends  on the  legislation  in  each  country.  They  are  either  inter-company  or stand-alone units, as is the case in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Egypt, Senegal, Mali and Orange France.\n\nWithin the Group Safety Department, the Group also benefits from an occupational health and safety team comprising an international safety director and an international medical consultant, who work in cooperation with the Group's major divisions and provide them with support through shared constant health and safety monitoring on a specific site, expert field visits at the request of the entities, and assistance to entities and employees on international business trips or expatriates in the event of a health and/or safety crisis.\n\nIn  addition,  as  part  of  its  prevention  policy,  the  Group  organizes an annual employee survey known as the 'Employee Barometer,' enabling  everyone  to  express  their  views  on  their  experience  of working at Orange and their understanding of the Group and its transformation. The system was designed to enable each Group entity to better understand the expectations of its employees.\n\n## 2.2.4.2.3 Social  dialogue\n\nThe Orange group promotes a substantial structured social dialogue involving its employees, labor unions and associations of employee representatives.  With  a  view  to  increasing  transparency  and consultation, Orange has set up employee representative bodies for  all  scopes.  Each  of  these  bodies  has  its  own  prerogatives  to strengthen social dialogue.\n\nOrange recognizes the right to freedom of association, representation and membership in a trade union for its employees in accordance with  the  principles  set  out  in  ILO  Convention  No.  87  (1948)  on Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize. Employees are free to become members of their choice of trade union or to choose not to do so.\n\n## Worldwide Works Council\n\nThe Worldwide Works Council is a forum for social dialogue created by an agreement signed in June 2010. It enables all Group employees worldwide  to  be  represented,  and  to  exchange  information  with employee representatives on transnational economic, financial and employee-related issues.\n\nIts tasks are as follows:\n\n- -promote  the  communication  of  Group  issues  to  employee representatives;\n- -improve the Group's social dialogue at the global level;\n- -be part of the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) development strategy.\n\nThe Council does not replace existing national representation bodies or  the  European  Works  Council.  It  complements  the  agreement signed in 2006 with the UNI global union on respect for fundamental rights.  It  meets  at  least  once  a  year  at  the  initiative  of  its  Chair, who is  the  Group's  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  or  his representative, and whenever exceptional circumstances so require, with the agreement of management.",

The aim is to make the company an ever more inclusive place, giving everyone the opportunity to grow and contribute to creating value for the community.\n\nThe  Group's  Diversity  and  Inclusion  policy  was  reformulated  in March 2021.\n\nGender equality is the first pillar of the Group's Diversity and Inclusion policy. It is a commitment shared by all Orange entities worldwide. The second pillar is equal opportunity and the fight against discrimination. Within  this  framework,  each  country  is  responsible  for  choosing at  least  one  other  dimension  of  diversity,  in  addition  to  gender equality, corresponding to its economic, employee-related and social challenges,  from  among  the  following  five  dimensions:  disability, origin,  age,  identity  and  opinions.  Lastly,  in  view  of  its  corporate purpose and its strategic plan, the Group adopted digital equality as the third pillar of its Diversity and Inclusion policy in 2020.\n\nThe policy i s b a s e d  i n  p a r t  o n  t h e  g l o b a l  a g r e e m e n t  o n  g e n d e r  e q u a l i t y in the workplace, the fight against discrimination and violence, and work-life balance of July 2019, and on the French scope of the fifth agreement on gender equality in the workplace and work-life balance of January 2018.\n\n## Gender equality in the workplace\n\nThe  Group  has  been  a  signatory  of  the  United  Nations'  Women Empowerment Principles since March 2015.\n\nOrange's  gender  equality  policy  is  steered  by  the  Professional Equality  Strategy  Committee,  created  in  2011  and  composed  of members of the Executive Committee, as well as representatives of Group entities. It is based on the global agreement on gender equality, the fight against discrimination and violence, and work-life balance, signed with UNI global union. This agreement, which can be applied and adapted in the countries where the Orange group operates, is based on a participatory approach by all stakeholders and is built through structured social dialogue. It is implemented through local committees and a network of dedicated liaison officers in the main subsidiaries and entities. It is monitored jointly by the Group  and  UNI  global  union.  The  professional  equality  policy  is based on five pillars:\n\n- -gender balance in all of the Group's occupations, particularly in the technical and digital professions;\n- -access  for  women  to  management  positions:  the  Group has  set  a  target  of  35%  (which  changes  annually)  of  senior management positions being held by women by 2025, in line with the percentage of women in its workforce; this policy is supplemented by a special focus on the percentage of women on the Boards of Directors of Group subsidiaries and on the specialized committees reporting to the Executive Committee;\n- -equal pay for women and men, based on a methodology for analyzing pay gaps, common to all countries;\n- -work-life balance;\n- -the fight against violence.\n\n## Equal opportunity and combating discrimination\n\nEqual opportunity and combating discrimination are included are the global agreement on gender equality signed with UNI global union in July 2019. In that agreement, Orange reaffirms the need for fair treatment of candidates during the hiring process, based on the skills and experience required for the position. Similarly, Orange commits in this agreement to ensuring that access to training, career development and work organization is based on objective criteria.\n\nFor years, the equal opportunities policy has been a key factor in promoting diversity and inclusion in the Group. It focuses on five areas:\n\n- -disability:  Orange  has  been  a  signatory  of  the  International Labor Organization (ILO) 'Enterprise and Disabilit y' char ter since 2015, and participates in global movements (The Valuable 500, ILO GBDN). The Group has adopted the GSMA principles to make digital technology a lever for the inclusion of people with disabilities. In France, in 2020 Orange continued to implement the  commitments  laid  down  in  the  sixth  agreement  for  the employment and integration of people with disabilities, dated June 2017. On February 4, 2021, Orange signed the seventh agreement for the employment and integration of people with disabilities  and  the  fight  against  discrimination.  It  covers  the period from 2021 to 2023;\n- -origins:  Orange  is  a  signatory  of  the  Charter  of  Mobilization for  the  Defense  of  Equality  against  Racism,  and  is  attentive to  the  risks  of  discrimination  related  to  origins  (ethnic,  social, cul t u r a l ,  g e o g r a p h i c ,  e t c . ) .

It covers the Group's companies in France and takes three areas into account: the sustainable integration of young people into employment, the employment of seniors and  the  transmission  of  knowledge  and  skills.  The  Group  is also committed to the inclusion of young people from working class  backgrounds,  and  supports  associations  working  for equal opportunity, notably through the commitment of Orange employee volunteers;\n- -i dentit y: O r a n g e  i s  a  s i g n a t o r y  t o  t h e  L G B T+  C o m m i t m e n t  C h a r t e r and the UN Standards of Conduct for Tackling Discrimination against LGBTI people;\n- -personal opinions: Orange has developed a Neutrality Charter.\n\n## Digital equality\n\nOrange  has  translated  its  commitment  to  digital  equality  into the  International  Charter  for  Inclusive  Artificial  Intelligence  (see Section 2.2.2.3.3 Policy on the use of artificial intelligence).\n\nIn France, Orange has set itself the objective of recruiting at least 30% women among people attending  digital  training  programs (cybersecurity, data, Cloud, customer service) at its new apprentice training center.\n\n## 2.2.4.3 Social  consequences of our activities\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe  framework  for  controlling  non-financial  risks  linked  to  the social consequences of the activities relate to the risks identified in Section 2.1 Risk factors:\n\n- -the possible harmful effects on health of uncontrolled exposure to electromagnetic fields from near and far telecommunication equipment;\n- -the  excessive  or  inappropriate  use  of  telecommunication services and equipment.\n\nThey also cover the more comprehensive notion of responsibility in terms of use of products and services. The Group's commitment is backed by the Meaningful Marketing program and the Group's guidelines in its relationship with artificial intelligence.\n\n## 2.2.4.3.1 Policy on excessive and inappropriate uses\n\nTo  combat  inappropriate  uses,  Orange  supports  and  guides stakeholders  towards  peaceful,  responsible  and  creative  digital practices, and is setting up tools and information/training to deal with inappropriate uses of technologies. In mid-June 2018, the World Health Organization recognized video game addiction and added it to the eleventh edition of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD11). Digital gambling disorder is considered to be a pattern of gaming behavior characterized by impaired control over gaming, increasing priority given to gaming over other activities to the extent t h a t  g a m i n g  t a k e s  p r e c e d e n c e  o v e r  o t h e r  i n t e r e s t s  a n d  d a i l y  a c t i v i t i e s , and  continuation  of  gaming  despite  the  occurrence  of  negative consequences. For that reason, Orange carefully follows the advice of the experts and authorities on the subject of digital technology and health, and promotes their recommendations, particularly those intended for parents, young people and educators in general.\n\nFor children and young people, Orange's commitment is supported by the Better Internet for Kids (BIK) program, which aims to empower parents and educators to provide children with the best of the digital world.\n\nThus, Orange's policy is to suppor t digital use s a n d p r a c ti c e s a d a pte d to the age and maturity of children and their needs by:\n\n- -fostering the creativity, entrepreneurial spirit and education of young people;\n- -raising  its  employees'  awareness  of  the  issues  involved  in meaningful  marketing  by  laying  down  guidelines  for  product managers,  and  by  supporting  them  in  carrying  out  projects (recommendations on virtual reality and augmented reality, for example);\n- -offering services that meet the needs of families only for children aged nine and over, without promoting uses for younger children;\n- -offering  awareness-raising initiatives,  workshops  and  training to support parents, educators and children in the safe uses of digital technology, in cooperation with experts and associations for children and parents;\n- -implementing parental control tools or partnerships to offer digital coaching services;\n- -negotiating partnerships to help promote this policy.\n\nThis policy and its monitoring are carried out by the country CSR and Marketing teams in coordination with the Radio Waves and Health Committee and internal Orange experts working on child protection (see Section 2.2.4.3.2 Radio wave policy).\n\n## 2.2.4.3.2 Radio wave policy\n\nMobile  telephony  technologies  are  called  on  to  respond  to  the increasing  uses  made  by  users,  and  may  therefore  increase  the exposure to electromagnetic waves of the general population (via new fixed transmitters) or of users (via new mobile equipment or by creating new behaviors). To best meet this demand, Orange has implemented a Group policy on radio waves and health since 2007, in which it undertakes to:\n\n- -apply the limits defined by the ICNIRP (International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection) and recommended by the WHO for mobiles and antennas, including in countries within the Orange scope that do not have national regulations;\n- -provide  transparent  and  identical  information  to  all  of  its stakeholders;\n- -publicize the recommendations for the use of mobile devices issued by health authorities to limit exposure to radio waves;\n- -contribute to scientific research and standardization efforts to take these aspects into account as early as possible in product design;\n- -raise  awareness  of  employees  working  near  or  on  antennas about  the  safety  instructions  provided  in  European  Directive 2013/35/EU  of  June  26,  2013  and  in  France  its  Decree  No. 2016-1074 of August 3, 2016, even in countries not subject to the directive.\n\nCompliance with this policy and these commitments is ensured at Group level by the Radio Waves and Health Committee, comprising a lawyer, a public affairs expert, a doctor, a technical expert and two CSR experts, who meet weekly to analyze health and regulatory monitoring, propose initiatives at the Group's operational level and draft 'Group positions' and duty of care notes. These positions are circulated throughout the Group, and even to the Group Executive Committee as necessary.\n\n## 2.2.4.3.3 Policy on the use of artificial intelligence\n\nIn its Engage 2025 strategic plan, Orange has identified the levers of artificial intelligence (automatic learning, deep learning, etc.) as a performance tool, amplifying the digital transformation. Orange supports  the  approach  described  in  the  'Ethics  guidelines  for trustworthy AI' put forward by European Commission's High-Level Expert Group on AI and draws on its main principles:",

An  audit  carried  out  by  Bureau  Veritas  assessed  Orange  within the GEEIS-AI framework for its actions in the design, development and use of inclusive artificial intelligence. The receipt of this label in December 2020 illustrates Orange's commitment to digital equality and  follows  on  from  the  signing  of  the  International  Charter  for Inclusive AI, launched jointly by the Arborus Endowment Fund and Orange on April 21, 2020 and signed by some 50 organizations and companies, including Orange. It certifies that Orange uses AI from design to operation in a manner that promotes diversity by ensuring that the entire data value chain is responsible and that discriminatory biases are identified and controlled.\n\n## 2.2.4.4 Environmental impacts of our activities\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOrange adopts a proactive approach to risk and impact management to help preserve the environment against a backdrop of strong growth in digital usage. Potential or actual damage to the environment that Orange may have caused was addressed in its 2020 Vigilance Plan.\n\n## 2.2.4.4.1 Orange's environmental commitment\n\nOrange has been working to reduce its environmental footprint for more than 15 years.\n\nOrange  confirmed  its  commitment  to  the  climate  at  the  United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York in September 2019, by signing alongside other major corporations the UN Global Compact commitment for an average global warming trajectory of 1.5 \u00b0C by 2100 compared with pre-industrial levels.\n\nAs part of its Engage 2025 strategic plan announced in December 2019, Orange had undertaken to be Net Zero Carbon by 2040, 10 years ahead of the GSMA target and the IPCC recommendations for a 1.5  \u00b0C  trajectory (1) (aimed  at  limiting  the  average  warming  of  the\n\nplanet to 1.5 \u00b0C by 2100 compared with pre-industrial levels). Orange has thus set itself a new ambition with an environmental objective of reducing emissions in absolute terms and no longer relative to its customers' uses (the goal of its previous strategic plan has been achieved).\n\nBeing Net Zero Carbon in 2040 means:\n\n- -as  a  priority,  to  have  reduced  its  greenhouse  gas  emissions (Scopes 1, 2 and 3) as much as possible by 2040, both for its operations and those of its stakeholders (suppliers, employees, customers);\n- -to contribute to carbon sequestration in an amount equivalent in carbon to the residual emissions in 2040 (Scopes 1 and 2, and Scope 3 partially, i.e. those on which the company has a direct effect). This can be done through capital investments (e.g. forest planting) or financing of negative emissions (certified or verified) from projects that sequester carbon naturally (e.g. in forests, mangroves or agroforestry) or technologically;\n- -in addition, to contribute to emissions avoided outside its scope, for example by marketing products and services with a better carbon score than existing products or services - or by financing certified or verified emissions avoidance.\n\nNB: The target of Net Zero Carbon by 2040 is taken in the context of the special report by the IPCC (2) published in October 2018, which encourages decision-makers to do their best to limit average global warming to 1.5 \u00baC compared with pre-industrial levels by 2100, in the aim of avoiding the risk of serious climate disruptions. Meeting the 1.5 \u00b0C target by 2100 means Net Zero Carbon worldwide no later than 2050.\n\nThe  Net  Zero  Initiative (3) ,  in  which  the  Orange  group  is  taking part, formalized a standard for Net Zero Carbon for businesses in February 2019.\n\nOrange  sees  environmental  exemplarity  as  one  of  the  two cornerstones  of  its  corporate  responsibility.  This  commitment  is reflected in the intermediate objective of achieving a 30% reduction i n Scope 1 and 2 CO2 emissions at Group level by 2025, in absolute terms compared with the 2015 level, i.e. to generate a maximum of 1 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent in 2025.\n\nThis  interim  target  has  been  validated  by  international  reference SBTi as being in line with a 1.5 \u00b0C trajectory and consistent with the international sector-specific methodology for digital technology, jointly  developed  by  the  International  Telecommunication  Union, GSMA, GeSI and the  SBTi,  in  conjunction  with  the  International Energy Agency.\n\nTo  achieve  these  objectives,  Orange  is  launching  a  vast  energy efficiency plan and intends to derive at least 50% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2025.\n\nThe Group has also carried out an assessment of its Scope 3 impacts in accordance with the 15 categories defined by the GHG Protocol. Its mai n i m p a c t s  a r e  o n  t h e  s u b - c a t e g o r i e s  o f  fi x e d  a s s e t s ,  p u r c h a s e s of goods and services and use of products sold.\n\nIn 2020, the Group entered into a dialogue with the SBTi to define an objective for all of its Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions by 2025. For Scope 3, the target envisaged notably concerns fixed assets and purchases of goods and services, which will enable the Group to f u r t h e r  e n c o u r a g e  i t s  s u p p l i e r s  t o  r e d u c e  t h e i r  o w n  c a r b o n  f o o t p r i n t s .\n\n- 2\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2",

As a priority, Orange is seeking to make real reductions in its Scope 1 and 2 emissions and Scope 3 emissions over which the Group has a direct influence. Orange is acting on the other part of Scope 3 emissions with its main suppliers, via the International Telecommunication Union, the GSMA and the JAC (Joint Alliance for CSR).\n\nFor  Networks  and  IS,  the  Group  plans  to  rely  above  all  on  the implementation  of  advanced  sleep  modes  for  5G  antennas  and the  intensification  of  infrastructure  and  equipment  sharing  (RAN sharing). It also aims to continue pursuing eco-efficiency initiatives in Data centers (optimization of the number of Data centers, fill rate and electricity consumption).\n\nFor buildings, the aim is to reduce consumption by 20% by 2025 compared with 2015 by implementing a '360\u00b0 management' system in all main buildings. The objective is to measure in order to optimize and reduce energy consumption.\n\nOrange plans to reduce and electrify its vehicle fleets by 2025, while maintaining its status as Europe's biggest corporate carsharing fleet.\n\nAs an active member of the ITU, in particular alongside the Science Based  Targets  initiative  (SBTi),  the  GSMA  and  the  International Energy Agency, Orange has made a significant contribution to the production of a methodology document for estimating the impact of the Information and Communication Technology sector on the global climate. It explains the emission reduction paths to be followed by the sector in order to comply with scientific recommendations and confine the rise in temperatures to 1.5 \u00b0C by 2100 compared with the pre-industrial era (1)\n\nOrange has also made the commitment to integrate circular economy principles into its organization and processes in order to limit the impact of its activities and those of its suppliers and customers on resources and raw materials.\n\nThis commitment breaks down into the targets for 2025 listed below:\n\n- -10 0% of t h e  r a n g e  o f  O r a n g e - b r a n d  e q u i p m e n t  ( b o x e s ,  d e c o d e r s , etc.)  committed to an eco-design approach that reduces the carbon footprint during manufacture and distribution, as well as electricity consumption during use;\n- -more  than  90%  of  fixed  terminals  (boxes,  set-top  boxes) distributed by Orange to be collected, plus 30% of the mobile devices by country in Europe and the equivalent in volume of WEEE of 20% of the mobile devices sold in the MEA zone;\n- -at least 10% of total sales volumes of mobile devices in Europe derived from refurbished devices;\n- -attractive  repair  service  available  for  mobile  devices  sold  by Orange in of its host countries in Europe; and\n- -for  its  own  needs,  a  part  of  Orange's  investment  budget  for active network and IS equipment to be devoted to the purchase of  refurbished  equipment,  through  its  internal  'marketplace' or  by  promoting  equipment  catalogs  with  its  suppliers.  The quantification  of  this  ambition,  which  will  contribute  to  the reduction in scope 3 emissions, is in progress. Orange is also committed to taking into account criteria relating to the carbon footprint throughout the life cycle and the circular economy when selecting network and IS equipment.\n\n## 2.2.4.4.2 Environmental monitoring framework\n\nThe Group's Board of Directors oversees the risks and opportunities related to the environment, particularly climate change, through the work of the Executive Committee and in particular the Executive Director CSR, Diversity and Philanthropy and the Senior Executive Vice-President, Technology and Innovations.\n\nThe Group's environmental objectives set out in the Engage 2025 strategic  plan  (see  Section  2.2.4.4.1  Orange's  environmental commitment)  are  applied  in  roadmaps  drawn  up  for  each  entity under the authority  of  the  Executive  Director  CSR,  Diversity  and Philanthropy. and the entity's Chief Executive Officer. They are an integral part of the budgetary processes and the strategic plan (see Section 2.2.3.1 Specific internal control procedures pertaining to the preparation and processing of accounting and financial information) and are monitored by the Group Executive Committee, the Group Audit Committee, the GCSER Committee and the Board of Directors.\n\nThe monitoring of Orange's actions in environmental matters is based on the work of various committees:\n\n## Green ITN Group Steering Committee\n\nThis  committee,  chaired  by  the  Technology  &  Global  Innovation Division (TGI), meets periodically to review the progress of energy consumption management programs for the network and IS, and the development of the use of electricity from renewable sources. It  ensures  that  the  program  is  properly  implemented.  It  includes members from the TGI, Group CSR and Purchasing Departments, and from the contributing entities.\n\n## Circular Economy Group Steering Committee\n\nThe Group has set up a strategic internal Circular Economy Steering Committee to define and monitor the actions to be implemented within its businesses, with the appointment of project leaders and an implementation plan. Placed under the authority of the Group CSR Department, it is made up of decision-makers from the Group's main business lines: Purchasing, Supply Chain, Marketing, Networks and IS, Innovation, etc.\n\nThe plan covers several topics, including:\n\n- -eco-design;\n- -limiting  the  Group's  consumption  of  critical  non-renewable resources;\n- -optimizing waste management;\n- -the  possibility  of  giving  network  equipment  and  consumer devices a second life.\n\nIn particular, it aims to coordinate the Orange Sustainable & Circular Ambition for Recertification (OSCAR) program, which focuses on extending the service life of equipment, and its reuse and recovery within  the  Group.  It  is  based  on  an  action  plan  with  suppliers  to ensure  the  availability  of  refurbished  equipment,  the  planning  of decommissioning for reuse within the Group and the coordination of the internal 'marketplace' for refurbished equipment.\n\n## Carbon sequestration program\n\nWith a v i e w  t o  a c h i e v i n g  N e t  Z e r o  C a r b o n  i n  2 0 4 0 ,  t h e  G r o u p  i s  a l r e a d y developing a carbon sequestration program aimed at sequestering annually  the  equivalent  of  the  residual  emissions  estimated  for 2040.  The  investments  to  be  made  within  this  framework  have been approved by the Group's Investment Committee. That means the program can get started in 2021, thereby taking into account the growth time of the plants required for the physical sequestration of carbon.\n\n## Monitoring Committee for alignment with the TCFD's recommendations\n\nTo fulfill the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) published on June 29, 2017, Orange has decided to establish a special monitoring committee managed by the Group CSR Department with the support of Carbone 4, a",

        "page_content": "consultant. The aim of this committee is to undertake an in-depth analysis of the risks related to climate change and the ecological transition and to identify projects that need to be implemented so as to better fulfill the recommendations of the TCFD.\n\nA cross-reference table describing Orange's responses to the TCFD recommendations is available in Section 4.4.2.3 Alignment with the TCFD's recommendations.\n\n## Players involved in environmental awareness-raising and training\n\nThe Group Environment Department holds regular discussions with a network of national and business area contacts comprising around 90 people; it organizes an annual seminar or webinar to exchange best practices and launch new projects.\n\nInternal communications regularly raise awareness among all Group employees at key events such as the United Nations Climate Change Conference and environment days.\n\nAwareness-raising and discussion initiatives enable each employee to factor the objectives of responsible growth into their day-to-day activities. Dedicated training programs are regularly rolled out, such as the CSR Visa, launched in September 2020, which provides a common knowledge base across the Group on CSR challenges and the commitments and action plans implemented within Orange.\n\nSince 2018 in France, an indicator relating to the management of electrical energy consumption has been introduced in the calculation of the incentive bonus as part of the compensation of Orange SA employees,  thereby  giving  visibility  to  this  issue;  moreover,  the Orange LTIPs for the 2020-2022 and 2021-2023 periods include an environmental criterion.\n\n## Environmental Management System\n\nTo  achieve  the  objectives  of  reducing  environmental  risks  and impacts,  the  Group  is  progressively  rolling  out  environmental management  systems  (EMS)  in  accordance  with  ISO  14001  in its  main  host  countries.  This  internationally  recognized  standard describes how companies should organize themselves to manage the  environmental  impact  of  their  activities.  The  standard's  2015 version includes new requirements, which the Group is gradually integrating, notably through Stakeholder Dialogue and by taking into account complete life cycle impacts.\n\n## 2.2.4.4.3 Environmental compliance risk management\n\n## Facilities classified for environmental protection\n\nThe Orange group uses certain facilities, products and substances that may present environmental risks (even minor), some of which are subject to specific regulations. That is the case for facilities classified for  environmental  protection  (ICPE)  in  France.  The  significant increase  in  the  number  of  sites  with  ICPE  classified  facilities  in 2019 is attributable to a revision of regulations (Section ICPE2910 - Combustion facilities), which lowered the classification threshold.\n\nThese  facilities  are  the  subject  of  ongoing  in-depth  analyses  by the  Orange  group  and  have  led  to  the  adoption  of  preventive and curative maintenance plans in addition to regulatory periodic inspections. The rollout of the Environmental Management System and ISO 14001 certification audits also ensures compliance with regulations and related controls.\n\nTo prevent health-related risks (Legionnaires' disease) and reduce water consumption, a program to replace air cooling towers with dry coolers has been underway in France since 2006, although the ongoing restructuring of technical sites is slowing down the program.\n\n| Indicators                                                                      |   2020 |   2019 |   2018 |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Number of sites including classified facilities (ICPE A, D, DC and E) in France |    330 |    346 |    249 |\n| Number of wet air-cooling towers in France                                      |     26 |     31 |     31 |\n\n## Hazardous substances\n\nSome facilities use regulated products or substances. These include chlorofluorocarbons (commonly known as CFCs) or other refrigerants (more  specifically  HCFCs  or  HFCs)  contained  in  air  conditioning systems - see above.\n\nOrange requires its suppliers to comply with the European REACH regulation (Registration, Evaluation and Authorisation of Chemicals) and implements the necessary means to inform its customers about t h e  p r e s e n c e  o f  h a z a r d o u s  s u b s t a n c e s ,  a s  d e fi n e d  b y  t h e  r e g u l a t i o n .\n\nOrange complies with the European RoHS II directive, which requires the Group to meet specific producers' or distributors' obligations to limit the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment. In its contracts, the Group requires its suppliers to apply the European RoHS II directive to all products subject to it, including outside Europe.\n\n## Provisions for environmental risk\n\nThe Orange group believes that its activities as a telecommunication operator do not pose a serious direct threat to the environment. The Group's activities do not entail production processes with a severe\n\nimpact on scarce or non-renewable resources, natural resources (water, air) or biodiversity and in most cases do not involve any lethal risks. That is why no provision for environmental risk is made in the Group's accounts.\n\nHowever, a provision is recognized to cover the Group's obligation to dismantle installed technical equipment and to restore the technical sites it occupies.\n\nThe provision is set on the basis of:\n\n- -dismantling  costs  (on  a  per-unit  basis  for  telephone  poles, terminals and public phones, and per site for mobile network antennas)  borne  by  the  Group  to  meet  its  environmental obligations;\n- -annual scheduled asset returns and departures from sites.\n\nIn the Group's financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020, the provision totaled 901 million euros, of which 516 million euros for Orange SA. It consists predominantly of the cost of restoring mobile antenna sites to their former state, reprocessing of telephone poles,  managing  electrical  and  electronic  waste,  batteries  and accumulators, and dismantling public phones.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 2\n\n2",

Partnerships may involve funding borne entirely by Orange, either with public entities (business development, external research, hosting PhD students, etc.) or private entities for development services. They may also be based on joint funding or public subsidies, such as in the context of participation in European projects. All partnerships entered into by the Group are subject to an analysis of the contributions of each partner, an allocation of ownership by income and the definition of the operating regime for the results. They give rise to contracts in accordance with the Group's guidelines. Orange applies the business ethics principles defined by the Group for its partnerships. In sector partnerships that leverage other stakeholders, the partnerships are also made under the cover of an antitrust declaration.\n\n## 2.2.4.5.2 Relationships with suppliers and subcontractors\n\n## Orange's responsible purchasing principles\n\nOrange has for several years implemented a responsible purchasing policy that embeds CSR in its supplier relationships and improves management of employee-related, social and environmental risks. It is monitored by a 'Responsible Purchasing Steering Committee' comprising members of the Group CSR, the Legal Department and the Purchasing Department. This committee met once in 2020.\n\nThis  policy  is  implemented  by  the  Global  Procurement  &  Supply Chain Department, which is part of the Orange group Finance & Performance Department and which ensures consistency among all Group companies, each of which has its own purchasing department. Thus, more than 1,500 permanent employees in 50 countries and territories conducted negotiations with 55,000 active suppliers in 2020. A key event for dialogue with suppliers is organized annually during the 'Supplier Forum'.\n\nThe Group-level CSR action plan aims to promote the appropriation of CSR commitments by the various purchasing stakeholders and their application in the relevant business processes, and to ensure the Group's compliance with the law on the duty of Vigilance. All of these principles have also been adopted by BuyIn, the joint venture between Orange and Deutsche Telekom, which covers the Group's main purchasing domains.\n\nThis policy was updated in 2018 (available on gallery.orange.com) and is based on the following guidelines:\n\n- -developing balanced relationships with suppliers, based on trust, respect and sustainable business relationships;\n- -contributing  to  financial  performance  by  creating  value  and ensuring the availability of products and services at the best cost, while preserving competition among Orange's strategic suppliers by establishing an industrial policy that protects the interests of stakeholders;\n- -managing CSR risks and opportunities related to purchasing and the supply chain by requiring Group suppliers to adhere to a code of conduct and comply with laws and regulations;\n- -providing the Group and its customers with the benefit of the know-how of innovative and high-performance suppliers.\n\nIt is based on the systematic incorporation of a CSR clause in the Group's  framework  agreements,  as  well  as  into  exclusively  local\n\ncontracts, reinforced by the integration of the Code of Conduct in the appendices to these contracts. The Code of Conduct describes in  particular  the  ethics,  employee-related  and  environmental commitments expected by the Group. Orange thus requires that its partners, suppliers and their sub-contractors i) comply with all national, European and international rules with respect to ethical and responsible behavior. This includes, without limitation, standards dealing with human rights, occupational health and safety conditions, environmental protection, sustainable development, anti-corruption and child protection; ii) adopt and apply the Group's ethics standards and its commitments and make progress in those areas.\n\nOrange's CSR program is overseen by the Responsible Purchasing Steering Committee; it covers all subsidiaries and is based on five pillars:\n\n- -clear  CSR  commitments  defined  in  Orange's  'Responsible Purchasing  Commitments.'  They  are  also  stated  in  the  CSR Clause of the supplier code of conduct and apply to all suppliers (Group and local);\n- -a strong CSR culture thanks to mandatory CSR training sessions for purchasers;\n- -effective CSR risk management based on CSR evaluations and supplier audits;\n- -the  active  search  for  opportunities  through  dialogue  with subsidiaries and suppliers;\n- -transparent reporting on the CSR maturity of all subsidiaries.\n\nIn  2019,  Orange  France  Purchasing  Department  completed  an ISO 20400 maturity assessment and obtained the compelling level (third level out of four). They have also obtained the Supplier Relations and Responsible Purchasing label issued by the French Ministry of the Economy and Finance, Business Mediation and the National Purchasing  Council;  they  once  again  passed  the  intermediate assessment of this label in 2020.\n\n## Supplier assessment\n\nSuppli e r s  a r e  a s s e s s e d  a t  s e v e r a l  l e v e l s  o f  t h e  c o n t r a c t u a l  r e l a t i o n s h i p , using several tools:\n\n- -on  a  documentary  basis  thanks  to  the  use  of  a  recognized expert  partner,  EcoVadis,  which  offers  a  tool  for  assessing suppliers' commitment to CSR under ISO 26000. The results of the assessment make it possible to identify the suppliers most at risk from a CSR point of view and to prioritize Orange's corrective actions.  Orange  recommends  a  minimum  EcoVadis  score  of 25/100  for  a  contract  to  be  signed  with  Orange.  Corrective action plans are mandatory for prospects or suppliers scoring less than 45/100;\n- -via  on-site  audits  carried  out  by  an  expert  partner  company within  the  JAC.  Orange  implements  a  coordinated  program of on-site CSR audits based on verification, assessment and development of a common methodology. The audits assess the status of suppliers' compliance with social and environmental standards (SA 8000, ISO 14001) and establish corrective action plans where necessary.\n\nThe Group has set up a monitoring and alert system for purchasing and  procurement  risks  related  to  suppliers  deemed  strategic  to the  organization  and  whose  failure  to  comply  could  have  major consequences on the Group's operations.\n\nIn  response  to  the  requirements  of  Orange's  Vigilance  Plan,  the supplier assessment program was redesigned and implemented in the Group's main subsidiaries in 2019 (see Section 4.5. Suppliers and subcontractors), and extended in 2020.",

Since 2018, the JAC has increased the efficiency of its action through an accreditation program for its suppliers (JAC Academy), trained in on-site audit methodology. JAC also works with other institutions (ITU, BSR, CDP, RMI and GSMA) to supplement its requirements on other CSR priorities such as climate change, the circular economy, the t r a c e a b i l i t y  o f  m i n e r a l s  f r o m  s u p p l y  s o u r c e s  t h a t  r e s p e c t  h u m a n  r i g h t s and the environment. The JAC welcomes other telecommunication operators so that it can expand its geographical coverage (in Asia, South America and Africa), thus indicating the global nature of its commitment.\n\n## BuyIn\n\nBuyIn is the joint venture created by Orange and Deutsche Telekom in  2011  to  group  together  the  strategic  purchasing  of  the  two international  groups.  As  such,  by  leveraging  its  scale,  BuyIn  can achieve more competitive conditions in terms of quality, price and innovation.  The  company  concentrates  the  assessments  of  its suppliers during calls for tenders. The CSR recommendation that informs this selection is based on the score of the reference partner used by Orange, the results of on-site audits by the Joint Alliance for CSR (JAC) and observations by its own CSR experts.\n\nEvery year, BuyIn redefines its risk mapping by purchase category, then conducts a targeted assessment of each high-risk category, as well as the largest markets, in accordance with its code of conduct developed with Orange and Deutsche Telekom.\n\nBuyIn makes sure that each supplier under contract has a score higher than the benchmark score defined in our external partner's tool, or implements a corrective action plan specific to those suppliers with lower scores, to allow them to reach the required level.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 2\n\n2",

        "page_content": "This section contains forward-looking statements about Orange. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward-looking statements. The most significant risks are detailed in Section 2.1 Risk factors.\n\nThe following comments are based on the Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in accordance with IFRS (International Financial Reporting  Standards,  see  Note  2  to  the  Consolidated  Financial Statements).  The  Group  has  applied  IFRS  16  'Leases'  since January 1, 2019. In this context, the decision of the IFRS IC (IFRS Interpretations Committee) published in December 2019 and relating to the enforceable lease term was implemented by the Group on December 31, 2020 for all leases falling within the scope of the final decision of the Inte r p r e t a t i o n s  C o m m i t t e e ,  w i t h  r e t r o a c t i v e  e f f e c t  f r o m January 1, 2019. Data on a historical basis and data on a comparable basis for the 2019 fiscal year were restated to reflect this change. An additional right of use and lease liability for 443 million euros were therefore  recognized  retrospectively  as  of  January  1,  2019. The impact of the application of this decision on the Consolidated income statement and on the Consolidated statement of cash flows of the Group is not significant (see Note 2.3.1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\nData  on  a  comparable  basis,  EBITDA  after  Leases  (referred  to as  'EBITDAaL'),  economic  CAPEX  (referred  to  as  'eCAPEX'  or 'economic CAPEX'), the 'EBITDAaL - eCAPEX' indicator, organic cash flow from telecom activities, net financial debt, and the ratio of net financial debt to EBITDAaL from telecom activities, are financial indicators  not  defined  by  IFRS.  For  further  information  on  the cal c u l a t i o n  o f  t h e s e  i n d i c a t o r s  a n d  t h e  r e a s o n s  w h y  t h e  O r a n g e  g r o u p uses them and considers them useful for readers, see Section 3.1.5 Financial indicators not defined by IFRS and Section 7.2.1 Financial glossary.\n\nData on a historical basis (see Section 7.2.1 Financial glossary) relates to data for prior periods as reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements for the current period. The transition from data on a historical basis to data on a comparable basis for the 2019 fiscal year is set out in Section 3.1.5.1 Data on a comparable basis.\n\nThe new organization of the Orange group's Executive Committee in place since September 1, 2020 (see Section 3.1.1.3 Significant events) led the Group to review the presentation of its segment information, without however changing the definition of its business segments. In this context, Spain was integrated into the Europe aggregate. The segment information now includes, within Europe, Spain and Other European countries, comprising Poland, Belgium, Luxembourg and each  of  the  Central  European  countries  (Moldova,  Romania  and Slovakia). Data on a historical basis, data on a comparable basis and customer bases for the 2019 fiscal year were restated to reflect this change. In addition, the Orange Bank business segment was renamed Mobile Finance Services to reflect the gradual integration of new activities within this segment (see beginning of Section 3.1.3 Analysis by business segment and Note 1.9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\nThe segment information (see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) that is presented in the following sections is understood, unless stated otherwise, before eliminations for transactions with other segments.\n\nUnless stated otherwise, data in the tables is presented in millions of euros, without a decimal point. This presentation may, in some cases, lead to negligible differences in the totals and sub-totals in the tables.

In data on a comparable basis, this growth was mainly driven by countries in Africa & Middle East, and France, up 5.2% and 1.6% respectively year-on-year. Together this more than offset the decline in revenue in Europe (-3.5%), mostly in Spain, in Enterprise services (-1.4%) and, to a lesser extent, in services to International Carriers & Shared Services. Between 2019 and 2020, the Group's revenue  growth  was  fueled  by  the  strong  trend  in  wholesale services, due to the co-financing of the fiber network in France, and convergence services, which grew by 4.4% and 2.1% respectively in data on a comparable basis. However, in the context of the Covid-19 health  crisis,  international  roaming  (customers  and  visitors)  was adversely affected by travel restrictions, and equipment sales (-9.5% in data on a comparable basis) by store closures.\n\nSales activity recorded  an  increase  in  access  lines,  despite  an extremely  competitive  environment  and  a  year  dominated  by the  Covid-19  crisis.  In  data  on  a  comparable  basis,  convergent offers  (11.1  million  customers  at  December  31,  2020)  were  up 2.7%  year-on-year.  Very  high-speed  broadband  offers,  which had  9.6  million  access  lines  at  December  31,  2020,  rose  23.7% year-on-year. The total number of mobile access lines also increased by 3.3% year-on-year, with 214.1 million access lines at December 31,\n\n2020. Lastly, Orange Bank's customer base in France and Spain, including the mobile insurance offer, was almost 1.2 million customers at December 31, 2020.\n\nEBITDAaL was 12,680 million euros in 2020, down 1.4% in data on a historical basis and 1.0% in data on a comparable basis. In data on a comparable basis, EBITDAaL was significantly affected by the decline in international roaming and the main additional costs directly linked to the Covid-19 crisis (-545 million euros), as well as by Spain (-13.0%) and Enterprise (-14.9%). These effects were mitigated by the remarkable performance of countries in Africa & Middle East (+10.0%), the solid results of Other European countries (+2.3%), and the resilience of France (+0.2%). The ratio of EBITDAaL from telecom activities to revenue was 30.4% in 2020, down 0.4 points on 2019 in data on a historical basis and data on a comparable basis.\n\nOperating income amounted to 5,521 million euros in 2020, down 409 million euros (-6.9%) on 2019 in data on a historical basis. This decrease is mainly due to the 176 million euro decline in EBITDAaL in data on a historical basis and the 162 million euro increase in net expenses relating to significant litigation, following a reassessment of the risk related to various disputes.\n\nConsolidated net income totaled  5,055  million  euros  in  2020, compared with 3,222 million euros in 2019, an increase of 1,833 million euros. This increase is mainly due to the tax income of 2,246 million euros recognized at the end of 2020 relating to the settlement of a tax dispute in France in respect of fiscal years 2005-2006 (see Section 3.1.1.3 Significant events).",

        "page_content": "Economic CAPEX stood at 7,132 million euros in 2020, down 2.2% in data on a historical basis and 1.7% in data on a comparable basis. The ratio of economic CAPEX to revenue from telecom activities was 16.8% in 2020, down 0.4 points on 2019 in data on a historical basis and 0.3 points in data on a comparable basis. The fall in the Group's economic CAPEX was largely a result of the co-financing received, partly offset by the accelerated rollout in very high-speed fixed (FTTH) and mobile (4G/5G) broadband networks. Despite the Covid-19 crisis, the Group succeeded in rolling out more fiber in 2020  than  in  2019.  At  December  31,  2020,  the  Group  thus  had 48.3  million  households  connectable  with  very  high-speed  fixed broadband (including 47.2 million FTTH connectable households), up 22.2% year-on-year. In addition, there were 81.3 million 4G customers at December 31, 2020, an increase of 20.4% year-on-year. At 2020 year-end, nearly 100% of Orange mobile sites in France offered 4G coverage.\n\nNet financial debt stood at 23,489 million euros at December 31, 2020, a decrease of 1,976 million euros vs end-Dec 2019. This was mainly due to the tax income of 2,246 million euros recognized at\n\nthe end of 2020 relating to the settlement of a tax dispute in France in respect of fiscal years 2005-2006 (see Section 3.1.1.3 Significant events). The ratio of net financial debt to EBITDAaL from telecom activities stood at 1.83x at December 31, 2020. Excluding the impact of the 2.2 billion euro tax refund, the ratio would have been 2.00x, in line with the medium-term objective of around 2x.\n\nOrganic cash flow from telecom activities a m o u n t e d  t o  2 , 4 9 4  m i l l i o n euros at December 31, 2020, compared with 2,345 million euros at December 31, 2019, an increase of 149 million euros between the two periods. This increase is mainly due to the reduced outflows related to economic CAPEX and to the French part-time for seniors (TPS) plans.\n\nWith regard to the dividend , see Section 6.3 Dividend policy.\n\n## 3.1.1.3 Significant events\n\nThe Group's main significant events are described in Section 1.3 Significant events.\n\n## 3.1.2 Analysis of the Group's results and capital

historical basis , the 0.1% increase in Group revenue between 2019 and 2020, an increase of 32 million euros, includes:\n\n- -the  negative  impact  of  foreign  exchange  fluctuations,  which amounted to 156 million euros, mainly as a result of movements in the Polish zloty (for 86 million euros), the Guinean franc (for 31 million euros) and the US dollar (for 19 million euros) against the

This decline mainly reflects:\n\n- -(i)  the  decrease  in  mobile  only  services,  with  a  significant decrease  in  12-month  mobile  only  ARPO  (see  Section  7.2.1 Financial glossary) and the number of mobile only accesses, particularly for prepaid offers, and (ii) the decline in convergent services,  marked  primarily  by  a  decline  in  convergent  ARPO\n\n- over 12 months, due overall to the polarization of offers and the general market shift towards low-cost offers; and\n- -to a lesser extent, a sharp drop in equipment sales, due to the significant fall in volumes due to the Covid-19 health crisis (store closures).\n\nIn  Other European countries, the decrease of 79 million euros in revenue (a drop of 1.4%) was mainly due to:\n\n- -(i)  the  decline  in  mobile  only  services,  mostly  in  Romania, Belgium  and  Slovakia,  due  to  the  migration  of  customers  to convergent of fers and the decline in customer roaming due to the Covid-19 health crisis, (ii) the significant drop in equipment sales, essentiall y i n  P o l a n d  a n d  t o  a  l e s s e r  e x t e n t  B e l g i u m  a n d  S l o v a k i a , resulting from the Covid-19 health crisis (store closures, travel restrictions),  (iii)  the  contraction  in  other  revenues  in  Belgium and Romania (downturn due to the Covid-19 health crisis), as well as in Poland (fall in energy sales), (iv) the decrease in mobile carrier services in Belgium caused by the Covid-19 health crisis (fall in SMS volumes and visitor roaming), and (v) the downward trend in  fixed  only  narrowband  services  in  Poland  (decline  in conventional telephony);\n- -partially offset by (i) the significant growth in convergent services i n a l l  c o u n t r i e s ,  d r i v e n  i n  p a r t i c u l a r  b y  t h e  i n c r e a s e  i n  t h e  c u s t o m e r base, and (ii) the increase in IT & integration services, mainly in Poland and, to a lesser extent, in Romania.\n\nIn Africa & Middle East countries, the increase of 291 million euros in r e v e n u e  ( a  r i s e  o f  + 5 . 2 % ) ,  w a s  f u e l e d  ( i )  m o s t l y  b y  t h e  g r o w t h  o f  m o b i l e only services (driven by data services and, to a lesser extent, Orange Money; see Section 3.1.1.3 Significant events), and (ii) secondarily, by the increase in fixed only broadband services (due in particular to the accelerated fiber rollout), (iii) partially offset by the decline in services to carriers, impacted by the Covid-19 health crisis (with the fall in incoming international traffic and visitor roaming). Growth in the region was driven mainly by the solid performance of the C\u00f4te d'Ivoire sub-group (in all countries), the Sonatel sub-group (mainly Guinea) and Egypt.\n\nWith regard to Enterprise, the decrease of 107 million euros in revenue (a drop of -1.4%) is essentially due to:\n\n- -(i) the decline in mobile services and equipment, heavily impacted by the Covid-19 health crisis, (ii) the downward trend in voice s e r v i c e s ,  a n d  ( i i i )  t h e  f a l l  i n  d a t a  s e r v i c e s  ( m a i n l y  s a t e l l i t e  t e l e v i s i o n broadcasting services), in connection with the Covid-19 health crisis;\n- -partially offset by the growth in IT & integration services (mainly cybersecurity  and  Cloud  services),  slowed  however  in  the second and third quarters of 2020 by the Covid-19 health crisis.\n\nLastly,  with  regard  to  services  to  International  Carriers  &  Shared Services, the decrease of 44 million euros in revenue (a fall of -3.0%) is mainly due to the decline in activity relating to international carriers, particularly in the context of the Covid-19 health crisis (restrictions on movements and international travel, fall in traffic on voice corridors).",

This change mainly results from a difference in the methodology used for aggregating bases (and not the bases themselves), secondarily, from a harmonization between countries, and lastly, from the integration of Wholesale FTTH access bases.\n\nPreviously,  the  Group  distinguished  between  (i)  mobile  service customers, (ii) fixed broadband customers, and (iii) fixed telephony customers.  Since  January  1,  2020,  the  Group  has  made  a distinction  between  (i)  mobile  accesses  (bases  unchanged)  and (ii) fixed accesses, which include fixed broadband accesses (bases unchanged)  and  fixed  narrowband  accesses.

The ratio of EBITDAaL from telecom activities to revenue was 30.4% in 2020, down 0.4 points on 2019 in data on a historical basis and data on a comparable basis.\n\nFor the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on the Group's activities and financial position, see Section 3.1.1.3 Significant events.\n\n## Change in data on a historical basis\n\nIn historical data ,  the  1.4%  decrease  in  the  Group's  EBITDAaL between 2019 and 2020, i.e. a decrease of 176 million euros, is due to  (i)  the  negative  impact  of  foreign  exchange  fluctuations,  which amounted to 23 million euros, mainly as a result of movements in the Polish zloty against the euro, (ii) the unfavorable impact of changes in  the  scope  of  consolidation  and  other  changes  for  22  million euros, primarily due to the effect of the disposal of Orange Niger in November 2019, and (iii) the organic change on a comparable basis, i.e. a fall of 131 million euros in EBITDAaL.\n\nChange in data on a comparable basis\n\nIn data on a comparable basis ,  the  1.0%  or  131  million  euro decrease in Group EBITDAaL between 2019 and 2020 was mainly due to:\n\n- -the 8.1% or 262 million euro increase in other network expenses and IT expenses (see Section 7.2.1 Financial glossary) in almost all  countries,  essentially  due  to  the  increase  in  outsourcing expenses  for  operations  and  technical  maintenance,  as  well as IT expenses, linked in large part to fiber optic maintenance and higher energy costs in France, the network rollout and the development of data services in countries in Africa & Middle East, and the growth of IT and integration services (in particular cybersecurity and the Cloud for B2B services);\n- -the 16.3% or 118 million euro decrease in other adjusted operating income (see Section 7.2.1 Financial glossary and Note 5.2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), which was particularly marked in France and Spain, due in particular to lower rebilling of network sharing costs, income received from litigation and income received from damage to lines;\n- -the 115 million euro increase in depreciation and amortization of  right-of-use  assets  (effects  of  rent  indexation  and  lease amendments, new leases, integration of new mobile mast sites, etc.),  mainly  in  France  and  for  B2B  services,  and  to  a  lesser\n\nextent, in countries in Africa & Middle East and for services to International Carriers & Shared Services;\n\n- -the 5.8% or 105 million euro increase in adjusted operating taxes and levies (see Section 7.2.1 Financial glossary and Note 11.1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), mostly in France (due to the flat-rate tax on certain network assets, IFER) and in Africa & Middle East countries (due to business growth);\n- -the 3.1% or 83 million euro increase in other adjusted external purchases (see Section 7.2.1 Financial glossary), mainl y i n Fr a n c e, as a result of (i) the increase in purchases for resale primarily related  to  the  construction  of  public  initiative  networks  (see section 3.1.1.3 Significant events), and secondarily to the rollout of build-to-suit mobile sites, and (ii) the effects of the Covid-19 health crisis, with the recognition of costs of medical supplies, partially offset by the fall in overheads (travel, entertainment and vehicle expenses) in most countries, linked to travel savings and the cancellation of various events;\n- -the 11.0% or 55 million euro increase in other adjusted operating expenses (see Section 7.2.1 Financial glossary and Note 6.2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), which is mainly due to (i) the increase in impairment and losses on trade receivables from  telecom  activities  (particularly  in  France  and  for  B2B services) due to the Covid-19 health crisis (see Note 5.3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), and (ii) the increase in the cost of bank credit risk for Mobile Finance Services, particularly in connection with the Covid-19 health crisis (see Note 17.2.3 of the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements);\n- -and the 41 million euro increase in depreciation and amortization of  financed  assets  (set-top  boxes  in  France  financed  by  an intermediary bank; see Note 9.5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\nThese unfavorable changes were partially offset by:\n\n- -the  6.0%  or  435  million  euro  fall  in  commercial  expenses, equipment  and  content  costs  (see  Section  7.2.1  Financial glossary), due to (i) the sharp decrease in commercial expenses and equipment costs in France and Europe and for B2B ser vices, due to the consequences of the Covid-19 health crisis (store closures and decline in equipment sales, and lower advertising, promotion  and  sponsorship  expenses),  (ii)  partially  offset  by higher  content  costs  in  Europe  (mainly  in  Spain)  and  higher distribution commissions in Africa & Middle East countries (linked to business growth, and in particular Orange Money);",

Between  2019  and  2020,  EBITDAaL  included  the negative effect of promotional offers on e-readers amounting to 60 million euros, due to a positive impact that was smaller in 2020 than in 2019;\n- -the  1.1%  or  52  million  euro  decrease  in  service  fees  and inter-operator  costs  (see  Section  7.2.1  Financial glossary), resulting primarily from (i) the fall in network expenses in Spain (due  to  the  decline  in  sales  activity  and  the  increase  in  fiber r o l l o u t ) ,  a n d  ( i i )  s e c o n d a r i l y,  t h e  s l i g h t  r e d u c t i o n  i n  i n t e r c o n n e c t i o n costs, particularly in Belgium (fall in SMS volumes and roaming in connection with the Covid-19 health crisis); and\n- -the 0.4% or 34 million euro decline in adjusted labor expenses (see Section 7.2.1 Financial glossary). Between the two periods, (i)  the  effect  of  wage  policies  in  France  and  internationally,\n\nand (ii) to a lesser extent, the payment of specific bonuses to some employees in connection with the Covid-19 health crisis (particularly  bonuses  for  employees  who  continued  working on site) are more than offset by (i) the effect of the 1.6% drop in the average number of employees (full-time equivalent, see Section  7.2.1 Financial glossary),  representing  a  decrease  of 2,168  full-time  equivalent  employees  (mainly  in  France  and Poland),  and  (ii)  the  decrease  in  employee  profit-sharing  and share-based compensation.\n\nBetween 2019 and 2020,  the  decline  in  international  roaming  of customers and visitors, particularly affected by the Covid-19 health crisis, had a negative impact on EBITDAaL amounting to 292 million euros in data on a comparable basis. The amount of 253 million euros was also recognized in 2020 for the main specific additional costs generated by the management of the Covid-19 health crisis.

This increase was chiefly attributable to:\n\n- -the 2,295 million euro reduction in corporate income tax expense (see Note 11.2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), mainly due to the current tax income of 2,246 million euros recognized in 2020 following the settlement of a tax dispute. On November 13, 2020, the French Conseil d'\u00c9tat found in favor of Orange SA in a tax dispute in France in respect of fiscal years 2005-2006. This decision brought the proceedings to a close and allowed Orange to recover the amounts paid in July 2013 totaling 2,246 million euros, of which 646 million euros in interest (see Section 3.1.1.3 Significant events and Note 11.2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements);\n- -partially offset by (i) the 409 million euro fall in operating income, and (ii) to a lesser extent, the 53 million euro drop in finance costs, net (see Note 13.2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Between the two periods, the change in finance costs, net mainly includes  (i)  the  negative  impact  of  derivatives  for  153  million euros (cross currency swaps) set up by the Group to hedge its\n\neconomic exposure on subordinated notes issued in pounds sterling, for which the revaluation for foreign exchange risk is not recognized (see Notes 13.2 and 15.4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), (ii) partially offset by the counter-effect of the recognition, in 2019, of a 119 million euro expense in respect of the investment held in BT Group until 2019 (see Note 13.7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\nNet income attributable to non-controlling interests amounted to 233 million euros in 2020, compared with 218 million euros in 2019 (see Note 15.6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). After taking into account net income attributable to non-controlling interests, the net income attributable to owners of the parent company totaled 4,822 million euros in 2020, compared with 3,004 million euros in 2019, an increase of 1,818 million euros.\n\n## 3.1.2.4 Group comprehensive income\n\nThe  transition  from  consolidated  net  income  to  consolidated comprehensive income is described in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income in the Consolidated Financial Statements.",

The  ratio  of economic CAPEX to revenue from telecom activities  was  16.8% in 2020, down 0.4 points on 2019 in data on a historical basis and 0.3 points in data on a comparable basis.\n\nChange in data on a historical basis\n\nIn historical data ,  the  2.2%  or  160  million  euro  decrease  in  the Group's economic CAPEX between 2019 and 2020 is due to (i) the negative effect of foreign exchange fluctuations, which amounted to 22 million euros, mainly as a result of movements in the Polish zloty against the euro, (ii) the negative impact of changes in the scope of consolidation and other changes for 14 million euros, and (ii) the organic change on a comparable basis, i.e. a decrease of 124 million euros in economic CAPEX.\n\n## Change in data on a comparable basis\n\nIn data on a comparable basis ,  the  1.7%  or  124  million  euro decrease in the Group's economic CAPEX between 2019 and 2020 was attributable mainly to:\n\n- -the increase in external financing between the two periods. The Group's investments benefit from co-financing received from third-party operators and subsidies (particularly in France, Spain and Poland) which are deducted from economic CAPEX;\n- -the decline in the rollout of very high-speed fixed broadband networks  (FTTH)  in  Spain  and  to  a  lesser  extent  Poland, largely due to delays caused by the Covid-19 health crisis (see Section 3.1.1.3 Significant events);\n- -t h e  f a l l  i n  c a p i t a l  e x p e n d i t u r e  o n  l e g a c y  fi x e d  a n d  m o b i l e  n e t w o r k s in  France,  in  line  with  the  gradual  migration  of  customers  to very  high-speed fixed  and  mobile  broadband networks (fiber and 4G/5G);\n- -the decrease in economic CAPEX relating to leased handsets, Livebox and equipment installed at customers' premises, mainly in France, and to a lesser extent, for B2B services; and\n- -to  a  lesser  extent  delays  or  postponements  of  investment projects  relating  to  the  Covid-19  health  crisis,  particularly  for B2B services.\n\nThese decreases were partially offset by:\n\n- -the growth of investments in (i) very high-speed fixed broadband networks  (FTTH)  in  France,  and  (ii)  very  high-speed  mobile broadband networks (4G/5G), primarily in France, Spain and countries  in  Africa  &  Middle  East,  despite  the  slower  rollout due to the Covid-19 health crisis (see section 3.1.1.3 Significant events); and\n- -the decrease in disposals of fixed assets, mainly:\n- -in Spain, with fewer disposals of mobile sites (75 million euros i n 2020, compared with 185 million euros in 2019, as part of the sale of 1,500 non-strategic mobile sites to Cellnex for a total of 260 million euros),\n- -as well as in Poland and for shared services, with the decline in  disposals  made  as  part  of  the  optimization  of  the  real estate portfolio (a counter-effect of the significant disposals made in 2019 and delays or postponements of real estate restructuring projects due to the Covid-19 health crisis),\n\nassets.

In its core business, the Group is continuing to revolutionize the operator role, confirming its leadership and further  upgrading  its  infrastructure  based  on  new  fixed  and mobile  network  technologies  (FTTH  and  5G  in  particular;  see Section 3.1.1.3 Significant events). The Group will pursue its efforts to optimize investments and disposals of non-strategic assets. This will involve prioritizing the allocation of its resources to projects that create the most value, with the aim of achieving a ratio of economic CAPEX to revenue from telecom activities of around 15% by 2023.\n\nIn fixed networks,  whether  using  proprietary  infrastructure  or third-party  networks  via  co-financing  or  leasing  arrangements, Orange plans to market its FTTH packages to more than 65 million households  in  Europe  by  2023,  thus  confirming  its  European leadership in fiber. At the same time, Orange will seek to:\n\n- -constantly improve the quality of connectivity inside the home (Homelan): boxes and WiFi will continue to be developed and Orange will assist i ts c u s to m e r s  i n  o p t i m i z i n g  t h e i r  h o m e  n e t w o r k ;\n- -offer new services based on the home of the future by leveraging the gradual increase in home speeds: Orange plans to develop its TV experience in OTT (Over-The-Top) to respond to changes\n\n- in content use and to continue developing security or remote support solutions; and\n- -reduce the carbon footprint of networks through energy efficiency and decarbonization programs (improvement in the energy mix, particularly through the use of renewable energy).\n\nOn the mobile n e t wo r k ,  5 G  l o o k s  s e t  t o  d i s r u p t  t h e  t e l e c o m  i n d u s t r y. Following the first commercial launch in Romania in November 2019, the  Group  continued  marketing  5G  in  2020  in  several  European countries where the Group operates (Poland, Spain, France; see Section  3.1.1.3 Significant events). Having obtained the necessary licenses, Orange will integrate DSS technology to capitalize on its existing infrastructure and ensure a rapid rollout while keeping costs down. With 5G, speeds are expected to be up to 10 times faster. From 2023, when the core networks will move to 5G, Orange aims to offer lower latency and use network slicing, i.e. prioritizing certain network slices to cover critical usage or specific needs. The technical performance of the 5G technology will enable the emergence of many  new  uses,  both  for  the  general  public  (immersive  videos, Cloud gaming) and in B2B, for which 5G will be a catalyst of digital transformation (optimization of production times, remote control of machines, predictive maintenance, etc.). Orange has also pledged to reduce the CO2 emissions of its mobile networks.\n\nOrange's infrastructure will be upgraded while retaining control of its strategic assets. For its FTTH infrastructure , Orange will continue to invest directly to meet its commitments in medium-density areas (AMII), for example in France. However, to continue its industrial effort in certain areas, while controlling its investments, Orange could link up with partners. Through the vehicle Orange Concessions, bringing together public initiative networks (PIN) in France, Orange will be able  to  seize  new  development  or  consolidation  opportunities  in this market (see Section 3.1.1.3 Significant events). To continue to reinvent its model with optimal management of the FTTH network, Orange will rely on other financial vehicles to address third-party networks in France. In Spain and Poland, Orange also plans to share future FTTH rollouts with other operators via FiberCos, potentially involving third parties.\n\nAt the same time, Orange will decommission its copper network in  France,  very  gradually,  so  as  to  support  all  network  users  in their  transition  to  fiber.  The  current  transition  is  accompanied  by a  plan  to  replace  wooden  poles  with  composite  equipment with a  smaller  environmental  footprint.  After  an  initial  trial  phase,  the decommissioning of copper will begin in 2023 and is expected to end in 2030.\n\nTo  optimize  the  rollout  of  its mobile infrastructure ,  particularly in  5G, in terms of pace, coverage and financial capacity, Orange plans to rely on RAN-sharing agreements, while maintaining areas of differentiation, in keeping with the agreements already existing in Poland, Romania, Spain and Belgium.\n\nTo make better use of directly-owned towers in its mobile network in Europe, Orange plans to set up TowerCos in most of its European countries. These entities focus purely on tower management and have  three  key  objectives:  improving  operational  efficiency  and optimizing mobile investments, increasing the co-location rate, while maintaining Orange's competitive advantage, and finally, ensuring better understanding of and highlighting the quality and value of these assets. Orange will retain control of these entities in all European countries where they are created. In this respect, Orange reached a major milestone with the announcement in February 2021 of the creation of Totem, the Group's European TowerCo (see Section 3.1.1.3 Significant events).",

Orange is thus positioning itself as a trusted partner that supports companies seeking to optimize their connectivity costs, make their networks more reliable, extract value from their data, and ensure a performance in line with the data speed required by services and applications (see Section 3.1.1.3 Significant events).  This  commitment  is  supported  by  equipment financing programs to minimize customer investments in equipment.\n\nTo r o l l  o u t  a n d  m a i n t a i n  i n t e r n a t i o n a l  c o n n e c t i v i t y ,  O r a n g e  w i l l  c o n t i n u e its  investments  by  replacing  a  cable-laying  ship  and  investing  in submarine cable companies (see Section 3.1.1.3 Significant events). It will also participate in voluntary environmental certification programs for the maritime industry.\n\nin  urban  and  rural  areas,  relying  in  particular  on  Djoliba,  the  first pan-African  backbone  (see  Section  3.1.1.3  Significant events). Multiservice activities, and specifically financial services, are also central to the growth strategy for Africa & Middle East countries by 2025. The Group aspires to become the market leader in mobile financial  services  on  the  continent  by  leveraging  its  assets:  the increase in Orange Money's active customer base, the profitability of the service, the diversification of applications and the extension of the service outside the Group's traditional area (see Section 3.1.1.3 Significant events).\n\nIn  financial  services,  Orange  Bank  plans  to  extend  its  reach  and diversify  its  product  portfolio  (loans,  insurance,  specific  digital banking solutions).\n\nSee also Section 1.2.2 The Orange group strategy.\n\nIn Africa & Middle East, a region that is experiencing strong growth, Orange intends to accelerate the rollout of mobile and fixed networks\n\n## 3.1.3 Review by business segment\n\nThe new organization of the Orange group's Executive Committee in place since September 1, 2020 (see Section 3.1.1.3 Significant events) led the Group to review the presentation of its segment information, without however changing the definition of its business segments. In this context, Spain was integrated into the Europe aggregate. Data on a historical basis, data on a comparable basis and customer base data for the 2019 fiscal year were restated to reflect this change. In addition, the Orange Bank business segment was renamed Mobile Finance Services to reflect the gradual integration of new activities within  this  segment  (see  Note  1.9  to  the  Consolidated  Financial Statements).\n\nThe  decisions  regarding  the  allocation  of  resources  and  the performance assessment of the component parts of Orange are made by the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (main operational decision-maker) at business segment level, mainly consisting of the geographical establishments.\n\nThe business segments are:\n\n- -France (excluding Enterprise);\n- -Spain and each of the Other European countries (comprising the business segments Poland, Belgium and Luxembourg and each  of  the  Central  European  countries:  Moldova,  Romania and Slovakia). The Europe aggregate combines the business segments of this area;\n- -the Sonatel sub-group (comprising the entities in Senegal, Mali, Guinea,  Guinea-Bissau  and  Sierra  Leone),  the  C\u00f4te  d'Ivoire sub-group  (comprising  the  entities  in  C\u00f4te  d'Ivoire,  Burkina Faso and Liberia) and each of the other countries in Africa and the Middle East (mainly Botswana, Cameroon, Central African Republic  (CAR),  Congo  (DRC),  Egypt,  Jordan,  Madagascar, Morocco, and Niger until its disposal on November 22, 2019). The  Africa  &  Middle  East  aggregate  combines  the  business segments of this area;\n- -Enterprise,  which  brings  together  dedicated  communication solutions  and  services  for  businesses  in  France  and  around the world;\n- -the  activities  of  International  Carriers  &  Shared  Services  ('IC &  SS'),  which  include  (i)  the  rollout  of  the  international  and long-distance network, submarine cable laying and maintenance, and international wholesale services and sales, and (ii) shared services, which cover the Group's support and cross-cutting functions  (IT  systems,  research  and  development,  and  other general  Group  activities),  content  activities  and  the  Orange brand; and\n- -Mobile Finance Services.\n\nFor  more  details  on  segment  information,  see  Note  1  to  the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

This growth in volume is also accompanied by growth in value. The 12-month convergent ARPO (see Section 7.2.1 Financial glossary) therefore rose by 1.1% between December 31, 2019 and  December  31,  2020,  despite  the  unfavorable  effect  of promotional e-reader offers between the two periods and the negative impact of the Covid-19 health crisis.\n\nThis increase was partially offset between the two periods by:\n\n- -the  164  million  euro  decrease  in  Equipment  sales,  heavily impacted  by  the  Covid-19  health  crisis,  mainly  due  to  store closures  or  reduced  access  to  stores  during  the  lockdown periods;\n- -t h e  12 7  m i l l i o n  e u r o  d e c r e a s e  i n  r e v e n u e  f r o m  Fixed only services, due almost exclusively to the downward trend in conventional telephony  (down  12.6%  year-on-year,  or  175  million  euros), whereas fixed only broadband services rose by 49 million euros (or  1.8%  year-on-year).  The  12-month  fixed  only  broadband ARPO (see Section  7.2.1 Financial glossary)  was  down  1.1% year-on-year, due in particular to the unfavorable effect, between the two periods, of promotional e-reader offers; and",

        "page_content": "- -to a lesser extent, the 56 million euro decrease in revenue from Mobile  only  services,  primarily  due  to  the  3.2%  contraction in  the  mobile  only  access  base,  linked  to  (i)  the  migration  of contract offers to convergent offers, and (ii) the smaller customer base for prepaid offers. Added to this is the fall in 12-month mobile only ARPO (see Section 7.2.1 Financial glossary), down 0.4% between December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020, impacted in particular by (i) the unfavorable effect, between the two periods, of promotional e-reader offers, and (ii) the negative effect of the Covid-19 health crisis on revenues from customer roaming.\n\n## 3.1.3.1.2 EBITDAaL - France\n\nChange in data on a historical basis\n\nIn data on a historical basis ,  the  29  million  euro  increase  in EBITDAaL from France between 2019 and 2020 stems from (i) the positive impact of changes in the scope of consolidation and other changes amounting to 11 million euros, and (ii) organic change on a  comparable  basis  representing  an  18  million  euro  increase  in EBITDAaL.\n\nFurther, between 2019 and 2020, EBITDAaL included the negative effect, between the two periods, of promotional offers on e-readers amounting to 60 million euros, due to a positive impact that was smaller in 2020 than in 2019.\n\nChange in data on a comparable basis\n\nIn data on a comparable basis ,  the  18  million  euro  increase  in EBITDAaL in France between 2019 and 2020 was mainly attributable to:\n\n- -(i) the 296 million euro increase in revenue, (ii) the decrease in commercial expenses and equipment costs, especially the costs of  handsets  and  other  equipment  sold,  linked  to  the  decline in equipment sales caused by the Covid-19 health crisis, and (iii)  to  a  lesser  extent,  the  reduction  in  labor  expenses  owing to the decrease in the average number of employees (full-time equivalents);\n- -partially offset by:\n- -the  increase  in  other  external  purchases,  largely  due  to (i) purchases for resale mainly related to the construction of public initiative networks (PIN, see Section 3.1.1.3 Significant events) and secondarily to the rollout of build-to-suit mobile sites, and (ii) the effects of the Covid-19 health crisis, with recognition of the costs of medical supplies, partially offset by  the  reduction  in  overheads  (travel,  entertainment  and vehicles),\n- -the decrease in other operating income (net of other operating expenses), mainly linked to the increase in impairment and l o s s e s  o n  t r a d e  r e c e i v a b l e s  d u e  t o  t h e  C o v i d -19  h e a l t h  c r i s i s ,\n- -the increase in other network expenses and IT expenses related to fiber maintenance and higher energy costs,\n- -the increase in depreciation and amortization of right-of-use assets  (integration  of  new  antenna  sites,  effects  of  rent indexation  and  lease  amendments)  and  financed  assets\n\n- (set-up  boxes  financed  by  an  intermediary  bank;  see Note 9.5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), and\n- -the  increase  in  operating  taxes  and  levies,  mainly corresponding to the increase in the flat-rate tax on network enterprises (IFER), reflecting the higher unit prices of lines from January 1, 2020.\n\n## 3.1.3.1.3 Operating income - France\n\nIn data on a historical basis ,  the  83  million  euro  decrease  in operating income in France between 2019 and 2020 was largely attributable to:\n\n- -the  recognition  of  a  net  expense  on  significant  litigations  of 199 million euros in 2020, corresponding to the reassessment of the risk on various disputes;\n- -partially offset by (i) the 40 million euro decrease in restructuring program  costs,  (ii)  the  29  million  euro  increase  in  EBITDAaL on a historical  basis,  and  (iii)  the  25  million  euro  decrease  in specific  labor  expenses,  mainly  related  to  the  counter-effect of the recognition, in 2019, of an expense of 32 million euros in respect of the French part-time for seniors plans (TPS, plans relating to agreements for the employment of older workers in France) and related bonuses (see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\n## 3.1.3.1.4 Economic CAPEX - France\n\nIn both data on a historical basis and data on a comparable basis , the 304 million euro decline in economic CAPEX in France between 2019 and 2020 is mainly due to:\n\n- -(i) the significant increase in co-financing received from third-party operators in connection with the rollout of fiber optic networks, (ii)  partly  offset  by  the  increase,  between  the  two  periods,  in gross investments to catch up with the FTTH network rollout, despite being hampered by the Covid-19 health crisis, especially after work stopped during the first lockdown (see Section 3.1.1.3 Significant events); and\n- -to  a  lesser  extent,  the  increase  in  fixed  asset  disposals,  with the  sale  of  FTTH  connections  to  SFR  in  2020,  following  the agreement signed in May 2018 between Orange and SFR (which led to Orange withdrawing from 236 municipalities in its AMII area, in favor of SFR).\n\n## 3.1.3.1.5 Telecommunication licenses - France\n\nIn 2020, telecommunication licenses in France represented a total of 876 million euros. These mainly correspond to the acquisition of the 5G license (90 MHz of spectrum in the 3.5 GHz band) for 875 million euros, including 854 million euros in fixed fees (with payment spread over four to 15 years, depending on the block) and 21 million euros in s p e c t r u m  r e f a r m i n g  c o s t s  r e l a t i n g  t o  t h e  a l l o c a t i o n  o f  n e w  f r e q u e n c i e s to operators (see Section 3.1.1.3 Significant events).\n\nIn 2019, no telecommunication license acquisition was recognized in France\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

mobile access base was down 1.3% year-on-year, with 21.5  million  customers  at  December  31,  2020.  Contract  offers grew 0.9% year-on-year, reflecting both (i) the growth in premium offers, driven by Open convergent offers (which reached 9.8 million customers at December 31, 2020), and (ii) the increase in entry-level offers, driven by the penetration of SIM-only offers. This was largely due to the Sosh brand, which was in high demand during lockdown periods  and  while  stores  remained  closed.  Sosh  had  a  total  of 4.2 million customers at December 31, 2020, up 8.1% year-on-year. The prepaid customer bases are structurally in decline. In addition, there were 16.4 million 4G customers at December 31, 2020, an increase of 3.1% year-on-year.\n\nThe total  fixed  broadband  access  base increased by 2.6% year-on-year  (298,000  new  customers)  to  reach  12.0  million customers  at  December  31,  2020.  This  growth  is  mainly  driven by (i) the dynamism of fiber optic offers, with a total of 4.5 million customers  at  December  31,  2020,  up  35.3%  year-on-year,  and (ii)  the  continued  growth  of  convergent  offers,  which  grew  by 0.8%, with 5.8 million customers at December 31, 2020. Moreover, 7.6 million customers had subscribed to IPTV and satellite TV offers at  December  31,  2020,  an  increase  of  4.7%  year-on-year.  Fixed access lines sold to other operators (wholesale) were down 2.3% year-on-year, due to the structural decline and migration of copper access lines. In contrast, the number of very high-speed broadband connections rose sharply (up 53.5% year-on-year).\n\n## 3.1.3.2 Europe\n\n| Europe                                 | 2020   | 2019                             | 2019 data on a   historical basis   | % change data on a  (1)   | % change data on a   historical basis   |\n|----------------------------------------|--------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| (at December 31, in millions of euros) |        | data on a  comparable basis  (1) |                                     | comparable basis          |                                         |\n| Revenue                                | 10,580 | 10,968                           | 11,051                              | (3.5) %                   | (4.3) %                                 |\n| EBITDAaL                               | 2,932  | 3,112                            | 3,136                               | (5.8) %                   | (6.5) %                                 |\n| EBITDAaL/Revenue                       | 27.7%  | 28.4%                            | 28.4%                               | (0.7 pts.)                | (0.7 pts.)                              |\n| Operating Income                       | 796    |                                  | 1,009                               |                           | (21.0) %                                |\n| eCAPEX                                 | 1,847  | 1,668                            | 1,681                               | 10.7%                     | 9.8%                                    |\n| eCAPEX/Revenue                         | 17.5%  | 15.2%                            | 15.2%                               | 2.2 pts.                  | 2.2 pts.                                |\n| Telecommunication licenses             | 73     | 308                              | 308                                 | (76.2) %                  | (76.2) %                                |\n| Average number of employees            | 26,807 | 27,867                           | 27,718                              | (3.8) %                   | (3.3) %                                 |\n\n- (1) See Section 3.1.5.1 Data on a comparable basis.",

3.1.5.1 Data on a comparable basis.\n- (2) Central Europe: entities in Moldova, Romania and Slovakia.\n\nChange in data on a historical basis\n\nIn data on a historical basis , the 471 million euro decrease in the Group's revenue from countries in Europe between 2019 and 2020 includes (i) the negative effect of foreign exchange fluctuations for 88 million euros (mainly as a result of movements in the Polish zloty against the euro), (ii) the positive impact of changes in the scope of consolidation and other changes for 5 million euros, and (ii) organic change on a comparable basis, i.e. a decrease of 388 million euros in revenue.\n\nChange in data on a comparable basis\n\nIn data on a comparable basis , the 388 million euro decrease in revenue from countries in Europe between 2019 and 2020 is mainly attributable to:\n\n- -the  decline  in  Mobile  only  services  in  all  countries  and  the downturn  in  Equipment  sales,  and  to  a  lesser  extent,  the decrease in Wholesale services (in most countries except Spain and Poland), the contraction in Fixed only services and the fall in Other revenues;\n- -partially offset by (i) the growth in IT & integration services, and (ii) the growth in Convergent services.\n\nThe 388 million euro decrease in revenue in Europe between the two periods was largely due to the fall in revenue in Spain, down 312 million euros year-on-year.\n\nBetween  2019  and  2020,  the  decline  in  revenue  in  Europe  was essentially due to:\n\n- -the 245 million euro fall in revenue from Mobile only services in all countries, linked to a decrease in the mobile only access base, down 1.3% year-on-year (particularly in Spain and Central European countries) due to the combined effect of lower prepaid\n\naccess sales, the migration of customers to convergent offers, and the decline in international roaming revenues from customers as a result of the Covid-19 health crisis;\n\n- -the 113 million euro decrease in Equipment sales in almost all countries (except Romania and Moldova), mainly due to store closures during lockdown periods; and\n- -to a lesser degree:\n- -the 47 million euro decline in Fixed only services, primarily due  to  the  downward  trend  in  conventional  telephony  in Poland and the migration of customers to convergent offers,\n- -the  37  million  euro  decrease  in  Other  revenues, mainly relating  to  Belgium  and  Romania (linked to the downturn caused by the Covid-19 health crisis), as well as Poland, due to lower energy sales, and\n- -the 18 million euro drop in revenue from Wholesale services, due  in  particular  to  the  reduction  in  mobile  services  to carriers, resulting mainly from (i) the decline in SMS volumes and visitor roaming in Belgium due to the Covid-19 health crisis, and (ii) the fall in call termination (mostly in Romania).\n\nThis decrease in revenue was partially offset by:\n\n- -the  57  million  euro  increase  in  revenue  from  IT  &  integration services, mainly in Poland in the B2B market, and secondarily in Romania, linked to the signing of specific new contracts with local authorities; and\n- -to a lesser extent, the 15 million euro increase in revenue from Convergent services. The 5.1% fall in revenues from convergent services in Spain was more than offset by the 122 million euro increase in revenue from convergent services in Other European countries.  Year-on-year,  the  convergent  customer  base  in countries in Europe countries grew 5.0%.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

customer bases in European countries withstood the Covid-19 health crisis and strong competition, which was particularly evident in Spain.\n\nThe total mobile access base was  stable  year-on-year,  with 50.9  million  customers  at  December  31,  2020.  Prepaid  offers continued to decline, accentuated by the Covid-19 health crisis.

The fixed broadband access base recorded a 3.0% year-on-year increase (with 7.8 million accesses  at  December  31,  2020),  driven  by  the  growth  in  very high-speed  broadband,  up  11.2%  year-on-year  (with  4.7  million accesses at December 31, 2020).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

Contract customers  increased  by  1.7%  year-on-year,  whilst  prepaid customers (1.9 million customers at December 31, 2020) fell by 24.7% year-on-year;\n- -the  total  fixed  broadband  access  base  shrank  by  1.0% year-on-year,  although  the  very  high-speed  fixed  broadband access base continued to grow at a rate of 4.8% year-on-year to reach 3.4 million customers at December 31, 2020, or 83.2% of the total fixed broadband access base. In addition, digital TV packages (IPT V and satellite T V ) i n c re a s e d by 0.9% ye a r- o n -ye a r, driven by content offers (broadcasts of championship football matches and optional premium content).\n\nThe 312 million euro fall in revenue from Spain between the two periods (i.e. a reduction of 5.9%) is mainly attributable to:\n\n- -t h e  15 0  m i l l i o n  e u r o  d e c l i n e  i n  r e v e n u e  f r o m  M o b i l e  o n l y  s e r v i c e s , mainly  due  to  the  migration  of  the  market  towards  low-cost offers, resulting in (i) a 6.4% drop in 12-month mobile only ARPO between December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020, and (ii) a 5.2% year-on-year contraction in the mobile only access base, particularly for prepaid offers;\n- -the  107  million  euro  decrease  in  revenue  from  Convergent services, due to the challenging competitive environment and the effects of the Covid-19 health crisis, particularly for packages that include football content. The convergent customer base had 3 mil l i o n  c u s t o m e r s  a t  D e c e m b e r  31,  2 0 2 0 ,  u p  0 .1%  y e a r- o n - y e a r. 12-month convergent ARPO fell 2.5% between December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020; and\n- -to a lesser extent (i) the 55 million euro decrease in Equipment sales, owing to lower volumes due to the Covid-19 health crisis (store closures during lockdown periods), and (ii) the 30 million euro  fall  in  revenue  from  Fixed  only  services,  impacted  by  a tough competitive environment and the Covid-19 health crisis, leading  to  a  4.3%  year-on-year  contraction  in  the  fixed  only broadband access base and a 3.8% fall in 12-month fixed only broadband ARPO.\n\n## EBITDAaL - Spain\n\nIn  both data on a historical basis and data on a comparable basis , the 214 million euro decline in EBITDAaL in Spain between 2019 and 2020 is mainly due to:\n\n- -(i) the 312 million euro fall in revenue, (ii) the decrease in other operating income (decline in rebilling linked to network sharing, increase  in  impairment  and  losses  on  trade  receivables  due to the Covid-19 health crisis), and (iii) to a lesser extent, higher content costs;",

the Africa & Middle East segment between 2019 and 2020 includes (i) the unfavorable effect of changes in the scope of  consolidation  and  other  changes  for  69  million  euros,  mostly corresponding to the disposal of Orange Niger on November 22, 2019  (for  63  million  euros),  (ii)  the  negative  impact  of  foreign exchange fluctuations for 33 million euros, mainly taking into account movements in the Guinean franc (for 31 million euros), and, to a lesser extent, the Jordanian dinar, against the euro, (iii) more than offset by organic change on a comparable basis, amounting to a 291 million euro increase in revenue.\n\nChange in data on a comparable basis\n\nIn data on a comparable basis , the 291 million euro increase in revenue from countries in the Africa & Middle East segment between 2019 and 2020 is mainly due to business growth of (i)  the  C\u00f4te d'Ivoire sub-group, led by C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and Burkina Faso, (ii) the Sonatel sub-group, primarily driven by Guinea, Mali and Sierra Leone, (iii) Egypt, and (iv) to a lesser extent, Cameroon.\n\nThe growth in revenue from countries in the Africa & Middle East segment between the two periods is mainly attributable to:\n\n- -the  278  million  euro  increase  in  Mobile  only  services, due in large  part  to  (i)  the  23.7%  growth  in  data  services,  boosted by  the  38.8%  increase  in  the  4G  customer  base,  which  had 33.0 million customers at December 31, 2020, and (ii) the 21.1% growth in Orange Money's revenue, which stood at 507 million euros in 2020, despite the regulatory measures introduced by central banks for mobile payment services in the context of the Covid-19 health crisis. At December 31, 2020, the mobile only access base had 128.4 million accesses, up 5.2% year-on-year, mainly due to the sales performance recorded in Cameroon and in the Sonatel and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire sub-groups; and\n- -to  a  lesser  extent,  the  75  million  euro  increase  in  Fixed only services, largely as a result of the development of broadband services (particularly in Morocco), in turn due to the accelerated rollout of fiber and lifestyle changes during the pandemic. The fixed  broadband  access  base,  up  39.3%  year-on-year,  has therefore grown in almost all countries;\n- -partially  offset  by  the  69  million  euro  reduction  in  Wholesale services, impacted by the fall in incoming international traffic volumes and the decline in visitor roaming linked to the Covid-19 travel restrictions.\n\n## 3.1.3.3.2 EBITDAaL - Africa & Middle East\n\nChange in data on a historical basis\n\nIn data on a historical basis ,  the  151  million  euro  increase  in EBITDAaL in countries in the Africa & Middle East segment between 2019 and 2020 includes (i) the unfavorable impact of changes in the scope of consolidation and other changes for 15 million euros, and (ii) the negative effect of foreign exchange fluctuations for 13 million euros, ( i i i )  m o r e  t h a n  o f f s e t  b y  o r g a n i c  c h a n g e  o n  a  c o m p a r a b l e  b a s i s , representing a 179 million euro increase in EBITDAaL.\n\nChange in data on a comparable basis\n\nIn data on a comparable basis , the 179 million euro increase in EBITDAaL in countries in the Africa & Middle East segment between 2019 and 2020 is primarily explained by:\n\n- -revenue growth of 291 million euros, and to a lesser extent, the fall in interconnection costs (due to the decline in domestic call termination and the slowdown in international transit activity), as well as the reduction in other operating expenses;\n- -partially offset by (i) the increase in operating taxes and levies, mostly due to business growth, (ii) the increase in other network expenses  and  IT  expenses  (continued  network  rollout  in  all countries, development of data services), and (iii) the increase in distribution commissions, linked to the strong sales momentum and, in particular, the expansion of Orange Money.\n\n## 3.1.3.3.3 Operating income - Africa & Middle East\n\nIn data on a historical basis ,  the  87  million  euro  increase  in operating income in countries in the Africa & Middle East segment between 2019 and 2020 was largely due to the 151 million increase in EBITDAaL on a historical basis, partially offset by:\n\n- -the  35  million  euro  increase  in  impairment  of  goodwill  and fixed assets (see Notes 8 and 9.3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements),  due  to  the  counter-effect  of  the  recognition,  in 2019,  (i)  of  a  reversal  of  provisions  for  fixed  assets  in  Egypt for 89 million euros, reflecting notably an improvement in the country's economic situation, (ii) partially offset by impairment of goodwill in Jordan for 54 million euros, which reflected the effects of an uncertain political and economic climate and strong competitive pressure in the fixed and mobile data markets;\n- -and the 39 million euro increase in depreciation and amortization of  fixed  assets  (see  Note  9.2  to  the  Consolidated  Financial Statements).",

This growth was mainly driven by the increase in  cybersecurity  services  (with  revenue  of  768  million  euros in  2020, up 9.0% year-on-year) and Cloud services (up 5.9% year-on-year).\n\n## 3.1.3.4.2 EBITDAaL - Enterprise\n\nChange in data on a historical basis\n\nIn data on a historical basis ,  the  168  million  euro  decrease  in Enterprise EBITDAaL between 2019 and 2020 includes (i) the positive effect of foreign exchange fluctuations for 10 million euros, (ii) the favorable impact of changes in the scope of consolidation and other changes for 1 million euros, and (iii) organic change on a comparable basis, amounting to a decrease of 179 million euros in EBITDAaL.\n\nChange in data on a comparable basis\n\nIn data on a comparable basis , the 179 million euro decrease in Enterprise EBITDAaL between 2019 and 2020 can essentially be attributed to:\n\n- -(i)  the 107 million euro fall in revenue, (ii) the increase in labor expenses, mainly related to the increase in the average number of employees (full-time equivalents) linked to the development of Cloud and cybersecurity activities, (iii) the increase in other network  expenses  and  IT  expenses,  corresponding  to  the increase in operating and maintenance costs for IT infrastructure and  applications  (in  line  with  the  increase  in  IT  &  integration services), and (iv) the increase in impairment and losses on trade receivables due to the Covid-19 health crisis;\n- -partially offset by the reduction in commercial expenses and equipment costs, in line with the decline in activity.\n\n## 3.1.3.4.3 Operating income - Enterprise\n\nIn data on a historical basis , the 152 million euro fall in Enterprise operating  income  between  2019  and  2020  is  largely  due  to  the 168 million euro decrease in EBITDAaL on a historical basis, partially offset by the recognition, in 2020, of a 14 million euro gain on disposal of fixed assets.\n\n## 3.1.3.4.4 Economic CAPEX - Enterprise\n\nChange in data on a historical basis\n\nIn data on a historical basis ,  the  66  million  euro  decrease  in Enterprise economic CAPEX between 2019 and 2020 includes (i) the negative effect of foreign exchange fluctuations for 3 million euros, (ii)  the  favorable impact of changes in the scope of consolidation and other changes for 2 million euros, and (iii) organic change on a comparable basis, amounting to a decrease of 64 million euros in economic CAPEX.",

Between 2019 and 2020, the 10 million euro decrease in operating income is mainly due to:\n\n- -the increase in the cost of bank credit risk (see Notes 1.2, 1.3 and 6.2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), including 15 million euros related to the Covid-19 health crisis (see Section 3.1.1.3 Significant events and Note 17.2.3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements);\n- -the increase in operating expenses resulting in particular from the development of offers in Europe and the launch of Orange Bank Africa;\n\n- -partially offset by the 29 million euro increase in Net Banking Income (NBI, see Notes 1.2, 1.3 and 5.2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), essentially due to lower acquisition and distribution costs.\n\nIn  both data on a historical basis and data on a comparable basis ,  the  economic CAPEX of Mobile Finance Services rose by 2 million euros between 2019 and 2020, primarily due to the increase in investments in Europe and the launch of the banking activities of Orange Bank Africa (see Section 3.1.1.3 Significant events).\n\n## 3.1.3.6.2 Assets, liabilities and cash flows\n\nThe segment information for Mobile Finance Services (operating income, investments in property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, assets, liabilities and cash flows) are presented in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and the activities of Mobile Finance  Services  (financial  assets  and  liabilities,  management of  market  risks  connected  with  the  activities,  and  unrecognized contractual  commitments)  are  described  in  Note  17  to  the Consolidated Financial Statements.",

Any change in the rating could have an effect on the cost of future financing or access to liquidity.\n\nIn  addition,  a  change  in  Orange's  credit  rating  will,  for  some outstanding financing, affect the compensation paid to investors via Step-up clauses (a clause that triggers an increase in interest payments in the event of a downgrading of Orange's long-term credit rating by the rating agencies, according to contractually defined rules - this clause may also stipulate a downward revision of the coupon interest rate in the event of an improvement in the rating, as long as the interest rate does not drop below the initial interest rate on the loan - see Note 14.3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\nOrange's credit rating at December 31, 2020 was as follows:\n\n| Orange's credit rating   | Standard & Poor's   | Moody's   | Fitch Ratings   |\n|--------------------------|---------------------|-----------|-----------------|\n| (at December 31, 2020)   |                     |           |                 |\n| Long-term debt           | BBB+                | Baa1      | BBB+            |\n| Outlook                  | Stable              | Stable    | Stable          |\n| Short-term debt          | A2                  | P2        | F2              |\n\nFor further information on risks related to the financial markets and a history of the Company's credit ratings, see Section 2.1.3 Financial risks.\n\n## 3.1.4.3 Equity\n\nAt December 31, 2020, the French State held 22.95% of the capital of Orange SA and 29.43% of the voting rights, directly or in concert with Bpifrance Participations (see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\nThe payment of dividends by Orange took place as follows (see Note 15.3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements):\n\n- -in 2020, payment of (i) the balance of the dividend of 0.20 euro per share in respect of the 2019 fiscal year (see Section 3.1.1.3 Significant events), and (ii) the interim dividend of 0.40 euro per share in respect of the 2020 fiscal year;\n- -in 2019, payment of (i) the balance of the dividend of 0.40 euro per share in respect of the 2018 fiscal year, and (ii) the interim dividend of 0.30 euro per share in respect of the 2019 fiscal year.\n\nAdditionally, Orange has not exercised its right to defer the coupon related  to  the  deeply  subordinated  notes  since  their  issuance. Accordingly, it paid the noteholders (i) 258 million euros in 2020, and (ii) 297 million euros in 2019 (of which 21 million euros in coupons on  subordinated  notes  reclassified  in  short-term  borrowings  at\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

Changes  in  equity  are  described  in  the Consolidated statement of changes in equity and in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## 3.1.5 Financial indicators not defined by IFRS\n\nIn this document, in addition to the financial indicators reported in accordance with IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards), Orange publishes financial indicators that are not defined by IFRS. As  described  below,  these  figures  are  presented  as  additional information and are not meant to be substitutes for or to be confused with financial indicators as defined by IFRS.\n\n## 3.1.5.1 Data on a comparable basis\n\nIn  order  to  allow  investors  to  track  the  annual  changes  in  the Group's operations, data on a comparable basis are presented for the previous period. The transition from data on a historical basis to data on a comparable basis consists of keeping the results for the year ended and restating the previous year in order to present financial  data  with  comparable  methods,  scope  of  consolidation and exchange rates over comparable periods. Orange provides the detail s of t h e  e f f e c t  o f  c h a n g e s  i n  m e t h o d ,  s c o p e  o f  c o n s o l i d a t i o n  a n d\n\nexchange rates on its key operating indicators in order to isolate the intrinsic business effect. The method used is to apply to the data of the corresponding period of the preceding year the methods and the scope of consolidation for the period ended, as well as the average exchange rates used for the Consolidated income statement for the period ended.\n\nOrange's  management  believes  that  the  presentation  of  these indicators  on  a  comparable  basis  is  relevant  because  these  are indicators used internally by the Group for monitoring its operating activities.  Changes  in  data  on  a  comparable  basis  better  reflect organic business changes.\n\nData on a comparable basis are not financial indicators defined by IFRS and may not be comparable to similarly-titled indicators used by other companies. It is provided as additional information only and should not be considered as a substitute for an analysis of the Group's historical data for the past year or previous periods.\n\n## 3.1.5.1.1 2019 fiscal year - Group\n\nThe following table presents, for the Orange group, the transition from data on a historical basis to data on a comparable basis for the 2019 fiscal year for the key operating data.\n\n| 2019 fiscal year - Group (at December 31, 2019, in millions of euros)   | Revenue   | EBITDAaL   | eCAPEX   | Average  number of  employees   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|------------|----------|---------------------------------|\n| Data on a historical basis                                              | 42,238    | 12,856     | 7,293    | 135,619                         |\n| Foreign exchange fluctuations  (1)                                      | (156)     | (23)       | (22)     | -                               |\n| Polish zloty (PLN)                                                      | (86)      | (21)       | (13)     | -                               |\n| Guinean franc (GNF)                                                     | (31)      | (15)       | (5)      | -                               |\n| US dollar (USD)                                                         | (19)      | (4)        | (2)      | -                               |\n| Jordanian dinar (JOD)                                                   | (8)       | (3)        | (1)      | -                               |\n| Egyptian pound (EGP)                                                    | 34        | 11         | 6        | -                               |\n| Other                                                                   | (46)      | 9          | (7)      | -                               |\n| Changes in the scope of consolidation and other changes                 | 68        | (22)       | (14)     | 336                             |\n| Acquisition of SecureLink                                               | 122       | 8          | 2        | 472                             |\n| Acquisition of BKM                                                      | 22        | (1)        | -        | 146                             |\n| Acquisition of SecureData                                               | 5         | -          | -        | 53                              |\n| Disposal of Orange Niger                                                | (63)      | (15)       | (2)      | (331)                           |\n| Other                                                                   | (18)      | (14)       | (14)     | (4)                             |\n| Data on a comparable basis                                              | 42,151    | 12,812     | 7,257    | 135,954                         |\n\nThe changes included in the transition from data on a historical basis to data on a comparable basis for the 2019 fiscal year incorporate ( i )  f o r e i g n  e x c h a n g e  fl u c t u a t i o n s  b e t w e e n  t h e  a v e r a g e  e x c h a n g e  r a t e s for the 2019 fiscal year and the average exchange rates for the 2020 fiscal year, (ii) changes in the scope of consolidation (see Note 4.2 to the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements)  and  other  changes,  with mainly:\n\n- -the acquisition of SecureLink (Enterprise) on July 8, 2019, taking effect on January 1, 2019, on a comparable basis;\n\n- -the acquisition of BKM (Europe) on July 30, 2019, taking effect on January 1, 2019, on a comparable basis;\n- -the acquisition of SecureData (Enterprise) on January 31, 2019, taking effect on January 1, 2019, on a comparable basis; and\n- -the sale of Orange Niger (Africa & Middle East) on November 22, 2019, taking effect on January 1, 2019, on a comparable basis.",

It is a more comprehensive indicator than 'EBITDAaL - eCAPEX' (used internally to manage and assess operating and segment results and to implement its investment and resource allocation strategy), since it notably includes the effects of  financial  costs,  income  taxes  and  changes  in  working  capital requirements.

This indicator is commonly used by companies in the telecommunication sector.\n\nOrganic cash flow from telecom activities is not a financial indicator defined  by  IFRS  and  may  not  be  comparable  to  similarly-titled indicators used by other companies. It is not a substitute for cash generated by operating activities or allocated to investing activities.\n\n## 3.1.5.6 Net financial debt\n\nNet financial debt as defined and used by Orange does not take into account Mobile Finance Services activities, for which this concept is not relevant. It consists of (i) financial liabilities excluding operating payables (translated into euros at the year-end closing rate) including derivative instruments (assets and liabilities), (ii) less cash collateral deposits, cash and cash equivalents and investments at fair value. Furthermore, financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges, included in net financial debt are mainly set up to hedge items that are not included therein, such as future cash flows. As a result, the portion relating to these unmatured hedging instruments recorded in other comprehensive income is added to gross financial debt to offset this temporary difference.\n\nThe breakdown of net financial debt is shown in Note 13.3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nNet financial debt is an indicator of financial position used by the Group. Net financial debt is a frequently disclosed indicator. It is widely used by analysts, investors, rating agencies and most groups in all business sectors in Europe.\n\nNet financial debt is not a financial indicator defined by IFRS and may not be comparable to similarly-titled indicators used by other companies. It is provided as additional information only and should not be considered as a substitute for an analysis of all the Group's assets and liabilities.\n\n## 3.1.5.7 Ratio of net financial debt to EBITDAaL from telecom activities\n\nThe ratio of net financial debt to EBITDAaL from telecom activities is  calculated  as  the  ratio  of  the  Group's  net  financial  debt  (see Section  3.1.5.6  Net financial debt)  to  EBITDAaL  from  telecom activities (see Section 3.1.5.2 EBITDAaL) calculated over the previous 12 months. As net financial debt (as defined and used by Orange) does not take into account Mobile Finance Services activities, for which this concept is not relevant, net financial debt is divided by EBITDAaL from telecom activities.  In  addition,  when  changes  in scope significantly affect the Group's net financial debt at the end of  the  period,  the  calculation  of  the  ratio  of  net  financial  debt  to EBITDAaL from telecom activities is adjusted to take into account the EBITDAaL from those entities over the previous 12 months.\n\n| (at December 31, in millions of euros)                             | 2020   | 2019 data on a   historical basis   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|-------------------------------------|\n| Net financial debt (a)                                             | 23,489 | 25,466                              |\n| EBITDAaL from telecom activities (b)                               | 12,839 | 13,015                              |\n| Ratio of net financial debt/EBITDAaL from telecom activities (a/b) | 1.83   | 1.96                                |\n\nThe ratio of net financial debt to EBITDAaL from telecom activities is used by Orange to measure the Group's ability to repay its debt, and more broadly to measure its financial strength. This ratio is commonly used by companies in the telecommunication sector.\n\n## 3.1.6 Additional  information\n\n## Unrecognized contractual commitments\n\nUnrecognized contractual commitments are described in Notes 16 and 17.3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nRatio of net financial debt to EBITDAaL from telecom activities is not a financial indicator defined by IFRS and may not be comparable to similarly-titled indicators used by other companies.",

The Notes are expected to be redeemed on or about April 1, 2021.\n\n## 3.2.2 Outlook\n\nThe Group's financial targets take into account the allocation of the tax refund of 2.2 billion euros received at the end of 2020 following the settlement of the tax dispute in France in respect of fiscal years 2005-2006 (see Section 3.1.1.3 Significant events). This balanced allocation of funds for the benefit of the company's development, its employees and its shareholders, with a reinforced commitment to society, is intended to generate added value for the Group in the long term. It will nevertheless have an impact on short-term objectives.\n\nFor 2021, therefore, the Group forecasts:\n\n- -stable but negative EBITDAaL (see Section 3.1.5.2 EBITDAaL) (around +1% before the allocation of the tax refund);\n- -economic CAPEX (see Section 3.1.5.3 eCAPEX) of between 7.6 and 7.7 billion euros (around 7.3 billion euros before the allocation of the tax refund);\n- -organic cash flow from telecom activities (see Section 3.1.5.5 Organic cash flow from telecom activities) of more than 2.2 billion euros (more than 2.6 billion euros before the allocation of the tax refund); and\n- -a ratio of net financial debt to EBITDAaL from telecom activities (see Section 3.1.5.7 Ratio of net financial debt to EBITDAaL from telecom activities) maintained at around 2x in the medium term.\n\nIn  2015,  SFR  filed  an  action  for  damages  allegedly  suffered  as a  result  of  Orange's  anticompetitive  practices  in  the  'Enterprise' market segment. On March 16, 2021, Orange and SFR entered into a memorandum of understanding, notably putting an end to this dispute. As part of this agreement, SFR is expected to withdraw its claim for 3 billion euros. This agreement will not have a material impact on the Group's earnings and net financial debt in 2021.\n\nThese  objectives  are  based  on  the  assumptions  stated  in  the presentation  of  the  global  digital  services  market  and  the  Group strategy (see Section 1.2 Market, strategy and business model) as well as in the presentation of the Group's operating activities, which include a description of the various business segments' markets (see Section 1.4 Operating activities). They take into account the events known on the date of this document mentioned in Section 3.2.1 above.\n\nThey  were  compiled  and  prepared  on  a  basis  comparable  with the historical financial information and consistent with the Group's accounting policies.\n\nThe Group also confirms its objective to generate between 3.5 and 4 billion euros in organic cash flow from telecom activities in 2023.\n\nFor more information on the outlook beyond 2021, see Section 1.2.2 The Orange group strategy.\n\nBy nature, achievement of these targets is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the targets announced. The most significant risks are detailed in Section 2.1 Risk factors.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

The Europe aggregate thus presents all the business segments in this region;\n- -the Sonatel subgroup (grouping together Sonatel in Senegal, Orange Mali, Orange Bissau, Orange in Guinea and Orange in Sierra Leone), the C\u00f4te d'Ivoire subgroup (including the Orange C\u00f4te d'Ivoire entities, Orange in Burkina Faso and Orange in Liberia) and each of the other countries in Africa and Middle East. The Africa and Middle East aggregate thus presents all the business segments in this region;\n- -Enterprise;\n- -the activities of International Carriers & Shared Services (IC&SS), which contain certain resources, mainly in the areas of networks, information systems, research and development and other shared Group activities, as well as the Orange brand;\n- -Mobile Financial Services.\n\nThe use of shared resources, mainly provided by IC&SS, is taken into account in segment results based either on the terms of contractual agreements between legal entities, external benchmarks or by reallocating costs among the segments. The supply of shared resources is included in other revenues of the service provider, and the use of these resources is included in expenses of the service user. The cost of shared resources may be affected by changes in contractual relationships or organization and may therefore impact the segment results disclosed from one year to another.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\n## Operating performance indicators\n\nThe Group has applied IFRS 16 'Leases' since January 1, 2019.\n\nIn 2019, this change in the standard led the Group to modify its key operating performance indicators and to define others: EBITDAaL ('EBITDA after Leases') and eCapex ('economic CAPEX').\n\nReported EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and CAPEX remain the performance indicators used for prior periods.\n\nSince 2019, these key operating performance indicators have accordingly been used by the Group to:\n\n- -manage and assess its operating and segment results; and\n- -implement its investment and resource allocation strategy.\n\nThe  Group's  management  believes  that  the  presentation  of  these  indicators  is  relevant  as  it  provides  readers  with  the  same management indicators as those used internally.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

Associated procedures are based on third-party decisions (regulatory authority, court, etc.) and occur over a different period to the activities at the source of the litigation. Costs are by nature difficult to predict in terms of their source, amount and period;\n- -specific labor expenses: independent of any departure plans included in the costs of restructuring programs, certain employee working time adjustment programs have a negative impact on the period in which they are signed and implemented. Specific labor expenses primarily relate to changes in assumptions and experience effects for the various part-time for seniors plans in France;\n- -the fixed asset, investment and business portfolio review: the Group conducts an ongoing review of its portfolio of fixed assets, investments and businesses. In this context, decisions to exit or sell are implemented and, by their nature, have an impact on the period in which they take place;\n- -restructuring program costs: the adaptation of the Group's activities to changes in the environment may generate costs related to the shutdown or major transformation of an activity. These costs, linked to the cessation or major transformation of an activity, mainly consist of employee departure plans, contract terminations and costs in respect of contracts that have become onerous;\n- -acquisition and integration costs: the Group incurs costs directly related to the acquisition of entities and their integration in the months following their acquisition. These are primarily legal and advisory fees, registration fees and earn-outs;\n- -where appropriate, other specific items that are systematically specified in relation to income and/or expenses.\n\nEBITDAaL is not a financial indicator defined by IFRS and may not be comparable to similarly-titled indicators used by other groups. It is provided as additional information only and should not be considered as a substitute for operating income or cash flow provided by operating activities.\n\neCapex relates to acquisitions of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets excluding telecommunication licenses and financed assets, minus the disposal price of fixed assets. It is used internally as an indicator to allocate resources. eCAPEX is not a financial indicator defined by IFRS and may not be comparable to similarly-titled indicators used by other companies.\n\nThe Group uses organic cash flow from telecom activities as an operating performance measure for telecom activities as a whole. Organic cash flow from telecom activities relates to net cash provided by telecom activities minus (i) repayment of lease liabilities and debts related to financed assets, (ii) purchases and disposals of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, net of the change in fixed asset payables, (iii) excluding the effect of telecommunication licenses paid and principal litigations paid (and received). Organic cash flow is not a financial indicator defined by IFRS and may not be comparable to similarly-titled indicators used by other groups.\n\n## Operating performance indicators used in 2018\n\nReported EBITDA related to operating income before depreciation and amortization, effects resulting from business combinations, reclassification of translation adjustment from liquidated entities, impairment of goodwill and fixed assets and share of profits (losses) of associates and joint ventures.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA related to reported EBITDA, adjusted for significant litigation, specific labor expenses, investment and business portfolio review, restructuring and integration costs and, where appropriate, other specific items.\n\nThis measurement indicator allowed the effects of certain specific factors to be isolated from reported EBITDA, irrespective of their recurrence and the type of income or expense, when they were linked to:\n\n- -significant  litigation:  significant  litigation  expenses  related  to  risk  reassessments  regarding  various  litigations.  Associated procedures were based on third-party decisions (regulatory authority, court, etc.) and could occur over a different period to the activities at the source of the litigation. Costs were by nature difficult to predict in terms of their source, amount and period;\n- -specific labor expenses: independent of any departure plans included in the costs of restructuring programs, certain employee working time adjustment programs had a negative impact on the period in which they were signed and implemented. Specific labor expenses primarily related to changes in assumptions and experience effects for the various part-time for seniors plans in France;\n- -the investment and business portfolio review: the Group conducted an ongoing review of its investments and business portfolio. In this context, disposal decisions were implemented and, by their nature, had an impact on the period in which the disposal took place. The corresponding gains (losses) on disposal affected either reported EBITDA or consolidated net income of discontinued operations;\n- -restructuring and integration costs: the adaptation of the Group's activities to changes in the environment may generate costs related to the discontinuation or major transformation of an activity. These costs, linked to the cessation or major transformation of an activity, mainly consist of employee departure plans, contract terminations and costs in respect of contracts that have become onerous;",

In addition to its role as a supplier of connectivity, the Group provides business services, primarily solutions in the fields of digital work, security and improvement of business line processes.\n\nTelecommunication operator activities are regulated and dependent upon the granting of li c e n s e s, j u s t  a s  m o b i l e  fi n a n c i a l  s e r v i c e  a c t i v i t i e s have their own regulations.\n\n## 2.2 Basis of preparation of the financial statements\n\nThe consolidated financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors' Meeting on February 17, 2021 and will be submitted for approval at the Shareholders' Meeting on May 18, 2021.\n\nThe  2020  consolidated  annual  financial  statements  have  been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting\n\nStandards (IFRSs) as endorsed by the European Union. Comparative figures are presented for 2019 and 2018 using the same basis of preparation.\n\nThe  data  are  presented  in  millions  of  euros,  without  a  decimal. Rounding  to  the  nearest  million  may  in  some  cases  lead  to non-significant discrepancies in the totals and subtotals shown in the tables.\n\nFor  the  reported  periods,  the  accounting  standards  and interpretations  endorsed  by  the  European  Union  are  similar  to the  compulsory  standards  and  interpretations  published  by  the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) with the exception of  the  texts  currently  being  endorsed, that have no effect on the Group accounts. Consequently, the Group financial statements are prepared in accordance with the IFRS standards and interpretations, as published by the IASB.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

The accounting principles applied since 2019, and the disclosures regarding lease liabilities and right-of-use assets are described in Note 10.\n\n## IFRS IC decision on IFRS 16 lease term\n\nThe  IFRS  IC  decision  on  the  enforceable  period  of  leases  was implemented from December 31, 2020 for all leases falling within the  scope  of  the  final  decision  of  the  Interpretation  Committee. This  first-time  application  with  retroactive  effect  to  January  1, 2019 represents a change in accounting policy. The effect of this implementation is mainly limited to leases with indefinite terms and short notice periods and to contracts whose initial lease term was exceeded and in a situation of tacit renewal at the time of application of this conclusion of the IFRS IC.\n\nThe IFRS IC committee published a decision in December 2019 which specifies that it is not possible to use only the legal approach to determine the enforceable period of a contract, if the duration cannot be determined definitively at the origin of the contract. The committee considers that a lease contract remains enforceable as long as the lessee or the lessor would have to bear a loss or a more than insignificant penalty in case of termination of the contract. To determine the enforceable period of a lease, all economic aspects of the lease must be taken into account and not just contractual termination indemnities.\n\nOn the date of preparation of the 2019 consolidated annual financial statements, the Group had adopted, depending on the accounting positions and the implementation methods concerning assessment of  the  term  of  leases,  a  legal  approach  in  a  certain  number  of open-ended  lease  contracts  with  a  notice  period  of  less  than 12 months, for which the Group applied the short-term exemption, in particular for leases of certain mobile sites.\n\nIn order to determine the reasonably certain terms to be applied to leases that are concerned by the IFRS IC decision, the Group has adopted a differentiated approach taking into account the nature of the underlying leased asset and/or the terms of the lease renewal for certain contracts.\n\nFor the majority of leases with indefinite terms benefiting from notice clauses of less than 12 months, the Group has adopted a period consistent  with  the  time  horizon  in  which  the  Group's  strategic investment decisions are made at the date of implementation of this IFRS IC decision. Where appropriate, the duration of these leases may be reassessed in order to take into account the Group's strategic choices or technological developments related to the underlying assets covered by these leases.",

The effect of this amendment, which gives tenants the possibility of recognizing eligible Covid-19-related rent concessions as if they were not lease modifications, is not significant for the Group.\n\n## 2.3.2 Amendment to IFRS 3 'Definition of a business'\n\nThis amendment clarifies the definition of a business and aims to help those preparing financial statements to determine whether an acquisition  should  be  recognized  as  a  business  combination  or an asset acquisition. This amendment will apply to all acquisitions made from January 1, 2020. These changes relate to the definition of a business:\n\n- -the business must include inputs and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs;\n- -the scope is limited to goods and services provided to customers and to income from ordinary activities and not to dividends, cost reductions or any other direct economic benefits for investors and possibly other third parties.\n\nThis amendment had no effect on the Group's consolidated financial statements at December 31, 2020 and the Group will take these new provisions into account when making future acquisitions.\n\n## 2.3.3 Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8 'Materiality'\n\nAmendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8, applicable since January 1, 2020, improve the definition of 'material' in order to determine whether information  should  be  provided  in  the  financial  statements,  or whether the way in which it is communicated has the same effect as if it had not been communicated. The Group considers that the judgment applied in the choice of information provided in its notes to the consolidated financial statements meets the provisions of the amendments published by the IASB.\n\n2.4 Main standards and interpretations compulsory after December 31, 2020 with no early application elected by the Group\n\n## 2.4.1 Amendment to IAS 1: Classification of liabilities as current or non-current\n\nThe amendments to the standard clarify the current requirements of  IAS  1  on  the  classification  of  liabilities  in  an  entity's  balance sheet. These amendments are not expected to have a significant impact  on  the  Group's  statement  of  financial  position.  However, the  implementation  of  these  amendments  could  lead  to  the reclassification of certain liabilities from current to non-current, and vice  versa.  The  date  of  entry  into  force  of  these  amendments  is January 1, 2023.\n\n## 2.4.2 Amendment to IAS 16: Proceeds before intended use\n\nThe amendment clarifies that an entity is not permitted to recognize any revenue from the sale of items produced as a deduction from the cost of the fixed asset while preparing the asset for its intended use. The proceeds from selling such items are recognized in profit or loss. The amendment is applicable from January 1, 2022.\n\n## 2.4.3 Amendment to IAS 37: Onerous contracts - cost of fulfilling a contract\n\nThe clarifications provided by the amendment concern the incremental costs of fulfilling an onerous contract to be taken into account in the provision, namely the costs of direct labor and materials and the allocation of other costs directly related to the contract, for example the depreciation expense relating to a fixed asset used in fulfilling the contract. The amendment is applicable from January 1, 2022.\n\n## 2.4.4 Amendment to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 relating to interest rate benchmark reform phase 2\n\nT h e  a m e n d m e n t s  t o  t h e  s t a n d a r d s  f o r  t h i s  p h a s e  2  p r o v i d e  i n  p a r t i c u l a r practical expedients for the modification of financial instruments or\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

For debt instruments affected by the IBOR reform, it will not be necessary to apply the provisions of IFRS 9 to determine whether the modification of the instrument is  substantial.  These  amendments propose that modifications to financial instruments related to the reform be treated prospectively as an update to the interest rate with no impact on profit or loss. With regard to hedge accounting, the amendments introduce an exemption allowing hedge accounting to be maintained despite the change in future cash flows impacted by the change in rates due to the reform.\n\nThe amendments add new disclosures on the effects of the change in rates on contractual cash flows impacting financial assets and liabilities, lease assets and liabilities and hedge accounting.\n\nDiscussions with the counterparties to negotiate the replacement of the indices with the new ones are ongoing. At December 31, 2020, the Group's exposure to financial instruments indexed to variable rates and maturing after the reform's implementation date is mainly summarized as follows:\n\n- -perpetual bonds redeemable for shares (French acronym TDIRA) for a nominal amount of 633 million euros;\n- -cross currency swaps with a nominal value of 348 million euros; and\n- -interest rate swaps with a nominal value of 573 million euros.\n\nThe analysis of l e a s e s  t h a t  m a y  b e  a f f e c t e d  b y  t h e  r e f o r m  i s  u n d e r w a y. The amendments are applicable from January 1, 2021.\n\n## 2.5 Accounting policies, use of judgment and estimates\n\nThe accounting policies are presented within each note to which they refer.

Management revises these estimates if the underlying circumstances evolve or in light of new information or more experience. Consequently,\n\nthe estimates made at December 31, 2020 may subsequently be changed. The consequences of the health crisis on the economic environment have led the Group's management to review some of its estimates (see Note 3).\n\n| Topic                                 |

summarize the impacts of the health crisis on  the  Group's  business  and  performance,  the  judgments  and assumptions made as well as the main effects of the crisis on the Group's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## 3.1 Effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on Orange's business and financial position\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic that affected France and the world in 2020 prompted  the  Group  to  rapidly  implement  actions  to  protect  its employees, suppliers, subcontractors and customers and, further afield, all of its stakeholders.\n\nThe implementation of these actions and the decisions taken by the  governments  of  the  countries  in  which  the  Group  operates have  affected  Orange's  business  and  financial  position.  These consequences  are  not  easily  quantifiable  as  they  are  difficult  to separate from other factors affecting the period.\n\nHowever, in 2020, the main effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on the Group's revenue are as follows:\n\n- -a  widespread  and  significant  decline  in  revenues  from international roaming (customers and visitors);\n- -a sharp decline in equipment sales;\n\n- -lower than expected growth in revenues from fixed-line services to operators;\n- -a slowdown in services to businesses;\n- -a general decline in sales activity.\n\nWith regard to the Group's operating expenses, the main effects of the Covid-19 pandemic are:\n\n- -a rise in impairments and losses on trade receivables;\n- -an overall increase in external purchases, in particular due to the costs of arrangements introduced to safeguard health, additional costs rel ate d to t h e  s u p p o r t  m e a s u r e s  f o r  c e r t a i n  n e t w o r k  s e r v i c e providers in France, as well as donations and sponsorship;\n- -the  payment  of  specific  bonuses  to  some  employees  in connection with the health crisis;\n- -a significant decrease in commercial expenses, equipment costs and overheads.\n\nWith  regard  to  the  Group's  investments,  the  main  effects  are  a significant inflection in investments in the first half of the year, due to the slowdown or temporary postponement of a certain number of projects.",

As at December 31, 2018, Orange holds 88.2% of the capital of Business & Decision (93.1% including the shares under reciprocal promises).\n\n## 4.3 On-going transactions\n\n## Signing agreement of Orange Romania to acquire a controlling stake in Telekom Romania Communications\n\nOrange Romania has announced on November 9, 2020 the signing of a deal to acquire a controlling 54% stake in Telekom Romania Communications. This transaction aims at accelerating Orange's ambitions to become a major convergent operator for customers in the Romanian market.\n\nThe transaction price amounts to 268 million euros (on a debt-free, cash-free basis and is subject to customary adjustments at closing of the transaction).\n\nThe  closing  of  the  transaction  is  subject  to  customary  condition precedents, notably antitrust clearance by the European Commission\n\n## Accounting policies\n\n## Changes in the scope of consolidation\n\nEntities are fully consolidated if the Group has the following:\n\n- -power over the investee; and\n- -exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and\n- -the ability to use its power over the investee to affect the amount of the investor's returns.\n\nWhen assessing control, IFRS 10 requires judgment and continuous assessment.\n\nClarifications of when the ownership interest does not imply a de facto presumption are provided in Note 20 which lists the main consolidated entities.\n\nJoint ventures and companies over which the Group exercises significant influence (generally corresponding to an ownership interest of 20% to 50%) are accounted for using the equity method.\n\nand other relevant authorities and is a priori expected within the second half of 2021.\n\n## Orange Concessions\n\nOn Januar y 22, 2021, O r a n g e  h a s  e n t e r e d  i n t o  a n  e x c l u s i v e  a g r e e m e n t with La Banque des Territoires (Caisse des d\u00e9p\u00f4ts), CNP Assurances and EDF Invest, for the sale of 50% of the capital and joint control of Orange Concessions. Subject to obtaining the agreement of the relevant antitrust authorities and all stakeholders, the closing of this transaction should be completed in the second half of 2021.\n\nWith  regard  to  the  disposal  plan  initiated  by  the  Group  and  in accordance with the criteria established by the IFRS 5 standard, the Group considers that the criteria for classifying the related assets as 'assets held for sale' are not met as of December 31, 2020.\n\n## Conditional voluntary public takeover offer on shares of Orange Belgium\n\nOn December 2, 2020, Orange has announced its intention to launch a conditional voluntary public tender offer on 47.09% of the capital of  Orange  Belgium,  corresponding  to  the  balance  of  the  shares of  Orange Belgium currently not held, at a price of 22 euros per share, in cash and without threshold conditions. It was submitted on January 21, 2021 for approval by the Financial Services and Markets Authority in Belgium (FSMA).\n\nIf conditions were met, this offer could then lead to the delisting of the shares of Orange Belgium.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n3 -\n\nWhen assessing the level of control or significant influence exercised over a subsidiary or associate, the existence and effect of any exercisable or convertible potential voting rights at the closing date is taken into account.\n\n## Takeovers (business combinations)\n\nBusiness combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method:\n\n- -the acquisition cost is measured at the fair value of the consideration transferred, including all contingent consideration, at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration are accounted for either through profit or loss or through other comprehensive income, in accordance with the applicable standards;\n- -goodwill is the difference between the consideration transferred and the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, and is recognized as an asset in the statement of financial position. Considering the Group's activity, the fair values of the identifiable assets relate mainly to licenses, customer bases and brands (which cannot be capitalized when developed in-house), generating induced deferred taxes. The fair value of these assets, which cannot be observed, is established using commonly adopted methods, such as those based on revenues or costs (e.g.: the 'Greenfield' method for the valuation of licenses, the 'relief from royalty' method for the valuation of brands and the 'excess earnings' method for customer bases).\n\nFor each business combination with an ownership interest below 100%, non-controlling interest is measured:\n\n- -either at its fair value: in which case, goodwill is recognized for the portion relating to non-controlling interests;\n- -or proportionate to its share of the acquiree's identifiable net assets: in which case, goodwill is only recognized for the share acquired.\n\nAcquisition-related costs are directly recognized in operating income in the period in which they are incurred.\n\nWhen a business combination is achieved in stages, the previously held equity interest is re-measured at fair value at the acquisition date through operating income. The related other comprehensive income, if any, is fully reclassified to profit or loss.\n\n## Internal transfer of consolidated shares\n\nIFRS do not address the accounting treatment for the transfer of consolidated shares within the Group resulting in changes in ownership interest. The Group applies the following accounting policy:\n\n- -t h e  t r a n s f e r r e d  s h a r e s  a r e  c a r r i e d  a t  h i s t o r i c a l  c o s t  a n d  t h e  g a i n  o r  l o s s  o n  t h e  t r a n s f e r  i s  f u l l y  e l i m i n a t e d  i n  t h e  a c q u i r e r 's  a c c o u n t s ;\n- -the non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the change in their share in the equity against Group retained earnings, with no impact on profit and loss and equity.\n\n## Assets held for sale\n\nThe Group qualifies an asset or group of assets as 'held for sale' when:\n\n- -the management is committed to a plan to sell;\n- -the asset is available for immediate sale in its current state (subject to any conditions precedent that are usual in such disposals); and\n- -the sale is highly probable, within 12 months.\n\nThus, when the Group is committed to a plan to sell involving the loss of control or significant influence over one of its assets, it classifies all assets and liabilities of the entities concerned under a separate line in the statement of financial position: 'Assets/ Liabilities held for sale', at a value equal to the lower of the net carrying value and the fair value net of disposal costs.\n\nIn addition, when the asset or group of assets held for sale represents a major line of an operating segment, its contribution to the income statement is presented separately below 'consolidated net income of continuing operations' and its cash flow contribution is presented in the statement of cash flows.\n\n## Note 5 Sales\n\n## 5.1 Revenue\n\nThe  presentation  of  revenue  is  disaggregated  by  category  and segment  in  Note  1.1  'Segment  information.'  The  breakdown  of revenue by type is as follows:\n\n- -mobile-only services: mobile service revenue is generated by incoming and outgoing calls (voice, SMS and data), excluding convergent services (see below);\n- -fixed-only services: revenue from fixed services includes fixed broadband  and  narrowband  services,  excluding  convergent\n\nservices  (see  below)  and  fixed  network  business  solutions, including voice and data;\n\n- -convergence  packages  (convergent  services):  these  include revenue  from  convergence  packages  for  the  B2C  market (Internet + Mobile products);\n- -equipment sales: equipment sales include all sales of equipment (mobile handsets, broadband equipment, connected devices and  accessories),  excluding  sales  of  equipment  related  to integration  and  information  technology  services  and  sales  of equipment to  external  distributors  and  brokers,  presented  in 'Other revenue';",

        "page_content": "- -I T &   integration  services:  these  services  include  unified communication and collaboration services (LAN and telephony, consultancy,  integration,  project  management),  hosting  and infrastructure services (including Cloud Computing), application services (customer relations management and other application services), security services, video conferencing offers, as well as sales of equipment related to the above products and services;\n\n- -services  to  carriers  (wholesale):  wholesale  revenue  includes roaming revenue from customers of other networks (national and international), revenue from Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNO) and from network sharing, among others;\n- -other revenues: these include, in particular, equipment sales to external distributors and brokers, revenues from portals, online advertising and the Group's cross-functional activities and other miscellaneous revenues.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nMost revenue falls within the application scope of IFRS 15 'Revenue from contracts with customers.' Orange's products and services are offered to customers under service-only contracts and contracts combining the equipment used to access services and/or other service offers. Revenue is recognized net of VAT and other taxes collected on behalf of governments.\n\n## Standalone service offers (mobile-only services, fixed-only services, convergent services)\n\nOrange offers its B2C and B2B customers a range of fixed and mobile telephony services, fixed and mobile Internet access offers and content offers (TV, video, media, added-value audio service, etc.). Some contracts are for a fixed term (generally twelve or twenty-four months), while others may be terminated at short notice (i.e. monthly arrangements or portions of services).\n\nService revenue is recognized when the service is provided, based on use (e.g. minutes of traffic or bytes of data processed) or the period (e.g. monthly service costs).\n\nUnder some content offers, Orange may act solely as an agent enabling the supply by a third-party of goods or services to the customer and not as a principal in the supply of the content. In such cases, revenue is recognized net of amounts transferred to the third-party.\n\nContracts with customers generally do not include a material right, as the price invoiced for contracts and the services purchased and consumed by the customer beyond the specific scope (e.g. additional consumption, options, etc.) generally reflect their standalone selling prices. There is no significant impact from contract modification for this type of service contract. Service obligations transferred to the customer at the same pace are treated as a single obligation.\n\nWhen contracts include contractual clauses covering commercial discounts (initial discount on signature of the lease or conditional on attaining a consumption threshold) or free offers (e.g. three months of subscription free of charge), the Group spreads these discounts or free offers over the enforceable period of the contract (period during which the Group and the customer have a firm commitment). Where applicable, the consideration payable to the customer is recognized as a deduction from revenue in accordance with the specific terms and conditions of each contract.\n\nIf  the  performance  obligations  are  not  classified  as  distinct,  the  offer  revenue  is  recognized  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  the contract term. One of the main applications of this method is the initial service connection in the context of a service contract and communication. It is not generally separable from the service contract and communication offer and is therefore recognized in income over the average term of the expected contractual relationship.\n\n## Separate equipment sales\n\nOrange offers its B2C and B2B customers several ways to buy their equipment (primarily mobile phones): equipment sales may be separate from or bundled with a service offer. When separate from a service offer, the amount invoiced is recognized in revenue on delivery and receivable immediately or in instalments over a period of up to 24 months. Where payment is received in instalments, the offer comprises a financial component and gives rise to the calculation of interest deducted from the amount invoiced and recognized over the payment period in net finance costs.\n\nWhere Orange purchases and sells equipment to indirect channels, the Group generally considers that Orange maintains control until resale to the end-customer (the distributor acts as an agent), even where ownership is transferred to the distributor. Sale proceeds are therefore recognized when the end-customer takes possession of the equipment (on activation).\n\n## Bundled equipment and service offers\n\nOrange proposes numerous offers to its B2C and B2B customers comprising equipment (e.g. a mobile handset) and services (e.g. a communication contract).\n\nEquipment revenue is recognized separately from service revenue if the two components are distinct (i.e. if the customer can receive one or other of the services separately). Where one of the components in the offer is not at its separate selling price, revenue is allocated to each component in proportion to their individual selling prices. This is notably the case in offers combining the sale of a mobile phone at a reduced price, where the individual selling price of the mobile phone is considered equal to its purchase cost and logistics expenses plus a commercial margin based on market practice. The amount allocated to equipment sales is recognized under revenue on delivery in exchange for a contract asset, spread over the term of the service contract.\n\nThe provision of a Livebox \u00ae (proprietary Internet box) is neither a separate component of the Internet access service offer nor a lease, as Orange maintains control of the box.\n\n## Services including a build and run phase\n\nFor business clients, some contracts have two phases: construction and then management (operation and maintenance) of assets built and delivered to customers. Revenue recognition requires an analysis of the facts and circumstances of each contract in order to determine whether distinct performance obligations exist. Under these contracts, if the construction phase is classified as separate, the Group recognizes the revenue of this phase according to the percentage of completion. However, if the Group does not have a certain right to payment and/or if there is no continuous transfer of control of the asset under construction, then revenue for this\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

On each contract modification, we assess the scope of the modification or its impact on the contract price in order to determine whether the modification should be treated as a distinct contract, as though the existing contract were terminated and a new contract signed, or whether the modification should be considered as a change to the existing contract.\n\n## Service offers to carriers (wholesale)\n\nThree types of commercial agreements are entered into with Carrier customers for domestic wholesale activities and International carrier offers:\n\n- -pay-as-you-go model: contract generally applied to 'legacy' regulated activities (bitstream call termination, local loop access, roaming and certain data solution contracts), where contract services are not covered by a firm volume commitment. Revenue is recognized as the services are provided (which relates to transfer of control) over the contractual term;\n- -send-or-pay model: contract where the price, volume and term are defined. The customer has a commitment to pay the amount indicated in the contract irrespective of actual traffic consumed over the commitment period. This contract category notably i ncludes cer tain MVNO (Mobile Vir tual Net work Operator), IDD (International Direct Dialing) or hubbing (call free floating) contracts. Related revenue is recognized progressively based on actual traffic during the period, to reflect transfer of control to the customer;\n- -mix model: hybrid contract combining the 'pay-as-you-go' and 'send-or-pay' models, comprising a fixed entry fee paid by the customer providing access to preferential pricing conditions for a given volume ('send-or-pay' component). In addition to this entry fee, an amount is invoiced based on traffic consumption ('pay-as-you-go' component). The amount invoiced for the entry fee included in this type of commercial agreement is recognized progressively in revenue based on actual traffic over the period.\n\nCurrent agreements between major transit carriers are not billed or cross-billed (free peering) and are therefore not recognized in revenue.\n\n## Service level commitment clause\n\nThe contracts entered into by Group and its customers include service level commitments regarding the processing of orders, delivery and after sales support (delivery time, performance, service reinstatement time). If the Group fails to comply with one of these commitments, it then pays compensation to the customer, which is usually a tariff reduction. The projected amount of these penalties is recognized as a deduction from revenue whenever it is expected that the commitment will not be fulfilled.\n\n## Public-private service concession arrangements\n\nThe Group rolls out and/or operates certain networks under service concessions, such as the public initiative networks implemented in France to roll out fiber-optic networks in less populated areas. Some contracts are analyzed in accordance with IFRIC 12 'Service concession arrangements.' When the Group builds a network, construction revenue is recognized as counterparty to a right to receive a consideration from either a public entity or users of the public service. This right is accounted for as:\n\n- -an intangible asset in respect of the right to receive payments from public service users amounting to the fair value of the corresponding infrastructure. This asset is amortized over the term of the contract; and/or\n- -a financial receivable in respect of the unconditional right to receive royalties from the public entity, for the fair value of the consideration expected from the public entity. This receivable is recognized at amortized cost.\n\n## Leases\n\nOrange's lease income is related either to its regulatory obligations to lease technical sites to its competitors, to the supply of equipment in certain contracts with business clients, or to the granting of rights of use meeting the criteria for leasing network equipment, i.e. occasional leases of surplus space in certain buildings to third parties.\n\nLease revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract term, except for certain equipment leases to business clients, which are classified as finance leases; in such cases the equipment is considered sold on credit.",

Such measures have helped to partially reduce the risk of non-recovery of trade receivables at December 31, 2020, but reduce visibility of the extent of the expected deterioration of the economic environment (in particular the risk of corporate default).\n\nIn  view  of  the  continuing  uncertainty  surrounding  the  economic environment, the Group has strengthened its monitoring of trade receivables in order to manage and adapt the recovery measures,\n\nwhich were gradually able to resume in 2020 in all customer segments in  accordance  with  local  legislation  (having  been  temporarily suspended during the state of health emergency periods adopted in  each  country)  and  has  sometimes  granted  a  rescheduling  of payment schedules to certain customers.\n\nFor Mobile Financial Services, the effects of the health crisis on bank credit risk are described in Note 17.2.3.\n\nThere is no change compared to December 31, 2019 in Orange's belief that the concentration of counterparty risk related to customer accounts  is  limited  due  to  the  large  number  of  customers,  their diversity (residential, professional and large companies) and their various sectors of the economy, as well as their wide geographic distribution in France and abroad.\n\nThe table below provides an analysis of the change in impairment for trade receivables in the statement of financial position:\n\n| (in millions of euros)                                               | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Allowances on trade receivables - in the opening balance             | (888)  | (816)  | (760)  |\n| IFRS 9 transition impact                                             | -      | -      | (22)   |\n| Allowances on trade receivables - including IFRS 9 transition impact | (888)  | (816)  | (782)  |\n| Net addition with impact on income statement  (1)                    | (383)  | (332)  | (286)  |\n| Losses on trade receivables                                          | 275    | 271    | 255    |\n| Changes in the scope of consolidation                                | 0      | (1)    | (2)    |\n| Translation adjustment                                               | 13     | (5)    | (1)    |\n| Reclassifications and other items                                    | 0      | (5)    | (0)    |\n| Allowances on trade receivables - in the closing balance             | (983)  | (888)  | (816)  |\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nTrade receivables are mainly short-term with no stated interest rate and are measured in the statement of financial position at original invoice amount, in accordance with IFRS 15. Those trade receivables which include deferred payment terms over 12 or 24 months for the benefit of customers buying a mobile telephone are discounted and classified as current items in the statement of financial position. Receivables from financial leases on equipment leased to companies are recognized as current operating receivables because they are acquired in the normal course of business.\n\nIn order to meet the requirements of IFRS 9, the impairment of trade receivables is based on three methods:\n\n- -a collective statistical method: this is based on historical losses and leads to a separate impairment rate for each aging balance category. This analysis is performed over a homogenous group of receivables with similar credit characteristics because they belong to a customer category (B2C, professionals);\n- -a stand-alone method: the assessment of impairment probability and its amount are based on a set of relevant qualitative factors (ageing of late payment, other balances with the counterpart, rating from independent agencies, geographical area). This method is mainly used for carrier customers (national and international), administrations and public authorities, as well as for large business service accounts;\n- -a provisioning method based on anticipated loss: IFRS 9 requires recognition of expected losses on receivables immediately upon recognition of the financial instruments. In addition to the pre-existing provisioning system, the Group applies a simplified",

The rate applied depends on the maximum revenue non-recoverability rate.\n\nIdentification of impairment losses for a group of receivables represents the step preceding identification of impairment for individual receivables. As soon as information is available (clients in bankruptcy or subject to equivalent judicial proceedings), these receivables are then excluded from the statistical impairment database and individually impaired.\n\nThe trade receivables may be part of non-recourse program. When they are sold to consolidated securitization mutual funds, they remain on the statement of financial position. Other sales to financial institutions may lead to their de-recognition in the event that legal ownership and almost all the risks and benefits of the receivables are transferred as described by IFRS 9.\n\n## 5.4 Customer contract net assets and liabilities\n\n| (in millions of euros)                               | December 31,  2020   | December 31,  2019   | December 31,  2018   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| Customer contract net assets  (1)                    | 709                  | 771                  | 784                  |\n| Costs of obtaining a contract                        | 262                  | 258                  | 233                  |\n| Costs to fulfill a contract                          | 265                  | 181                  | 149                  |\n| Total customer contract net assets                   | 1,236                | 1,209                | 1,166                |\n| Prepaid telephone cards                              | (197)                | (212)                | (221)                |\n| Connection fees                                      | (589)                | (665)                | (706)                |\n| Loyalty programs                                     | (25)                 | (38)                 | (38)                 |\n| Other deferred revenue  (2)                          | (1,158)              | (1,163)              | (1,025)              |\n| Other customer contract liabilities                  | (15)                 | (15)                 | (12)                 |\n| Total deferred revenue related to customer contracts | (1,984)              | (2,093)              | (2,002)              |\n| Total customer contract net assets and liabilities   | (748)                | (884)                | (836)                |\n\nThe following tables give an analysis of the balances of customer contract net assets and the costs of acquiring and fulfilling them in the financial statements.\n\n| (in millions of euros)                                | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Customer contract net assets - in the opening balance | 771    | 784    | 815    |\n| Business related variations (1)                       | (60)   | (13)   | (36)   |\n| Changes in the scope of consolidation                 | -      | -      | -      |\n| Translation adjustment                                | (3)    | 1      | (1)    |\n| Reclassifications and other items                     | (0)    | 0      | 6      |\n| Customer contract net assets - in the closing balance | 709    | 771    | 784    |\n\nBelow is presented the change in deferred income on customer contracts (prepaid telephone cards, service access fees, loyalty programs and other unearned income) in the statement of financial position:\n\n| (in millions of euros)                                                  | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Deferred revenue related to customer contracts - in the opening balance | 2,093  | 2,002  | 2,021  |\n| Business related variations                                             | (73)   | (20)   | (18)   |\n| Changes in the scope of consolidation  (1)                              | -      | 101    | 7      |\n| Translation adjustment                                                  | (31)   | 13     | 2      |\n| Reclassifications and other items                                       | (6)    | (3)    | (10)   |\n| Deferred revenue related to customer contracts - in the closing balance | 1,984  | 2,093  | 2,002  |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

This is the case in a bundled offer combining the sale of a mobile phone and mobile communication services for a fixed period, where the mobile phone is invoiced at a reduced price leading to the reallocation of a portion of amounts invoiced for telephone communication services to the supply of the mobile phone. The excess of the amount allocated to the mobile phone over the price invoiced is recognized as a contract asset and transferred to trade receivables as the service is invoiced.\n\nContract assets, like trade receivables, are subject to impairment for credit risk. The recoverability of contract assets is also verified, especially to cover the risk of impairment should the contract be interrupted. Recoverability may also be impacted by a change in the legal environment governing offers.\n\nContract liabilities represent amounts paid by customers to Orange before receiving the goods and/or services promised in the contract. This is typically the case for advances received from customers or amounts invoiced and paid for goods or services not yet transferred, such as contracts payable in advance or prepaid contracts (previously recognized in deferred income).\n\nCustomer contract assets and liabilities are presented, respectively, in current assets and current liabilities since they are a normal part of the Group's operations.\n\n| (in millions of euros)                                 | 2020   |   2019 | 2018   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Costs of obtaining a contract - in the opening balance | 258    |    233 | 250    |\n| Business related variations                            | 11     |     21 | (14)   |\n| Changes in the scope of consolidation                  | -      |      1 | -      |\n| Translation adjustment                                 | (7)    |      1 | (3)    |\n| Reclassifications and other items                      | -      |      1 | 0      |\n| Costs of obtaining a contract - in the closing balance | 262    |    258 | 233    |\n\n| (in millions of euros)                               | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Costs to fulfill a contract - in the opening balance | 181    | 149    | 140    |\n| Business related variations                          | 21     | 30     | 22     |\n| Changes in the scope of consolidation                | -      | -      | -      |\n| Translation adjustment                               | (12)   | 2      | 3      |\n| Reclassifications and other items (1)                | 75     | -      | (16)   |\n| Costs to fulfill a contract - in the closing balance | 265    | 181    | 149    |\n\n- (1) Mainly includes reclassifications from prepaid expenses to contract fulfilment costs.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\n## Cost of obtaining a contract\n\nWhere a telecommunication service contract is signed via a third-party distributor, this distributor may receive business provider r e m u n e r a t i o n ,  g e n e r a l l y  p a i d  i n  t h e  f o r m  o f  a  c o m m i s s i o n  f o r  e a c h  c o n t r a c t  o r  i n v o i c e - i n d e x e d  c o m m i s s i o n .

It should be noted that the Group has adopted the simplification measure authorized by IFRS 15 to recognize the costs of obtaining contracts as an expense at the time they are incurred if the amortization period of the asset that the Group would have recognized in respect of them, does not exceed one year.\n\nThe costs of obtaining fixed-period mobile service contracts are capitalized and recognized prorata temporis over the enforceable period of the contract, as these costs are generally incurred each time a customer renews the fixed period. The costs of obtaining fixed-line contracts for a pre-determined term for B2C market customers are expensed prorata temporis over the estimated period of the customer relationship. The costs of obtaining B2B and operator solution contracts are not material.\n\n## Costs to fulfill a contract\n\nContract fulfillment costs consist of all the initial contractual costs necessary to fulfill one or more performance obligations of a contract. These costs, when they are directly related to a contract, are capitalized and recognized prorata temporis over the enforceable period of the contract.\n\nAt Group level, these costs mainly concern contracts for business clients, with, for example, design, installation, connection and migration fees that relate to a future performance obligation of the contract.\n\nThe assumptions underlying the period over which the costs of fulfilling a contract are expensed are periodically reviewed and adjusted in line with observations; termination of the contractual relationship with the customer results in the immediate expensing of the remaining deferred costs.

These contracts are primarily monthly service contracts.\n\nIn addition, certain contracts offer customers the ability to purchase additional services. These additional services are not included in the transaction price and are recognized when the customer exercises the option (generally on a monthly basis). They are not therefore included in unfulfilled performance obligations.\n\nSome multi-year service contracts with B2B and operator customers include fixed monthly costs and variable user fees.

Regulations state that EMIs, as last-resort guarantors for the reimbursement of e-money holders, are obliged to restrict the funds collected in exchange for the issue of e-money (obligation to protect holders). The e-money distribution model relies on Orange's subsidiaries and third-party distributors. EMIs issue e-money (or units of value 'UV') at the request of these distributors in exchange for funds collected therefrom. The distributors then transfer the e-money to end holders.\n\nWithin the Orange group, this restriction includes the protection of third-party holders (distributors and customers).\n\nThese transactions have no impact on the Group's net financial debt and are listed under the following headings:\n\n- -assets restricted to an amount equal to the e-money in circulation outside of the Orange group (or UV in circulation);\n- -UV in circulation under liabilities, representing the obligation to reimburse the third-party holders (customers and third-party distributors).\n\nThese two headings are presented under 'other assets' and 'other liabilities' and under operating activities as 'change in working capital requirement'.\n\n## 5.7 Related party transactions\n\nThe French State, either directly or through Bpifrance Participations, is one of the main shareholders of Orange SA.

The Group's significant litigations are described in Note 18.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\n## Litigation\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Group is involved in a number of legal and arbitration proceedings and administrative actions described in Note 18.\n\nThe costs which may result from these proceedings are accrued at the reporting date if the Group has a present obligation towards a third party resulting from a past event and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and the amount of that liability can be quantified or estimated within a reasonable range. The amount of provision recorded is based on a case-by-case assessment of the risk level, and events arising during the course of legal proceedings may require a reassessment of this risk. Where appropriate, litigation cases may be analyzed as contingent liabilities, which correspond to:\n\n- -probable obligations arising from past events that are not recognized because their existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the Company's control; or\n- -present obligations arising from past events that are not recognized because it is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation or because the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.\n\n## Acquisition and integration costs\n\nAcquisition and integration costs are incurred at the time of acquisition of legal entities (costs linked to the acquisition of the entity, consultancy fees, training costs for new staff, migration costs associated with customer offers, labor expenses associated with the transition). They are incurred over a maximum period of 12 months following the acquisition date.\n\n## 6.3 Restructuring and integration costs\n\n| (in millions of euros)                 | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   |\n|----------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Restructuring costs                    | (25)   | (132)  | (189)  |\n| Departure plans  (1)                   | (15)   | (68)   | (30)   |\n| Lease property restructuring  (2)      | 2      | 5      | (28)   |\n| Distribution channels  (3)             | (5)    | (26)   | (11)   |\n| Other                                  | (8)    | (43)   | (120)  |\n| Acquisition and integration costs  (4) | -      | -      | (10)   |\n| Acquisition costs of investments       | -      | -      | (10)   |\n| Total restructuring costs              | (25)   | (132)  | (199)  |\n\n- (2) Essentially related to vacant leases in France.\n- (3) Essentially concerns the costs related to the end of the relationship with some distributors.",

They include those that have been financed by the supplier (with or without notification of transfer to financial institutions) under direct or reverse factoring, and those for which the supplier proposed an extended payment period to Orange and for which Orange confirmed the payment arrangement under the agreed terms. Orange considers these financial liabilities to carry the characteristics of trade payables, in particular due to the ongoing trade relationship, the payment schedules ultimately consistent with the operational cycle of a telecommunications operator in particular for the purchase of primary infrastructures, the supplier's autonomy in the anticipated relationship and a financial cost borne by Orange that corresponds to the compensation of the supplier for the extended payment schedule agreed.\n\nFor payables without specified interest rates, they are measured at nominal value if the interest component is negligible. For interest bearing payables, the measurement is at amortized cost.\n\nDecember 31,\n\n2020\n\nDecember 31,\n\n2019\n\nDecember 31,\n\n2018",

In France, civil servants employed by Orange SA are  covered  by  the  French  government  sponsored  civil  and military pension plan. Orange SA's obligation under the plan is limited to the payment of annual contributions (French law No. 96-660 dated July 26, 1996). Consequently, Orange SA has no obligation to fund future deficits of the pension plans covering its own civil servant employees or any other civil service plans. Expenses recognized under the terms of defined contribution pension plans amounted to (729) million euros in 2020 ((724) million euros in 2019 and (828) million euros in 2018);\n- -the Group is committed to a limited number of annuity-based defined-benefit plans : notably the Equant plans in the United Kingdom for 326 million euros and a plan for senior management staff in France for 196 million euros. Plan assets were transferred to these plans in the United Kingdom and in France. A few years ago, these plans were closed to new subscribers and also closed in the United Kingdom with regard to the acquisition of rights;\n- -the Group is also committed to capital-based defined benefit plans w h e r e ,  i n  a c c o r d a n c e  w i t h  t h e  l a w  o r  c o n t r a c t u a l  a g r e e m e n t s , employees are entitled to bonuses on retirement, depending on their years of service and end of career salary; this essentially relates to bonuses due upon retirement in France, particularly for employees under private-law contracts (909 million euros for Orange SA, equal to 84% of the capital-based plans) and for civil servants (27 million euros, equal to 3% of capital-based plans);\n\n- -other post-employment benefits are also granted to retired employees: these are benefits other than defined-benefit and defined-contribution plans;\n- -other long-term benefits may also be granted such as seniority awards, long-term compensated absences and French par t-time for seniors plans (TPS) detailed below.\n\n## French part-time for seniors plans\n\nThe part-time for seniors plans are accessible to civil servants and employees under private contract from the French entities who are eligible for full retirement benefits within 3 to 5 years and who have at least 15 years service within the Group. Eligible employees are those who will retire no later than January 1, 2025.\n\nThese plans give employees the opportunity to work 50% or 60% of a full-time job whilst receiving:\n\n- -a base salary between 65% and 80% of full-time employment;\n- -the  retirement  entitlement  benefits  of  full-time  employment during  the  period  in  question  (both  the  Company's  and  the employee's contributions);\n- -a minimum salary level.\n\nThese plans last for a period of at least 18 months and no longer than five years.\n\nThe beneficiaries may decide to invest part of their base compensation (5%, 10% or 15%) in a Time Savings Account (CET), with an additional Group contribution. The CET allows for a reduction in the amount of time worked.\n\nAt December 31, 2020 33,000 employees had signed up for TPS, 26,100 of  whom have already passed through it. The number of employees who are or will be participating in the French part-time for seniors plans and thus included in the provision, is estimated approximately at 9,950 employees.",

'Wage  drift  -  Seniority  -  Job-skills' refers to annual change in total payroll costs independent of general or  categorical  increases  in  wages  and  salaries,  due  to  in-grade promotions, out of grade promotions and the aging of existing staff.\n\nThe  impacts  on  pension  benefit  obligations  of  changes  in  key assumptions would be as follows:\n\nRate increase by 50 points\n\nRate decrease by 50 points\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRate decrease by 5%\n\nRate increase by 5%\n\n- 3\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3",

Its computation is based on external indices commonly used as reference for the Eurozone,\n- -actuarial gains and losses on post-employment benefits are fully recorded in other comprehensive income,\n- -the Group's defined benefit plans are generally not financed. In the rare cases where they are, hedging plan assets are set up by employer and employee contributions which are managed by separate legal entities whose investments are subject to fl u c t u a t i o n s  i n  t h e  fi n a n c i a l  m a r k e t s .  T h e s e  e n t i t i e s  a r e  g e n e r a l l y  a d m i n i s t r a t e d  b y  j o i n t  c o m m i t t e e s  c o m p r i s i n g  r e p r e s e n t a t i v e s of the Group and of the beneficiaries. Each committee adopts its own investment strategy which is designed to strike the optimum strategies to match assets and liabilities, based on specific studies performed by external experts. It is generally carried out by fund managers selected by the committees and depends on the market opportunities. Assets are measured at fair value, determined by reference to quoted prices, since they are mostly invested in listed securities (primarily shares and bonds) and the use of other asset categories is limited.\n\nOther long-term benefits may be granted such as seniority awards, long-term compensated absences and French part-time for seniors plan (TPS) agreements. The calculation of the related commitments is based on actuarial assumptions (including demographic, financial and discounting assumptions) similar to those relating to post-employment benefits. The relevant actuarial gains and losses are recognized in profit or loss when they arise.\n\nTermination benefits are subject to provisions (up to the related obligation). For all commitments where termination of employment contracts would trigger payment of an indemnity, actuarial gains and losses are recognized in profit or loss for the period when modifications take place.\n\n## 7.3 Share-based payment\n\n## Free share award plans in force at December 31, 2020\n\nThe Board of Directors approved the implementation of free share award plans (Long Term Incentive Plan - LTIP) reserved for the Executive Committee, Corporate Officers, and Senior Management holding the positions of 'Executives' and 'Leaders'.\n\n## Main characteristics\n\n|                                                     | LTIP 2020 - 2022   | LTIP 2019 - 2021   | LTIP 2018 - 2020   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| Implementation date by the Board of Directors       | July 29, 2020      | July 24, 2019      | July 25, 2018      |\n| Number of free share units  (1)                     | 1.7 million        | 1.7 million        | 1.7 million        |\n| Estimated number of beneficiaries                   | 1,300              | 1,200              | 1,200              |\n| Acquisition date of the rights by the beneficiaries | December 31, 2022  | December 31, 2021  | December 31, 2020  |\n| Delivery date of the shares to the beneficiaries    | March 31, 2023     | March 31, 2022     | March 31, 2021     |\n\n- (1) In countries where the regulations, tax codes or labor laws do not permit awards of stock, the beneficiaries of the plan will receive a cash value based on the exchange-traded price of Orange stock at the delivery date of the shares.\n\nCondition of continued employment\n\nThe allocation of rights to beneficiaries is subject to a condition of continued employment:\n\n| Assessment of the employment continuation   | LTIP 2020 - 2022                          | LTIP 2019 - 2021                          | LTIP 2018 - 2020                          |\n|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| Assessment of the employment continuation   | From January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2022 | From January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2021 | From January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2020 |\n\n## Performance conditions\n\nDepending on the plans, the allocation of rights to beneficiaries is subject  to  the  achievement  of  internal  and  external  performance conditions, namely:\n\n- -the organic cash flow from telecom activities internal performance condition, as defined in the plan regulations, assessed (i) annually against the budget for the LTIP 2019-2021 and 2018-2020, and\n\n(ii) at the end of the three years of the plan against the objective set by the Board of Directors for the LTIP 2020-2022;\n\n- -the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) internal performance condition, half of which relates to the change in the level of CO2 per customer use and half to the Group's renewable electricity rate, assessed at the end of the three years of the plan in relation to the objectives set by the Board of Directors;",

The net carrying value of tested assets was brought down to the value in use of current and long-term assets at 100% at December 31, 2019 (0.8 billion euros).\n\nIn  Egypt,  the  reversal  of  89  million  euros  of  impairment  on  fixed assets primarily reflected an improvement in the country's economic situation (see Note 9.3).\n\n## At December 31, 2018\n\nI n  J o r d a n ,  t h e  5 6  m i l l i o n  e u r o s  i m p a i r m e n t  o f  g o o d w i l l  m o s t l y  r e fl e c t e d the effects of an uncertain political and economic climate and heavy competitive pressure on the fixed and mobile data markets.

The economic and financial position of the Company led it, as a precaution, to recognize a fixed-asset impairment in the amount of 43 million euros to cover Orange's exposure using our best current estimation.\n\nOfficer, has no employment contract, and the employment contracts of Deputy CEOs were suspended on the date of their appointment as corporate officers.

In this respect, the review of expectations could affect the margin of recoverable amounts over the carrying value tested (see Note 8.4) and result in impairment losses on goodwill and fixed assets.\n\nIn  2020,  the  Group  updated  its  financial  trajectories.  The  entire strategic plan will be updated in 2021.\n\nThe discount rates and growth rates to perpetuity used to determine the values in use were revised as follows at the end of December 2020:\n\n- -the discount rates, which may incorporate a specific premium reflecting  an  assessment  of  the  performance  risks  of  certain business  plans  or  country  risks,  experienced  the  following changes:\n\n- -a f a l l  i n  E u r o p e  d u e ,  o n  t h e  o n e  h a n d ,  t o  i n t e r e s t  r a t e s  l o w e r e d by central banks in response to the crisis, and on the other hand, a fall in betas due to the minimal reaction of European telecom operators to changes in the indices,\n- -an  increase  in  the  Africa  and  Middle  East  region,  where country risk premiums tend to increase as investors seek lower risk;\n- -perpetual growth rates increased slightly in the Africa and Middle East  region,  returning  to  the  rates  used  in  December  2018. In  Europe,  perpetual  growth  rates  were  maintained  in  most r e g i o n s ,  w i t h  t h e  a s s e s s m e n t  m a d e  a t  t h e  e n d  o f  D e c e m b e r  2 0 2 0 concluding  that  the  effects  of  the  economic  situation  would not lead to any change in the long-term outlook of the service markets offered by the Group.\n\nAt December 31, 2020, business plans and key operating assumptions were sensitive to the following:\n\n- -the consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic: a slowdown in sales activity,  a  decline  in  roaming  and  equipment sales and",

the Group operates, where price pressure is strong, particularly in Spain;\n- -the Group's ability to adjust costs and capital expenditure to changes in revenue;\n\n- -specifically in the Middle East

Cash flow for the terminal year forming a significant part of the recoverable amount, a change of plus or minus 10% in these cash flows is presented as a sensitivity assumption.\n\nCash flow is cash provided by operating activities net of acquisitions and disposals of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets (including tax at a standard rate, repayment of lease liabilities and\n\nIncrease in discount rate in order for the recoverable amount to be equal to the net carrying value\n\n(in basis points)\n\ndebts  related  to  financed  assets,  related  interest  expenses  and excluding other interest expenses).\n\nA  sensitivity  analysis  was  carried  out  on  the  main  consolidated activities or the activities most sensitive to the assumptions of the impairment tests and is presented below to enable readers of the financial statements to estimate the effects of their own estimates.

Sensitivity  analyzes,  calculated  on  cash  flows and financial parameters, are therefore not relevant for these CGUs at December 31, 2020. A change of one euro in the reference price per share used to calculate the fair value of the Belgium/Luxembourg entity would have an effect on the recoverable amount of 0.1 billion euros.\n\nAt December 31, 2020, the value in use of the Spain CGU was revised based on the key valuation assumptions established by the new local governance. This valuation exercise was carried out in a particularly competitive market, marked by an erosion in average revenue per user and the effects of the current health crisis. The revision of the assumptions resulted in a value in use equal to the carrying value of the assets tested, without however requiring any impairment.\n\nA sensitivity analysis was carried out on each of the following criteria, taken individually:\n\n- -increase of 1% in the discount rate;\n- -decrease of 1% in the perpetual growth rate;\n- -decrease of 10% in cash flow in the terminal year.\n\nThis sensitivity analysis revealed a risk of impairment estimated at between 15% and 30% of the net value of goodwill according to the criteria retained taken individually.\n\nThe same analysis was carried out on:\n\n- -Romania and identified a risk of impairment of up to 15% of the net value of goodwill;\n- -J ordan  and  revealed  an  impairment  risk  estimated  at approximately 20% of the net value of goodwill.\n\nThe other entities not listed above, with the exception of the Orange brand, presented in Note 9.3, each account for less than 3% of the recoverable amount of the consolidated entities.",

        "page_content": "## Accounting policies\n\nGoodwill recognized as an asset in the statement of financial position comprises the excess calculated:\n\n- -either on the basis of the equity interest acquired (and for business combinations after January 1, 2010, with no subsequent changes for any additional purchases of non-controlling interests); or\n- -on a 100% basis, leading to the recognition of goodwill relating to non-controlling interests.\n\nGoodwill is not amortized. It is tested for impairment at least annually and more frequently when there is an indication that it may be impaired. Thus, changes in general economic and financial trends, the different levels of resilience of the telecommunication operators with respect to the deterioration of local economic environments, changes in the market capitalization of telecommunication operators, as well as financial performance compared to market expectations represent external impairment indicators that are analyzed by the Group, together with internal performance indicators, in order to assess whether an impairment test should be performed more than once a year.\n\nThese tests are performed at the level of each Cash-Generating Unit (CGU) (or group of CGUs). These generally correspond to business segments or to each country in the Africa and Middle East region and Europe. This is reviewed if the Group changes the level at which it monitors return on investment for goodwill testing purposes.\n\nTo determine whether an impairment loss should be recognized, the carrying value of the assets and liabilities of the CGUs or groups of CGUs is compared to their recoverable amount, for which Orange uses mostly the value in use.\n\nValue in use is estimated as the present value of the expected future cash flows. Cash flow projections are based on economic and regulatory assumptions, license renewal assumptions and sales activity and investment forecasts drawn up by the Group's management, as follows:\n\n- -cash flow projections are based on three-to-five-year business plans and include a tax cash flow calculated as EBIT (operating income) multiplied by the statutory tax rate (excluding the impact of deferred tax and unrecognized tax loss carryforwards at the date of valuation). In the case of recent acquisitions, longer-term business plans may be used;\n- -post-tax cash flow projections beyond that timeframe may be extrapolated by applying a declining or flat growth rate for the next year, and then a perpetual growth rate reflecting the expected long-term growth in the market;\n- -post-tax cash flows are subject to a post-tax discount rate, using rates which incorporate a relevant premium reflecting a risk assessment for the implementation of certain business plans or country risks. The value in use derived from these calculations is identical to the one that would result from discounting pre-tax cash flows at pre-tax discount rates.\n\nThe key operating assumptions used to determine the value in use are common across Group's business segments. Key assumptions for most CGUs include:\n\n- -key  revenue  assumptions,  which  reflect  market  level,  penetration  rate  of  the  offers  and  market  share,  positioning  of  the competition's offers and their potential impact on market price levels and their transposition to the Group's offer bases, regulatory authority decisions on pricing of services to customers and on access and pricing of inter-operator services, technology migration of networks (e.g. extinction of copper local loops), decisions of competition authorities in terms of concentration or regulation of adjacent sectors such as cable;\n- -key cost assumptions, on the level of marketing expenses required to deal with the pace of product line renewals and the positioning of the competition, the ability to adjust costs to potential changes in revenues or the effects of natural attrition and employee departure plans underway;\n- -key assumptions on the level of capital expenditure, which may be affected by the rollout of new technologies, by decisions of regulatory authorities relating to licenses and spectrum allocation, deployment of fiber networks, mobile network coverage, sharing of network elements or obligations to open up networks to competitors.\n\nTested net carrying values include goodwill, land and assets with finite useful lives (property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and net working capital requirements including intra-group balances). The Orange brand, an asset with an indefinite useful life, is subject to a specific test, see Note 9.3.\n\nIf an entity partially owned by the Group includes goodwill attributable to non-controlling interests, the impairment loss is allocated between the shareholders of Orange SA and the non-controlling interests on the same basis as that on which profit or loss is allocated (i.e. ownership interest).\n\nImpairment loss for goodwill is recorded definitively in operating income.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

Its recoverable amount is assessed based on the expected contractual royalties (and included in the business plan) discounted in perpetuity, less the costs attributable to the brand's owner.\n\n## 9.4 Other intangible assets\n\n| (in millions of euros)      | December 31, 2020   | December 31, 2020                                        | December 31, 2020       | December 31, 2020   | December 31,  2019   | December 31,  2018   |\n|-----------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n|                             |                     | Gross value Accumulated  depreciation  and  amortization | Accumulated  impairment | Net book  value     | Net book  value      | Net book   value     |\n| Telecommunications licenses | 12,168              | (5,800)                                                  | (46)                    | 6,322               | 6,043                | 5,917                |\n| Software                    | 13,149              | (8,842)                                                  | (19)                    | 4,288               | 4,250                | 4,046                |\n| Orange brand                | 3,133               | -                                                        | -                       | 3,133               | 3,133                | 3,133                |\n| Other brands                | 1,099               | (121)                                                    | (899)                   | 78                  | 88                   | 89                   |\n| Customer bases              | 5,265               | (4,785)                                                  | (11)                    | 469                 | 597                  | 449                  |\n| Other intangible assets     | 2,564               | (1,543)                                                  | (177)                   | 844                 | 626                  | 439                  |\n| Total                       | 37,378              | (21,090)                                                 | (1,152)                 | 15,135              | 14,737               | 14,073               |\n\n| (in millions of euros)                                             | 2020    | 2019    | 2018    |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Net book value of other intangible assets - in the opening balance | 14,737  | 14,073  | 14,339  |\n| Acquisitions of other intangible assets                            | 2,935   | 2,385   | 1,895   |\n| o/w telecommunications licenses (1)                                | 969     | 519     | 200     |\n| Impact of changes in the scope of consolidation (2)                | 31      | 328     | 69      |\n| Disposals                                                          | (4)     | (10)    | (0)     |\n| Depreciation and amortization                                      | (2,309) | (2,286) | (2,256) |\n| Impairment (3)                                                     | (24)    | 88      | (10)    |\n| Translation adjustment                                             | (176)   | 106     | 7       |\n| Reclassifications and other items                                  | (55)    | 52      | 29      |\n| Net book value of other intangible assets - in the closing balance | 15,135  | 14,737  | 14,073  |\n\n## Internal costs capitalized as intangible assets\n\nInternal costs capitalized as intangible assets relate to labor expenses and amounted to 405 million euros in 2020, 389 million euros in 2019 and 382 million euros in 2018.",

        "page_content": "## Accounting policies\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are made up of tangible fixed assets and financed assets. They mainly comprise network facilities and equipment.\n\nThe gross value of property, plants and equipment is made up of their acquisition or production cost, which includes study and construction fees as well as enhancement costs that increase the capacity of equipment and facilities. Maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred, except where they serve to increase the asset's productivity or extend its useful life.\n\nThe cost of property, plant and equipment also includes the estimated cost of dismantling, removing and restoring the site occupied due to the obligation incurred by the Group.\n\nThe roll-out of assets by stage, especially for network assets, in the Group's assessment, does not generally require a substantial period of preparation. As a result, the Group does not generally capitalize the interest expense incurred during the construction and acquisition phase for its property, plant and equipment and intangible assets.\n\nIn France, the regulatory framework governing the optical fiber network roll-out (Fiber To The Home - FTTH) organizes the access by commercial operators to the last mile of networks rolled-out by another operator on a co-funding basis (ab initio or a posteriori) or through a line access. The sharing of rights and obligations between the various operators co-financing the terminal section of networks is classified as a joint operation in accordance with IFRS 11 'Partnerships': Orange only recognizes as an asset its share of the network assets self-built or purchased to other co-financing operators.\n\nThe Group has entered into network sharing arrangements with other mobile operators on a reciprocal basis, which may cover passive infrastructure sharing, active equipment or even spectrum.\n\nAs a reminder, before applying IFRS 16, the accounting principles related to the assets acquired in form of finance lease and in operating lease were the following:\n\nThe assets acquired in form of finance lease did not affect the cash flow on acquisition. However, the subsequent rental payments during the leasing period represented interest payments (cash flow on operating activities) and capital repayments (cash flow on financing activities).\n\nThe majority of the assets held under finance lease were office and network buildings. The land and buildings hosting radio sites could belong to the Group, or be held through a finance lease, or be available under an operating lease or be simply made available.\n\nThe lease agreements of office buildings and points of sale generally were qualified as operating leases and the future lease payments were disclosed as unrecognized contractual commitments.\n\nSimultaneously the equipment, very often generic, of which the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred from the Group to third parties via a lease, was considered as sold.\n\n## 9.6 Fixed assets payables\n\n| (in millions of euros)                      | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   |\n|---------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Fixed assets payable in the opening balance | 3,665  | 3,447  | 3,656  |\n| Business related variations  (1)            | 1,002  | 200    | (230)  |\n| Changes in the scope of consolidation       | (0)    | (14)   | 0      |\n| Translation adjustment                      | (50)   | 29     | 8      |\n| Reclassifications and other items           | 23     | 3      | 13     |\n| Fixed assets payable in the closing balance | 4,640  | 3,665  | 3,447  |\n| o/w long-term fixed assets payable          | 1,291  | 817    | 612    |\n| o/w short-term fixed assets payable         | 3,349  | 2,848  | 2,835  |\n\n- (1) Includes 725 million euros in 2020 for the acquisition of the 5G license in France.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nThese payables are generated from trading activities. The payment terms can be over several years in the case of infrastructure roll-out and license acquisition. The payables due in more than 12 months are presented in non-current items. For payables without specified interest rates, they are measured at nominal value if the interest component is immaterial. For interest bearing payables, the measurement is at amortized cost.\n\nTrade payables also include those that the supplier may have sold with or without notifying financial institutions in a direct or reverse factoring arrangement (see Note 6.6).\n\nFirm purchase commitments are disclosed as unrecognized contractual commitments (see Note 16), net of any prepayment, which are recognized as prepayment on fixed assets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

The provision is assessed on the basis of the identified costs for the current fiscal year, extrapolated for future years using the best estimate of the commitment settlement. This estimate is revised annually and adjusted where appropriate against the asset to which it relates. The provision is present-discounted at a rate set by geographical area and equal to the average rate of risk-free investments in 15-year State bonds.\n\nIn case of extinguishment of the obligation, the provision is reversed in compensation for the net carrying value of the dismantling asset and of the net carrying value of the underlying assets if the dismantling asset is less than the reversal of the provision.\n\n## Note 10   Lease agreements\n\nIn the course of its activities, the Group regularly enters into leases as a lessee. These leases concern the following asset categories:\n\n- -Land and buildings;\n- -N etworks and terminals;\n- -IT equipment;\n- -O t h e r .\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nThe  main  accounting  positions  relating  to  the  IFRS  IC  Committee's  decision  published  in  December  2019  on  the  terms  of IFRS 16 leases are set out in Note 2.3.1.\n\nAs a reminder, the new IFRS 16 'Leases' has been mandatory since January 1, 2019.\n\nThe main effects of the implementation of IFRS 16 compared to the principles previously applied under IAS 17 (former standard) relate to the recognition of leases as lessee (see effects on the financial statements presented in Note 2.3.1). IFRS 16, which defines a lease as a contract that confers to the lessee the right to control the use of an identified asset, significantly changes the recognition of these contracts in the financial statements. Lease recognition rules for lessors are unchanged compared with IAS 17.\n\nAll leases are recognized in the balance sheet as an asset reflecting the right to use the leased assets and a corresponding liability reflecting the related lease liabilities (see Notes 10.1 and 10.2). In the consolidated income statement, depreciation of right-of-use assets (see Note 10.1) is presented separately from the interest expenses on lease liabilities. In the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash outflows relating to interest expenses impact operating cash flows, while repayments of the lease liability impact financing cash flows.\n\nOn first-time application, the Group adopted the simplified retrospective method and applied the following authorized practical expedients:\n\n- -the exclusion of initial direct costs from the measurement of the right-of-use asset at the date of first-time application;\n- -the identical classification of asset and liability balances for finance leases identified under IAS 17 in right-of-use assets and lease liabilities as provided for in the standard;",

        "page_content": "- -the inclusion in the opening balance sheet of provisions for onerous contracts measured at December 31, 2018 pursuant to IAS 37, as an alternative to impairment testing of right-of-use assets in the opening balance sheet. Rent expenses already provisioned are presented in impairment of right-of-use assets.\n\nWhen the Group carries out a transaction qualified as sale and leaseback in accordance with IFRS 16, a right-of-use asset is recognized in proportion to the previous carrying value of the asset corresponding to the right-of-use asset retained as counterparty to a lease liability. A gain (or loss) on disposal of fixed assets is recognized in the income statement in proportion to the rights transferred to the buyer-lessor. The adjustment of the gain (or loss) on disposal recognized in the income statement for the share on which the Group retains its user rights via the lease relates to the difference between the right-of-use asset and the lease liability recognized in the balance sheet.\n\nFinally, the Group applies the two exemptions provided for in IFRS 16, concerning leases with a term of 12 months or less and leases where the value, when new, of the underlying asset is less than approximately 5,000 euros. Leases covered by either of these exemptions are presented in off-balance sheet commitments and an expense is recognized in external purchases in the consolidated income statement.\n\nThe Group classifies as a lease a contract that confers to the lessee the right to control the use of an identified asset for a given period, including a service contract if it contains a lease component.\n\nThe Group has defined four major categories of leases:\n\n- -land and buildings: these leases mainly concern commercial (point of sale) or service activity (office and head office) leases, as well as leases of technical buildings not owned by the Group. Real estate leases entered into in France generally have long terms (nine-year commercial leases with early termination options after three and six years, known as '3/6/9 leases') (see Note 10.2). However, depending on the geographical location of the leases, their legal term may vary and the Group may be required to adopt a specific enforceable period taking into account the local legal and economic environment;\n- -networks and terminals: the Group is required to lease a certain number of assets in connection with its mobile activities. This is notably the case of land on which to install antennas, mobile sites leased to third-party operators and certain 'TowerCos' contracts (companies operating telecom towers). Leases are also entered into as part of fixed-line network activities. These leases mainly concern access to the local loop where the Orange group is a market challenger (total or partial unbundling), as well as the lease of land transmission cables;\n- -IT equipment: this asset category primarily comprises the lease of servers and hosting space in Data centers;\n- -other: this asset category primarily comprises the lease of vehicles and technical equipment.\n\n## 10.1 Right-of-use assets\n\n| (in millions of euros)    | December 31, 2020   | December 31, 2020                            | December 31, 2020       | December 31, 2020   | December 31,  2019 (1)   |\n|---------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|\n|                           | Gross value         | Accumulated  depreciation  and  amortization | Accumulated  impairment | Net book value      | Net book  value          |\n| Land and buildings        | 7,035               | (1,937)                                      | (233)                   | 4,865               | 4,959                    |\n| Networks and terminals    | 2,540               | (609)                                        | -                       | 1,931               | 1,524                    |\n| IT equipment              | 120                 | (90)                                         | (0)                     | 30                  | 29                       |\n| Other right-of-use        | 304                 | (121)                                        | (0)                     | 184                 | 188                      |\n| Total right-of-use assets | 9,999               | (2,757)                                      | (233)                   | 7,009               | 6,700                    |\n\n- (1) 2019 figures have been restated of the IFRS IC decision on lease term (see Note 2.3.1).\n\n| (in millions of euros)                                         | 2020    | 2019 (1)   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|---------|------------|\n| Net book value of right-of-use assets - in the opening balance | 6,700   | 6,790      |\n| Increase (new right-of-use assets)                             | 1,529   | 1,014      |\n| Impact of changes in the scope of consolidation                | 1       | 18         |\n| Depreciation and amortization  (2)                             | (1,384) | (1,274)    |\n| Impairment (3)                                                 | (57)    | (33)       |\n| Impact of changes in the assessments                           | 331     | 187        |\n| Translation adjustment                                         | (104)   | 26         |\n| Reclassifications and other items                              | (7)     | (28)       |\n| Net book value of right-of-use assets - in the closing balance | 7,009   | 6,700      |\n\n- (1) 2019 figures have been restated of the IFRS IC decision on lease term (see Note 2.3.1).\n- (2) Including in 2020, right-of-use assets depreciation and amortization expenses of land and buildings for (947) million euros, networks and terminals for (358) million euros, IT equipment for (13) million euros and other right-of-use assets for (65) million euros.

It includes lease payments on contracts of\n\n12 months or less, contracts where the new value of the underlying asset is less than 5,000 euros, and variable lease payments which were not figured into the measurement of the lease liability.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nA right-of use is recognized as an asset, with a corresponding lease liability (see Note 10.2). This right-of-use asset is equal to the amount of the lease liability, plus any direct costs incurred under certain leases such as fees, lease negotiation expenses or administration costs and less rent-free period liabilities and lessor financial contributions.\n\nWork performed by the lessee and modifications to the leased asset, as well as guarantee deposits, are not components of the right-of-use asset and are recognized in accordance with other standards.\n\nFinally, the right-of-use asset is amortized in the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term adopted by the Group.\n\n## 10.2 Lease liabilities\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, lease liabilities amount to 7,371 million euros, including non-current lease liabilities of 5,875 million euros and current lease liabilities of 1,496 million euros.\n\n| (in millions of euros)                                  | 2020    | 2019 (1)   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|---------|------------|\n| Lease liabilities - in the opening balance              | 6,932   | 6,531      |\n| Increase with counterpart in right of use               | 1,582   | 1,580      |\n| Impact of changes in the scope of consolidation         | 1       | 18         |\n| Decrease in lease liabilities following rental payments | (1,400) | (1,429)    |\n| Impact of changes in the assessments                    | 326     | 187        |\n| Translation adjustment                                  | (96)    | 24         |\n| Reclassifications and other items                       | 26      | 21         |\n| Lease liabilities - in the closing balance              | 7,371   | 6,932      |\n\n- (1) 2019 figures have been restated of the IFRS IC decision on lease term (see Note 2.3.1).\n\nThe following table details the undiscounted future cash flows of lease liabilities:\n\n| (in millions of euros)         | December 31,  2020   | 2021   | 2022   | 2023   |   2024 |   2025 | 2026 and  beyond   |\n|--------------------------------|----------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------------------|\n| Undiscounted lease liabilities | 8,025                | 1,581  | 1,273  | 1,047  |    879 |    763 | 2,482              |\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nThe Group recognizes a liability (i.e. a lease liability) at the date the underlying asset is made available. This lease liability is equal to the present value of fixed and in-substance fixed payments not paid at that date, plus any amounts that Orange is reasonably certain to pay at the end of the lease, such as the exercise price of a purchase option (where it is reasonably certain to be exercised), or penalties payable to the lessor for terminating the lease (where such termination option is reasonably certain to be exercised).\n\nThe Group only takes the lease component into account when measuring the lease liability. For certain asset classes where leases include both service and lease components, the Group may recognize a single contract, classified as a lease (i.e. without distinguishing between the service and lease components).\n\nOrange systematically determines the lease term as the period during which leases cannot be canceled, plus periods covered by any extension options that the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise and by any termination options that the lessee is reasonably certain not to exercise. In the case of '3/6/9' leases in France, the term adopted is assessed on a contract-by-contract basis.\n\nThis period is also defined taking into account any laws and practices specific to each jurisdiction and business sector regarding the  firm  lease  commitment term granted by lessors. The Group nonetheless assesses the enforceable period, based on the circumstances of each lease, taking into account certain indicators such as the existence of more than insignificant penalties in the event of termination by the lessee. To determine the length of this enforceable period, the Group considers the economic importance of the leased asset and the assumptions made in its strategic plan.\n\nWhen non-removable leasehold improvements have been made to leased assets, the Group assesses, on a case-by-case basis, whether these improvements provide an economic benefit when determining the enforceable period of the lease.\n\nWhen a lease includes a purchase option, the Group considers the enforceable period to be equal to the useful life of the underlying asset where the Group is reasonably certain to exercise the purchase option.\n\nFor e a c h  l e a s e ,  t h e  d i s c o u n t  r a t e  u s e d  i s  d e t e r m i n e d  b a s e d  o n  t h e  y i e l d  r a t e  o n  g o v e r n m e n t  b o n d s  i n  t h e  l e s s e e  c o u n t r y,  i n  a c c o r d a n c e with the lease term and currency, to which the Group's credit spread is added.\n\nAfter the lease commencement date, the amount of the lease liability may be reassessed to reflect changes introduced in the following main cases:",

Since then, some municipalities sent out ta x bil l s i n a c c o r d a n c e  w i t h  s u c h  S u p r e m e Court  sentence.  In  2018,  Orange  has  re-evaluated  the  risk in  light  of  the  course  of  the  proceedings.  There  are  no  new\n\ndevelopments in 2020 that would lead to a modification of the Group's accounting position, Orange is awaiting the decision of t h e  S u p r e m e  C o u r t  o n  t h e  f o r m u l a e  t h a t  s h a l l  b e  u s e d  t o  c a l c u l a t e the value of the use;\n\n- -regarding fixed services, Orange received a favorable decision from the municipality of Madrid in June 2020 and carried out a new risk assessment in light of the decision. In January 2021, the European Union Court of Justice, in response to an interpretative question raised, has ruled on the charge on fixed services. At this stage, Orange estimates that it holds a strong position and that the decision does not lead to a modification of its accounting position.

Collections and repayments to states have no impact on the income statement.\n\nIn the normal course of business, the Group regularly deals with differences of interpretation of tax law with the tax authorities, which can lead to tax reassessments or tax disputes.\n\nOperating taxes and levies are measured by the Group at the amount expected to be paid or recovered from the tax authorities of each country, based on its interpretation with regard to the application of tax legislation. The Group calculates the tax assets, liabilities and accruals recognized in the statement of financial position based on the technical merits of the positions it defends versus that of the tax authorities.\n\n## 11.2 Income taxes\n\n## 11.2.1 Income  taxes\n\n| (in millions of euros)   | (in millions of euros)   | 2020   | 2019    | 2018    |\n|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------|---------|---------|\n| Orange SA tax group      | Orange SA tax group      | 1,556  | (875)   | (702)   |\n| -                        | Current  tax             | 1,801  | (559)   | (595)   |\n| -                        | Deferred tax             | (246)  | (316)   | (107)   |\n| Spanish tax group        | Spanish tax group        | (146)  | (123)   | (164)   |\n| -                        | Current  tax             | (40)   | (84)    | (65)    |\n| -                        | Deferred tax             | (106)  | (39)    | (99)    |\n| Africa & Middle East     | Africa & Middle East     | (341)  | (296)   | (255)   |\n| -                        | Current  tax             | (343)  | (294)   | (258)   |\n| -                        | Deferred tax             | 2      | (1)     | 3       |\n| United Kingdom           | United Kingdom           | (137)  | (66)    | (66)    |\n| -                        | Current  tax             | (75)   | (66)    | (66)    |\n| -                        | Deferred tax             | (63)   | (0)     | (0)     |\n| Other subsidiaries       | Other subsidiaries       | (83)   | (86)    | (122)   |\n| -                        | Current  tax             | (99)   | (89)    | (128)   |\n| -                        | Deferred tax             | 16     | 3       | 6       |\n| Total Income taxes       | Total Income taxes       | 848    | (1,447) | (1,309) |\n| -                        | Current  tax             | 1,245  | (1,093) | (1,112) |\n| -                        | Deferred tax             | (396)  | (354)   | (197)   |\n\nIn 2020, the Orange group's current tax amounted to 1,245 million euros and included tax income of 2,246 million euros related to the tax dispute in France for fiscal years 2005-2006.

The decrease in the tax rate in France resulted in a reduction in the current tax expense of (36) million euros in 2020.\n\nI n  2 0 19 ,  t h e  t a x  r a t e  w a s  3 4 . 4 3 % .  A s  p a r t  o f  t h e  l a w  e n a c t e d  o n  J u l y  11, 2019 concerning the creation of a digital services tax, the French government instituted an exceptional new measure maintaining the corporate income tax rate of 34.43% for the 2019 fiscal year instead of the 32.02% corporate tax rate originally planned. This measure resulted in an additional tax expense for the Group of (35) million euros in 2019.\n\nIn 2018, the tax rate was 34.43%.\n\n## Current tax expense\n\nThe current  tax  expense  reflects  the  requirement  to  pay  income tax calculated on the basis of 100% of taxable income due to the depletion of tax loss carry forwards.\n\nIn 2020, the current tax expense included tax income of 2,246 million euros, as a result of the decision issued by the Conseil d'\u00c9tat on November 13, 2020 in favor of Orange SA on a dispute in respect of the years 2005-2006.\n\n## Deferred tax expense\n\nDeferred taxes are recorded at the tax rate expected at the time of their reversal.\n\nThe 2018 French Finance Act, that passed in late December 2017, included  a  gradual  reduction  in  the  corporate  tax  rate  with  an expected tax rate of 25.82% as of 2022 for the Group.\n\nThe 2021 Finance Law passed at the end of December 2020 confirms the trajectory initially planned, i.e. a rate of 28.41% in 2021 and a rate of 25.82% from 2022.\n\n## Developments in tax disputes and audits in France\n\nTax audits\n\nOrange SA was subject to a tax audit covering fiscal years 2015 to 2016. An amending proposal was issued covering the calculation of trademark fees paid by Orange SA to the British company Orange Brand  Services  Ltd  and  deducted  from  its  taxable  income.  The administration questions the inclusion of revenue from the roaming contract with Free and revenue from the fixed PSTN business. This r e c t i fi c a t i o n  r e q u e s t  i s  c o n t e s t e d  b y  O r a n g e  S A ,  w h i c h  h a s  r e q u e s t e d the opening of out-of-court proceedings and arbitration between the French and British tax authorities. The additional tax charge would effectively result in double taxation that would fail to comply with the provisions of the Franco-British tax agreement and the European arbitration agreement.\n\nOrange SA is currently subject to a tax audit covering fiscal years 2017 to 2018.\n\nDisputes in progress concerning fiscal years 2000-2006\n\nIn  the  context  of  the  absorption  of  Cogecom by Orange SA and pursuant to an adverse ruling by the Court of Montreuil on July 4, 2013 which triggered the payment of the amounts claimed by the Tax authority, Orange SA had to pay in 2013 the remaining balance on principal and late payment interest claimed for a total amount of 2.1 billion euros.\n\nOver the last few years, the main developments in terms of legal proceedings brought before the Versailles Administrative Court of Appeal were the following:\n\n- -concerning fiscal years 2000-2004:\n- -in a ruling given on July 24, 2018, the Administrative Court of Appeal of Versailles upheld the request from Orange. As the Tax administration did not appeal in cassation, this litigation is now closed. The accounting consequences were taken into account in the 2018 consolidated financial statements with no material impact;\n- -concerning fiscal years 2005-2006:\n- -in a ruling of February 18, 2016, the Administrative Court of  Appeal  of  Versailles  upheld  the  judgment  of  July  4, 2013,  despite  the  contrary  conclusions  of  the  appointed Rapporteur. The Group then appealed to the Conseil d'\u00c9tat on April 18, 2016 to rule on the substance of the case,\n- -in  a  ruling  dated  December  5,  2016,  the  Conseil d'\u00c9tat annulled the February 18, 2016 ruling by the Administrative Court of Appeal of Versailles and remanded the dispute to the same Court, on the grounds argued by the Group, i.e., the principle of intangibility of the opening balance sheet of the earliest fiscal year still subject to audit,\n- -in  a  ruling  dated  July  24,  2018,  the  Administrative  Court of Appeal of Versailles made an adverse decision against Orange, despite the contrary conclusions of the appointed Rapporteur. The Group appealed in cassation to the Conseil d'\u00c9tat which was to render the final decision,\n- -in  a  ruling  dated  November  13,  2020,  the Conseil d'\u00c9tat handed down a decision favorable to Orange SA on this tax dispute. This decision closes the procedure definitively. The  accounting  consequences  are  current  tax  income recognized  in  the  2020  financial  statements  for  a  total amount of 2,246 million euros (including 646 million euros of interests).\n\n## Spanish tax group\n\n## Current tax expense\n\nThe corporate tax rate applicable is 25% and the current income tax expense mainly represents the obligation to pay a minimum level of tax calculated on the basis of 75% of taxable income due to the 25% restriction on the utilization of tax loss carry forwards.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

The corporate tax rate has been 19% since April 1, 2017.\n\n## Deferred tax expense\n\nIn 2020, the deferred tax expense includes an increase of (63) million euros in deferred tax liabilities recognized in the United Kingdom on the Orange brand. The British government canceled the tax reduction from 19% to 17% in 2020, provided for by the 2016 Finance Act, thus maintaining the rate at 19%. The deferred tax liabilities on the brand are now recorded at a 19% tax rate.\n\n## Group tax proof\n\n| (in millions of euros)                                     | Note   | 2020      | 2019    | 2018    |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|--------|-----------|---------|---------|\n| Profit before tax                                          |        | 4,207     | 4,669   | 3,467   |\n| Statutory tax rate in France                               |        | 32.02%    | 34.43%  | 34.43%  |\n| Theoretical income tax                                     |        | (1,347)   | (1,608) | (1,194) |\n| Reconciling items:                                         |        |           |         |         |\n| Impairment of goodwill  (1)                                | 8.1    | -         | (19)    | (19)    |\n| Impairment of BT shares                                    | 13.7   | -         | (34)    | (30)    |\n| Share of profits (losses) of associates and joint ventures |        | (1)       | 3       | 1       |\n| Adjustment of prior-year taxes                             |        | 1         | 10      | 23      |\n| Recognition/(derecognition) of deferred tax assets         |        | (98)      | (36)    | (151)   |\n| Difference in tax rates  (2)                               |        | 157       | 192     | 189     |\n| Change in applicable tax rates  (3)                        |        | (92)      | 43      | (84)    |\n| Tax income related to the 2005-2006 tax dispute  (4)       |        | 2,246     | -       | -       |\n| Other reconciling items                                    |        | (18)      | 2       | (44)    |\n| Effective income tax                                       |        | 848       | (1,447) | (1,309) |\n| Effective tax rate                                         |        | (20.17) % | 30.99%  | 37.75%  |\n\n## 11.2.2 Income tax on other comprehensive income\n\n|                                                              | 2020          | 2020          | 2019          | 2019                      | 2018   | 2018         |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------------------|--------|--------------|\n| (in millions of euros)                                       | Gross  amount | Deferred  tax | Gross  amount | Deferred tax Gross amount |        | Deferred tax |\n| Actuarial gains and losses on  post-employment benefits      | (31)          | 6             | (109)         | 30                        | 45     | (6)          |\n| Assets at fair value                                         | 94            | -             | (16)          | -                         | (30)   | -            |\n| Cash flow hedges                                             | 22            | (10)          | 144           | (47)                      | (67)   | 18           |\n| Translation adjustment                                       | (414)         | -             | 78            | -                         | (7)    | -            |\n| Other comprehensive income of  associates and joint ventures | -             | -             | -             | -                         | -      | -            |\n| Total presented in other  comprehensive income               | (328)         | (4)           | 97            | (17)                      | (59)   | 12           |",

The  deferred tax assets recognized for Spain amounted to 0.5 billion euros at December 31, 2020.\n\nMost of the other tax losses carryforwards for which no deferred tax assets have been recognized will expire beyond 2025.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nCurrent income tax and deferred tax are measured by the Group at the amount expected to be paid or recovered from the tax authorities of each country, based on its interpretation with regard to the application of tax legislation. The Group calculates the tax assets and liabilities recognized in the statement of financial position based on the technical merits of the positions it defends versus that of the tax authorities.\n\nDeferred taxes are recognized for all temporary differences between the carrying values of assets and liabilities and their tax basis, as well as for unused tax losses, using the liability method. Deferred tax assets are recognized only when their recovery is considered probable.\n\nA deferred tax liability is recognized for all taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, interests in joint ventures and associates, except to the extent that both of the following conditions are satisfied:\n\n- -the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference (e.g. the payment of dividends); and\n- -it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nAccordingly, for fully consolidated companies, a deferred tax liability is only recognized in the amount of the taxes payable on planned dividend distributions by the Group.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.\n\nAt each period end, the Group reviews the recoverable amount of the deferred tax assets carried by certain tax entities with significant tax losses carryforwards. The recoverability of the deferred tax assets is assessed in the light of the business plans used for impairment testing. This plan may be adjusted for any tax specificities.\n\nDeferred tax assets arising on these tax losses are not recognized under certain circumstances specific to each company/tax consolidation group concerned, and particularly where:\n\n- -entities cannot assess the probability of the tax loss carryforwards being set off against future taxable profits, due to the horizon for forecasts based on business plans used for impairment testing and uncertainties as to the economic environment;\n- -entities have not yet begun to use the tax loss carryforwards;\n- -entities do not expect to use the losses within the timeframe allowed by tax regulations;\n- -it is estimated that tax losses are uncertain to be used due to risks of differing interpretations with regard to the application of tax legislation.",

If an associate incurs losses and the carrying amount of the investment is reduced to zero, the Group ceases to recognize the additional share of losses since it has no commitment beyond its investment.\n\nAn impairment test is performed at least annually and when there is objective evidence of impairment, for instance a decrease in the quoted price when the investee is listed, significant financial difficulty of the entity, observable data indicating that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows, or information about significant changes having an adverse effect on the entity.\n\nAn impairment loss is recorded when the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, the recoverable amount being the higher of the value in use and the fair value less costs to sell. The unit of account is the whole investment. Any impairment is recognized as 'Share of profits (losses) of associates and joint ventures'. Impairment losses shall be reversed once the recoverable amount exceeds the carrying amount.\n\n## Note 13   Financial assets, liabilities and financial results (telecom activities)\n\n## 13.1 Financial assets and liabilities of telecom activities\n\nIn order to improve the readability of financial statements and to be able to distinguish the performance of telecom activities from the performance of the mobile financial services activities,  the  notes related to financial assets and liabilities as well as financial income or expenses are split to respect these two business areas.\n\nNote 13 presents the financial assets, liabilities and related gains and losses specific to telecom activities and Note 17 concerns the activities of Mobile Financial Services with regard to its assets and liabilities, with net financial income being not material.\n\nThe following table reconciles the contributive balances of assets and liabilities for each of these two areas to the consolidated balance sheet (intra-group transactions between telecom activities and mobile financial services activities are not eliminated) with the consolidated statement of financial position as of December 31, 2020.\n\n| (in millions of euros)                       | Orange  consolidated  financial  statements   | o/w  telecom  activities   | Note   | o/w Mobile  Financial  Services   | Note   | o/w  eliminations  telecom  activities/ mobile  financial  services   |\n|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------|--------|-----------------------------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Non-current financial assets related to      |                                               |                            |        |                                   |        |                                                                       |\n| Mobile Financial Services activities         | 1,210                                         | -

This  aggregate,  not  defined  by  IFRS,  may  not  be comparable to similarly entitled indicators used by other companies. It  is  provided  as  additional  information  only  and  should  not  be considered as a substitute for an analysis of all the Group's assets and liabilities.\n\nNet financial debt as defined and used by Orange does not include mobile  financial  services  activities  for  which  the  concept  is  not relevant.\n\nIt  consists  of  (a)  financial  liabilities  excluding  operating  payables ( t r a n s l a t e d  i n t o  e u r o s  a t  t h e  y e a r- e n d  c l o s i n g  r a t e )  i n c l u d i n g  d e r i v a t i v e instruments (assets and liabilities), less (b) cash collateral paid, cash, cash equivalents and financial assets at fair value.\n\nFurthermore, financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges included  in  net  financial  debt  are  set  up  to  hedge  in  particular items that are not included therein, such as future cash flows. As a consequence, the portion of these unmatured hedging instruments recorded  in  other  comprehensive  income  is  added  to  the  gross financial debt to offset this temporary difference.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the financial liability are deducted from the liability's carrying value. The costs are subsequently amortized over the life of the debt, using the effective interest rate method.\n\nSome financial liabilities at amortized cost, mainly borrowings, are subject to hedging. This relates mostly to borrowings hedged against the exposure of their future cash flows to foreign exchange risk (cash flow hedge).\n\n## 13.4 TDIRA\n\nThe perpetual bonds redeemable for shares ('TDIRAs') with a par value of 14,100 euros are listed on Euronext Paris. Their issuance was described in a securities note approved by the Commission des Op\u00e9rations de Bourse (French Securities Regulator, renamed Autorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s financiers (French Financial Markets Authority)) on February 24, 2003. As of December 31, 2020, taking into account redemptions  made  since  their  issuance,  44,880  TDIRAs remain outstanding for a total par value of 633 million euros.\n\nThe TDIRAs are redeemable in new Orange SA shares, at any time at the holders' request or, under certain conditions as described\n\nin the appropriate prospectus, at Orange SA's initiative based on a  ratio  of  590.600  shares  to  one TDIRA (i.e.,  conversion price of 23.874 euros), as the initial ratio of 300 shares to one TDIRA has been adjusted several times to protect bondholders' rights, and may be further adjusted under the terms and conditions set out in the information memorandum.\n\nSince January 1, 2010, the interest rate on the TDIRAs has been the three-month Euribor +2.5%.\n\nThe TDIRA are subject to split accounting between equity and liabilities. For the securities outstanding on December 31, 2020, the 'equity' component before deferred tax stood at 152 million euros.\n\n4\n\n| (in millions of euros)                 | December 31,   | December 31,  December 31,   | December 31,  December 31,   |\n|----------------------------------------|----------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|\n|                                        | 2020           | 2019                         | 2018                         |\n| Number of securities                   | 44,880         | 57,981                       | 57,981                       |\n| Equity component before deferred taxes | 152            | 196                          | 196                          |\n| Debt component                         | 636            | 822                          | 822                          |\n| o/w accrued interests not yet due      | 3              | 4                            |                              |\n| Paid interest                          | 14             | 18                           | 27                           |\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nSome Group financial instruments include both a liability component and an equity component. This relates to perpetual bonds redeemable for shares (TDIRA). On initial recognition, the liability component is measured at its market value, corresponding to the value of the contractually determined future cash flows discounted at the market rate applied at the date of issue to comparable instruments providing substantially the same conditions, but without the option to convert or redeem in shares. This liability component is subsequently recognized at amortized cost.\n\nThe carrying amount of the equity component is determined at inception by deducting the fair value of the financial liability from the notional value of the instrument. This does not change throughout the life of the instrument.",

The Bonds mature in June 2021 and have been redeemable on demand by investors since August 7, 2017, in cash, BT securities or a combination of the two, at Orange's choice. Under IFRS, this operation was split between a financial liability at amortized cost\n\nand a derivative instrument (sale of call option) revalued at fair value through profit or loss. In the first half of 2019, Orange purchased call options with the same characteristics as the sale of call options included in the bonds exchangeable for BT securities. The purchase of calls offsets the sale of the initial call options, so the Group is no longer exposed to any change in value of BT securities linked to the bonds exchangeable for BT shares.\n\n## 13.6 Loans from development organizations and multilateral lending institutions\n\n| (in millions of euros)                                                         | December 31,  2020   | December 31,  2019   | December 31,  2018   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| Sonatel                                                                        | 292                  | 380                  | 343                  |\n| Orange Mali                                                                    | 227                  | 203                  | 200                  |\n| M\u00e9di Telecom                                                                   | 220                  | 282                  | 335                  |\n| Orange C\u00f4te d'Ivoire                                                           | 172                  | 237                  | 225                  |\n| Orange Egypt                                                                   | 163                  | 213                  | 210                  |\n| Orange Cameroon                                                                | 111                  | 82                   | 105                  |\n| Orange Jordanie                                                                | 61                   | 77                   | 31                   |\n| Orange Burkina Faso                                                            | 56                   | 46                   | -                    |\n| Other                                                                          | 81                   | 104                  | 127                  |\n| Bank loans                                                                     | 1,384                | 1,625                | 1,574                |\n| Orange SA (1)                                                                  | 2,288                | 2,356                | 2,023                |\n| Orange Espagne                                                                 | -                    | 33                   | 67                   |\n| Loans from development organizations and multilateral lending institutions (2) | 2,288                | 2,389                | 2,090                |\n| Total                                                                          | 3,671                | 4,013                | 3,664                |\n\n- (2) Primarily the European Investment Bank.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

These assets are recognized at fair value at inception and subsequently. All changes in fair value are recorded in net financial expenses.\n\n- -Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income that may not be reclassified to profit or loss (FVOCI)\n\nInvestment securities which are not consolidated or equity-accounted are, subject to exceptions, recognized as assets at fair value through other comprehensive income that may not be reclassified to profit/loss. They are recognized at fair value at inception and subsequently. Temporary changes in value and gains (losses) on disposals are recorded in other comprehensive income that may not be reclassified to profit/loss.\n\n- -Financial assets at amortized cost (AC)\n\nThis category mainly includes loans and receivables. These instruments are recognized at fair value at inception and are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. If there is any objective evidence of impairment of these assets, the value of the asset is reviewed at the end of each reporting period. An impairment loss is recognized in the income statement when impairment tests demonstrate that the financial asset carrying amount is higher than its recoverable amount. For theses financial assets, the provisioning system also covers expected losses according to IFRS 9.\n\n## 13.8 Derivatives instruments\n\n## 13.8.1 Market value of derivatives\n\n| (in millions of euros)            | December 31, 2020   | December 31, 2019   | December 31, 2018   |\n|-----------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n|                                   | Net                 | Net                 | Net                 |\n| Hedging derivatives               | (311)               | 324                 | (162)               |\n| Cash flow hedge derivatives       | (311)               | 328                 | (160)               |\n| Fair value hedge derivatives      | (0)                 | (4)                 | (2)                 |\n| Derivatives held for trading  (1) | (199)               | (187)               | (298)               |\n| Net derivatives (2)               | (510)               | 138                 | (460)               |\n\n- (1) Mainly due to the foreign exchange effects of the economic hedges against the revaluation of subordinated notes denominated in pounds sterling (equity instruments recognized at their historical value - see Note 15.4) for (210) million euros in 2020, (136) million euros in 2019 and (246) million euros in 2018.\n- (2) Of which foreign exchange effects of the cross currency swaps (classified as hedging or held for trading) hedging foreign exchange risk on gross debt notional for 251 million euros in 2020, 822 million euros in 2019 and 512 million euros in 2018. The foreign exchange effects of the cross currency swaps is the difference between the notional converted at the closing rate and its notional converted at the opening rate (or at the trading day spot rate in case of new instrument).\n\nThe risks hedged by these derivative instruments are described in Note 14. These derivatives are associated with cash-collateral agreements, the effects of which are described in Note 14.5.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nDerivative instruments are measured at fair value in the statement of financial position and presented according to their maturity date, regardless of whether they qualify for hedge accounting under IFRS 9 (hedging instruments versus trading instruments).\n\nDerivatives are classified as a separate line item in the statement of financial position.\n\nTrading derivatives are non-qualified economic hedges. Changes in the value of these instruments are recognized directly in profit and loss.\n\nHedge accounting is applicable when:\n\n- -at the inception of the hedge, there is a formal designation and documentation of the hedging relationship;\n- -the effectiveness of the hedge is demonstrated at inception and it is expected to continue in subsequent periods: i.e. at inception and throughout its duration, the company expects changes in the fair value of the hedged element to be almost fully offset by changes in the fair value of the hedged instrument.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

The hedged portion of these items is re-measured at fair value in the statement of financial position. Change in this fair value is booked in the income statement and offset by symmetrical changes in the fair value hedging of financial hedging instruments up to the limit of the hedge effectiveness;\n- -the cash flow hedge is a hedge of the exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to a particular interest rate and/or currency risk associated with a recognized asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction (such as a future purchase or sale) and which could affect profit or loss. As the hedged item is not recognized in the statement of financial position, the effective portion of change in fair value of the hedging instrument is booked in other comprehensive income. It is reclassified in profit or loss when the hedged item (financial asset or liability) affects the profit or loss or in the initial cost of the hedged item when it relates to the hedge of a non-financial asset acquisition cost;\n- -the net investment hedge is a hedge of the exposure to changes in values attributable to exchange risk of a net investment in a foreign operation, and could affect profit or loss on the disposal of the foreign operation. The effective portion of the net investment hedge is recorded in other comprehensive income. It is reclassified in profit or loss upon the disposal of the net investment.\n\nFor transactions qualified as fair value hedges and economic hedges, the foreign exchange impact of changes in the fair value of derivatives is booked in operating income when the underlying hedged item results from operational transactions and in net finance costs when the underlying hedged item is a financial asset or liability.\n\nHedge accounting can be terminated when the hedged item is no longer recognized, i.e. when the Group revokes the designation of the hedging relationship or when the hedging instrument is terminated or exercised. The accounting consequences are as follows:\n\n- -fair value hedge: at the hedge accounting termination date, the adjustment of the fair value of the liability is amortized using an effective interest rate recalculated at this date. Should the item hedged disappear, the change in fair value is recognized in the income statement;\n- -cash flow hedge: amounts recorded in other comprehensive income are immediately reclassified in profit or loss when the hedged item is no longer recognized. In all other cases, amounts are reclassified in profit or loss, on a straight basis, throughout the remaining life of the original hedging relationship.\n\nIn both cases, subsequent changes in the value of the hedging instrument are recorded in profit or loss.\n\nConcerning the effects of the Foreign Currency Basis Spread, cross currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges, the Group has chosen to designate them as costs of hedge. This option enables recognizing these effects in comprehensive income and amortizing the cost of the Basis Spread to profit/loss over the period of the hedge.",

        "page_content": "## Note 14   Information on market risk and fair value of financial assets and liabilities (telecom activities)\n\nThe Group uses financial position or performance indicators that are not specifically defined by IFRS, such as EBITDAaL (see Note 1.9) and net financial debt (see Note 13.3).\n\nMarket  risks  are  monitored  by  Orange's  Treasury  and  Financing Committee,  which  reports  to  the  Executive  Committee.  The Committee is chaired by the Group's Executive Committee Member in charge of Finance, Performance and Development and meets on a quarterly basis.\n\nIt sets the guidelines for managing the Group's debt, especially in r e s p e c t  o f  i t s  i n t e r e s t  r a t e ,  f o r e i g n  e x c h a n g e ,  l i q u i d i t y  a n d  c o u n t e r p a r t y risk exposure for the coming months, and reviews past management (transactions realized, financial results).\n\nThe health crisis has not called into question the risk management policy relating to financial instruments. The Group continued to set up and manage hedging instruments in order to limit its exposure to operational and financial foreign exchange and interest rate risks, while maintaining a diversified financing policy.\n\n## 14.1 Interest rate risk management\n\n## Management of fixed-rate/variable-rate debt\n\nOrange Group seeks to manage its fixed-rate/variable-rate exposure in euros in order to minimize interest costs by using firm and conditional interest rate derivatives such as swaps, futures, caps and floors.\n\nThe fixed-rate component of gross financial debt, excluding cash collateral  received  and  agreements  to  buy  back  non-controlling interests,  was  estimated  at  89%  at  December  31,  2020,  91%  at December 31, 2019 and 87% at December 31, 2018.\n\n## Sensitivity analysis of the Group's position to changes in interest rates\n\nThe sensitivity of the Group's financial assets and liabilities to interest rate risk is only analyzed for the components of net financial debt that are interest-bearing and therefore exposed to interest rate risk.\n\n## Sensitivity of financial expenses\n\nBased on a constant amount of debt and a constant management policy, a 1% rise in interest rates would reduce the annual cost of gross financial debt by 2 million euros, while a decrease of 1% would improve it by 2 million euros.\n\n## Sensitivity of cash flow hedge reserves\n\nA 1% rise in euro interest rates would increase the market value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges and the associated cash flow hedge reserves by approximately 1,282 million euros. A 1% fall in\n\neuro interest rates would lead to a decrease in their market value and i n  t h e  c a s h  fl o w  h e d g e  r e s e r v e s  o f  a p p r o x i m a t e l y  1, 278  m i l l i o n  e u r o s .\n\n## 14.2 Foreign exchange risk management\n\n## Operational foreign exchange risk\n\nThe  Group's  foreign  operations  are  carried  out  by  entities  that operate in their own country and mainly in their own currency. Their operational exposure to foreign exchange risk is therefore limited to certain types of flows: purchases of equipment or network capacity, purchases of terminals and equipment sold or leased to customers, purchases from or sales to international operators.\n\nWhenever possible, the entities of the Orange Group have put in place policies to hedge this exposure (see Note 13.8).\n\n## Financial foreign exchange risk\n\nFinancial foreign exchange risk mainly relates to:\n\n- -dividends paid to the parent company: in general, the Group's policy is to economically hedge this risk as from the date of the relevant subsidiary's Shareholders' Meeting;\n- -financing  of  the  subsidiaries:  except  in  special  cases,  the subsidiaries are required to cover their funding needs in their functional currency;\n- -G roup financing: most of the Group's bonds, after derivatives, are denominated in euros. From time to time, Orange SA issues bonds in markets  other  than  euro  markets  (primarily  the  US dollar, pound sterling and Swiss franc). If Orange SA does not have assets in these currencies, in most cases, the issues are translated into euros through cross currency swaps. The debt allocation by currency also depends on the level of interest rates and par ti c u l a r l y  o n  t h e  i n t e r e s t  r a t e  d i f f e r e n t i a l  r e l a t i v e  t o  t h e  e u r o .\n\nLastly, the Group economically hedges foreign exchange risk on its subordinated notes denominated in pound sterling that are recorded in equity at their historical value (see Note 15.4), with cross currency swaps, for a notional amount of 988 million pounds sterling.\n\nThe table below shows the main exposures to foreign exchange fluctuations  of  the  net  financial  debt  in  foreign  currencies  of Orange SA, excluding the hedging effects of the subordinated notes described above and of Orange Polska and also shows the sensitivit y of the entity to a 10% change in the foreign exchange rates of the currencies to which it is exposed. Orange SA is the entity bearing the major foreign exchange risk, including internal operations which generate a net foreign exchange gain or loss in the consolidated annual financial statements.\n\n| (in millions of currency units)   | Exposure in currency units  (1)   | Exposure in currency units  (1)   | Exposure in currency units  (1)   | Exposure in currency units  (1)   | Exposure in currency units  (1)   | Sensitivity analysis   | Sensitivity analysis   |\n|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n|                                   | EUR                               | USD                               | GBP                               | PLN                               | Total  translated                 | 10% gain  in euro      | 10% loss  in euro      |\n| Orange SA                         | -                                 | 7                                 | 8                                 | 15                                | 17                                | (2)                    | 2                      |\n| Orange Polska                     | (160)                             | (5)                               | -                                 | -                                 | (164)                             | 15                     | (18)                   |\n| Total (euros)                     | (160)                             | 1                                 | 9                                 | 3                                 | (147)                             |                        |                        |\n\n- (1) Excluding FX hedge of subordinated notes denominated in pounds sterling.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

funding\n\nOrange has diversified sources of funding:\n\n- -regular issues in the bonds markets;\n- -occasional  financing  through  loans  from  multilateral  or development lending institutions;\n- -issues  in  the  short-term  securities  markets  under  the  NEU Commercial Paper program (Negotiable European Commercial papers);\n- -on December 21, 2016, Orange entered into a 6 billion euros syndicated loan with 24 international banks in order to refinance the previous syndicated loan maturing in January 2018. The new loan, with initial maturity in December 2021, includes two options to extend for one more year each, exercisable by Orange and subject  to  the  banks'  approval.  Orange  exercised  both  of  its options, the first one in 2017 and the second in 2018, allowing it, after agreement of the lenders, to extend the initial maturity first until December 2022 and then December 2023.\n\n## Liquidity of investments\n\nOrange invests  its  cash  surpluses  in  cash  equivalents  that  meet IAS 7 cash equivalent criteria or in fair value investments (negotiable debt securities, bonds with a maturity of no more than two years, UCITS and term deposits). These investments prioritize minimizing the risk of capital loss over performance.\n\nCash, cash equivalents and fair value investments are held mainly in France and other European Union countries, which are not subject to restrictions on convertibility or exchange controls.\n\n## Smoothing debt maturities\n\nThe policy followed by Orange is to apportion the maturities of debt evenly over the years to come.\n\nThe following table shows undiscounted future cash flows for each financial liability shown on the statement of financial position. The key assumptions used in this schedule are:\n\n- -amounts in foreign currencies are translated into euro at the year- end closing rate;\n- -future variable-rate interest is based on the last fixed coupon, unless a better estimate is available;\n- -TDIRA b e i n g  n e c e s s a r i l y  r e d e e m a b l e  i n  n e w  s h a r e s ,  n o  r e d e m p t i o n is taken into account in the maturity analysis. In addition, interest payable on the bonds is due over an undetermined period of time (see Note 13.4) therefore, only interest payable for the first period is  included (including interest payments for the other periods would not provide relevant information);\n- -the maturity dates of revolving credit facilities are the contractual maturity dates;\n- -the 'Other items' (undated and non-cash items) reconcile, for financial liabilities not accounted for at fair value, the future cash flows and the balance in the statement of financial position.",

It  breaks  down  as follows:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAt December 31, 2020, the Orange group's telecom activities had access  to  credit  facilities  in  the  form  of  bilateral  credit  lines  and syndicated credit lines. Most of these lines bear interest at variable rates.  Available  undrawn  amount  of  credit  facilities  amounts  to 6,146 million euros (including 6,000 million euros for Orange SA).\n\nCash  equivalents  amounted  to  5,140  million  euros,  mainly  at Orange SA for 4,329 million euros in UCITS, 450 million euros in term deposits and 170 million euros in negotiable debt securities.\n\nInvestments at fair value amounted to 3,206 million euros exclusively at Orange SA, with 3,105 million euros in NEU Commercial Paper and 101 million euros in bonds.\n\nAny specific contingent commitments in terms of financial ratios are presented in Note 14.4.\n\n## Orange's credit ratings\n\nOrange's credit rating is an additional performance indicator used to assess the Group's financial policy and risk management policy and, in particular, its solvency and liquidity risk, and is not a substitute for an analysis carried out by investors. Rating agencies revise the ratings  they  assign  on  a  regular  basis.  Any  change  in  the  rating could produce an impact on the cost of future financing or restrict access to liquidity.\n\nIn  addition,  a  change  in  Orange's  credit  rating  will,  for  certain outstanding financing, affect the compensation paid to investors:\n\n- -one Orange SA bond (see Note 13.5) with an outstanding amount of 2.5 billion dollars maturing in 2031 (equivalent to 2.0 billion euros at December 31, 2020) is subject to a Step-up clause in t h e  e v e n t  t h a t  O r a n g e 's  r a t i n g  c h a n g e s .

As  at December 31, 2020, the credit facility was not drawn.\n\nAt December 31, 2020, neither Orange's credit ratings nor the outlook had changed compared with December 31, 2019.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

The breach of these ratios constitutes an event of default that can lead to early repayment of the line of credit or loan concerned.\n\nThe main obligations are as follows:\n\n- -Orange Egypt: in respect of bank financing contracts signed in  2018,  of  which  the  total  nominal  amount  outstanding  at December  31,  2020  was  3,150  million  Egyptian  pounds  (i.e. 164 million euros), Orange Egypt must comply with a 'net senior debt to reported EBITDA' ratio;\n- -M\u00e9di Telecom: in respect of its bank financing contracts signed in  2012,  2014  and  2015,  of  which  the  total  nominal  amount outstanding at December 31, 2020 was 2,396 million Moroccan dirhams (i.e. 220 million euros), M\u00e9di Telecom must comply with ratios relating to its 'net financial debt' and 'net equity';\n- -Orange C\u00f4te d'Ivoire: in respect of its bank financing contracts signed in 2016 and 2019, of which the total nominal amount outstanding at December 31, 2020 was 112 billion CFA francs (i.e. 170 million euros), Orange C\u00f4te d'Ivoire must comply with a 'net debt to reported EBITDA' ratio;\n- -Orange Cameroon: in respect of its bank financing contracts signed in 2015 and 2018, of which the total nominal amount outstanding at December 31, 2020 was 72 billion CFA francs (i.e. 110 million euros), Orange Cameroon must comply with a 'net debt to reported EBITDA' ratio.\n\nThese ratios were complied with at December 31, 2020.\n\n## Clauses related to instances of default or material adverse changes\n\nMost of Orange's financing agreements, including in particular the 6  billion  euros  syndicated  credit  facility  set  up  on  December  21, 2016, as well as bond issues, are not subject to early redemption obligations  in  the  event  of  a  material  adverse  change,  or  cross default provisions. Most of these contracts include cross acceleration provisions. Thus, the mere occurrence of events of default in other\n\nfinancing agreements would not automatically trigger an accelerated repayment under such contracts.\n\n## 14.5 Credit risk and counterparty risk management\n\nThe Group could be exposed to a concentration of counterparty risk in respect of its trade receivables, cash and cash equivalents, investments and derivatives.\n\nOrange considers that it has limited concentration in credit risk with r e s p e c t  t o  t r a d e  r e c e i v a b l e s  d u e  t o  i t s  l a r g e  a n d  d i v e r s e  c u s t o m e r  b a s e (residential, professional and large business customers) operating in numerous industries and located in many French regions and foreign countries. In addition, the maximum value of the counterparty risk on these financial assets is equal to their recognized net carrying value. An analysis of net trade receivables past due is provided in Note 5.3. For loans and other receivables, amounts past due but not provisioned are not material.\n\nOrange  SA  is  exposed  to  bank  counterparty  risk  through  its investments and derivatives. Therefore, it performs a strict selection based on the credit rating of public, financial or industrial institutions i n  w h i c h  i t  i n v e s t s  o r  w i t h  w h i c h  i t  e n t e r s  i n t o  d e r i v a t i v e s  a g r e e m e n t s:\n\n- -f or  each non-banking counterparty selected for investments, limits are based on ratings and maturities of the investments;\n- -for  each  counterparty  bank  selected  for  investments  and deri v a t i v e s ,  l i m i t s  a r e  b a s e d  o n  e q u i t y,  r a t i n g ,  C D S  ( C r e d i t  D e f a u l t Swap, an accurate indicator of potential default risk) as well as on periodic analyses carried out by the Treasury Department;\n- -theoretical  limits  and  consumption  limits  are  monitored  and reported on a daily basis to the Group treasurer and the head of the trading room. These limits are adjusted regularly depending on credit events.\n\nFor derivatives, master agreements relating to financial instruments (French Banking Federation) are signed with all counterparties and provide for a net settlement of debts and receivables, in case of failure  of  one  of  the  parties,  as  well  as  for  calculation  of  a  final balance to be received or paid. These agreements include a CSA (Credit Support Annex) cash collateral clause that can lead to either a deposit (collateral paid) or collection (collateral received), on a daily basis. These payment amounts correspond to the change in market value of all derivatives.\n\nAs  a  rule,  investments  are  negotiated  with  high-grade  banks. Exceptionally,  subsidiaries  occasionally  deal  with  counterparties with the highest ratings available locally.",

In particular, the market value of these listed subsidiaries' shares is one of the measurement variables used in impairment testing.\n\nThe  mutual  funds  (UCITS)  in  which  Orange  invests  for  cash management purposes contain no equities.\n\nOrange is also exposed to equity risk through certain retirement plan assets (see Note 7.2).\n\nAt December 31, 2020, the Group was not significantly exposed to market risk on the shares of listed companies. The Group's prior exposure had been significantly reduced in 2019, with the disposal in June 2019 of its residual 2.49% stake in the share capital of BT (see Note 13.7).\n\nOrange  SA  and  its  non-financial  subsidiaries  are  not  subject  to regulatory  requirements  related  to  equity  (other  than  the  usual standards applicable to any commercial company).\n\nIts  financial  subsidiaries  (like  electronic  money  institutions)  are subject  to  regulatory  equity  requirements  specific  to  their  sector and jurisdiction.\n\nLike any company, Orange manages its financial resources (both equity and net financial debt) as part of a balanced financial policy, aiming to ensure flexible access to capital markets, including for the purpose of selectively investing in development projects, and to provide a return to shareholders.\n\nIn terms of net financial debt (see Note 13.3), this policy translates into liquidity management as described in Note 14.3 and a specific attention to credit ratings assigned by rating agencies.\n\nThis policy is also reflected, in some markets, by the presence of minority  shareholders  in  the  capital  of  subsidiaries  controlled  by Orange.

The results calculated using the internal valuation model are systematically benchmarked with the values provided by Bloomberg.\n\nThe Group considers the carrying value of trade payables and deposits received from customers to be a reasonable approximation of fair value, due to the high liquidity of these elements.\n\nThe fair value of long-term trade payables is the value of future cash flows discounted at the interest rates observed by the Group at the end of the period.\n\nFinancial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss mainly concern firm or contingent commitments to purchase non-controlling interests. Their fair value is measured in accordance with the provisions of the contractual agreements. When the commitment is based on a fixed price, a discounted value is retained.\n\nThe fair value of derivatives , mostly traded over-the-counter, is determined using the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted using the interest rates observed by the Group at the end of the period. The results calculated using the internal valuation model are consistently benchmarked with the values provided by bank counterparties and Bloomberg.\n\nWhen there are no reliable market data which identify the probability of default, the CVA (Credit Value Adjustment) and the DVA (Debit Value Adjustment) are measured based on historical default charts and CDS (Credit Default Swap) trends. Counterparty credit risk and the Group's own specific default risk are also continuously monitored based on the monitoring of debt security credit spreads on the secondary market and other market information.

They are booked in equity.\n\nAs equity instruments are recognized at historical value, the tranche denominated in foreign currency is never re-measured. Where appropriate, a translation adjustment impact is booked in equity when a call option is exercised.\n\nThe remuneration of holders is recorded directly in equity at the time of the decision to pay the coupons.\n\nThe tax impact related to the remuneration is accounted for through profit or loss, and that related to the remeasurement of the foreign currency portion is accounted for in equity.\n\n## Equity component of perpetual bonds redeemable for shares (TDIRAs) (see Note 13.4)\n\nThe equity component is determined as the difference between the fair value of the instrument taken as a whole and the fair value of the debt component. The equity component thus determined and recognized at inception is not subsequently re-measured and remains in equity, even when the instrument is extinguished.\n\n## 15.5 Translation adjustment\n\n| (in millions of euros)                                                 | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Gain (loss) recognized in other comprehensive income during the period | (414)  | 90     | (6)    |\n| Reclassification to net income for the period                          | 0      | (12)   | (1)    |\n| Total translation adjustments                                          | (414)  | 78     | (7)    |\n\n| (in millions of euros)                                     | December 31,   | December 31,  December 31,   | December 31,  December 31,   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|\n|                                                            | 2020           | 2019                         | 2018                         |\n| Polish zloty                                               | 668            | 807                          | 785                          |\n| Egyptian pound                                             | (503)          | (455)                        | (532)                        |\n| Slovak koruna                                              | 220            | 220                          | 220                          |\n| Leone                                                      | (143)          | (120)                        | (95)                         |\n| Other                                                      | (327)          | (123)                        | (126)                        |\n| Total translation adjustments                              | (85)           | 329                          | 252                          |\n| o/w share attributable to the owners of the parent company | (256)          | 78                           | 15                           |\n| o/w share attributable to non-controlling interests        | 171            | 251                          | 237                          |\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nThe functional currency of foreign operations located outside the euro area is generally the local currency, unless the major cash flows are made with reference to another currency (such as the Orange entities in Romania - euros and in the Democratic Republic of the Congo - US dollars).\n\nThe financial statements of foreign operations whose functional currency is neither the euro nor the currency of a hyper-inflationary economy are translated into euros (the Group's presentation currency) as follows:\n\n- -assets and liabilities are translated at the year-end rate;\n- -items in the income statement are translated at the average rate for the period;\n- -the translation adjustment resulting from the use of these different rates is included in other comprehensive income.\n\nThe translation adjustments are reclassified to profit or loss when the entity disposes or partially disposes (loss of control, loss of joint control, loss of significant influence) of its interest in a foreign operation through the sale, liquidation, repayment of capital or abandon of all, or part of, that activity. The reduction in the carrying value of a foreign operation, either because of its own losses or because of the recognition of an impairment loss, does not lead to a reclassification through profit or loss of the accumulated translation adjustments.\n\nRecycling of translation adjustments is presented in profit or loss within:\n\n- -consolidated net income of discontinued operations, when a line of business or major geographical area is disposed of;\n- -gains (losses) on disposal of fixed assets, investments and activities, when other businesses are disposed of;\n- -reclassification of translation adjustment from liquidated entities, in the event of the liquidation or abandonment of an activity without disposal.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

In accordance with IFRS 10, this can result in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.\n\n## Transactions with owners\n\nEach transaction with minority shareholders of an entity controlled by the Group, when not resulting in a loss of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction with no effect on consolidated comprehensive income.\n\n## 15.7 Earnings per share\n\n## Net income\n\nNet income, Group share, used for calculating basic and diluted earnings per share is determined according to the following method:\n\n| (in millions of euros)                                                          | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Net income - basic                                                              | 4,822  | 3,004  | 1,954  |\n| Effect of subordinated notes                                                    | (255)  | (268)  | (293)  |\n| Net income attributable to the owners of the  parent company - basic (adjusted) | 4,567  | 2,736  | 1,661  |\n| Impact of dilutive instruments: TDIRA                                           | 9      | 12     | -      |\n| Net income attributable to the owners  of the parent company - diluted          | 4,577  | 2,747  | 1,661  |\n\n## Number of shares\n\nThe weighted average number of shares used for calculating the basic and diluted earnings per share is presented below:\n\n| (number of shares)                                                 | 2020          | 2019          | 2018          |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding             | 2,656,122,534 | 2,652,532,564 | 2,656,683,856 |\n| Impact of dilutive instruments on number of ordinary shares: TDIRA | 26,945,386    | 33,780,544    | -             |\n| Free share award plan (LTIP)                                       | 720,936       | 1,662,103     | 1,419,415     |\n| Weighted average number of shares outstanding - diluted            | 2,683,788,856 | 2,687,975,211 | 2,658,103,271 |\n\nThe average market price of the Orange share in 2020 was higher than the fair value adopted under the LTIP 2019-2021 and 2020-2022 free  share  award  plans  (see  Note  7.3).

The number of shares used to calculate diluted earnings per share takes into account the conversion into ordinary shares of potentially dilutive instruments outstanding during the period. These instruments are considered to be dilutive when they have the effect of reducing earnings per share of continuing operations.\n\nWhen basic earnings per share are negative, diluted earnings per share are identical to basic earnings per share. In the event of a capital increase at a price lower than the market price, and in order to ensure comparability of the reporting periods shown, the weighted average numbers of shares outstanding in current and previous periods are adjusted. Treasury shares owned, which are deducted from the consolidated equity, do not enter into the calculation of earnings per share.\n\n## Note 16   Unrecognized contractual commitments (telecom activities)\n\nAt December 31, 2020, Orange is not aware of having entered into any commitment involving entities controlled by the Group that may have a material effect on its current or future financial position, other than the commitments described in this note.\n\n## 16.1 Operating activities commitments\n\n| (in millions of euros)                                                 | Total Less than one  year   | Total Less than one  year   | From one to  five years More than five  years   | From one to  five years More than five  years   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| Operating activities commitments                                       | 13,720                      | 4,007                       | 4,695                                           | 5,018                                           |\n| Operating leases commitments                                           | 489                         | 66                          | 191                                             | 233                                             |\n| Handsets purchase commitments                                          | 568                         | 557                         | 9                                               | 2                                               |\n| Transmission capacity purchase commitments                             | 1,767                       | 202                         | 522                                             | 1,043                                           |\n| Other goods and services purchase commitments                          | 3,240                       | 928                         | 1,428                                           | 884                                             |\n| Investment commitments                                                 | 1,739                       | 498                         | 820                                             | 422                                             |\n| Public initiative networks commitments                                 | 4,423                       | 1,160                       | 1,424                                           | 1,839                                           |\n| Guarantees granted to third parties in the ordinary course of business | 1,493                       | 596                         | 302                                             | 595                                             |\n\n## Lease commitments\n\nLease commitments include real estate leases relating to contracts for which the underlying asset will be available after December 31, 2020 and leases for which the Group applies the exemptions allowed by IFRS 16 (see Note 10).\n\n| (in millions of euros)       |   Minimum future lease payments |\n|------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Property lease commitments   |                             459 |\n| o/w technical activities     |                              21 |\n| o/w shops/offices activities |                             438 |\n\nMaturities are set forth below:\n\n| (in millions of euros)      | Minimum  Less than one   | Minimum  Less than one   | 1-2 years   | 2-3 years   | 3-4 years   | 4-5 years More than five   |       |\n|-----------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|----------------------------|-------|\n|                             | future lease  payments   | year                     |             |             |             |                            | years |\n| Property lease  commitments | 459                      | 52                       | 47          | 44          | 43          | 41                         | 232   |\n\nThe lease commitments correspond to the outstanding minimum future lease payments until the normal date of renewal of the leases or the earliest possible termination date.\n\nReal estate lease commitments in France represent 90% of all real estate lease commitments.\n\n## Transmission capacity purchase commitments\n\nTransmission capacity purchase commitments as at December 31, 2020 represented  1,767  million  euros.

These commitments will require investment expenditure in future years to roll out and enhance the networks. They are not shown in the table above if they have not been expressed in monetary terms, which is usually the case. The Group has accordingly agreed to meet the following conditions:\n\n## In France:\n\n- -the obligations included in the authorization to use 5G frequencies in the 3.4-3.8 GHz band issued to Orange on November 12, 2020 are as follows:\n- -the rollout of sites (3,000 sites by the end of 2022, 8,000 sites by the end of 2024 and 10,500 sites by the end of 2025), of which 25% must be located in rural areas or industrial areas outside of very densely populated areas,\n- -widespread availability of a 5G service at all sites by the end of 2030, an obligation that may be met either with the 3.4-3.8 GHz band or another band,\n- -the provision of a speed of at least 240 Mbps per sector from 75% of sites by the end of 2022, 85% of sites by the end of 2024, 90% of sites by the end of 2025, and 100% of sites by the end of 2030,\n- -coverage of the main highways by the end of 2025, major roads by the end of 2027,\n- -the provision of differentiated services and activation of the IPv6 network protocol (Internet Protocol version 6).\n\nIn  addition, the commitments made by Orange to participate in the first stage of the procedure and which made it possible to obtain 50 MHz at a reserve price became obligations in the authorization issued:\n\n- -from the end of 2023, Orange will have to provide a fixed offer from sites using the 3.5 GHz band and a fixed offer to cover the premises that benefit from fixed-access radio network services,\n- -Orange  will  have  to  meet  reasonable  requests  for  the provision  of  services  from  private  sector  companies  and public  sector  structures,  provide  indoor  coverage,  offer hosting for mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) and be transparent about network failures and planned rollouts;\n- -pursuant to the provisions of Article L. 33-13 of the French Postal & Electronic Communications Code regarding coverage in lightly inhabited areas:\n- -Orange proposed that it commit to ensuring that, within its FTTH deployment scope in the AMII area, unless refused by t h i r d  p a r t i e s ,  t h a t  10 0 % of homes and professional premises would  have  access  to  FTTH  sales  offers  by  the  end  of\n\n- 2020 (including a maximum 8% of premises connectable on demand) and that 100% of homes and professional premises would be made connectable by the end of 2022. Subsequent to the Arcep opinion, these proposals were accepted by the government in July 2018,\n- -outside  of  the  AMII  area,  Orange  proposed  that  it  make deployment  commitments  within  the  AMEL  area  the Vienne,  Haute-Vienne,  Deux-S\u00e8vres  and  Lot-et-Garonne departments,\n- -lastly, Orange proposed to make commitments outside of the  AMII  and  AMEL  areas  in  the  following  departments: Orne,  Hautes-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es,  Yvelines,  Territoire-de-Belfort, Guadeloupe and Martinique;\n- -on January 14, 2018, the Orange Group and the other French mobile operators signed an agreement (the 'New Deal') to ensure bet te r  m o b i l e  c o v e r a g e  o f  F r e n c h  t e r r i t o r y,  p a r t i c u l a r l y  r u r a l  a r e a s . This agreement includes enhanced coverage obligations, which are included for the period 2018-2021 in our licenses in force in the bands 900 MHz, 1,800 MHz and 2,100 MHz, and for the post 2021 period, in the new licenses for 900 MHz, 1,800 MHz and 2,100 MHz awarded on November 15, 2018:\n- -targeted programs for the improvement of coverage, with the coverage of 5,000 areas by operators by 2029,\n- -the generalization of 4G by the end of 2020 on almost all existing mobile sites,\n- -the  acceleration  of  the  coverage  of  the  transport  routes, ensuring that the main road and rail routes have 4G coverage,\n- -the supply of a fixed 4G service and the extension of the service  to  500  additional  sites  upon  request  from  the government by 2020,\n- -the widespread use of telephone coverage inside buildings, proposing voice over Wi-Fi and SMS over Wi-Fi offers and offers  involving  the  indoor  coverage  of  buildings  upon request,\n- -the improvement of reception quality throughout the country, particularly in rural areas, with good coverage (according to the Arcep decision No. 2016-1678 relative to publications giving information on mobile coverage) by 2024-2027;\n- -in 2015, in France, when the frequencies in the 700 MHz band were allocated:\n- -coverage obligations in 'priority deployment areas' (40% of the country within 5 years, 92% within 12 years and 97.7% within 15 years) and in 'white area' not yet covered by a broadband network (100% within 12 years), at the level of priority road routes (100% within 15 years) and at the level of the national rail network (60% within 7 years, 80% within 12 years and 90% within 15 years);\n- -in  2011,  in  France,  when the frequencies in the 2.6 GHz and 800 MHz bands were allocated:\n- -an  optional  commitment  to  host  mobile  virtual  network operators (MVNOs) on certain technical and pricing terms under Full MVNO schemes,\n- -an obligation to provide mobile coverage with theoretical maximum download speeds of at least 60 Mbps per user (25% of the country within 4 years and 75% within 12 years for the 2.6 GHz band, 98% of the country within 12 years and 99.6% within 15 years for the 800 MHz band) which can be met by using both the allocated frequencies and other frequencies,\n- -for the 800 MHz band, specifically: a coverage obligation in  priority  areas  (40% of the country within 5 years, 90% within  10  years)  with  no  obligation  to  provide  roaming services, a coverage obligation in each department (90% within 12 years, 95% within 15 years) and an obligation to pool resources in communities covered by the 'white area' program.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

I n  a d d i t i o n  t o  t h e  g u a r a n t e e s given  by  Orange  on  behalf  of  the  Public  Initiative  Networks,  the commitments will result in the recognition of 1,448 million euros of intangible assets, 2,420 million euros of expenses and 555 million euros of financial receivables. Maturities are staggered to 2043.\n\n## Guarantees granted to third parties in the ordinary course of business\n\nCommitments made by the Group to third parties in the ordinary course of business represented 1,493 million euros at December 31, 2020. They include performance guarantees granted to some of its Enterprise customers, in particular in the context of network security and remote access, and also include 350 million euros in respect of the guarantee granted by the Group to the Arcep corresponding to the reserve price of a 5G frequency block as part of the auction process in 2020.\n\nThe amount of guarantees granted by the Group to third parties (financial  institutions,  partners,  customers  and  government agencies) to cover the performance of the contractual obligations of non-consolidated entities is not significant. Guarantees granted by the Group to cover the performance of the contractual obligations of the consolidated subsidiaries are not considered as unrecognized contractual commitments, as they would not increase the Group's\n\ncommitments in comparison to the underlying  obligations  of  the consolidated subsidiaries.\n\n## 16.2 Consolidation scope commitments\n\n## Asset and liability warranties granted in relation to disposals\n\nUnder the terms of agreements between certain Group companies and the acquirers of certain assets, the Group is subject to warranty clauses  relating  to  assets  and  liabilities.  Nearly  all  material  sale agreements provide for ceilings on these warranties.\n\nAt  December  31,  2020,  the  main  warranties  in  effect  were  the following:\n\n- -the uncapped warranties granted to the EE joint venture when contributing the operations in the United Kingdom, concerning the restructuring of equity investments and assets done prior to the contribution expiring in 2022;\n- -a warranty given to BT as part of the EE sale, backed 50/50 by Orange  Group  and  Deutsche  Telekom  as  tax  and  operating warranties,  except  for  events  ascribable  solely  to  one  or  the other,  and  capped  at  the  contractually  set  disposal  price  of 5.1  billion  pounds  sterling  (5,7  billion  euros  converted  at  the exchange rate at December 31, 2020) for Orange's share, which will expire in 2023;\n- -standard uncapped warranties granted to Vivendi as part of the disposal of Dailymotion in 2015 (of which 90% took place in 2015 and the remaining 10% in 2017). These warranties will expire at the end of the statutory limitation period;\n- -miscellaneous  standard  warranties  granted  to  buyers  of  real estate sold by the Group.\n\nOrange believes that the risk of these warranties being enforced is remote and that the potential consequences of their being called are not material with respect to the Group's results and financial position.\n\n## Commitments relating to securities\n\nUnder  the  terms  of  agreements  with  third  parties,  Orange  can make or receive commitments to purchase or to sell securities. The on-going commitments at December 31, 2020 are not likely to have material impacts on the Group's financial position.\n\n## Orange Tunisie\n\nUnder the terms of the shareholders' agreement with Investec dated May 20, 2009, Orange has a call option giving it the right to purchase at market value 1% of the share capital of Orange Tunisie plus one share, subject to regulatory authorizations. If this option were to be exercised, Orange would take control of Orange Tunisie. Investec would then have the right to sell to Orange 15% of the share capital of Orange Tunisie at market value.\n\n## 16.3 Financing commitments\n\nThe Group's main commitments related to borrowings are set out in Note 14.\n\nOrange has pledged (or given as guarantees) certain investment securities and other assets to financial institutions or used them as collateral to cover bank loans and credit facilities.\n\nGuarantees  granted  to  some  lending  institutions  to  finance consolidated subsidiaries are not set out below.",

These assets are recognized at fair value at inception and subsequently. All changes in fair value are recorded in profit or loss.\n\n- -Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income that may not be reclassified to profit or loss (FVOCI)\n\nInvestment securities which are not consolidated or equity-accounted are, subject to exceptions, recognized as assets at fair value through other comprehensive income that may not be reclassified to profit or loss. They are recognized at fair value at inception and subsequently. Temporary changes in value and gains (losses) on disposals are recorded in other comprehensive income that may not be reclassified to profit or loss.\n\n- -Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income that are or may be reclassified subsequently to profit or loss (FVOCIR)\n\nAssets at fair value through other comprehensive income that are or may be reclassified subsequently to profit or loss mainly include investments in debt securities. They are recognized at fair value at inception and subsequently. Temporary changes in value are recorded in other comprehensive income that are or may be reclassified subsequently to profit or loss. In case of disposal, the cumulative profit (or loss) recognized in other comprehensive income is reclassified to profit or loss.\n\n- -Financial assets at amortized cost (AC)\n\nThis category primarily comprises miscellaneous loans and receivables as well as fixed-income securities held with the aim of collecting contractual flows. These instruments are recognized at fair value at inception and are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Impairment and provisions are recorded as soon as loans are granted or commitments are concluded, without waiting for the appearance of an objective indication of impairment. Impairment and provisions are updated as the credit risk evolves (see below 'Impairment of financial assets').\n\n## Impairment of financial assets\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 9, debt instruments classified as financial assets at amortized cost or as financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income, rental receivables, financing commitments and financial guarantees given are systematically subject to impairment or a provision for expected credit loss. These impairments and provisions are recorded as soon as loans are granted, commitments are concluded or bond securities are acquired, without waiting for the appearance of an objective indication of impairment.\n\nTo do this, the financial assets concerned are split into three categories according to the change in credit risk observed since their initial recognition and a depreciation is recorded on the amount outstanding of each of these categories as follows:\n\n- -per f o r m i n g  l o a n s :  t h e  c a l c u l a t i o n  o f  l o s s e s  e x p e c t e d  i s  m a d e  o n  a  12 - m o n t h s  b a s i s ,  a n d  t h e  fi n a n c i a l  i n c o m e  ( i n t e r e s t )  i s  c a l c u l a t e d on the basis of the instrument's gross amount;\n- -impaired loans: if the credit risk has significantly worsened since the debt has been booked to the balance sheet, the expected losses, estimated over the duration of the loan, are recognized and the financial income (interest) is calculated based on the gross amount of the instrument;\n- -doubtful loans: the expected loss, estimated over the duration of the loan, is depreciated. The financial income is calculated on the basis of the amount of the instrument net of the depreciation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

The fair value of these derivatives at December 31, 2020 was (16) million euros;\n- -210  million  euros  in  notional  value  hedging  a  portfolio  of French inflation-indexed fungible Treasury bonds (Obligations Assimilables du Tr\u00e9sor index\u00e9es sur l'inflation fran\u00e7aise - OATi) of the same amount and maturity, i.e. 2023. The fair value of these swaps at December 31, 2020 was (47) million euros;\n- -182 million  euros  in  notional  value  (of  which  32  million  euros maturing in 2021, 50 million euros maturing between one and two years and 100 million euros at more than five years), hedging a  portfolio  of  French  fungible  Treasury  bonds  (Obligations Assimilables du Tr\u00e9sor - OAT) of the same amount and maturity. The fair value of these swaps at December 31, 2020 was (6) million euros;\n- -20 million euros in notional value hedging a portfolio of OATi of the same amount and maturity, i.e. 2030. The fair value of these swaps at December 31, 2020 was (5) million euros;\n- -5 million euros in notional value hedging a portfolio of securities maturing in 2028 whose fair value at December 31, 2020 was (1) million euros.\n\nThe ineffective portion of these hedges recognized in profit or loss in 2020 was not material.\n\n## Cash flow hedge derivatives\n\nAt January 1, 2020, Orange Bank had documented a micro-hedge of  its  issues  with  interest  rate  swaps  which,  at  the  end  of  2020, represented:\n\n- -242 million  euros  in  notional  value  (of  which  94  million  euros maturing in 2021 and 148 million euros maturing between one and two years) hedging negotiable debt securities issued by the bank, the fair value of which at December 31, 2020 was almost zero.\n\n## Trading Derivatives\n\n- -Orange Bank has set up interest rate swaps as economic hedges (not designated as hedges under IFRS) of EIB securities for a total notional amount of 10 million euros maturing in 2029, the fair value of which was (1) million euros at December 31, 2020. The net effects of this hedging strategy on the income statement are not material;\n- -Orange Bank has a portfolio of trading swaps with a total notional value  of  28  million  euros  (of  which  18  million  euros  maturing between two and five years and 10 million euros at more than five years) and a total fair value at December 31, 2020 of (1) million euros. The net effects of this hedging strategy on the income statement are not material;\n- -Orange Bank has set up interest rate futures with a notional amount  of  202  million  euros.  The  notional  amount  of  these derivatives gives only an indication of the volume of outstanding contracts on the financial instruments markets and does not reflect the market risks associated with such instruments or the nominal value of the hedged instruments. The net effects of this hedging strategy on profit or loss are not material.\n\n## 17.2 Information on market risk management with respect to Orange Bank activities\n\nOrange Bank has its own risk management system in accordance with banking regulations. In terms of banking regulation, Orange Bank is under the supervision of the French Prudential Supervision and Resolution Authority (Autorit\u00e9 de contr\u00f4le prudentiel et de r\u00e9solution - ACPR) and must at all times comply with capital requirements in order to withstand the risks associated with its activities.\n\nOrange  Bank's  activities  expose  it  to  all  of  the  risks  defined  by the ordinance of November 3, 2014, relating to the internal control of  companies  in  the  banking,  payment  services  and  investment services sector subject to the control of the ACPR:\n\n- -credit  risk:  risk  of  loss  incurred  in  the  event  of  the  default  of a  counterparty  or  counterparties  considered  as  the  same beneficiary;\n- -market risk: risk of loss due to movements in market prices;\n- -operational risk: risk resulting from an inadequacy or a failure due to procedures, staff, IT systems or to outside events, including events that are unlikely to occur but that would imply a risk of",

Operational  risk  includes  risks  of  internal  and external fraud;\n\n- -interest rate risk: risk incurred in the event of changes in interest rates  impacting  on-balance  sheet  and  off-balance  sheet transactions, excluding, where applicable, transactions exposed to market risks;\n- -liquidity risk: risk that the company would not be able to meet its commitments or not be able to unwind or offset a position due to the market situation;\n- -inter-mediation  risk  on  investment  service  providers:  risk of  default  by  a  customer  or  counterparty  in  the  context  of  a financial instrument transaction in which the company provides a performance guarantee.\n\nThe size of the bank and its moderate risk profile led to the choice of  standard methods regarding the application of Regulation No. 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council on June 26, 2013.\n\nOrange Bank does not intervene on complex products. For market operations, the strategy defines, on one hand, the limits implemented and controlled and, on the other hand, the quality of the authorized signatories. In addition, the Bank has defined and regularly tests its business continuity system. The Bank has also undertaken, as comprehensively as possible, the identification and assessment of its operational risks, for which it also monitors occurrences.\n\nIn  line  with  regulations,  and  in  particular  Titles  IV  and  V  of  the Ordinance of November 3, 2014, the bank's Executive Committee, upon  recommendation  of  the  Risk  Management  Department, sets the institution's risk policy, in particular regarding selection of customers and risks, modalities and rules for granting loans, and delegations of authority.\n\nThe Risk Management Department analyzes and monitors risks, carries out the necessary controls and produces reports for various committees: the Credit Committee (management of counterparty risk), Risks and Audit Committee (management of operational risks), ALM Committee (management of market, interest rate and liquidity risks) and the Executive Committee.\n\n## 17.2.1 Market risk management\n\nOrange Bank does not carry out trading operations on its own behalf, its  market activity only concerns investments to optimize liquidity management and purchases mainly of interest rate hedges.\n\nSince  the  start  of  the  health  crisis,  Orange  Bank  has  noted  an increase in credit risk for all counterparties issuing on the financial markets.\n\nThe rise in expected and unexpected loss during the health crisis has increased the average probability of default of the securities portfolio. To ensure the quality of the investments held by the bank, a stress test was carried out on the portfolio and the results showed good resistance to the various simulated shocks. Nevertheless, as a precautionary measure, the investment rules have been reviewed, in particular by reducing the limits on the sectors most affected by the pandemic, reviewing the maturities and reassessing the probability of default of each counterparty.\n\nMarket risk was characterized by increased volatility on all financial markets with a return to normal at the end of 2020. The absence of exposure to trading portfolios, the bank's low exposure in terms of its investment portfolios and the fact that it has a significant proportion of low-risk government securities have made it possible to minimize the potential risks.\n\n## 17.2.2 Liquidity risk management\n\nThe  onset  of  the  health  crisis  was  characterized  by  difficulty  in accessing liquidity on the financial markets. Orange Bank anticipated\n\nthis situation by deciding to retain significant liquidity and continued to manage its liquidity prudently throughout the crisis.\n\nAt the end of December 2020, the LCR ratio (short-term liquidity ratio)  was  435%,  thus  providing  sufficient  liquidity  to  cover  any short-term needs. The Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) was 150%. In order to anticipate future liquidity needs, Orange Bank intensified the diversification of its funding sources, notably with the launch of a securitization program and an increase in deposit receipts (unaudited regulatory ratios).\n\n## 17.2.3 Credit risk management\n\nOrange Bank has maintained a cautious provisioning policy. At the end of 2020, and in line with the requirements of IFRS 9 to take into account economic forecasts in estimating future losses, the bank reviewed the economic scenarios used to determine the provisions for  credit  risk  relating  to  commitments  to  customers.  Provisions have been increased to anticipate the expected increase in defaults in 2021.\n\nThe cost of credit risk amounted to (30) million euros (i.e. 1.6% of average outstandings), of which (15) million euros related to the health crisis (i.e. 0.8% of average outstandings).\n\nIn France, a provision of 6 million euros was recognized on consumer loans at December 31, 2020. It takes into account three scenarios (central, optimistic and pessimistic) weighted respectively at 70%, 20% and 10% on the provisioning model of the economic forecasts of GDP in France published by the Banque de France and the OECD.\n\nFor  mortgage  loans  and  other  markets  (large  companies, professionals  and  private  banking),  Orange  Bank  recognized  a provision of 5 million euros for sectors deemed vulnerable, such as hotels and commercial real estate. Despite the quality of borrowers and existing guarantees, the bank estimates that the health crisis could still lead to business failures.\n\nIn Spain, Orange Bank recognized a provision of 4 million euros to cover the impacts of the health crisis on the portfolio of installment receivables.\n\nOrange Bank has also recorded a provision of 4 million euros on the consumer credit portfolio with the aim of taking into account the impact of the entry into force of the new definition of default from January 1, 2021.\n\nIn addition, and in response to the health crisis, Orange Bank has adapted its credit management practices by adhering to the FBFASF market protocol concerning deferral and rescheduling of loans to companies and professionals. At December 31, 2020, the total exposure related to customers whose payments had been deferred amounted to 15 million euros (1.8% of the portfolio) for mortgage loans, 22 million euros (2.7% of outstandings) for consumer loans and 66 million euros (25% of the portfolio) for company and professional portfolios.  The  majority  of  postponements  have  expired  and  the resumption of repayments took place without significant incidents.\n\n## 17.2.4 Remaining term to maturity\n\nThe following table details the remaining terms of Orange Bank's financial  assets  and  liabilities,  calculated  on  the  basis  of  the contractual maturity dates:\n\n- -maturity-by-maturity for amortizable transactions;\n- -for  roll-over  loans,  since  renewals  cannot  be  presumed,  the renewal dates are taken to be the final maturity dates;\n- -since derivatives are interest rate swaps, they are not subject to any exchange of notional. Their fair value has been broken down by maturity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

After  several  successive i ncreases in April 2016 and September 2018, SFR raised its claim from the initial 512 million euros to 3 billion euros in July 2019. The Group believes this claim represents a risk. In the wake of this decision, C\u00e9leste and Adista also brought actions against Orange before the Paris Commercial Court for damages. To date, the overall claims of SFR, C\u00e9leste and Adista represent a total of 3.1 billion euros. These cases are currently being investigated by the courts and a decision of the Paris Commercial Court is expected by the end of the first quarter 2021 in the SFR case.\n- -Concurrently to their complaints filed with the French Competition Authority,  regarding  practices  of  Orange  in  the  mobile  and fixed-to-mobile markets in the French Caribbean and in French Guyana, for which Orange was definitively ordered to pay a fine of  63  million  euros  in  December  2009  reduced  to  60  million euros by the Paris Court of Appeal in July 2013, Digicel and Outremer Telecom initiated before the Paris Commercial Court respectively in March 2009 and October 2010, legal actions for alleged damages stemming from these practices, in an amount which Digicel had assessed at 329 million euros increased to 493 million euros in November 2015 and Outremer at 75 million euros. After it was ordered by the Paris Commercial Court in March 2015 that 8 million euros should be paid to Outremer Telecom, the Paris Court of Appeal decreased the amount of the  fine  to  3  million  euros  in  May  2017,  noting inter alia  that the  damages  should  be  discounted  at  the  statutory  rate  of interests. On December 18, 2017 the Paris Commercial Court ordered Orange to pay Digicel the sum of 180 million euros, to be discounted from March 2009 until the date of payment at a rate of interest higher than that adopted by the Paris Court of Appeal in the Outremer Telecom litigation, i.e. a total amount of 346 million euros. Orange filed an appeal and, at the same time, obtained from the Paris Court of Appeal on February 6, 2018, the right to escrow only the notional amount of the penalty until the court ruled on the merits of the case. On June 17, 2020, the Paris Court of Appeal overturned the discounting method applied to  the  damages  set  forth  in  the  judgement  rendered  by  the Paris Commercial Court on December 18, 2017, which ordered Orange to pay to Digicel 180 million euros in principal. Following this judgment, Orange was refunded 97 million euros. Orange appealed to the French Supreme Court and re-assessed the risk r e l a t e d  t o  t h e  p o s s i b l e  r e v e r s a l  o f  t h e  C o u r t  o f  A p p e a l 's  j u d g m e n t , which  would  return  the  parties  to  the  situation  following  the first-instance court's decision.\n\n## Fixed-line services\n\n- -In  2010,  SFR  and  then  Verizon  summoned  Orange  SA  to appear  before  the  Paris  Commercial  Court  demanding  the reimbursement  of  alleged  overpayments  on  interconnection services provided by Orange, the price of which allegedly did not reflect their cost. On June 18 and 25, 2013, the Paris Commercial Court dismissed their claims but ordered Orange to pay Verizon 1 million euros damages with respect to services provided in 2008. Orange paid this amount in 2013. SFR and Verizon filed appeals against these decisions. In December 2015, the Paris Court of Appeal dismissed in full the claims made by SFR and confirmed the first instance decision. In September 2017, the French  Supreme  Court  rejected  SFR's  appeal.  Furthermore, in  April  2017,  the  Paris  Court  of  Appeal  dismissed  Verizon completely and reversed the compensation of 1 million euros granted for services provided in 2008. On June 5, 2019, the French Supreme Court annulled the decision of the Paris Court\n\n- of Appeal and restored the parties to the situation they were in following the first instance court's decision rendered on June 25, 2013. The proceedings are still ongoing.\n- -In 2012, SFR brought an action against Orange SA before the Paris  Commercial  Court  denouncing  its  retail  offers  for  the secondary residences market and claiming 218 million euros for losses allegedly suffered. In February 2014, the trial court ruled that Orange had abused its dominant position and ordered it to pay 51 million euros in damages to SFR. In October 2014, the  Paris  Court  of  Appeal  annulled  this  decision  which  was then reversed by the French Supreme Court on April 12, 2016. Orange had then to pay 53 million euros to SFR pursuant to the trial court's ruling. SFR had raised its claims to 257 million euros before the Court of Appeal. On June 8, 2018, the Court of Appeal sentenced Orange to pay 54 million euros. Orange paid the balance following the cancellation of the previous ruling from the Court of Appeal and appealed to the French Supreme Court.  On  September  16,  2020,  the  French  Supreme  Court overturned the judgment handed down by the Court of Appeal and restored the parties to the situation they were in following the Paris Commercial Court's decision. Orange applied to the Court of Appeal to have its conviction overturned and the return of the sums awarded.\n\n## Other proceedings in France\n\n- -In  June  2018,  Iliad  brought  summary  proceedings  against Orange SA before the presiding judge of the Paris Commercial Court,  aiming  to  ban  some  of  its  mobile  telephony  offers proposing mobile handsets at attractive prices accompanied by a subscription package, on the grounds that they constituted consumer credit offers. The case is currently being investigated by the judges deciding on the merits of the case. On October 16, 2020, Il i a d ,  f o r  t h e  fi r s t  t i m e ,  a s s e s s e d  i t s  l o s s  a t  7 9 0  m i l l i o n  e u r o s .\n- -I n  D e c e m b e r  2 0 18  t h e  a d m i n i s t r a t o r s  o f  f o r m e r  U K  r e t a i l e r  P h o n e s 4U, (which is in administration and no longer trading), filed a claim against the three main UK mobile network operators, including EE, and their respective existing or former parent companies including  Orange.  The  claim  (of  an  unquantified  amount)  is currently being disputed before the High Court of England and Wales. Orange challenges vigorously the allegations raised by Phones 4U which include collusion.\n- -Orange  Bank  is  the  object  of  two  historic  lawsuits  whereby the plaintiffs claim in total about 350 million euros in financial damages that they allege to have suffered. As Orange Bank believes these claims to be without merit and is contesting them strongly, the Group has not recognized any financial liability.\n- -In August 2020, ASSIA brought proceedings against Orange SA before  the  Paris  Civil  Court  for  infringement  of  two  dynamic xDSL line management patents. ASSIA claims a total of around 500  million  euros  for  the  financial  damage  it  claims  to  have suffered. Orange SA considers its claims to be unfounded and challenges them. The proceedings are currently being examined by the judges deciding on the merits of the case.\n- -The Evaluation and Compensation Committee, set up as part of the France Telecom employee-related crisis trial, to examine individual claims submitted by individuals present in the company between  2007  and  2010  and  their  beneficiaries,  extended the  period  for  submitting  files  until  December  31,  2020.  This Committee is continuing to analyze and process the requests received. At the end of December 2020, around 1,700 individual requests  had  been  received,  about  470  of  which  had  been closed subsequent to an agreement and the other requests are being processed.\n\n## Poland\n\n- -In 2011, the Polish Competition Authority (UOKiK) sanctioned the four major Polish mobile operators, including Orange Polska,",

This sanction was nullified in 2015 by the Court for the protection of competition and consumers. In 2017, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal of the UOKiK, who appealed to the Supreme Court. On November 26, 2016, the company Magna Polonia brought suit jointly and severally against  the  operators  to  the  Warsaw  Commercial  Court  and claimed 618 million zlotys (144 million euros) for the damages it allegedly sustained due to these practices. On February 9, 2018, the Warsaw Commercial Court examined the Magna Polonia claim and decided to postpone its ruling until after the Polish Supreme Court had come to a decision. On October 31, 2019, the Supreme Court confirmed the inexistence of collusive practices, thus rendering the claim made by Magna Polonia to the Warsaw Commercial Court without merits. In November 2019, Magna Polonia withdrew from the proceedings and, on December 13, 2019,  the  court  interrupted  the  proceedings.  The  dispute  is now closed.\n\n- -In 2013, the UOKiK opened an investigation on the country's three main mobile operators, including Orange Polska, for abuse of a dominant position in relation with the retail rates imposed by these three operators on the calls made to the network of the polish P4 operator. On January 2, 2018, UOKIK suspended the  proceedings  against  the  three  operators  as  there  were no  longer  anti-competitive  grounds.  In  addition,  in  2015  P4 issued two claims for damages for a total amount of 630 million zlotys (138 million euros) against the three operators jointly, as compensation for the loss it alleged to have suffered in relation to the contested pricing practices. In 2018, the Court of First Instance dismissed in its entirety the first compensation claim in  the  amount  of  316  million  zlotys  (70  million  euros).  P4  has appealed  against  this  decision.  On  December  28,  2020,  the Court of Appeal dismissed the judgment rendered by the Court of First Instance and referred the parties to the Court of First Instance. P4's second claim for compensation for 314 million zlotys (69 million euros) has not yet been notified on Orange Polska.\n\n## Romania\n\n- -On March 29, 2016, i nve s t i g a t o r s  f r o m  t h e  R o m a n i a n  C o m p e t i t i o n Council made an investigation at the headquarters of Orange Romania,  concerning  possible  discriminatory  practices  in the  mobile  payment  and  advertising  markets.  Following  the investigation, the Competition Council fined Orange Romania 65 million leu (13 million euros) on December 18, 2018. Orange Romania was notified of this decision on April 15, 2019 and filed an appeal on May 9, 2019.

These disputes, which concern various  breaches  of  contractual  documents,  are  the  subject of  pre-contentious  proceedings  and  arbitral  and  judicial proceedings in various countries. In addition, on March 19, 2019, following an administrative decree adopted by the Iraqi Ministry of  Trade and Industry, the General Directorate of Companies in Erbil (Iraqi Kurdistan) implemented the 2014 decision of the Iraqi regulatory authority (CMC) to cancel the partnership dated March 2011 between the operator Korek Telecom, Agility and Orange and to restore the shareholding of Korek Telecom as it existed before Orange and Agility had acquired a stake.

Orange thus considers that it was thus unlawfully expropriated of its investment and, on March 24, 2019, sent a notice of dispute to the Republic of Iraq based on the Bilateral lnvestment Treaty between France and Iraq.  In  the  absence  of  an  amicable  settlement  with  the Iraqi State, Orange submitted a request for arbitration with the International Center for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) on October 2, 2020.\n- -In Jordan, the telecom operator Zain, brought an action against Jordan  Telecommunications  Company  (Orange  Jordan)  for failure to open geographical numbers allocated by the Jordanian r e g u l a t o r.

Orange Jordan considers that the amount of the claim is not justified.\n\nIn  order  to  provide  its  telecommunication  services,  the  Group sometimes uses fixed assets of other parties. Terms of use of these assets are not always formalized. The Group is sometimes subject of  claims  and  might  be  subject  to  future  claims  in  this  respect, which could result in a cash outflow in the future. The amount of the potential obligations or future commitments cannot be measured with sufficient reliability due to legal complexities involved.\n\nOther than proceedings that may be initiated in respect of tax and social audits (see Notes 7.2 and 11), there are no other administrative, legal or arbitration proceedings, including any proceedings that are pending, suspended or threatened, of which Orange is aware of, which may have or have had in the last 12 months a material impact on the Company's and/or Group's financial position or profitability.\n\nof Orange Concessions.

It is engaged in both operational activities and subsidiary financing activities for the Orange group. The Company provides its B2C and B2B customers and other telecommunication operators with a wide range of services including fixed telephony and mobile  telecommunications,  data  transmission,  Internet  and multimedia, and other value-added services.\n\nThe Company's purpose, as laid down in Article 2 of the Bylaws, is as follows: 'As a trusted partner, Orange gives everyone the keys to a responsible digital world'.\n\nOrange SA is governed by French law on public limited companies (soci\u00e9t\u00e9s anonymes), subject to specific laws governing the Company,\n\nparticularly French law No. 90-568 of July 2, 1990 relating to the organization of public postal and telecommunication services, and Government Order 2014-948 of August 20, 2014 on the governance and  capital  transactions  of  companies  with  public  shareholding. Orange SA is also regulated by its Bylaws.\n\nThe activities of the Company are governed primarily by European Union  directives  and  by  the  French  Postal  and  Electronic Communications  Code  (Code  fran\u00e7ais  des  postes  et  des communications \u00e9lectroniques).\n\nOrange SA has been listed since 1997 on Euronext Paris (symbol: ORA) and on the New York Stock Exchange (symbol: ORAN).\n\n## Note 2 Impact of the health crisis linked to the Covid-19 pandemic\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic that affected France and the world in 2020 prompted Orange SA to rapidly implement actions to protect its employees, suppliers, subcontractors and customers and, further afield, all of its stakeholders.\n\nTheir  rollout,  as  well  as  the  decisions  taken  by  governments, affected Orange's activities and financial position; moreover, their consequences are not  easily  quantifiable,  as  they  are  difficult  to separate from other factors affecting the period.\n\nHowever, in 2020, the main effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on Orange SA's revenue are as follows:\n\n- -a  widespread  and  significant  decline  in  revenues  from international roaming (customers and visitors);\n- -a sharp decline in equipment sales;\n- -lower than expected growth in revenues from fixed-line services to operators;\n- -a slowdown in services to businesses;\n- -a general decline in sales activity.\n\n## Note 3 Notes to the income statement\n\n## 3.1 Revenue\n\n| (in millions of euros)    | 2020   | 2019   |\n|---------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Convergence services      | 5,150  | 5,030  |\n| Mobile services only      | 2,583  | 2,757  |\n| Fixed-line services only  | 7,073  | 7,148  |\n| IT & integration services | 650    | 676    |\n| Other carrier services    | 5,135  | 5,280  |\n| Equipment sales           | 975    | 1,050  |\n| Other revenue             | 1,036  | 849    |\n| Total  (1)                | 22,602 | 22,790 |\n\n- (1) Revenue generated outside France is not significant.\n\nBreakdown of revenue by product line is as follows:\n\n- -revenue from convergent services i n c l u d e s  r e v e n u e  i n v o i c e d  t o B2C customers of convergent of fers (excluding equipment sales, see the definition of this term) defined as the combination of at least a fixed broadband access (xDSL, FTTx, cable, 4G fixed) and a mobile contract;\n- -revenue from mobile services only includes revenue billed to mobile contract customers (incoming and outgoing calls: voice, SMS and data), excluding convergent services and equipment sales (see these definitions);\n\n- -revenue  for fixed-line  services only includes  revenue  billed to clients for fixed services excluding convergent services and equipment sales (see these definitions). It includes conventional fixed telephony, fixed broadband services, business solutions and  networks  (with  the  exception  of  France,  for  which  most business solutions and networks are suppor ted by the Enterprise operating segment);\n- -revenue  from IT & integration services includes  revenues from  unified  communication  and  collaboration  services (Local Area Network and telephony, consultancy, integration, project  management,  video-conference  offers),  hosting  and\n\nAt December 31, 2020, the main specific additional costs incurred by the management of the health crisis on operating income (loss) were estimated at around 150 million euros, mainly related to:\n\n- -costs related to health arrangements;\n- -measures  to  support  certain  network  services  in  order  to maintain activity  and  offset  part  of  the  fixed  costs  of  service providers in France;\n- -donations and sponsorships;\n- -the  payment  of  specific  bonuses  to  some  employees  in connection with the health crisis;\n- -losses and provisions on trade receivables.\n\nConcerning Orange SA's investments, the main effect is a reduction in investments, linked to the slowdown or temporary postponement of a certain number of projects, despite a rebound in the second half of the year.\n\nLastly, the effects of the health crisis were assessed as part of asset impairment tests using the estimates and assumptions specified in Note 4.2.

This amount mainly comprises an income ta x expense of (447) million euros and income from tax consolidation of 63 million euros accruing to Orange SA, the parent company of the tax consolidation group, and tax credits in the amount of 52 million euros.\n\nOrange SA has elected for Group tax consolidation relief with various subsidiaries. At December 31, 2020, the tax consolidation group comprised 73 companies (79 companies at December 31, 2019).\n\nThe Company's net future tax relief reflects an amount in the order of  231 million euros at December 31, 2020, (485 million euros at December 31, 2019), which is primarily linked to the provision for employee benefits. This relief will mainly be applied over the period from 2021 to 2029.\n\n## Developments in tax disputes and audits\n\n## Tax audits\n\nOrange SA was subject to a tax audit covering fiscal years 2015 to 2016. An amending proposal was issued covering the calculation of trademark fees paid by Orange SA to the British company Orange Brand  Services  Ltd  and  deducted  from  its  taxable  income.  The administration questions the inclusion of revenue from the roaming contract  with  Free  and  revenue  from  the  fixed  PSTN  business. This rectification request is contested by the Company, which has requested the opening of out-of-court proceedings and arbitration between the French and British tax authorities. The additional tax charge would effectively result in double taxation that would fail to comply with the provisions of the Franco-British tax agreement and the European arbitration agreement.\n\nOrange SA is currently subject to a tax audit covering fiscal years 2017 to 2018.",

        "page_content": "## Litigation in respect of fiscal years 2000-2006\n\nIn  the  context  of  the  absorption  of  Cogecom by Orange SA and pursuant to an adverse ruling by the Court of Montreuil on July 4, 2013 which triggered the payment of the amounts claimed by the Tax authority, the Company had to pay in 2013 the remaining balance on principal and late payment interest claimed for a total amount of 2.1 billion euros.\n\nOver the last few years, the main developments in terms of legal proceedings brought before the Versailles Administrative Court of Appeal were the following:\n\n- -concerning fiscal years 2000-2004:\n- -in a ruling given on July 24, 2018, the Administrative Court of Appeal of Versailles upheld the request from Orange SA. As the Tax administration did not appeal in cassation, this litigation  is  now  closed.  The  accounting  consequences were taken into account in the 2018 consolidated financial statements with no material impact;\n- -concerning fiscal years 2005-2006:\n\n- -in a ruling of February 18, 2016, the Administrative Court of  Appeal  of  Versailles  upheld  the  judgment  of  July  4, 2013,  despite  the  contrary  conclusions  of  the  appointed Rapporteur.  The  Company then appealed to the Conseil d'\u00c9tat on April 18, 2016 to rule on the substance of the case,\n- -in  a  ruling  dated  December  5,  2016,  the  Conseil d'\u00c9tat annulled the February 18, 2016 ruling by the Administrative Court of Appeal of Versailles and remanded the dispute to the same Court, on the grounds argued by the Company, i.e., the principle of intangibility of the opening balance sheet of the earliest fiscal year still subject to audit,\n- -in  a  ruling  dated  July  24,  2018,  the  Administrative  Court of Appeal of Versailles made an adverse decision against Orange, despite the contrary conclusions of the appointed Rapporteur.  The  Company  appealed  in  cassation  to  the Conseil d'\u00c9tat which was to render the final decision,\n- -in  a  ruling  dated  November  13,  2020,  the Conseil d'\u00c9tat handed down a decision favorable to Orange SA on this tax dispute. This decision closes the procedure definitively. The accounting consequences are tax income recognized in the 2020 financial statements for a total amount of 2,246 million euros (including 646 million euros of interest).\n\n## Note 4 Notes on the balance sheet - assets\n\n## 4.1 Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets\n\n## 4.1.1 Intangible  assets\n\n| (in millions of euros)                    | 2020    | 2019    |\n|-------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Net value at beginning of period          | 26,700  | 26,846  |\n| Acquisitions                              | 1,919   | 990     |\n| of which licenses  (1)                    | 877     | 10      |\n| of which trademarks, patents and software | 769     | 706     |\n| of which development costs                | 217     | 232     |\n| Disposals                                 | (15)    | (22)    |\n| Depreciation, amortization and impairment | (1,152) | (1,118) |\n| Other items                               | 3       | 4       |\n| Net value at end of period                | 27,455  | 26,700  |\n\n- (1) Includes in 2020, the acquisition of blocks of 5G frequencies for an amount of 875 million euros.\n\n| (in millions of euros)                | December 31, 2020   | December 31, 2020                            | December 31, 2020   | December 31, 2020   |\n|---------------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n|                                       | Gross value         | Accumulated  depreciation  and  amortization | Impairment          | Net value           |\n| Development costs                     | 1,217               | (584)                                        | -                   | 633                 |\n| Concessions, similar rights, patents, |                     |                                              |                     |                     |\n| licenses, trademarks, software        | 9,059               | (4,540)                                      | (16)                | 4,503               |\n| of which licenses                     | 4,344               | (1,701)                                      | (16)                | 2,626               |\n| Goodwill                              | 22,785              | (56)                                         | (647)               | 22,082              |\n| of which merger losses                | 22,629              | -                                            | (550)               | 22,079              |\n| Other intangible assets               | 572                 | (331)                                        | (4)                 | 237                 |\n| Total                                 | 33,633              | (5,511)                                      | (667)               | 27,455              |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

The  entire strategic plan will be updated in 2021.\n\nThe key operating assumptions used to determine values in use are common across all of the Group's business segments. These assumptions include:\n\n- -key revenue assumptions, which reflect market level, penetration r a t e  o f  t h e  o f f e r s  a n d  m a r k e t  s h a r e ,  p o s i t i o n i n g  o f  t h e  c o m p e t i t i o n ' s offers and their potential impact on market price levels and their transposition to the Group's offer bases, regulatory authority decisions on pricing of services to customers and on access and pricing of inter-operator services, technology migration of networks (e.g.  extinction  of  copper  local  loops),  decisions  of competition authorities in terms of concentration or regulation of adjacent sectors such as cable;\n- -key  cost  assumptions,  on  the  level  of  marketing  expenses required  to  deal  with  the  pace  of  product  line  renewals  and the positioning of the competition, the ability to adjust costs to potential changes in revenues or the effects of natural attrition and employee departure plans underway;\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

Civil servants employed by Orange SA are covered by the government-sponsored civil and military pension plan. Orange SA's obligation under the plan is limited to the payment of annual contributions (French law No. 96-660 dated July 26, 1996). Consequently, Orange SA has no obligation to fund future deficits of the pension plans covering its own civil servant employees or any other civil service plans;\n- -Orange SA also provides a defined-benefit plan in the form of annuities for Senior Management in the amount of 196 million euros. The plan assets of this plan were transferred. For several years now, this plan has been closed to new members;\n- -Orange  SA  is  also  committed,  in  the  amount  of  909  million euros for private sector employees and 27 million euros for civil servants, to capital-based defined-benefit plans : under the laws of some countries or contractual agreements, employees are entitled to certain lump-sum payments or bonuses on retirement depending on their years of service and end of career salary;\n- -other post-employment benefits are also granted to retired employees: these are benefits other than defined-benefit and defined-contribution plans;\n- -other long-term benefits may also be granted such as seniority awards,  long-term  compensated  absences  and  the  French part-time for seniors plans (TPS) detailed below.\n\n## French part-time for seniors plans\n\nThe part-time for seniors plans are accessible to civil servants and employees under private contract from the French entities who are eligible for full retirement benefits within 3 to 5 years and who have at least 15 years service within the Group. Eligible employees are those who will retire no later than January 1, 2025.\n\nThese plans give employees the opportunity to work 50% or 60% of a full-time job whilst receiving:\n\n- -a base salary between 65% and 80% of full-time employment;\n- -the  retirement  entitlement  benefits  of  full-time  employment during  the  period  in  question  (both  the  Company's  and  the employee's contributions);\n- -a minimum salary level.\n\nThese plans last for a period of at least 18 months and no longer than five years.\n\nThe beneficiaries may decide to invest part of their base compensation (5%, 10% or 15%) in a Time Savings Account (CET), with an additional Group contribution. The CET allows for a reduction in the amount of time worked.\n\nAt December 31, 2020 33,000 employees had signed up for TPS, 26,100 of  whom have already passed through it. The number of employees who are or will be participating in the French part-time for seniors plans and thus included in the provision, is estimated approximately at 9,950 employees.\n\nAt December 31, 2020, the provision for TPS was 791 million euros (versus 1,218 million euros at December 31, 2019).\n\n## Key assumptions used to calculate the amount of obligations\n\nThe assessment of post-employment benefits and other long-term benefits i s b a s e d  o n  r e t i r e m e n t  a g e  c a l c u l a t e d  i n  a c c o r d a n c e  w i t h  t h e provisions applicable to each plan and the necessary conditions to ensure entitlement to a full pension, both of which are often subject to legislative changes.\n\nThe valuation of the obligation of the French part-time for seniors plans is sensitive to estimates of the potentially eligible population",

The estimated increase in the capital of this plan is based on a long-term inflation assumption of\n\n(in millions of euros)\n\n## Discount rates\n\nSign-up rates (1) for French part-time for seniors plans\n\n- (1) Sensitivity is performed on future entries to the TPS.\n\n2% associated with the effect of a higher 'GVT' (acronym for Wage drift  -  Seniority  -  Job-skills).

        "page_content": "## Orange's credit ratings\n\nOrange's credit rating is an additional performance indicator used to assess the Group's financial policy and risk management policy and, in particular, its solvency and liquidity risk, and is not a substitute for an analysis carried out by investors. Rating agencies revise the ratings  they  assign  on  a  regular  basis.  Any  change  in  the  rating could produce an impact on the cost of future financing or restrict access to liquidity.\n\nIn  addition,  a  change  in  Orange's  credit  rating  will,  for  certain outstanding financing, affect the compensation paid to investors:\n\n- -one Orange SA bond with an outstanding amount of 2.5 billion dollars  maturing  in  2031  (equivalent  to  2.0  billion  euros  at\n\nDecember 31, 2020) is subject to a Step-up clause in the event that  Orange's  rating  changes.  This  clause  was  triggered  in 2013 and early 2014: the coupon due in March 2014 was thus computed on the basis of an interest rate of 8.75% and since then, the bond bears interest at the rate of 9%;\n\n- -the margin of the syndicated credit line of 6 billion euros might be modified in light of changes to Orange's credit rating, upwards or downwards. As at December 31, 2020, the credit facility was not drawn.\n\nAt December 31, 2020, neither Orange's credit ratings nor the outlook had changed compared with December 31, 2019:\n\n|                 | Standard & Poor's   | Moody's   | Fitch Ratings   |\n|-----------------|---------------------|-----------|-----------------|\n| Long-term debt  | BBB+                | Baa1      | BBB+            |\n| Outlook         | Stable              | Stable    | Stable          |\n| Short-term debt | A2                  | P2        | F2              |\n\n## 5.5.4 Financial  covenants\n\n## Commitments with regard to financial ratios\n\nOrange SA does not have any credit facilities or loans subject to specific covenants with regard to financial ratios.\n\n## Commitments related to instances of default or material adverse changes\n\nMost  of  Orange  SA's  financing  agreements,  in  particular  the 6 billion-euro syndicated credit facility, as well as bond issues, are not subject to early redemption obligations in the event of a material adverse change, or cross-default provisions. Most of these contracts include cross acceleration provisions. Thus, the mere occurrence of  events  of  default  in  other  financing  agreements  would  not automatically trigger accelerated repayment under such contracts.\n\n## 5.5.5 Credit risk and counterparty risk management\n\nOrange  SA  may  be  exposed  to  counterparty  risk  through  trade receivables, cash and cash equivalents, investments and derivative financial instruments.\n\nOrange  SA  considers  that  it  has  limited  counterparty  risk  with respect to trade accounts due to its large and diverse customer base (residential, professional and large business customers) operating in  numerous industries and located in many French regions and foreign countries. The maximum value of the counterparty risk on these financial assets is equal to their recognized net carrying value.\n\nOrange  SA  is  exposed  to  bank  counterparty  risk  through  its investments and derivatives. Therefore, it performs a strict selection based on the credit rating of public, financial or industrial institutions i n  w h i c h  i t  i n v e s t s  o r  w i t h  w h i c h  i t  e n t e r s  i n t o  d e r i v a t i v e s  a g r e e m e n t s:\n\n- -for  each  non-banking counterparty selected for investments, limits are based on ratings and maturities of the investments;\n- -for  each  counterparty  bank  selected  for  investments  and deri v a t i v e s ,  l i m i t s  a r e  b a s e d  o n  e q u i t y,  r a t i n g ,  C D S  ( C r e d i t  D e f a u l t\n\nSwap, an accurate indicator of potential default risk) as well as on periodic analyses carried out by the Treasury Department;\n\n- -theoretical  limits  and  consumption  limits  are  monitored  and reported on a daily basis to the Group treasurer and the head of the trading room. These limits are adjusted regularly depending on credit events.\n\nFor derivatives, master agreements relating to financial instruments (French Banking Federation) are signed with all counterparties and provide for a net settlement of debts and receivables, in case of failure  of  one  of  the  parties,  as  well  as  for  calculation  of  a  final balance to be received or paid. These agreements include a CSA (Credit Support Annex) cash collateral clause that can lead to either a deposit (collateral paid) or collection (collateral received), on a daily basis. These payment amounts correspond to the change in market value of all derivatives.\n\nAs a rule, investments are negotiated with high-grade banks.\n\n## 5.5.6 Notional amount and fair value of derivative financial instruments\n\nNotional contracts or amounts do not represent the amounts to be paid or received and consequently do not represent the risk incurred by Orange SA in the use of derivative financial instruments.\n\nThe  fair  value  of  the  currency  swaps  and  interest  rate  swaps  is estimated  by  discounting  expected  future  cash  flows  using  the year-end market exchange rates and year-end interest rates for the remaining term of the contracts.\n\nThe fair va l u e  o f  o v e r- t h e - c o u n t e r  o p t i o n s  i s  e s t i m a t e d  u s i n g  g e n e r a l l y accepted market measurement models.\n\nOrange SA may set up hedges of interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk with external counterparties on behalf of some of its direct or indirect subsidiaries. In the vast majority of cases, these hedges are subject to mirror transactions in the subsidiaries for which they are set up, with Orange SA not bearing any residual interest or foreign exchange rate risk.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

rentals for 72 million euros.\n\n## Operating lease commitments\n\nThe main operating lease commitments correspond to the present value of fixed and in-substance fixed payments not paid at that date, plus any amounts that Orange SA is reasonably certain to pay at the end of the lease, such as the exercise price of a purchase option (where it is reasonably certain to be exercised), or penalties payable to the lessors for terminating the lease (where such termination option is reasonably certain to be exercised).\n\nOrange SA systematically determines the lease term as the period during which leases cannot be canceled, plus periods covered by any ex te n s i o n  o p t i o n s  t h a t  t h e  l e s s e e  i s  r e a s o n a b l y  c e r t a i n  t o  e x e r c i s e and by any termination options that the lessee is reasonably certain not to exercise.\n\nFor each lease, the discount rate used is determined based on the yield rate on government bonds, in accordance with the lease term and currency, to which the Group's credit spread is added.\n\nOperating lease maturities are presented below:\n\n| (in millions of euros)                    | Minimum  Less than one   | Minimum  Less

other leases with renegotiated terms and conditions.\n\n## Other goods and services purchase commitments\n\nThe main commitments to purchase goods and services correspond to:\n\n- -property rental expenses for an amount of 458 million euros;\n- -the purchase of broadcasting rights for an amount of 264 million euros;\n- -hosting services for active equipment for mobile sites under a 'Built-to-Suit' agreement for approximately 247 million euros;\n- -the maintenance of submarine cables for which Orange has joint ownership or user rights, for an overall amount of 197 million euros.\n\n## Investment commitments\n\nAt the end of December 2020, investment commitments amounted to 1,109 million euros.\n\nIn addition to these commitments, which are expressed in monetary terms,  the  Group  made  certain  commitments  to  the  National Regulatory  Authorities  such  as  ensuring  certain  coverage  of  the population by fixed or mobile networks, particularly in the context of assignment of licenses or service quality. These commitments will require capital expenditure in future years to roll out and enhance the networks. They are not shown in the table above since they are not expressed in monetary terms:\n\n- -the obligations included in the authorization to use 5G frequencies in the 3.4-3.8 GHz band issued to Orange on November 12, 2020 are as follows:\n- -the rollout of sites (3,000 sites by the end of 2022, 8,000 sites by the end of 2024 and 10,500 sites by the end of 2025), of which 25% must be located in rural areas or industrial areas outside of very densely populated areas,\n- -widespread availability of a 5G service at all sites by the end of 2030, an obligation that may be met either with the 3.4-3.8 GHz band or another band,\n- -the provision of a speed of at least 240 Mbps per sector from 75% of sites by the end of 2022, 85% of sites by the end of 2024, 90% of sites by the end of 2025, and 100% of sites by the end of 2030,\n- -coverage of the main highways by the end of 2025, major roads by the end of 2027,\n- -the provision of differentiated services and activation of the IPv6 network protocol (Internet Protocol version 6).\n\nIn  addition, the commitments made by Orange to participate in the first stage of the procedure and which made it possible to obtain 50 MHz at a reserve price became obligations in the authorization issued:\n\n- -from the end of 2023, Orange will have to provide a fixed offer from sites using the 3.5 GHz band and a fixed offer to cover the premises that benefit from fixed-access radio network services,\n- -Orange  will  have  to  meet  reasonable  requests  for  the provision  of  services  from  private  sector  companies  and public  sector  structures,  provide  indoor  coverage,  offer\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

This agreement includes enhanced coverage obligations, which are included for the period 2018-2021 in our licenses in force in the bands 900 MHz, 1,800 MHz and 2,100 MHz, and for the post 2021 period, in the new licenses for 900 MHz, 1,800 MHz and 2,100 MHz awarded on November 15, 2018:\n- -targeted programs for the improvement of coverage, with the coverage of 5,000 areas by operators by 2029,\n- -the generalization of 4G by the end of 2020 on almost all existing mobile sites,\n- -the  acceleration  of  the  coverage  of  the  transport  routes, ensuring that the main road and rail routes have 4G coverage,\n- -the supply of a fixed 4G service and the extension of the service  to  500  additional  sites  upon  request  from  the government by 2020,\n- -the widespread use of telephone coverage inside buildings, proposing voice over Wi-Fi and SMS over Wi-Fi offers and offers  involving  the  indoor  coverage  of  buildings  upon request,\n- -the improvement of reception quality throughout the country, particularly in rural areas, with good coverage (according to the Arcep decision No. 2016-1678 relative to publications giving information on mobile coverage) by 2024-2027.\n- -in 2015, in France, when the frequencies in the 700 MHz band were allocated, Orange took:\n- -coverage obligations in 'priority deployment areas' (40% of the country within 5 years, 92% within 12 years and 97.7% within 15 years) and in 'white area' not yet covered by a broadband network (100% within 12 years), at the level of priority road routes (100% within 15 years) and at the level of the national rail network (60% within 7 years, 80% within 12 years and 90% within 15 years).\n- -in  2011,  in  France,  when the frequencies in the 2.6 GHz and 800 MHz bands were allocated, Orange took:\n- -an  optional  commitment  to  host  mobile  virtual  network operators (MVNOs) on certain technical and pricing terms under Full MVNO schemes,\n- -an obligation to provide mobile coverage with theoretical maximum download speeds of at least 60 Mbps per user (25% of the country within 4 years and 75% within 12 years\n\n- for the 2.6 GHz band, 98% of the country within 12 years and 99.6% within 15 years for the 800 MHz band) which can be met by using both the allocated frequencies and other frequencies,\n- -for the 800 MHz band, specifically: a coverage obligation in  priority  areas  (40% of the country within 5 years, 90% within  10  years)  with  no  obligation  to  provide  roaming services, a coverage obligation in each department (90% within 12 years, 95% within 15 years) and an obligation to pool resources in communities covered by the 'white area' program.\n\nNon-compliance with these obligations could result in fines and other sanctions ultimately including the withdrawal of licenses awarded. Management believes that Orange SA has the ability to fulfill these commitments towards government authorities.\n\n## Guarantees granted to third parties in the ordinary course of business\n\nAs the parent company of the Orange group, Orange SA grants guarantees  to  third  parties  in  order  to  cover  the  contractual obligations of its direct or indirect subsidiaries. These guarantees totaled 1,662 million euros at December 31, 2020.\n\nIn  the  context  of  deploying  the  high-speed  and  very  high-speed broadband network in France, the Group signed contracts through the  Public  Initiative  Network  (mainly  public  service  delegation contracts or public-private partnerships and procurement contracts for  design,  realization,  operation  and  maintenance),  under  terms which  Orange  SA  counter-guaranteed  for  an  overall  amount  of 3 6 8  m i l l i o n  e u r o s  a t  D e c e m b e r  3 1,  2 0 2 0 ,  a  p o r t i o n  o f  t h e  c o m m i t m e n t s being made by its subsidiaries with public entities, particularly for performance guarantees and rehabilitation of infrastructure.\n\nCommitments include performance guarantees granted to certain customers of subsidiaries of the Enterprise Division, for an amount of 290 million euros, and also include 350 million euros for the guarantee granted by Orange SA to Arcep corresponding to the reserve price of a 5G frequency block as part of the auction process in 2020.\n\nIn addition, Orange SA provides certain guarantees to third parties (financial institutions, customers, partners and government agencies) to ensure the fulfillment of its contractual obligations in the ordinary course of its business. These guarantees are not shown in the table above, as they do not increase the amount of its commitments.\n\n## 6.2 Other commitments\n\n## Warranties given on disposals\n\nUnder the disposal agreements for certain assets, subsidiaries or equity investments entered into by its subsidiaries, the Company guarantees that those subsidiaries will fulfill their obligations under the asset and liability warranties they have granted. Nearly all material disposal agreements provide for caps on these warranties.\n\nAt  December  31,  2020,  the  main  warranties  in  effect  were  the following:\n\n- -the uncapped warranties granted to the EE joint venture when contributing the operations in the United Kingdom, concerning the restructuring of equity investments and assets carried out prior to the contribution expiring in 2022;\n- -a warranty given to BT as part of the disposal of EE, backed 50/50  by  Orange  group  and  Deutsche  Telekom  as  tax  and operating warranties, excluding events ascribable solely to one or the other, and capped at the contractually set disposal price of 5.1 billion pounds sterling (5.7 billion euros converted at the exchange rate at December 31, 2020) for Orange's share, which will expire in 2023;",

These disputes are presented in Notes 3.6. Income tax and 5.3 Provisions.\n\nAt December 31, 2020, the provisions recognized by Orange SA for all disputes in which it is involved (other than those in Notes 3.6 Income tax and 5.3 Provisions) amounted to 451 million euros, compared with 569 million euros at December 31, 2019. Orange SA believes that any disclosure of the amount of provisions on a case-by-case basis for ongoing disputes could seriously harm the Group's position. The balance and overall movements on provisions are presented in Note 5.3 Provisions.\n\n## Litigation related to competition law\n\n## Mobile services\n\n- -In  parallel  to  the  judicial  inquiry  for  which  a  final  ruling  was handed down on December 17, 2015 a final verdict was reached by the French Competition Authority fining Orange 350 million euros for having implemented four anti-competitive practices in the 'Enterprise' market segment and imposing injunctions, SFR brought an action on June 18, 2015, for damages suffered because  of  Orange's  practices.  After  several  successive i ncreases in April 2016 and September 2018, SFR raised its claim from the initial 512 million euros to 3 billion euros in July 2019. The Group believes this claim represents a risk. In the wake of this decision, C\u00e9leste and Adista also brought actions against Orange before the Paris Commercial Court for damages. To date, the overall claims of SFR, C\u00e9leste and Adista represent a total of 3.1 billion euros. These cases are currently being investigated by the courts and a decision of the Paris Commercial Court is expected by the end of the first quarter 2021 in the SFR case.\n- -Concurrently to their complaints filed with the French Competition Authority,  regarding  practices  of  Orange  in  the  mobile  and fixed-to-mobile markets in the French Caribbean and in French Guyana, for which Orange was definitively ordered to pay a fine of  63  million  euros  in  December  2009  reduced  to  60  million euros by the Paris Court of Appeal in July 2013, Digicel and Outremer Telecom initiated before the Paris Commercial Court respectively in March 2009 and October 2010, legal actions for alleged damages stemming from these practices, in an amount which Digicel had assessed at 329 million euros increased to 493 million euros in November 2015 and Outremer at 75 million euros. After it was ordered by the Paris Commercial Court in March 2015 that 8 million euros should be paid to Outremer Telecom, the Paris Court of Appeal decreased the amount of the  fine  to  3  million  euros  in  May  2017,  noting inter alia  that the  damages  should  be  discounted  at  the  statutory  rate  of interests. On December 18, 2017 the Paris Commercial Court ordered Orange to pay Digicel the sum of 180 million euros, to be discounted from March 2009 until the date of payment at a rate of interest higher than that adopted by the Paris Court of Appeal in the Outremer Telecom litigation, i.e. a total amount of 346 million euros. Orange filed an appeal and, at the same time, obtained from the Paris Court of Appeal on February 6, 2018, the right to escrow only the notional amount of the penalty until the court ruled on the merits of the case. On June 17, 2020, the Paris Court of Appeal overturned the discounting method applied\n\n## 6.3 Financing commitments\n\nOrange SA's main commitments relating to borrowings are set out in Note 5.4 Financial liabilities and Note 5.5 Exposure to market risks.\n\nto  the  damages  set  forth  in  the  judgement  rendered  by  the Paris Commercial Court on December 18, 2017, which ordered Orange to pay to Digicel 180 million euros in principal. Following this judgment, Orange was refunded 97 million euros. Orange appealed to the French Supreme Court and re-assessed the risk r e l a t e d  t o  t h e  p o s s i b l e  r e v e r s a l  o f  t h e  C o u r t  o f  A p p e a l 's  j u d g m e n t , which  would  return  the  parties  to  the  situation  following  the first-instance court's decision.\n\n## Fixed-line services\n\n- -In  2010,  SFR  and  then  Verizon  summoned  Orange  SA  to appear  before  the  Paris  Commercial  Court  demanding  the reimbursement  of  alleged  overpayments  on  interconnection services provided by Orange, the price of which allegedly did not reflect their cost. On June 18 and 25, 2013, the Paris Commercial Court dismissed their claims but ordered Orange to pay Verizon 1 million euros damages with respect to services provided in 2008. Orange paid this amount in 2013. SFR and Verizon filed appeals against these decisions. In December 2015, the Paris Court of Appeal dismissed in full the claims made by SFR and confirmed the first instance decision. In September 2017, the French  Supreme  Court  rejected  SFR's  appeal.  Furthermore, in  April  2017,  the  Paris  Court  of  Appeal  dismissed  Verizon completely and reversed the compensation of 1 million euros granted for services provided in 2008. On June 5, 2019, the French Supreme Court annulled the decision of the Paris Court of Appeal and restored the parties to the situation they were in following the first instance court's decision rendered on June 25, 2013. The proceedings are still ongoing.\n- -In 2012, SFR brought an action against Orange SA before the Paris  Commercial  Court  denouncing  its  retail  offers  for  the secondary residences market and claiming 218 million euros for losses allegedly suffered. In February 2014, the trial court ruled that Orange had abused its dominant position and ordered it to pay 51 million euros in damages to SFR. In October 2014, the  Paris  Court  of  Appeal  annulled  this  decision  which  was then reversed by the French Supreme Court on April 12, 2016. Orange had then to pay 53 million euros to SFR pursuant to the trial court's ruling. SFR had raised its claims to 257 million euros before the Court of Appeal. On June 8, 2018, the Court of Appeal sentenced Orange to pay 54 million euros. Orange paid the balance following the cancellation of the previous ruling from the Court of Appeal and appealed to the French Supreme Court.  On  September  16,  2020,  the  French  Supreme  Court overturned the judgment handed down by the Court of Appeal and restored the parties to the situation they were in following the Paris Commercial Court's decision. Orange applied to the Court of Appeal to have its conviction overturned and the return of the sums awarded.\n\n## Other proceedings\n\n- -In  June  2018,  Iliad  brought  summary  proceedings  against Orange SA before the presiding judge of the Paris Commercial Court,  aiming  to  ban  some  of  its  mobile  telephony  offers proposing mobile handsets at attractive prices accompanied by a subscription package, on the grounds that they constituted consumer credit offers. The case is currently being investigated by the judges deciding on the merits of the case.

The  claim  (of  an  unquantified  amount)  is currently being disputed before the High Court of England and Wales. Orange challenges vigorously the allegations raised by Phones 4U which include collusion.\n- -In August 2020, ASSIA brought proceedings against Orange SA before  the  Paris  Civil  Court  for  infringement  of  two  dynamic xDSL line management patents. ASSIA claims a total of around 500  million  euros  for  the  financial  damage  it  claims  to  have suffered. Orange SA considers its claims to be unfounded and challenges them. The proceedings are currently being examined by the judges deciding on the merits of the case.\n- -The Evaluation and Compensation Committee, set up as part of the France Telecom employee-related crisis trial, to examine individual claims submit ted by individuals present in the company between  2007  and  2010  and  their  beneficiaries,  extended\n\nthe  period  for  submitting  files  until  December  31,  2020.  This Committee is continuing to analyze and process the requests received. At the end of December 2020, around 1,700 individual requests  had  been  received,  about  470  of  which  had  been closed subsequent to an agreement and the other requests are being processed.\n\nIn  order  to  provide  its  telecommunication  services,  Orange  SA sometimes uses fixed assets of other parties. Terms of use of these assets are not always formalized. The Company is sometimes subject of  claims  and  might  be  subject  to  future  claims  in  this  respect, which could result in a cash outflow in the future. The amount of the potential obligations or future commitments cannot be measured with sufficient reliability due to legal complexities involved.\n\nOther than proceedings related to tax audits (see Note 3.6 Income tax), there are no other administrative, legal or arbitration proceedings, including any proceedings that are pending or threatened, of which Orange is aware, which may have or have had in the last 12 months a material impact on the Company's and/or Group's financial position or profitability.\n\n## Note 8 Transactions with companies and related parties\n\nThe main related-party transactions with associates are carried out in the ordinary course of business.\n\nThe additional related-party transactions cover the main transactions carried out in the ordinary course of business with companies that belong  to  the  Group  and  that  are  not  wholly  owned  (directly  or indirectly) by Orange SA and companies in which the Chairman of\n\n## Note 9 Subsequent events\n\n## Orange Concessions\n\nOn Januar y 22, 2021, O r a n g e  h a s  e n t e r e d  i n t o  a n  e x c l u s i v e  a g r e e m e n t with La Banque des Territoires (Caisse des d\u00e9p\u00f4ts), CNP Assurances and EDF Invest, for the sale of 50% of the capital and joint control\n\nof Orange Concessions.

        "page_content": "## 10.1.2 Revenue  recognition\n\nThe  main  revenue  from  Orange  SA's  activities  is  recognized  as follows:\n\n## Provision of equipment\n\nRevenue from the sale of handsets and accessories is recognized when delivered. Installation fees are recognized in revenue when the line is activated.\n\nEquipment lease revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease agreement.\n\n## Service revenue\n\nRevenue from telephone and Internet access contracts is recognized on a straight-line basis over the period of the service.\n\nRevenue from incoming and outgoing telephone communications is recognized when the service is provided.\n\nRevenue related to the use of leased lines and to medium-speed and broadband data transmission is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract.\n\nRevenue related to the sale of transmission capacity on terrestrial and submarine cables is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract.\n\nRevenue from Internet advertising is recognized over the period over which the advertising service is provided.\n\n## Separable components of a bundled offer and related offers\n\nMany  service  offers  available  on  the  Group's  main  markets  are comprised of two components: an equipment component (e.g. a mobile handset) and a service component (e.g. a talk plan).\n\nHence, for bundled offers including a handset sold at a discounted price and a telecommunication service, revenue recognized for the handset sale is limited to the amount of the arrangement that is not contingent upon the rendering of service provision, i.e. the amount paid by the customer for the handset: this amount is usually the amount paid at the delivery, or the discounted amounts paid over a 12- or 24-month period with respect to the of fers paid by installments.\n\nWhere separable, revenue from equipment sales is recognized when the significant risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the buyer. The provision of an Internet box does not constitute either a separable component of the Internet access service offer nor a rental because Orange maintains control of the box and its usage.\n\nFor certain commercial offers, revenue from connection to a service is  recognized  in  full  when  billing  the  first  connection,  even  if  this service is not a separately identifiable transaction from subscription and communications.\n\n## Sales of content\n\nRevenue from the sale of revenue and cost-sharing arrangements ('contact  number'  service)  is  recognized  at  the  gross  amount. Amounts  due  to  providers  of  such  services  are  recognized  in operating expenses.\n\nRevenue from the sale or supply of content (audio, video, games, etc.) through the various communication systems (mobile, PC, TV, fixed telephony, etc.) is recognized at the gross amount; payments to content publishers are therefore recognized in operating expenses. When Orange SA is acting as agent in the sale or supply of content,\n\nthe related transactions are recognized in third-party accounts and only Orange SA's fees are recognized in net income.\n\n## Customer acquisition and loyalty program costs\n\nSubscriber acquisition and retention costs, other than loyalty program costs, are recognized in profit and loss in the period in which they are incurred, that is, on acquisition or renewal.\n\nThe accounting treatment of rights to loyalty discounts granted to customers is defined by CNC Urgent Issues Committee Opinion 2004- E dated October 13, 2004. When the right to a benefit is granted,  the  Company  undertakes  to  provide  cash  discounts  or benefits in kind to its customers. The equivalent value in euros of loyalty discounts granted to customers is recognized under deferred income. It is estimated on the basis of assumptions on cancellation rates and utilization rates of the rights by subscribers and is deferred until such time as it is converted into revenue when a future sale is made. This principle is applied to Orange SA's existing PCM (Change Your Mobile) program, under which customers can get a new mobile phone providing that they enter into a new contractual obligation.\n\n## 10.1.3 Intangible  assets\n\nPursuant to ANC Regulation No. 2015-06 of November 23, 2015, at the start of the fiscal year on January 1, 2016, the technical losses recognized in the financial statements were allocated, transaction by transaction, to the underlying assets on which there were unrealized gains. The residual amount of losses not allocated to components of identified assets remain in commercial goodwill and is subject to impairment tests as described in Note 10.1.5 Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets.\n\nThus,  intangible  assets  mainly  include  technical  merger  losses not allocated to identified assets, licenses, patents, usage rights, software and leasehold rights, as well as development costs.\n\n## Gross value\n\nIntangible assets are recognized at acquisition or production cost.\n\nThe acquisition cost of mobile network operating licenses consists of a fixed portion, which is capitalized, and a variable portion, which is expensed (equal to 1% of eligible revenue). The amortization period for the licenses begins as from the date on which the network is technically  ready  for  effective  marketing  of  the  service  and  ends on the license expiration date, with the exception of the first block of frequencies under the UMTS license, for which the amortization period is effective as from the award date.\n\nDevelopment  costs  are  capitalized  when  the  following  can  be demonstrated:\n\n- -the intention and the technical and financial capacity to complete the development project;\n- -the project will generate probable future economic benefits for the Company; and\n- -the cost can be measured reliably.\n\nResearch and development costs not fulfilling the above criteria are expensed as incurred.\n\n## Amortization\n\nIntangible assets are amortized on a basis that reflects the pattern in which their future economic benefits are expected to be consumed according to their probable use.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

This cost includes the costs di r e c t l y  a t t r i b u t a b l e  t o  t h e  t r a n s f e r  o f  t h e  a s s e t  t o  i t s  p l a c e  o f  o p e r a t i o n and its preparation for operation.\n\nTransfer taxes, fees or commissions and legal costs related to the acquisition are attached to the acquisition cost of the asset.\n\nThe  cost  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  includes,  where appropriate, the estimate of the costs of dismantling and removing the item and restoring the site on which it is located, representing the obligation incurred by Orange SA.\n\nThe cost of networks includes design and construction costs, as well as equipment and installation capacity improvement costs.\n\nMaintenance and repair  costs  are  expensed  as  incurred,  except where they serve to increase the asset's productivity or extend its useful life.\n\nThe rollout of assets by stage, especially for network assets, does not  generally  require  a  substantial  period  of  preparation.  As  a consequence, Orange SA does not generally capitalize the interest expense incurred during the construction and acquisition phase for its property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. Interest is entered under expenses in the fiscal year during which it is incurred, independently of how the borrowed capital is used.\n\nPursuant  to  the  component-based  approach,  the  total  cost  of an  asset  is  allocated  among  its  different  components  and  each component is accounted for separately when different components have different useful lives, or when the pattern in which their future economic  benefits  are  expected  to  be  consumed  by  the  entity varies, thereby requiring the use of different rates and methods of depreciation.\n\n## Depreciation and amortization\n\nProperty,  plant  and  equipment  are  depreciated  on  a  basis  that reflects the pattern in which the future economic benefits of each of their components are expected to be consumed according to their probable use.\n\nThe straight-line basis is usually applied over the following estimated useful lives:\n\n## Buildings (including lightweight constructions), leasehold improvements and equipment 5 to 30 years\n\nInfrastructure\t(civil\tworks,\tcopper\tand\toptical\n\ncables,\ttelephone\tpoles,\tmasts,\tmobile\n\nsite\tresearch\tand\tengineering\tcosts)\n\n8\tto\t30\tyears\n\nEquipment\t(switching,\ttransmission,\tetc.)\n\nand\tfixed\tand\tmobile\tnetwork\tinstallations,\n\nincluding\tinseparable\tunderlying\tsoftware Computer\thardware,\thandsets\n\n5\tto\t20\tyears\n\n3 to 5 years\n\nOther\tproperty,\tplant\tand\tequipment\n\n3\tto\t10\tyears\n\nLand and fixed assets in progress are not depreciated.\n\nThe depreciable amount of an asset relates to its gross value minus its residual value less disposal costs.\n\nOrange SA makes use of accelerated depreciation allowed under the  tax  regulations  in  force.  The  difference  between  accelerated depreciation and straight-line depreciation is recorded as a regulated provision on the balance sheet.\n\n## 10.1.5 Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets\n\nAn impairment loss is recognized, on a case-by-case basis, when the  fair  value  of  an  asset  falls  sustainably  below  its  net  carrying value  due  to  events  or  circumstances  arising  during  the  period (such as obsolescence, wear and tear, significant changes to the manner in which the asset is used, worse than expected economic performance, a drop in revenue or other external indicators, revision of operating cash flows, etc.).\n\nFair value is the higher of market value and value in use.\n\nFor  assets  which  are  to  be  held  and  used,  fair  value  is  usually determined  on  the  basis  of  value  in  use,  which  is  the  estimated present value of the future economic benefits expected to be derived from the use and disposal of the asset. For assets held for sale, fair value is determined on the basis of realizable value assessed by reference to market prices.\n\nIn addition, property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, including the commercial goodwill allocated to businesses in France, are tested overall for impairment relating to all activities and sites in France.\n\nPotential reversal of impairment is examined at each closing date. Impairment on goodwill is definitive.\n\n## 10.1.6 Financial  assets\n\nInvestment securities are recorded at historical purchase cost plus t h e  s h a r e ,  i f  a n y,  o f  t h e  m e r g e r  l o s s  a l l o c a t e d  t o  t h e m  p u r s u a n t  t o  A N C Regulation No. 2015-06. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred.\n\nTo determine whether an impairment loss should be recognized, the historical acquisition cost (including any share of merger losses allocated thereto) is compared to its fair value.\n\nFair value is equal to value in use for strategic interests. However, when an interest is due to be sold, it is measured at market value.\n\nThe value in use of investment securities is the estimated enterprise value of the component entities of those investments, less their net debt  (or  plus  their  net  cash),  as  calculated  in  their  currency  and converted into euros at the year-end exchange rate.\n\nDue to the shor t-te r m vo l a t i l i t y  o f  m a r k e t  v a l u e  a n d  t h e  s t r a t e g i c  n a t u r e of its investments, Orange SA uses the discounted cash flow method to assess enterprise value (excluding for banking activity). Cash flow projections are based on economic and regulatory assumptions, license renewal assumptions and forecast trading conditions drawn up by Orange SA's Management, as follows:\n\n- -cash flows are taken from business plans covering a timeframe of three to five years;",

        "page_content": "- -beyond that timeframe, cash flows are extrapolated by applying a perpetual growth rate specific to each business activity;\n- -the cash flows obtained are discounted using appropriate rates for the type of business.\n\nMarket value is the best estimate of the amount obtainable from the sale of an asset in an arm's length transaction less costs to sell. This estimate is made on the basis of available market information, taking into account any specific circumstances.\n\nOther criteria, such as market value (assessed based on average share price over the last 20 trading days), growth and profitability prospects,  parent  company  equity,  proportionate  share  in  the investment (historic basis) can be taken into account, separately or in addition to value in use, when calculating fair value according to the type of each investment.\n\n## Receivables related to investment securities\n\nReceivables  related  to  investment  securities  comprise  mediumor  long-term  loan  agreements  with  Group  companies.  They  are recognized separately from current accounts with Group subsidiaries, which are used for the daily management of their cash surpluses and requirements. Impairment is recognized according to the risk of non-recovery.\n\n## Cash collateral\n\nOrange SA has negotiated cash collateral agreements with its main bank  counterparties,  which  fluctuate  according  to  the  valuation of  off-balance  sheet  transactions  with  these  counterparties.  The amount  of  this  collateral  is  strongly  correlated  to  movements  in foreign exchange rates.\n\nCollateral paid is recorded in Financial assets and collateral received is recognized in Other short-term borrowings.\n\n## 10.1.7 Inventories\n\nNetwork maintenance equipment and equipment intended for sale to customers are measured at the lower of cost or likely net realizable value. The cost relates to the acquisition cost, which is determined by the weighted average cost method.\n\nWhen the probable net realizable value is lower than the cost of entry, a provision for impairment is recorded that amounts to the ascertained difference.\n\n## 10.1.8 Trade  receivables\n\nDue  to  its  broad  range  of  customers  (B2C  customers,  large companies,  professionals  and  MVNOs),  Orange  SA  does  not consider  itself  to  be  exposed  to  a  customer  concentration  risk. Impairment is recognized according to the risk of non-recovery of the receivables. It is calculated either on an individual basis or on a statistical assessment of the risk according to customer segment.\n\n## Receivables assigned to installment payments\n\nTrade receivables may include installment payments over at most a two-year period for mobile phone purchases. In 2018, Orange SA established  a  program  with  a  bank  of  non-recourse  sales  of  its deferred payment receivables. The transfer of ownership having been completed, the receivables thus sold were no longer recognized on the balance sheet. This sale is considered as a pure and simple assignment  of  receivables  related  to  the  Company's  day-to-day business. The difference between the par value and the sale price of the receivable is recorded in operating income.\n\n## 10.1.9 Marketable  securities\n\nMarketable securities are stated at cost. An impairment provision is  recognized, where applicable, for each line of securities of the same nature, equal to the difference between their carrying value\n\nand  the  average  stock  market  price  during  the  previous  month or, in the case of unlisted securities, their probable trading value. However, in line with CRC Rule No. 2008-15 of December 4, 2008, no  impairment  losses  are  recognized  on  marketable  securities comprising shares purchased or held in respect of free share award plans: any loss arising from their removal from the balance sheet without a counterbalancing entry is accounted for by recognizing a provision (see Note 10.1.16 Other employee benefits).\n\n## 10.1.10 Other shareholders' equity\n\nWhen, based on the terms of the contract or the economic conditions at the time of issuance, an interest bearing-financial instrument is not redeemable at the lender's option or it is redeemable in equity instruments, it is recognized in Other shareholders' equity.\n\n## 10.1.11 Government  grants\n\nOrange  SA  may  receive  non-repayable  grants,  presented  in shareholders' equity, under 'Grants,' in the form of direct or indirect f u n d i n g  f r o m  t h i r d  p a r t i e s  f o r  c a p i t a l  p r o j e c t s ,  m a i n l y  p r o v i d e d  b y  l o c a l and regional authorities. They are recycled to the income statement at the same rate and over the same period as the depreciation of the fixed assets financed.\n\n## 10.1.12 Bond issuance costs\n\nBond issuance costs are recorded in operating expenses in the fiscal year in which the bonds were issued. Share premiums are recognized in financial expenses over the term of the bond.\n\n## 10.1.13 Derivative financial instruments\n\nOrange SA manages the market risks related to changes in interest and exchange rates using financial instruments (derivatives), and particularly cross-currency interest rate swaps, interest rate swaps, caps, floors, futures contracts in organized markets, forward currency contracts, currency swaps and currency options. These instruments are used for hedging purposes.\n\nGains and losses arising on these derivatives are recorded in the income statement on a symmetrical basis with the losses and gains on the hedged items:\n\n- -differences  in  interest  receivable  or  payable  on  interest  rate deri v a t i v e s  a n d  a n y  p r e m i u m s  o r  d i s c o u n t s  o n  t h e s e  t r a n s a c t i o n s are recorded in the income statement on a symmetrical basis over the term of the hedged item;\n- -gains and losses arising on currency derivatives used to hedge balance sheet items are recorded as adjustments to the foreign exchange  gain  or  loss  of  the  hedged  item;  if  the  hedging instrument is unwound or matures before the hedged item, any associated gains or losses are retained on the balance sheet, as deferred income or prepaid expenses, until the transaction is unwound, and are then reclassified as income;\n- -gains and losses arising on derivatives designated as hedges of identifiable firm commitments or identifiable future transactions are deferred and recognized in the valuation of the transaction when it is unwound;\n- -some  transactions  which  comply  with  Orange  SA's  hedging policy do not qualify for hedge accounting. In accordance with ANC regulation No. 2015-05 of July 2, 2015 concerning forward financial instruments and hedging transactions, changes in the value of these transactions in open stand-alone position appear on the balance sheet as counterparties to transitional accounts: on the asset side of the balance sheet with respect to changes related to unrealized losses and on the liabilities side with respect to changes related to unrealized gains;\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

It may also result from Orange SA's practices or from public commitments that have created a legitimate expectation on the part of the third parties concerned that Orange SA will assume certain responsibilities.\n\nThe  amount  of  the  provision  corresponds  to  the  amount  of  the outflow of resources that will probably be required for Orange SA to settle the obligation.\n\nContingent  liabilities  are  disclosed  in  the  notes  to  the  financial statements. They correspond to:\n\n- -probable  obligations  arising  from  past  events  that  are  not recognized because their existence will be confirmed only by the  occurrence  or  non-occurrence  of  one  or  more  uncertain future events not wholly within the Company's control; or\n- -present  obligations  arising  from  past  events  that  are  not recognized  because  it  is  not  probable  that  an  outflow  of resources  embodying  economic  benefits  without  at  least equivalent compensation will be required to settle the obligation or because the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.\n\n## Litigation\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, Orange SA is involved in a number of legal and arbitration proceedings and administrative actions. The costs that may result from these proceedings are only accrued when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of that liability can be quantified or estimated within a reasonable range. The  amount  of  provision  recorded  is  based  on  a  case-by-case assessment of the risk level, and events arising during the course of legal proceedings may require a reassessment of this risk.\n\n## Dismantling and restoring sites\n\nOrange SA is required to dismantle technical equipment and restore technical sites.\n\nThe provision is based on dismantling costs (on a per-unit basis for public phones and mobile antenna sites, or per metric ton for telephone poles and fixed-line electrical and electronic equipment) incurred by Orange SA to meet its environmental commitments and annual estimated asset dismantling and site restoration obligations.\n\nThe provision is assessed on the basis of the identified costs for the current fiscal year, extrapolated for future years using the best estimate of the commitment settlement. It is discounted at a risk-free r a t e .

Only one plan is funded and as its assets are listed securities, their fair value is equal to their market value on the reporting date. The expected long-term return on these plan assets has been determined on the basis of a p l a n - b y - p l a n  a n a l y s i s  t a k i n g  a c c o u n t  o f  t h e  e x p e c t e d  r e t u r n on each type of asset in the portfolio. The expected return rate on each type of asset in the portfolio is estimated using an analysis of changes in the rate of inflation, long-term interest rates and the associated risk premium. These factors are combined and compared to the market to determine long-term return assumptions.\n\nEmployee  benefits  include  post-employment  benefits  (essentially pension  obligations),  retirement  bonuses  and  other  long-term benefits.\n\n## Post-employment benefits\n\n## Pension plan for French civil servants\n\nCivil  servants  employed  by  Orange  SA  are  covered  by  the government-sponsored civil and military pension plan. Orange SA's obligation  under  the  plan  is  limited  to  the  payment  of  annual contributions  (French  law  No.  96-660  dated  July  26,  1996). Consequently, Orange SA has no obligation to fund future deficits of the pension plans covering its civil servant employees or any other civil service plans.\n\nThe civil servant pension plan is a defined-contribution plan.\n\n## Retirement bonuses and other similar benefits\n\nThe retirement bonuses paid by Orange SA to its employees, either as a lump sum or as an annuity, in an amount determined by their l ength of ser v i c e  a n d  fi n a l  s a l a r y  a t  r e t i r e m e n t  a g e ,  c a n  b e  c o n s i d e r e d as a defined-benefit plan.",

However, some of the key suppliers and Orange SA agreed to extend the payment term for the Company, which may be up to six months for some invoices.\n\n## 10.1.18 Tax  regime\n\nThe Company is at the head of a tax consolidation group under Articles 223 A et seq. of the French General Tax Code (CGI). Income tax expenses are calculated and paid by the Company as if there\n\nwas no tax consolidation. Tax savings or add-ons stemming from corrections  made  to  overall  taxable  income  are  recognized  as i ncome or expenses at the level of the consolidating parent company, Orange SA.\n\n## 10.1.19 Consolidating company identification\n\nOrange SA, whose headquarters are located at 78 rue Olivier de Serres 75015 Paris (SIREN 380 129 866), prepares the Consolidated Financial Statements of the largest group of which the Company is  a  part.  A  copy  of  the  aforementioned  Consolidated  Financial Statements is available on the Group website (https://www.orange. com/en/latest-consolidated-results).\n\n## 10.2 Use of estimates\n\nIn preparing Orange SA financial statements, Management makes estimates,  insofar  as  many  elements  included  in  the  financial statements cannot be measured with precision. Management revises these estimates if the underlying circumstances evolve or in light of new information or more experience. Consequently, the estimates made at December 31, 2020 may subsequently be changed. The consequences of the health crisis on the economic environment have led Management to review some of its estimates (see Note 2 Impact of the health crisis linked to the Covid-19 epidemic).\n\nThe assumptions on which the main estimates are based mainly relate to:\n\n- -provisions (see Notes 5.3.1 Employee benefits, 7 Litigation and 10.1.15 Long-term employee benefit obligations);\n- -property,  plant  and  equipment  and  intangible  assets  (see Note 10.1.5 Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets);\n- -investment securities (see Note 4.2 Financial assets);\n- -revenue recognition, where the exercise of judgment is needed to identify the components of a packaged offer or to analyze complex  contracts  which  may  have  an  effect  on  several accounting periods (see Note 10.1.2 Revenue recognition);\n- -off-balance sheet commitments for operating leases, where the exercise of judgment is necessary in particular to determine the duration of the commitment (see Note 6.

This change mainly results from a dif ference in the methodology used for aggregating bases (and not the bases themselves), secondarily, from a harmonization between countries, and lastly, the integration of Wholesale FTTH access bases.\n\nPreviously,  Orange  SA  distinguished  between  (i)  mobile  services customers, (ii) fixed broadband customers, and (iii) fixed telephony\n\ncustomers. Since January 1, 2020, Orange SA now distinguishes between (i) mobile access (unchanged bases), and (ii) fixed access, which  includes  fixed  broadband  access  (unchanged  bases)  and fixed narrowband access. In addition, fixed access now includes Wholesale FTTH access in France (co-financed lines and leased lines).\n\nData for the previous period have been adjusted on this basis.",

Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.\n\n## Justification of Assessments: Key Audit Matters\n\nDue  to  the  global  crisis  related  to  the  Covid-19  pandemic,  the financial statements of this period have been prepared and audited under specific conditions. Indeed, this crisis and the exceptional measures taken in the contex t of the state of sanitar y e me rg e n cy h ave had numerous consequences for companies, particularly on their\n\n## Key Audit Matters\n\n## Audit Response\n\n## Revenue recognition for telecommunications activities\n\n(Notes 5.1 and 5.4 to the consolidated financial statements)\n\nThe Company recognized in the consolidated income statement \u20ac42 270 million of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n\nThe Company's telecommunications business involves a wide range of frequently changing services and large volumes of data processing. This requires various revenue recognition methods according to the type of product or service sold, and complex IT systems for revenue recognition.\n\nRevenue recognition principles are disclosed in Note 5.1 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nRevenue recognition of telecommunications business is a key audit matter due to the complexity of the associated IT systems.\n\nFor the telecommunications business, we gained insight into the accounting processes used to recognize various revenue streams, from contract signature and initial communication to invoicing and receiving payment.\n\nWe took into account the high level of integration of the various IT s y s t e m s  i n v o l v e d  i n  r e v e n u e  r e c o g n i t i o n  b y  i n c l u d i n g  I T  s p e c i a l i s t s in our audit team and testing the design, implementation and effectiveness of automated system controls affecting revenue recognition.\n\nAs part of our work, we:\n\n- -identified  the  main  controls  set  up  by  Orange  that  are relevant to our audit;\n- -tested  the  functionalities  of  business  and  commercial applications  used  to  prepare  accounting  and  financial information, the configuration and interfaces of accounting systems;\n- -performed  analytical  procedures  and  tested  a  selection of manual entries at year end, by comparing our revenue estimates,  based  on  a  combination  of  internal  data  and publicly available external data, with revenue recorded.\n\nWe have also assessed the appropriateness of the information presented in Notes 5.1 and 5.4 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\noperations and their financing, and have led to greater uncertainties on their future prospects. Those measures, such as travel restrictions and remote working, have also had an impact on the companies' internal organization and the performance of the audits.\n\nIt is in this complex and evolving context that, in accordance with the requirements of Articles L. 823-9 and R. 823-7 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit matters relating to risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements  of  the  current  period,  as  well  as  how  we  addressed those risks.\n\nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the consolidated financial statements.",

These tests are performed at the level of each cash-generating unit (CGU) or group of CGUs, which generally correspond to the operating segment, or each country in Africa and  the  Middle  East  and  in  Europe.  An  impairment  loss  is recognized if the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying value. Orange mostly retains the value in use to determine the recoverable amount, which is the estimated present value of future expected cash flows.\n\nThe assessment of the value in use required certain estimates and judgments, as described in Notes 2.5.2 and 8, in particular: the  competitive,  economic  and  financial  environment  of certain  countries  in  which  the  Group  operates,  the  ability  to realize operating cash flows from strategic plans, the level of investment to be made, and the discount and perpetual growth rates used in calculating recoverable amounts As mentioned in Note 8.3, as at December 31, 2020, the business plans and key  operational  assumptions  were  sensitive  to  the  Covid-19 pandemic consequences.\n\nWe beli e v e  t h a t  t h e  e v a l u a t i o n  o f  t h o s e  a s s e t s  i s  a  k e y  a u d i t  m a t t e r, given their sensitivity to assumptions made by management, and the significance of goodwill and, other intangible and tangible assets in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nWe eval u a t e d  t h e  d e s i g n  a n d  t e s t e d  t h e  o p e r a t i n g  e f f e c t i v e n e s s  o f c e r t a i n  i n t e r n a l  c o n t r o l s  o v e r  t h e  G r o u p ' s  i m p a i r m e n t  a s s e s s m e n t process, including controls related to the determination of the recoverable amount of the CGUs or groups of CGUs, and the development  of  the  revenue  growth  rates  and  discount  rate assumptions.\n\nTo assess the reliability of data from the business plans that is used to calculate recoverable value, together with our valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, we:\n\n- -compared  the  2020  business  plans  projections  with business plans from prior financial years;\n- -compared the business plans from prior financial years with actual results of the related years;\n- -interviewed operational and finance managers at Orange to gain insight into the key assumptions used in business plans and assess assumptions based on the explanations obtained;\n- -evaluated the Group's forecasted revenue growth rates, by comparing the growth rate to the Group's peer companies' analyst reports and market research reports;\n- -examined  the  sensitivity  analyses  performed  by  Orange and  performed  our  own  sensitivity  analyses  on  key assumptions to assess the potential effect of a change in these assumptions on the conclusions of impairment tests (including  operating  cash  flows,  discount  and  perpetual growth rates);\n- -reconciled the data included in the valuation models used by the Group in the determination of recoverable values to the plans submitted to those charged with governance.\n\nRelating to the models used for the determination of recoverable values, we involved our valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in evaluating the discount and growth rates used in the valuations by comparing them against rate ranges that were independently developed using publicly available market data for comparable entities.\n\nWe have also assessed the appropriateness of the information presented  in  Notes  8  and  9  to  the  consolidated  financial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

At  that  date  unrecognized  deferred  tax  assets  amounted  to \u20ac3,714  million  and  mainly  comprised  tax  losses  that  can  be carried forward indefinitely.\n\nAs stated in accounting principles of Note 11.2.3, deferred tax assets  are  only  recognized  when  it  is  probable  that  the  tax entity will have sufficient future taxable profit to recover them. The recoverability of deferred tax assets is assessed based on the business plans used for impairment testing, which may be adjusted for tax specificities related to each jurisdiction.\n\nWe believe that the re cognition of defer re d ta x a s s ets a s s o c i a te d with tax loss carryforwards is a key audit matter, given their sensitivity  to  assumptions  made  by  the  Group,  particularly relating to Orange ability to achieve the performance forecasts in  the  business  plans  and  to  the  feasibility  of  the  Group  tax planning assumptions.\n\nWe tested certain controls implemented by the Group on the deferred tax valuation process notably relating to assumptions used and applicable tax regulations for  the  determination  of future taxable profit, which consisted in:\n\ndetermining whether the tax loss carryforwards could be used before they expire to offset deferred tax liabilities in the same tax jurisdiction; and\n\n- -determining  the  capacity  of  each  entity  to  generate future  taxable  profit  enabling  the  utilization  of  tax  loss carryforwards.\n- -We analyzed the method used by the Group to assess tax loss carryforwards to be used in the future.\n\nTo examined future taxable profit, we analyzed the reliability of the processes used to prepare the business plan to assess the probability of each entity recovering its deferred tax assets by:\n\nanalyzing the procedure used to develop and approve the latest business plans used for those estimates;\n\n- -comparing forecast performance from previous years with actual results for the years concerned;\n- -comparing  revenue  growth  rate  to  the  Group's  peer companies' analyst reports and market research reports.\n- -examining the consistency of assumptions made to assess deferred tax assets with those used for impairment testing (namely forecasted cash-flows and revenue growth rates);\n- -involving  tax  professionals  with  specialized  skills  and knowledge,  who  assisted  in  assessing  the  Group's application of the relevant tax regulations and evaluated the feasibility and viability of the Group's tax-planning strategies.\n- -We also assessed the appropriateness of the information presented in Notes 11.2.1 and 11.2.3 to the consolidated financial statements.",

Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could r e a s o n a b l y  b e  e x p e c t e d  t o  i n fl u e n c e  t h e  e c o n o m i c  d e c i s i o n s  o f  u s e r s taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs specified in Article L. 823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce), our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company.\n\nAs  part  of  an  audit  conducted  in  accordance  with  professional standards  applicable  in  France,  the  statutory  auditor  exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:\n\n- -identifies and assesses the risk of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs  and  performs  audit  procedures  responsive  to  those risks,  and  obtains  audit  evidence  considered  to  be  sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for the audit opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- -obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control;\n- -evaluates  the  appropriateness  of  accounting  policies  used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management in the consolidated financial statements;\n- -assesses the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained  is  sufficient  and  appropriate  to  provide  a  basis  for  our opinion.\n\nOur responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe  conducted  our  audit  engagement  in  compliance  with independence requirements of the French Commercial Code (Code\n\n## Key Audit Matters\n\n## Audit Response\n\n## Revenue recognition for telecommunications activities\n\nThe Company recognized in the annual financial statements \u20ac. 22,6 02 mill i o n  o f  r e v e n u e  f o r  t h e  y e a r  e n d e d  D e c e m b e r  31, 2020.\n\nThe  Company's  telecommunications  activities  involves a  wide  range  of  frequently  changing  services  and  large volumes of data processing. This requires various revenue recognition methods according to the type of product or service sold, and complex IT systems.\n\nRevenue  recognition  principles are presented  in Note 10.1.2 to the annual financial statements.\n\nRevenue recognition of telecommunications business is a key audit matter due to the complexity of the associated IT systems.\n\nFor  telecommunications  activities,  we  gained  insight  into  the accounting processes used to recognize various revenue streams, from contract signature and initial communication to invoicing and receiving payment.\n\nWe took into account the high level of integration of the various IT systems involved in revenue recognition by including IT specialists in  our  audit  team  and  testing  the  design,  implementation  and effectiveness of key automated system controls affecting revenue recognition.\n\nAs part of our work, we:\n\n- -identified the main controls set up by the Company that were relevant for our audit;\n- -tested the functions of business and commercial applications used  to  prepare  accounting  and  financial  information,  the configuration and interfaces of accounting systems;\n- -performed  analytical  procedures  and  tested  a  selection  of manual entries at year end, by comparing our revenue estimates, based on a combination of internal data and publicly available external data, with revenue recorded.\n\nWe  have  also  assessed  the  appropriateness  of  the  information presented  in  Notes  3.1,  5.7  and  10.1.2  to  the  annual  financial statements.\n\nde commerce) and the French Code of Ethics (Code de d\u00e9ontologie) for  statutory  auditors  for  the  period  from  January  1,  2020  to  the date of our report and specifically we did not provide any prohibited non-audit services referred to in Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014.\n\n## Justification of Assessments - Key Audit Matters\n\nDue  to  the  global  crisis  related  to  the  Covid-19  pandemic,  the financial statements of this period have been prepared and audited under specific conditions. Indeed, this crisis and the exceptional measures taken in the contex t of the state of sanitar y e me rg e n cy h ave had numerous consequences for companies, particularly on their operations and their financing, and have led to greater uncertainties on their future prospects. Those measures, such as travel restrictions and remote working, have also had an impact on the companies' internal organization and the performance of the audits.\n\nIt is in this complex and evolving context that, in accordance with the requirements of Articles L. 823-9 and R. 823-7 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit matters relating to risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period, as well as how we addressed those risks.\n\nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the financial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

Impairment  is  recorded  when  their carrying amount is higher than fair value, which is value in use for strategic investments.\n\nAs stated in Notes 10.1.5 and 10.1.6 to the annual financial statements, value in use of equity investments comprises estimated enterprise value less net debt (or plus net liquid assets),  which  is  calculated  in  its  currency  of  origin  and converted into Euros at the exchange rate effective at the reporting date.\n\nGoodwill is recognized at acquisition cost. Impairment is recorded when the carrying amount is higher than fair value, generally based on value in use.\n\nDue  to  the  short-term  volatility  of  market  value  and  the strategic nature of its investments, Orange S.A. uses the discounted cash flow method to assess enterprise value (excluding  for  banking  activity).  Discounted  cash  flow  is calculated based on economic and regulatory assumptions, assumptions  relating  to  license  renewals  and  operating forecasts by Management.\n\nOther  criteria,  such  as  market  value  (assessed  based on  average  share  price  over  the  last  20  trading  days), growth and profitability prospects, parent company equity, proportionate share in the investment (historic basis) can be taken into account, separately or in addition to value in use, when calculating fair value according to the type of each investment. As mentioned in Note 4.2, as at December 31, 2020, the business plans and key operational assumptions were sensitive to the Covid-19 pandemic consequences.\n\nGiven  their  significance  on  the  balance  sheet  and  the complexity of models used and their sensitivity to changes in  data  and  assumptions on which estimates are based, we believe that the evaluation of equity investments and goodwill is a key audit matter.\n\nWe  have  gained  insight  into  the  procedure  implemented  by the  Management  to  identify  indications  of  impairment  in  equity investments  and  goodwill,  and  where  appropriate,  to  determine impairment charge and reversals.\n\nWe have assessed the method used by Orange S.A. to identify impairment of equity investments and goodwill.\n\nTo assess the estimate of the values in use of equity investments and the value in use of goodwill, together with our valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, we:\n\n- -analyzed the procedure for determining and approving business plans on which cash flow forecasts are based;\n- -compared 2020 cash flow forecasts with business plans from previous financial years;\n- -compared the business plans from prior financial years with actual results of the related years;\n- -interviewed operational and finance managers at Orange S.A. to gain insight into the key assumptions used in business plans and assess assumptions based on the explanations obtained;\n- -evaluated  the  Group's  forecasted  revenue  growth  rates,  by comparing  the  growth  rate  to  the  Group's  peer  companies' analyst reports and market research reports;\n- -examined the sensitivit y analyses per formed by Orange S.A. and performed our own sensitivity analyses on key assumptions to assess the potential effect of a change in these assumptions on the conclusions of impairment tests (including operating cash flows, discount and perpetual growth rates);\n- -reconciled the data included in the valuation models used by the Company in the determination of recoverable values to the plans submitted to those charged with governance.\n\nRelating  to  the  models  used  for  the  determination  of  enterprise values, together with valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, we:\n\n- -tested the mathematical reliability of the models and recalculate values in use determined by Orange;\n- -analyzed the method used to determine the discount rate and perpetual growth rate, compare those rates with market data and external sources and recalculate the rates based on our own data sources;\n- -tested that enterprise value resulting from forecast cash flows had been adjusted for net debt for each entity considered.\n\nWe  have  also  assessed  the  appropriateness  of  the  information presented in Notes 4.1.1, 4.2, 10.1.5 and 10.1.6. to the annual financial statements.",

That includes controls related to the assessment of data provided by the Legal Department and external counsels;\n- -interviewing the Legal Department and the Secretary General of  your  Group  and  analyzing  the  documentation  available (specifically the minutes of court hearings) to assess the basis of assumptions used to determine the provisions for litigations;\n- -understanding the risk analyses performed by Management;\n- -examining the responses to third party confirmations requests: legal opinions of external counsels and underlying information including  ongoing  proceedings  and  the  probable  financial consequences;\n- -examining whether any events subsequent to the reporting date and information provided in the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 have been taken into account to estimate provisions.\n\nWe  have  also  assessed  the  appropriateness  of  the  information presented in Notes 7 and 10.1.14 to the annual financial statements.\n\nWith respect to the information relating to items that your company considered likely to have an impact in the event of a public takeover bid or exchange offer, provided pursuant to Article L. 22.10-11 of the  French  Commercial  Code,  we  have  agreed  this  information to  the  source  documents  communicated  to  us.  Based  on  these procedures, we have no observations to make on this information.\n\n## Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements\n\n## Format of presentation of the financial statements intended to be included in the Annual Financial Report\n\nIn accordance with Article 222-3, III of the AMF General Regulation, the Company's management informed us of its decision to postpone the  presentation  of  the  financial  statements  in  compliance  with the European single electronic format as defined in the European Delegated Regulation No 2019/815 of 17 December 2018 to years beginning on or after January 1st, 2021.

Our objective  is  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether  the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level  of  assurance,  but  is  not  a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise  from  fraud  or  error  and  are  considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs specified in Article L. 823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce), our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company.\n\nAs  part  of  an  audit  conducted  in  accordance  with  professional standards  applicable  in  France,  the  statutory  auditor  exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:\n\n- -identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- -obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control;\n- -evaluates  the  appropriateness  of  accounting  policies  used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management in the financial statements;\n- -assesses the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability  to  continue  as  a  going  concern.  This  assessment  is based  on  the  audit  evidence  obtained  up  to  the  date  of  his Audit Report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the Audit Report to the  related  disclosures  in  the  financial  statements  or,  if  such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein;\n- -evaluates the overall presentation of the financial statements and  assesses  whether  these  statements  represent  the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n\n## Report to the Audit Committee\n\nWe  submit  a  report  to  the  Audit  Committee  which  includes  in particular  a  description  of  the  scope  of  the  audit  and  the  audit program implemented, as well as the results of our audit. We also report,  if  any,  significant  deficiencies  in  internal  control  regarding the  accounting  and  financial  reporting  procedures  that  we  have identified.\n\nOur report to the Audit Committee includes the risks of material misstatement  that,  in  our  professional  judgment,  were  of  most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and which are therefore the key audit matters that we are required to describe in this report.\n\nWe also provide the Audit Committee with the declaration provided for  in  Article  6  of  Regulation  (EU)  N\u00b0  537/2014,  confirming  our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France such as they are set in particular by Articles L. 822-10 to L. 822-14 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce) and in the French Code of Ethics (code de d\u00e9ontologie) for statutory auditors.

This  last  section  lays  out\n\nOrange's  policy  for  managing  its  non-financial  risks,  as  well  as the  governance  and  processes  established  in  the  Group.  The non-financial performance presented below comprises the scorecard on the implementation of Orange's policies in 2020.\n\n## Dialogue with stakeholders\n\nOrange bases its CSR efforts on repeated, structured dialogue with all of its stakeholders, aimed at:\n\n- -ensuring  the  consistency  of  the  Group's  CSR  projects  and producing a materiality analysis;\n- -identifying  and  characterizing  the  risks  related  to  the  social and environmental challenges of the countries where Orange operates, focusing in particular on detecting 'weak signals';\n- -identifying opportunities for innovation opening up new prospects of growth for Orange, while supporting the social and economic development of the countries concerned.\n\nIn  2020,  Orange  worked  on  the  'country'  dialogue  in  a  new formulation to respond to the launch of the Engage 2025 plan, and drawing on new methods imposed by the health crisis. The new 'Responsible together in a post-Covid world' dialogue was launched in Sierra Leone, Poland and Tunisia in 2020, and will be launched in Madagascar, Slovakia, Jordan and France in 2021. It incorporates the CSR commitment pillars of the strategic plan as well as the notions of freedom of expression, data protection and work organization. It\n\n## The corporate purpose of Orange\n\nThe corporate purpose of Orange was constructed jointly during 2019, in consultation with its employees (over 15,000 interactions and  proposals,  130,000  votes)  and  with  its  internal  (social partners,  directors)  and  external  (NGOs,  think  tanks,  customers, authorities, suppliers, investors, etc.) stakeholders. It was unveiled in December 2019 and has been included in Orange's Bylaws, after approval by the Shareholders' Meeting of May 19, 2020 with 99.98% of votes in favor.\n\n'As a t r u s t e d  p a r t n e r,  O r a n g e  g i v e s  e v e r y o n e  t h e  k e y s  t o  a  r e s p o n s i b l e digital world'.\n\nIt comes with a mission and commitments:\n\n'Our mission is to ensure that digital services are well thought-out, made available and used in a more caring, inclusive and sustainable way in all areas of our business. Orange does everything in its power to ensure people and organizations enjoy a more autonomous and secure digital life. Through the engagement and expertise of the Group's teams, Orange employs innovative technologies and services everywhere, and for everyone'.\n\nOrange's corporate purpose is par t of the new Engage 2025 strategic plan, which is guided by exemplary social and environmental conduct.\n\nFor example, to promote digital inclusion, in addition to its connectivity offer,  Orange  will  be  rolling  out  digital  solidarity  schemes  in  all geographies between now and 2025. Among the initiatives taken in  this  respect,  Orange plans to; (1) open Orange Digital Centers bringing together open Code schools, Orange Fab and structures dedicated to solidarity inclusion, such as the FabLab, in each of the c o u n t r i e s  w h e r e  t h e  G r o u p  o p e r a t e s ;  ( 2 )  e s t a b l i s h  a  F o u n d a t i o n  i n  e a c h\n\nis expected to be rolled out across all of the Group's geographies over the next two years.\n\nA new 'Young people and the business world' Group dialogue was launched in 2019-2020 concerning the renewal of generations at Orange with broader thinking on the hopes, fears and preferences of young people. It was conducted in two regions of France (Hauts de France and \u00cele-de-France), in Egypt (at Orange Egypt and OBS Egypt) and in Senegal. It enabled us to identify areas for improvement in terms of young people's knowledge of jobs, as well as their appreciation and vision of the assignments and content of the positions on offer. A communication campaign launched in September 2020 helped r e p o s i t i o n  O r a n g e  a s  a  r e s p o n s i b l e  e m p l o y e r  t h a t  m e e t s  t h e  w i s h e s  o f young people and, more broadly, other audiences (work-life balance, interest in assignments and progression, work organization, etc.).\n\nOrange is also actively monitoring developments in order to better understand the expectations related to the changes brought about by  digital  technology,  notably  through  think  tanks,  collaborative workshops and the Digital Society Forum (DSF) open collaborative platform.\n\ncountry where this is legally possible, and extend the Foundation's programs (Digital Schools, Digital Home, Solidarity FabLabs, etc.) to all countries; (3) provide affordable smartphones and a so-called 'social' offer for customers who are the most excluded from digital technology in Europe; and (4) support its customers' uses with digital workshops in stores, other locations or online, as well as a space on its website dedicated to the safe and responsible use of digital technology. Orange intends to consolidate the formalization of its commitment to digital inclusion, based on ongoing collective work under the responsibility of the Group CSR.\n\nOn the environmental front, Orange is taking steps to be Net Zero Carbon by 2040, thanks to a revisited energy efficiency plan, the use of renewable energies, and carbon sequestration for its residual emissions. 2025 will mark a turning point for Orange, with a 30% reduction in its own CO2 emissions compared with 2015.\n\nOrange will report on the successful integration of the corporate purpose into its operations by monitoring the Group's progress in its areas of commitment, defined for a responsible economy, a society of trust, digital equality and the environment. The Group plans to set  up  a  Corporate Purpose Monitoring Committee with external personalities representative of its stakeholders.\n\nTo enable all Orange employees to adopt the challenges of Corporate Social  Responsibility  and  the  commitments  made  by  Orange  in this area, an online training course was launched in October 2020 and is available in French and English. It allows for a 'visa' to be obtained subject to completion of a test; as of December 31, 2020, 8,207 employees had registered for the training, and 5,277 visas had been issued.",

        "page_content": "## Note on methodology\n\n## 2020 non-financial reporting\n\nThe  Group  has  published  an  annual  report  on  sustainable development and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) since 2002. Since  2018,  it  has  also  published  a  Statement  of  Non-Financial Performance (SNFP).\n\nMore  detailed  information  on  employee-related,  social  and environmental commitments, impacts and performance is available at https://gallery.orange.com. All indicators related to reporting are also presented there.\n\n## Reporting period and scope\n\nThe  2020  SNFP  covers  the  period  from  January  1  through December 31, 2020.\n\nThe  information  presented  covers  all  the  Group's  activities and  countries  of  operation,  except  where  specifically  stated, corresponding to the scope of the consolidated subsidiaries. The list of the Group's main consolidated subsidiaries is given in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements (see Section 3.3).\n\nNote that the activities of Orange Bank were included from the 2017 fiscal year.\n\nFor  the  2020  fiscal  year,  the  scope  of  non-financial  reporting covers on average 97% of the Group's revenue. The coverage rate, estimated as a percentage of the revenue of the entities included in the scope, is specified for each indicator in the environmental and employee-related data tables.\n\n## Reporting methodology\n\nThe content of the report was prepared based on the indicators selected to take into account the main economic, employee-related, social  and  environmental  impacts  of  the  Group's  activities.  The selection  of  these  indicators  is  based  on  the  recommendations of international standardization bodies such as standard AA1000 APS (2008), the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), the United Nations Global  Compact,  the  guiding  principles  of  the  OECD  and  the ISO 26000 standard on Corporate Social Responsibility. Indicators were  collected,  calculated,  and  consolidated  with  the  help  of dedicated IT tools.\n\n## Application of the principles of the AA1000 standard\n\nThe  process  of  developing  the  2020  SNFP  observed,  in  its main  aspects,  the  three  principles  (inclusion,  materiality  and responsiveness) of the AA1000 Accountability Principles Standard ( A P S )  ( 2 0 0 8 ) ,  a  s t a n d a r d  i n  t h e  a r e a  o f  C o r p o r a t e  S o c i a l  R e s p o n s i b i l i t y based on taking stakeholders' expectations into account:\n\n- -inclusion: identifying the expectations of Orange's stakeholders is a determining factor in identifying sustainable development issues;\n- -materiality: selecting the most  significant  sustainable development issues in view of the Group's activities, taking into account stakeholders' expectations and an internal ranking of risks, which is reassessed regularly;\n- -responsiveness:  identifying the significant sustainable development issues for the Orange group's activities, resulting in action plans that are reassessed annually.\n\nMore information on the application of this process is available at https://gallery.orange.com.\n\n## Verification of the report\n\nAs in  previous  years,  Orange  has  appointed  one  of  its  Statutory Auditors, designated as an Independent Third Party, to verify the compliance of  the  Statement  of  Non-Financial  Performance  and the  accuracy  of  the  information  contained  in  the  Statement  that must appear in the consolidated Management Report prepared by the Board of Directors and presented to the Shareholders' Meeting. Orange has also requested a more in-depth verification of certain indicators  in  order  to  obtain  a  reasonable  assurance  report  (see Section 4.7 Report by one of the Statutory Auditors).\n\nThe verification of the most important non-financial information was conducted  within  a  selection  of  contributing  entities,  combining on-site and remote verifications. This work was supplemented by an in-depth review of the consolidation of non-financial information. The methodology was adapted to the fact that the Orange organization has multiple locations.\n\nThe conclusions of the verification work are given in the report on Orange's Statement of Non-Financial Performance (see Section 4.7 Report by one of the Statutory Auditors).\n\n- 4\n\n4",

In 2020, a security statute and objectives were presented to the members of the  Group  Executive  Committee  and  the  members  of  the  Board of Directors. A survey was also conducted by an external firm to assess Orange's position in relation to its European peers, measure progress since the most recent benchmarking and identify areas for improvement.\n\nIn its Human Rights 2020 Outlook report, Verisk Maplecroft notes that there is heightened risk to the protection of personal data given the extreme measures and unchecked powers implemented to combat the current health crisis, which set a precedent for state governance, particularly  in  Asia.  One  of  the  main  dangers  is  the  unrestricted access of governments to personal data, which could be used to stymie political opposition, curtail the free speech of populations and illegally monitor certain foreign nationals.\n\n## Operational organization\n\nThe approach taken by the Group Security Department is assessed annually to check compliance with the Group Security Standard. The annual entity reviews involve exchanges of information between the Security Department and the entities' management, involving relevant  members  of  the  Executive  Committee.  They  assess  the entities in terms of data security and suggest areas for improvement. Thirty-one reviews were carried out in 2020 on entities in Europe and  Africa  (operator  subsidiaries  and  Group  support  functions, representing more than 90% of Group revenue).\n\nAs  an  example,  they  helped  correct  vulnerabilities  or  made a  contribution  to  the  structuring  of  the  security  units  of  certain subsidiaries.\n\nIn terms of personal data protection, all 'Operator' subsidiaries in Europe and Orange Business Services had a Data Protection Officer (DPO) in 2020. The DPO network is managed under the framework of the Data Protection Committees by the Group DPO; it meets very regularly to ensure correct deployment of the compliance approach in line with developments in legislation, share best practice, analyze typical  complaints  and  review  the  entities'  internal  procedures. Several hundred people in the Group spend all or part of their time maintaining this continuous improvement approach and supporting the business divisions.\n\nFurthermore,  associated  with  this  network  are  numerous multidisciplinary  committees  in  the  entities  and  in  the  support functions that deal with the deployment and the compliance issues that may arise. The Legal Department and the DPOs are members. This structure has made it possible to ensure that the program has been well understood down to the business unit level. It complements the monitoring process of the Group's security policy.\n\nFor  entities  in  the  MEA  region,  regional  staff,  like  their  European counterparts, are made aware of personal data protection through meetings. Legal requirements in the MEA region are monitored.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Awareness and Training\n\nAs in the area of security, raising the awareness of all employees to the risks and ensuring that everyone acquires best practices is achieved through support from the Security Department and data protection training. An employee data protection charter has been distributed in  each  country  and  is  available  on  the  Company's  intranet.  The entities  have  promoted  follow-up  e-learning  programs  or  training sessions. In some entities, the participation rate is estimated at over 80% of employees.\n\n## Controls\n\nIn 2020, four Group entities in Europe and the MEA region underwent a remote evaluation to verify the proper implementation of the Group Security Standard, share best practices from other subsidiaries and collect  those  of  the  evaluated  subsidiary.  In  2020,  the  European countries (France, Spain, Poland, Slovakia, Romania, Belgium and Moldova)  maintained  their  score  for  compliance  with  the  Group Security Standard at approximately 90%. Within the MEA division, the creation of a shared skills center will accelerate the achievement of this score by 2025.\n\nThe results were shared with the entities' CEOs and used to adjust the action plans according to the areas of improvement identified.\n\nSimilarly,  the  Security  Oversight  Centers  (SOCs),  a  major  tool  in detecting  and  preventing  cyber  threats,  were  assessed  on  four principles: governance, process, technology and human resources. The objective is to help the SOCs mature and thereby become more effective at detection.\n\n| Indicators                                                                        | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| % of entities in Europe with a DPO                                                | 100%   | 100%   | 100%   |\n| % compliance with Group  security organization  requirements (Group average)      | 87%    | 90%    | 87%    |\n| % compliance with Group  security management system  requirements (Group average) | 85%    | 86%    | 85%    |\n\nThe decline in security indicators in 2020 is attributable first to the consolidation of new entities, and second to the introduction of more demanding requirements.\n\n## 4.1.1.2 Business opportunity: Orange Cyberdefense\n\nIn  May  2018,  Orange  combined  its  cyber  activities  within  the Group's Strategy and Cybersecurity Department (DSCS) in order to strengthen the security of the Group's systems and networks. The aim was both to ensure a high level of internal cyberdefense and to develop Orange's commercial activities in this strategic area.\n\nOrange Cyberdefense combines the historical  security  expertise and  infrastructure  of  Orange  Business  Services  (OBS)  with  that of Atheos, acquired in 2014, Lexsi, acquired in 2016, SecureData acquired in January 2019 and SecureLink, acquired in July 2019. Orange  Cyberdefense  thus  has  the  critical  mass  needed  in  this consolidating market, and the ability to support its customers locally in all their geographies.",

Thus, 18,910 confirmed incidents were treated in order to stop a proven attack. Its know-how was officially recognized by the French information systems security agency (Agence Nationale de S\u00e9curit\u00e9 des Syst\u00e8mes d'Information ANSSI), which in late 2018 awarded Orange Cyberdefense the French security-incident detection service PDIS certification.\n\nOrange Cyberdefense has at its disposal multiple OBS locations around the world and leverages Orange's 30 years of experience in making at-risk infrastructures secure, whether for SMEs, multinational corporations or local authorities. It draws on the security expertise of  2,400  employees  working  in  France  and  internationally.  This expertise, particularly in the area of research and threat knowledge, gives rise to open information sharing in the form of the publication of the Security Navigator guide.\n\n## 4.1.2 Breach of ethics rules\n\n## Tone from the Top\n\nOn December 10, 2020, the eighth edition of 'Ethics & Compliance Day' provided a f re s h o p p o r t u n i t y  t o  a f fi r m  t h e  E x e c u t i v e  C o m m i t t e e 's commitment  to  compliance,  with  talks  from  the  Delegate  Chief Executive Officer, the Secretary General and the Executive Director CSR, Diversity and Solidarity, as well as many Executive Directors and Managing Directors of subsidiaries.\n\n## Governance\n\nDespite lockdown in most of our countries, 2020 saw the governance work of the compliance program continue, with a presentation to the Governance and Corporate Social and Environmental Responsibility Committee  (GCSERC)  of  the  Group's  Board  of  Directors,  a presentation of the analysis of the risks of corruption and influence peddling to the Group Risk Committee, as well as the holding of a Risk Committee meeting dedicated to cases of fraud and corruption, attended by the Lead Director, and two sessions of the Group Ethics Committee.\n\n## Operational organization\n\nThe Compliance network (Chief Compliance Officers - CCO) met eleven times in 2020 to share information and recommendations by the Group CCO as well as to share experiences of the entity CCOs; the Ethics network (which brings together the Ethics Advisors) met three times in 2020 to share information and experiences and to define work projects for 2021.\n\nAmong the highlights of the actions carried out or continued in 2020, we note that:\n\n- -the  Group's  Anti-Corruption  Policy,  which  serves  as  a  code of  conduct  within  the  meaning  of  the Sapin 2  law,  has  now been rolled out and/or adapted throughout the Group and its subsidiaries;\n- -the Group's Fraud & Compliance due diligence methodology, which was completely updated in 2020, has been rolled out across all Group divisions and countries. Project reviews are used  to  monitor  the  implementation  of  the  methodology  by the  entities  and  give  rise  to  training  to  strengthen  control  of the procedure and to recommendations by Group Compliance experts;\n\nOrange Cyberdefense is also involved in skills-based sponsorship. Thus, at the beginning of the health crisis in the spring of 2020, Orange Cyberdefense made a free assistance hotline available to healthcare establishments, at the time victims of numerous cyberattacks, in partnership with the French Ministry of Solidarity and Health. The hotline  was  used  to  put  healthcare  establishments  in  touch  with experts on issues related to incident response, threat detection and protection against denial of service attacks.\n\nOrange is now positioned as a major player in the cybersecurity sector in Europe, with 768 million euros in revenue in 2020. Orange Cyberdefense has been assessed as a:\n\n- -'Strong Performer' in the Forrester Wave\u2122 Managed Security Services Providers (MSSPs) report for 2020;\n- -'Major Contender' in 2020 by The Everest Group worldwide assessment of IT Security and Services;\n- -'Major Player' by IDC on Asia/Pacific Managed Security Services.\n- -the prevention of conflicts of interest has been strengthened with  the  introduction  of  the  annual  declaration  of  interests by  management  in  certain  subsidiaries,  including  Orange Slovensko, Sonatel and Orange C\u00f4te d'Ivoire;\n- -the  rollout  of  tools  for  declaring  gifts,  meals  and  invitations continued in the entities and subsidiaries, and now covers more than 90% of Group revenue.\n\n## Awareness and Training\n\n- -the eighth 'Ethics & Compliance Day' on December 10, 2020 gave rise to numerous actions organized locally by CCOs, COs and Ethics Advisors in countries and entities: video messages or emails from CEOs or CCOs, training sessions, posters, games, competitions, exchanges and debates with internal or external experts;\n- -training  tools  and  materials  on  corruption  prevention,  which have been widely updated since 2018, helped to boost training initiatives in 2020: for example, after a version in French, English and Spanish, the UN-Orange Anti-Corruption Visa e-learning module was delivered in Polish and Slovak in 2020. Approximately 30,000 'UN-Orange Anti-Corruption Visas' were delivered in 2020, bringing the number issued to Group employees to nearly 75,000;\n- -communication tools were regularly made available to the Ethics and  Compliance  Networks  to  assist  them  in  communicating with teams on conflicts of interest and the prevention of the risk of corruption. They are designed for three types of audience: Directors, Managers and employees in order to deliver the most appropriate information. Finally, the Chief Compliance Officer spoke on ethics and compliance issues as part of the 'Orange Directors' training program for employee directors and a special edition of the Orange Directors Newsletter was devoted to Ethics & Compliance Day;\n- -the  Chief  Compliance Officer and members of his team also worked  with  the  Supervisory  Board  of  Orange  Poland,  the country managers of the MEA region and other management t e a m s  ( M E A  M a n a g e m e n t  C o m m i t t e e ,  M e r g e r s  a n d  A c q u i s i t i o n s Department, Recruitment, Employer Attractiveness and Career Development  Department,  Local  Government  Relations Department, among others).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 4\n\n4",

The areas experiencing a significant increase are related to customer complaints and data protection; their breakdown by origin of the issuer and by themes covered in 2020 are as follows:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA multidisciplinary team has been working towards the opening in 2021 of an external Internet platform for the collection of alerts in order to increase the system's visibility and security.\n\nReports are processed according to the procedure laid down by the Group or its subsidiaries: acknowledgement of receipt, review of the admissibility of the report and processing by teams authorized according to the area, while respecting the confidentiality  of  the whistleblower and the people concerned throughout the process.\n\n## Controls\n\n- -each  year,  the  'Ethics'  area  is  reviewed  in  accordance  with the  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act  (see  Section  2.2.3.2  Summary of internal control work implemented pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act),  with  a  review  of  the  following points:  existence  of  the  Code  of  Ethics  and  access  to  it  by employees, information for employees on conflicts of interest and the existence of an internal whistleblowing system, access to and communication on this system. This control concerns Orange SA and its main subsidiaries representing 95% of the Group's revenue. Both the work conducted by Orange and the independent assessment by the Statutory Auditors resulted in satisfactory findings for the 2020 fiscal year;\n- -the  Statutory  Auditors  also  monitor  the  progress  of  the  AntiCorruption Compliance program during twice-yearly meetings with the Group's Chief Compliance Officer and his team;\n- -lastly, the Internal Audit Department conducted several audits of Sapin 2 compliance programs in 2020 (Group and country programs), as well as several Standard Entity Reviews during which the Sapin 2 compliance program was also reviewed.\n\n| Indicators                                                            | 2020    | 2019   | 2018   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------|--------|\n| Governance: entities  with a Compliance and/ or Ethics representative | 100%    | 100%   | 100%   |\n| Training: UN-Orange  Anti-Corruption Visas  delivered during the year | ~30,000 | 37,200 | 5,400  |\n\nNo significant customer or supplier complaints have been formalized against the Group regarding Compliance issues.\n\n## 4.1.3 Breaches of human rights and fundamental freedoms\n\n## Human rights impact assessment and remediation\n\nOrange determines the criteria  corresponding  to  its  assessment of the human rights risks incurred as a result of its activities and geographies. As such, 13 dimensions of human rights are considered in the form of risk criticality indexes to provide an aggregate rating, country by country. They cover the robustness of the various countries in terms of the degree of corruption, democratic governance, the power of  the  judiciary  in  its  scope  and  effectiveness,  as  well  as respect for the rights of minorities, indigenous people and women.\n\nThey are supplemented by more specific dimensions as an operator of  critical  infrastructure:  digital  inclusion,  freedom  of  opinion  and expression,  and,  in  the  face  of  the  multiplicity  of  government injunctions, interception of communications or cut-off of telephone service  or  Internet  access;  for  the  first  time  the  dimensions  of government stability and civil unrest were also included in 2020.\n\nAs  an  employer  and  ordering  company  in  its  supply  chain,  the criterion of discrimination against employees is added.\n\nOn the basis of its 2020 human rights impact assessment, based on the ratings assigned by Verisk Maplecroft in the analytical framework described  above  for  the  entire  Orange  operator  scope,  Orange considers that three of the geographies in which it operates required sustained  attention  with  regard  to  respect  for  human  rights  and fundamental freedoms as of the end of 2020. They are Mali, the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic. A total of 1,260 people are directly employed by Orange (1) in these three  countries  to  serve  more  than  23.5  million  customers.  Five countries are assessed by Orange as also requiring special attention in  terms  of  human  rights  and  fundamental  freedoms.  They  are Guinea, Cameroon, Egypt, Burkina Faso and Madagascar. A total of 24,482 people (2) are directly employed by Orange in these countries to serve more than 55.5 million customers.\n\nThe Group identifies election periods as requiring special attention to prevent risks specific to its business as a critical infrastructure",

With the involvement of the subsidiaries concerned and the support of the Group Security Department, they verify the implementation of procedures enabling our employees to continue their essential activities in complete safety.\n\nTo  be  able  to  fully  exercise  its  power  to  oppose  any  unjustified request, Orange also ensures that it has the latest legal provisions allowing the authorities to request network cuts or communication interceptions,  particularly  before  elections  are  held.  Despite the  search  for  constant  dialogue  with  the  authorities,  Orange  is sometimes led, in liaison with the Global Network Initiative (GNI) and non-governmental organizations, to raise awareness among public opinion of discriminatory behavior or behavior that undermines respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.\n\nThe  Orange  Foundation  is  present  in  the  following  countries considered  to  require  attention:  Burkina  Faso,  Cameroon,  Mali, Guinea Conakry and Madagascar. It provides support to populations there through programs dedicated primarily to women and young people, in the areas of health and education.\n\n| Indicators         | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   |\n|--------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Number of serious  | 10     | 10     | 10     |\n| incidents handled* |        |        |        |\n\nThe number of annual tampering or service interruption requests is stabilizing. Requests for service interruption from governments are i ncreasingly concurrent with the electoral process (in the run-up to an election and during the election itself, including the counting period).\n\nOrange may receive several requests from the authorities, of different and simultaneous nature: request for reduction of Internet speeds, limits on access to certain social networks, interruption of different categories of telecommunication services.\n\nOrange  acts  in  accordance  with  the  GNI  principles  (see Section 2.2.4.1.3).\n\nLike  other  GNI  member  companies,  Orange  is  regularly  and independently assessed on its progress in implementing the GNI principles. The aim of the assessment is to enable the GNI's Board of Directors to determine whether each member company is making good faith efforts to implement its principles as part of a continuous improvement  approach.  The  independent  assessment,  which includes both an examination of the Group's processes (systems, poli c i e s  a n d  p r o c e d u r e s )  a n d  a n  e x a m i n a t i o n  o f  s p e c i fi c  c a s e  s t u d i e s , concluded that implementing the GNI principles is definitely a priority for the Group, that the principles are integrated in Orange's policies and that Orange is making good faith efforts to implement the GNI Principles in a process of continuous improvement. These findings\n\nwere published by GNI in April 2020, in its GNI Public Assessment Report.\n\n## Promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms\n\nOrange renewed its signature to the United Nations Global Compact in 2020, in accordance with the fundamental principles set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labor Organization.\n\nAs  a  signatory  to  the  United  Nations  Guiding  Principles,  Orange contributed  to  discussions  on  the  new  framework  to  be  put  in place after ten years of applying the Guiding Principles, as part of a working group led by the United Nations. Orange shares the United Nations' analysis on the effective implementation of the Principle of 'protection of human rights' by public authorities and the Principle of 'respect for human rights' by companies. Orange proposes to set up an analysis of the sharing of responsibility between public authorities and companies prior to the implementation of a Principle of 'reparation' yet to be developed.\n\nOrange works to promote human rights and fundamental freedoms and defends their values, particularly with regard to the responsibility it intends to assume in respect of its supply chain:\n\nAs  a  member  of  EDH  (Entreprises pour les Droits de l'Homme), Orange continued its dialogue with NGOs and social partners during 2020 on the themes of respect for human rights, particularly forced labor.\n\nOrange presented the progre s s of i t s  t h i n k i n g  a n d  s h a r e d  i t s  p r a c t i c e s :\n\n- -in  a  webinar  organized  by  the  French  Court  of  Auditors  in July 2020 on business resilience: Orange presented its actions relating  to  the  protection  of  human  rights  and  freedom  of expression during the period of lockdown. Orange highlighted the protection of its employees thanks to the massive use of telework,  its  responsibility  towards  its  suppliers,  in  particular towards  the  most  fragile  companies  for  which  measures  for immediate  payment  of  bills  were  applied;  with  respect  to  its customers, Orange implemented its business continuity plan, notably  by  reinforcing  the  capacity  of  its  networks  and  its cyberdefense offer;\n- -at  a  symposium  organized  in  October  2020  by  the  'Human Rights  Platform'  on  partnerships  between  the  private  sector and NGOs, Orange shared its vision of concerted actions within structured platforms such as the GNI, the JAC or the EDH on specific themes;\n- -Orange  took part in a webinar organized by CSR Europe with the participation of the European Commission in November 2020, to present the JAC (Joint Alliance for CSR) initiative, which makes cooperation central to interactions between prime contractors and their supply chain; this webinar was par t of the Commission's consultation process to establish a new regulatory framework for human rights due diligence.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 4\n\n4",

These  data  are  complemented  by those taken from the Group's financial reporting tool.\n\n## 4.2.1 Employment\n\n## General changes in the number of Group employees\n\nIn  2020,  the  main  changes  to  the  Group's  organization  were internal, adapting to changes in the business with the creation of the Wholesale and International Networks division (from the Corporate division),  the  reintegration  of  Spain  into  the  Europe  division,  and the relocation of the Middle East & Africa division's headquarters to  Casablanca,  within  a  new  company.  At  the  end  of  2020,  the Group had 142,150 active employees, of whom 139,269 were on permanent contracts and 2,881 on fixed-term contracts. The number of permanent contracts was down 3.0% (-4,257) on a historical and pro forma basis, with fixed-term contracts down 11.2% (-362). These trends vary depending on the different scopes.\n\nThey  were  mainly  driven  by  France,  where  the  Group  had 82,428  employees  at  the  end  of  December,  breaking  down as  81,295  permanent  and  1,133  fixed-term  contracts,  a  decline of  4,820  active  employees  (-5.5%),  i.e.  -4,578  permanent  and -242 fixed-term contracts. The decline was attributable to Orange SA (-4,828  permanent  contracts,  i.e.  -6.4%),  with  the  permanent contracts  of  the  French  subsidiaries  increasing  by  2.4%  (+250). The  reduction  in  fixed-term  contracts  (-17.6%)  was  observed  in comparable proportions  at  the  parent  company  (-176  or  -18.3%) and subsidiaries (-66 or -15.9%).\n\nAt  the  end  of  2020,  57,974  permanent  employees  were  working outside France, with a very slight increase of 0.6% (+322 permanent\n\nFor the fifth consecutive year, Orange received the Top Employer Global certification in February 2020, which recognizes best policies and practices in terms of human resources.\n\nemployees) compared with 2019. This international stability masks a number of differences:\n\n- -OBS international continues to increase its permanent workforce (+707  permanent  contracts,  i.e.  +4.8%),  mainly  in  emerging markets (Egypt, India, Morocco and Mauritius) within Equant;\n- -the Sofrecom division's permanent workforce also increased significantly (+285 permanent contracts, i.e. +17.9%), driven by its  operations  in  Morocco  and  Tunisia,  in  information  system consulting activities;\n- -the Middle East & Africa division also posted an increase in its permanent workforce between 2019 and 2020 (+186 permanent contracts, i.e. +1.3%);\n- -by  contrast,  the  Europe  division  reported  a  decline (-923 permanent contracts, i.e. -3.4%) due to the reduction in the  workforce  at  Orange  Polska  (-944  permanent  contracts, i.e. -7.9%) and Orange Belgium (-138 permanent contracts, i.e. -6.9%), partially offset by growth in Central Europe and, more marginally, in Spain.\n\nIn terms of average full-time equivalent employees (monthly average over the year), the Group's internal workforce was 133,787 FTEs at the end of 2020. This represents a reduction of approximately 2,200  FTEs  (-1.6%)  on  a pro forma basis, a trend driven almost exclusively by France (Orange SA).\n\n| Number of employees - active employees at end of period   | 2020        | 2019    | 2019    | 2018    |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|-------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Orange SA                                                 | 71,297      | 76,301  | 76,301  | 81,257  |\n| French subsidiaries                                       | 11,125      | 10,941  | 10,941  | 10,622  |\n| Total France  (1)                                         | 82,422      | 87,242  | 87,242  | 91,879  |\n| International subsidiaries  (1)                           | 59,728      | 59,526  | 59,526  | 58,832  |\n| Group total                                               | \uf0fc\uf0fc  142,150 | 146,768 | 146,768 | 150,711 |\n\n| Employees by contract type   | 2020        | 2019    | 2019 (pro forma)   | 2018    |\n|------------------------------|-------------|---------|--------------------|---------|\n| Permanent contracts          | 139,269     | 143,526 | 143,526            | 147,123 |\n| Fixed-term contracts         | 2,881       | 3,242   | 3,242              | 3,588   |\n| Group total                  | \uf0fc\uf0fc  142,150 | 146,768 | 146,768            | 150,711 |\n\n\uf0fc\uf0fc Item reviewed by KPMG: reasonable assurance.\n\nA new business line standard was implemented in France in 2019, and internationally in 2020.

At the end of 2020, one in two employees on fixed-term contracts was working in Customer activities (mainly sales and services for B2C customers). The innovation and technology businesses (information systems and networks) are their second sector of activity (21%).\n\n## Recruitments and departures\n\n| Number of outside hires on permanent contracts   | 2020      | 2019   | 2018   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|-----------|--------|--------|\n| Orange SA                                        | 779       | 1,419  | 1,701  |\n| French subsidiaries                              | 1,242     | 1,554  | 1,503  |\n| Total France  (1)                                | 2,021     | 2,973  | 3,204  |\n| International subsidiaries  (1)                  | 6,133     | 8,081  | 7,948  |\n| Group total                                      | \uf0fc\uf0fc  8,154 | 11,054 | 11,152 |\n\n- (1) Scope of financial consolidation: a company is assigned to the scope in which its revenue is consolidated\n- \uf0fc\uf0fc Item reviewed by KPMG: reasonable assurance .\n\nIn a context marked by the health crisis, Orange adapted the volume of its external recruitments to two main factors: change in its activity, and  the  turnover  rate.  Depending  on  the  region,  the  digitization of  certain  processes,  particularly  for  back-office  activities,  also\n\ncontributed to the year's downward trend. The number of external hires on permanent contracts carried out by the Group in 2020 was 8,154, a decline of 26.2% compared with 2019.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 4\n\n4",

Despite  a  decline of approximately 30% in volume compared with 2019, the Group met the commitments made in the intergenerational agreement of December 12, 2018, exceeding the target of 8,000 recruitments in this geographical area over the three-year 2018-2020 period. Anticipating the impact of retirements, these recruitments will also support the Group's transformation and intensify the acquisition of new skills. Over 80% of new hires are in the 'Innovation and Technology' and 'Customer' business lines. These new arrivals, more than 60% of whom are based in the growing French subsidiaries, continue to develop their expertise, particularly in software production design, data analysis, consulting and information systems integration and cybersecurity.\n\nOutside France, new hires totaled 6,133 in 2020, compared with 8,081 in 2019 (-1,948 or -24.1%), a decrease that was accompanied by a 26.9% drop in permanent departures within this scope.

The 12,453 departures of permanent employees in 2020 represented a decline of 19.2% (-2,963  departures)  compared  with  2019.  The  trend  is  more pronounced internationally (10% turnover rate (1) excluding retirement in 2020) than in France (1.5% turnover rate excluding retirement).\n\nIn France, 6,600 departures were recorded in 2020 (-801 departures compared with 2019, i.e. -10.8%), 80% of which were retirements, almost exclusively at the parent company. The downward trend can be seen in the various reasons for leaving: retirements were down 7.4% (-424), due to a slightly smaller number of eligible employees than  in  2019,  and  above  all,  the  uncertainty  linked  to  the  health crisis and the economic climate, which prompted some employees to  postpone  their  departure.  There  were  also  fewer  resignations (-235  compared  with  2019,  i.e.  -26%),  mainly  in  the  subsidiaries\n\nof the OBS division, which are involved in businesses with a high technological dimension (software design, data experts, etc.) that are usually subject to significant competition between companies in  the  sector.  Given  these  specificities,  turnover  rates  excluding retirements differ between Orange SA (0.8% in 2020) and the French subsidiaries (6.8%).\n\nThe trend was more pronounced on the international scope, where departures  were  down  27%  (i.e.  2,162  fewer  departures  than  in 2019). The change was mainly reflected in resignations (-1,798 or -34.6%),  which  were  down  significantly  across  all  divisions,  and layoffs (-1,138 or -59.4%). Only the voluntary departure indicator was up (approximately 770 more departures than in 2019), following the opening of a voluntary departure plan at Orange Poland as part of an agreement signed in 2019 and covering 2020-2021, on which the health crisis had no impact.\n\n## Professional integration of young people\n\n| Professional integration - Group in France  (1)                      | 2020  (4)   | 2019   | 2018   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|--------|--------|\n| Number of new students accepted for internships during the year  (2) | 1,697       | 2,614  | 2,617  |\n| Number of work-study contracts signed during the year  (3)           | 3,299       | 3,510  | 3,535  |\n\n- (1) Orange SA and its subsidiaries with employees in France.\n- (2) Concerns students who signed their internship agreement during the year.\n- (3) Apprenticeship and vocational training contracts.\n- (4) The 2020 figures are provisional.",

        "page_content": "The  health  crisis  and  the  resulting  lockdown  in  France  (from March 17 to May 11, 2020) had a significant impact on the number of internship agreements signed, which mainly took place during the first half of the year (down approximately 900, i.e. or 35% compared with 2019, of which 800 in the first half alone). These 1,697 internship agreements are below the average annual minimum commitment (2,400) provided for in the intergenerational agreement covering the 2019-2021 period signed with the social partners on December 12, 2018. The number of work-study contracts signed was expected to fall in 2020, but remained well above the average minimum annual commitment (2,150) provided for in the same agreement. In addition, there  were  4,661  students  on  work-study  contracts  in  France  at\n\nDecember 31, representing 5.7% of permanent contracts at the same date. The rate of professional integration in France therefore exceeds Orange's commitments to trade unions and legal obligations (5%).\n\nKeen to capitalize on their initial vocational experience and the skills acquired, the Group also gives preference to these young interns or work-study students in external recruitment for permanent contracts in the areas needed for the Group's future in France. In 2020, 591 of t h e m  ( r e p r e s e n t i n g  3 0 %  o f  p e r m a n e n t  h i r e s  i n  F r a n c e  d u r i n g  t h e  y e a r ) benefited from this program. Added to those completed in 2019, they represent nearly 71% of Orange's commitment to recruit at least 2,000 new employees over the 2019-2021 period.\n\n## External workforce\n\n| Interim employees - Group France  (1)             | 2020  (3)   | 2019   | 2018   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|-------------|--------|--------|\n| Amount of payments made to external companies for |             |        |        |\n| employee placement (in millions of euros)         | 25.1        | 36.7   | 40.7   |\n| Monthly average number of temporary workers  (2)  | 541         | 775    | 855    |\n\n- (2) Calculation of interim employee expenses recorded in the France Group's results.\n- (3) The 2020 figures are provisional.\n\nTemporary  labor  is  used  mainly  used  to  cope  with  temporary increases in activity, particularly the launch of new products and services, as well as sales campaigns and promotional offers.\n\nIt is presented in full-time equivalents (FTE) and as a monthly average over the year. In 2020, it mainly concerned commercial departments, in particular half for the sales activities to B2C customers, and nearly a quarter of the total in B2B sales and service. Less significant in network activities, the use of temporary labor represents a small\n\nvolume in information systems activities. The 30% decline compared with 2019, driven mainly by B2C customer relations activities impacted by the health crisis, is found across all activities.\n\nThe Group recommends using temporary employees rather than employees  on  fixed-term  contracts  for  assignments  of  less  than two months. External labor represented 0.5% of the Group's total workforce in France in 2020.\n\n## Outsourcing\n\n| Outsourcing - Group France  (1)                       | 2020  (3)   | 2019  (4)   | 2018    |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|---------|\n| Amount of subcontracting (in millions of euros)       | 2,820.8     | 2,724.3     | 2,529.9 |\n| Full-time equivalent workforce (monthly average)  (2) | 35,721      | 33,691      | 31,100  |\n\n- (3) The 2020 figures are provisional.\n- (4) The 2019 figures have been updated.\n\nThe use of employees belonging to external companies takes the form of service contracts. In France, they are mainly used in the field of networks, in the areas of technical intervention (on the networks and on the customer's premises), studies, engineering, architecture, as well as in B2B and B2C customer relations and service. They are also used in the field of information systems on design, development and integration activities.\n\n## 4.2.2 Compensation\n\nCompensation and recognition are mainly based on:\n\n- -the basic salary;\n- -variable  compensation,  which  rewards  individual  and  group performance, through the achievement of both quantitative and qualitative targets in the service of customer satisfaction;\n- -collective  compensation,  such  as  incentive  or  profit-sharing schemes in France;\n- -the allocation of shares to certain executives under long-term incentive plans;\n\nThe use of subcontracting concerned 35,721 full-time equivalent employees (monthly average over the year) at end-December 2020, compared with  33,691  FTEs  in  2019,  an  increase  of  6.0%.  This external  labor  accounted  for  32.1%  of  the  total  Group  France workforce (Orange SA and Group subsidiaries operating in France). The upward trend mainly reflects the efforts implemented by the Group to continue the development of fiber (construction of the very high-speed broadband network and customer connections), mainly in the second half of 2020.\n\n- -benefits  programs,  covering  health,  death  and  disability insurance, savings and retirement, in addition to non-monetary items, which are socially responsible solutions that also develop a sense of belonging to the Company. Employee shareholding programs also contribute to this aim, while increasing employees' share in the Group's capital (see Section 6.2.1 Distribution of capital and voting rights).\n\nThe  compensation  policy  of  the  Group's  entities  is  managed  in close  collaboration  with  the  Finance  Department.  It  takes  into account the local situation, in particular through legal obligations, the macroeconomic environment, the rate of voluntary departures (turnover) and compensation policies observed in the market.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 4\n\n4",

These agreements are based mostly on a financial indicator and operating priorities, including the quality of service provided to customers. When targets are achieved, the amount of payroll paid out as the incentive bonus is usually around 4%.\n\nUnder the agreement at Orange SA for 2018 to 2020, the incentive bonus  is  based  primarily  on  the  achievement  of  an  operating performance  indicator  (growth  in  revenue,  control  of  operating expenses and optimization  of  investments  in  all  markets),  with  a weighting of 60%. This indicator is supplemented by an indicator r e l a t i n g  t o  t h e  q u a l i t y  o f  s e r v i c e  o f f e r e d  t o  c u s t o m e r s ,  w i t h  a  w e i g h t i n g of 30% (measuring customer satisfaction across all universes and markets), plus a CSR indicator relating to the control of electrical energy consumption, which accounts for 10%.\n\nIncentive  bonuses  representing  4.7%  of  the  payroll  were  paid in  May  2020, in respect of 2019. For an average yearly salary of 50,000 euros, the individual incentive bonus came to 2,440 euros.\n\nFor  2020,  a  provision  for  exceeding  the  operating  performance, service quality and energy management targets was recognized at December 31, 2020.\n\n| (in millions of euros)          | 2020     |   2019 |   2018 |\n|---------------------------------|----------|--------|--------|\n| Orange SA incentives            | 195  (1) |    191 |    180 |\n| Additional Orange SA incentives | 195  (1) |    191 |     17 |\n\n- (1) Amount funded at December 31, 2020.\n\n## Employee profit-sharing\n\nAn employee profit-sharing agreement was signed with the trade unions in France in June 2013, replacing the previous agreement. This  agreement  applies  to  the  employees  of  Orange  SA  and  its majority-owned French subsidiaries that are parties to the agreement.\n\nUsing a dispensatory calculation formula, the special profit-sharing reserve of each company is equal to 4% of its operating income ( l o s s )  ( F r e n c h  G A A P ) ,  a n d  t h e  G r o u p 's  p r o fi t - s h a r i n g  r e s e r v e  a m o u n t s to  the  sum  of  the  positive  special  profit-sharing  reserves  of  the companies that are parties to the agreement.\n\nThe  Group's  special  profit-sharing  reserve  is  distributed  among all beneficiaries, 20% based on their length of service and 80% in proportion  to  their  gross  annual  compensation.  Employees  may choose whether their individual amounts are paid to them directly or deposited in the Group Savings Plans.\n\nThe following table shows the amount of profit-sharing distributed over the last three years under the Group profit-sharing agreement in France.\n\n| (in millions of euros)                      | 2020     |   2019 |   2018 |\n|---------------------------------------------|----------|--------|--------|\n| Special profit-sharing reserve of the Group | 119  (1) |    146 |    148 |\n\n- (1) Amount funded at December 31, 2020; including 115 million euros funded in the Orange SA accounts.\n\n## The Orange Vision 2020 free share award plan\n\nOn October 25, 2017, Orange's Board of Directors decided to launch a  free  share  award  plan  with  performance  conditions,  known  as Orange Vision 2020. Its purpose was to recognize the contribution of employees to the success of the Essentiels 2020 strategic plan and to increase employee shareholding in the Group.\n\nGiven  that  five-sixths  of  the  performance  conditions  set  by  the Board of Directors (50% organic cash flow and 50% EBITDAaL), measured against the budgets for the 2017, 2018 and 2019 fiscal years, were met, the Orange Vision 2020 plan was delivered to more than 124,000 employees in 87 countries in April 2020, in a volume of 6.8 million shares or the monetary equivalent in certain countries.",

The large number\n\nof employees recorded in the below 30% category relates to this phase of the program.\n\n## Telework\n\nSince the agreement of June 22, 2009, telework has been one of the methods of organizing work within the Group in France. Consolidated by new agreements and amendments (in 2013 and 2017), its practice has been developed and extended to all levels of the organization. Thus, in 2019, more than 34,000 Orange SA employees benefited from a regular telework amendment and/or made use of the occasional telework provided for in the agreement. In 2020, the health crisis and lockdown in different geographies accelerated the trend: during the first period of lockdown, approximately 100,000 Group employees, of whom 62,000 in France, worked entirely from home. This method of organization, which is popular with employees, is also, outside the specific health context, a factor of transformation and attractiveness for the Group, which is considering changing the way it is organized as part of the employee-related and social challenges of the Engage 2025 plan.\n\n## Absenteeism\n\n| Number of days of employee absence due to illness  (1)   | 2020  (2)   | 2019  (3)   | 2018      |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|-----------|\n| Group total                                              | 1,172,683   | 1,092,105   | 1,088,973 |\n| o/w Orange SA                                            | 685,307     | 656,142     | 679,895   |\n\n- (2) The number indicated for Orange SA corresponds to data for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020.

It comprises 33  members  representing  24  countries  across  the  world,  each with more than 400 employees. It met once in 2020. It examines economic,  financial  and  employee-related  matters  of  a  global  or transnational nature, such as the Group's general business and its probable developments, its financial position, its Corporate Social Responsibility, and its industrial, commercial and innovation strategy.\n\nEmployee  representatives  are  either  trade  union  representatives a p p o i n t e d  b y  t h e i r  t r a d e  u n i o n  t o  s i t  o n  t h e  c o m m i t t e e ,  r e p r e s e n t a t i v e s appointed  by  elected  forums  of  employees,  or  employee representatives appointed by a democratic process according to locally defined rules.\n\n## In Europe\n\nThe  European  Works  Council  is  made  up  of  25  employee representatives  from  19  countries.  It  met  three  times  in  2020  to discuss,  with  employee  representatives,  subjects  relating  to  the economic and financial position by business sector, the probable development of the Group's activities and structure, industrial and innovation strategy, and major investment and employment trends.\n\n## 4.2.5 Health and Safety\n\n## Quality of life at work\n\nThe Orange group is committed to making its occupational health, safety and quality of life policy a cornerstone of its CSR policy. It is based on the global health and safety agreement and the laws and regulations in force in each country. It also meets the requirements of the French law on the Duty of Vigilance of March 27, 2017. Details of  the  Group's  commitments  can  be  found  in  section  2.2.4.2.2. Occupational health and safety.\n\nEach year, all Group employees are invited to express their views on  their  experience  at  work  through  a  survey  measuring  their perception of the quality of life at work and employee support for the implementation of the strategic plan.\n\n55% of employees responded to the survey in 2020, a year marked by the implementation of the Engage 2025 strategic plan and the Group's ability to adapt its operating methods during the health crisis.\n\n## In France\n\nIn 2020, the Social and Economic Committee (CSEC) of UES Orange met 25 times, mainly to discuss measures implemented in the contex t of the Covid-19 pandemic and for recurring information-consultation meetings (strategy, economic and financial position of the company, social policy, employment and working conditions).

This testifies to the strong involvement of the local executive teams.\n\nIn addition, according to our Group occupational health and safety policy framework, each entity must have an occupational health and s a f e t y  m a n a g e m e n t  s y s t e m .  S e v e r a l  m a j o r  e n t i t i e s  h a v e  b e e n  a u d i t e d\n\nand certified ISO 45001 since the publication of this new international s t a n d a r d .

In 2020, the Group had 20 ISO 45001 entities that were cer tified for their OHSMS, covering 10% of the Group's total workforce. The remaining entities are regularly audited, according to a reference framework based on OHSAS 18001 or ISO 45001, without any certification process. The audit program was successfully maintained in France despite the international health crisis. It was not possible to do the same in the rest of the Group, as international travel has been limited since March 2020: a support program for non-certified OHSMSs was  offered  to  more  than  20  entities  operating  internationally  in several countries, to enable them to obtain ISO 45001 certification at a later date.\n\nTraining for managers and information sessions for pilot partners (a member of the Management and the entity's OH&S officer) are held regularly in France. Internationally, a similar process also began in January 2020 in several entities of the MEA division.\n\n| Number of cases that were classed as occupational illness   |   2020  (1) |   2019 |   2018 |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|--------|--------|\n| Total Orange SA                                             |          13 |     32 |     33 |\n\nThe 'number of cases classed as occupational illness' indicator concerns Orange SA exclusively. Over 80% of occupational illnesses recognized are musculoskeletal disorders. The figures are too low in absolute terms to make a meaningful interpretation. It should also be noted that this indicator only concerns files for active employees.\n\n## Specific case of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic\n\nHealth crisis management exercises are a regular feature within the Orange group, due to its presence in endemic areas with annual occurrences (the last two years have been marked by leprosy in Madagascar, Ebola hemorrhagic fever in the Democratic Republic of\n\nCongo, measles in Africa, Europe and the United States). Health alerts are then published on the Group's reference site (Travel security), which  also  addresses  security  risks  (terrorism,  social-political disorders, etc.) and natural disasters (earthquakes, hurricanes, etc.).\n\nThanks  to  this  experience,  Orange's  reactivity  at  both  local  and corporate  level  was  much  greater  in  the  specific  context  of  the SARS-CoV-2 health crisis.\n\nSee Section 1.3 Significant events - Effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on the Group's activities and financial position.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 4\n\n4",

Its implementation was discussed with the trade union organizations. The Monitoring and Compensation Committee, set up on October 1, 2019 to examine individual claims submitted by individuals present in the Company between 2007 and 2010 and their beneficiaries, extended the period for filing claims\n\nfrom June 30 to December 31, 2020. It is responsible for reaching amicable solutions and settlements in order to avoid long, costly and socially painful litigation procedures for those concerned.\n\nAt the end of December 2020, approximately 1,700 individual claims had been received, of which only a portion has been processed to  date,  and  approximately  470  have  been  closed  following  an agreement.\n\n## 4.2.6 Training\n\n| Number of training hours  (in millions) (1)                    | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Group total audited scope 2020 (80% of consolidated employees) | 1.98   | -      | -      |\n| Group total audited scope 2019 (66% of consolidated employees) | -      | 2.49   | -      |\n| o/w Orange SA                                                  | 1.38   | 2.15   | 2.46   |\n\n| Number of training hours per employee  (1)                     | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Group total audited scope 2020 (80% of consolidated employees) | 17.7   | -      | -      |\n| Group total audited scope 2019 (66% of consolidated employees) | -      | 26.0   | -      |\n| at Orange SA                                                   | 19.0   | 27.8   | 30.4   |\n\nIn 2020, the training activity was severely impacted by the health crisis in all regions where the Group operates. Compared with the pro-forma figure for 2019, the total volume of training hours was down by one-third in 2020.\n\nThe lockdown measures imposed in the various countries and the widespread take-up of telework, particularly in France, have resulted in  the  elimination  of  face-to-face  training  and  a  massive  shift  to the remote format, which generally runs for a shorter period. This adaptation ensured the continuity of the training offer throughout 2020 and access to training for as many people as possible. The rate of access to training was over 80%, stable compared with 2019, with nearly 92,000 employees trained in 2020.\n\nDuring this period, priority was given to the training required to carry out the Group's priority activities, as well as to training for managers and employees on remote work and management.\n\nIn  2020,  the  teams  at  Orange  Campus,  the  Group's  networked school,  mobilized  to  support  all  Group  employees  in  developing a common foundation of knowledge, skills and practices in Data AI.  This  dedicated  three-year  program  is  complemented  by  four personalized courses, offered according to the profiles and needs of each employee. The Orange Campus digital offering has been enhanced  by  a  large  number  of  technical  or  behavioral  training modules  (soft  skills).  Lastly,  Orange  Campus  launched  a  new managerial development of fer, with the aim of enabling each manager to learn from him or herself and use his or her best resources to adapt to each situation.\n\nFor Orange France, training  initiatives  to  support  the  Group's strategic challenges continued, increasingly with digital and modular delivery. Training efforts focused specifically on reinforcing customer service soft skills, supporting the store transformation through the Smartstores concept and upskilling in the areas of cybersecurity, future networks (5G, etc.) and IT.\n\nFor Orange Business Services, training  covered  four  strategic skills  areas:  customer  empathy,  digital  confidence,  technological leadership, and business openness and agility. Skills development focuses mainly on cyberdefense, digital services (API - Application Programming Interface, IoT - Internet of Things, M2M - Machine to Machine), software development, the Cloud and the virtualization of  networks and Big Data. The Group also continued to support its employees in the areas of anti-corruption, compliance and data protection,  in  line  with  its  ambition  to  be  a  trusted  operator  for businesses.\n\nIn Europe, the emphasis was placed on the development of key skills, acculturation to agility and the development of new leadership models.  In  addition  to  customer  empathy  and  convergence,  the training mainly focused on cybersecurity, IoT and AI, with a growing proportion of digital content.\n\nIn the Middle East & Africa segment, skills development continued in the seven strategic areas identified as playing a major role in digital transformation in Africa and the Middle East: cybersecurity, Big Data, AI, new financial services, Cloud, IoT/M2M and B2B/ICT.",

The methodological precisions or limitations of some indicators are specified below and include, among  others,  compilations  of  the  precisions  given  under  the employment indicator tables.\n\n## Breakdown of men-women among supervisory staff (permanent employees at the end of the period)\n\nThe rule for calculating the 'supervisory staff' indicator is based on the active workforce with permanent contracts.\n\nThe  'supervisory  staff'  indicator  includes  employees  belonging to the 'senior management' category, which corresponds to the consolidation of levels E, F and G of the French National Collective Agreement for Telecommunications (CCNT), or the equivalent level for the employees of entities outside France and French subsidiaries that do not benefit from this agreement.\n\n## Percentage of women in the management network\n\nThe management network is a network comprising 1,326 managers at  the  end  of  2020.  Its  members  all  hold  positions  of  very  high responsibility in the Orange group.\n\n## Disabled employees - Orange SA\n\nThe 'number of disabled employees' indicator relates to the numbers of  employees  declared  in  the  DOETH  (Obligatory  Declaration  of Employment of Disabled Workers).\n\nTheir  'integration  rate'  and  'employment  rate'  are  calculated according to the DOETH methods. The figure shown for 2020 is provisional due to the processing time of the declarations.\n\n## Number of departures\n\nThe 'number of resignations' and 'number of dismissals' indicators only take into account the departure of employees in active work on a permanent contract. Thus, the departure of employees that are temporarily not working (inactive employees: long-term medical leave, extended leave, unpaid leave, etc.) are not included in these indicators.\n\nThe 'number of final departures of permanent employees' indicator referred to in the employment section of the Management Report, includes by convention the balance of provisional recruitments and departures from the Group, with provisional departures being higher than entries.\n\n## Training hours\n\nThe number of training hours per employee is calculated on the basis of the number of training hours divided by the average monthly number of active employees over the year.\n\nThe  data  reported  on  Group  training  comes  from  two  types  of reports: one via the Group's Orange Learning tool currently being rolled out in all subsidiaries worldwide, and the other via monthly reporting from subsidiaries using their own information system in addition to Orange Learning.\n\nTo calculate the indicators related to training, the 2020 reporting scope  covers  80% (1) of  the  consolidated  Group  workforce,  as  a result of ongoing actions to improve the reliability of the information.\n\n## Health and safety indicators\n\nThe  coverage  rate  for  these  indicators  was  more  than  97.8%  of employees at the end of 2020. Accidents reported by the countries comply with local regulations.\n\nThe figures given for Orange SA correspond to fiscal year 2020, recorded at December 31, 2020. The figures for the prior year are updated with the final figures when the subsequent fiscal year is reported, taking account of any adjustments made at a later date.\n\nThe definition of the 'number of employee days of absence due to illness' and 'number of employee days of absence due to occupational accident' indicators relates to employees on permanent contracts and employees on fixed-term contracts.\n\nThe 'number of employees recognized as having an occupational illness' indicator only takes into account recognized occupational illnesses declared by active employees.\n\nThe 'frequency rate of occupational accidents' relates to the number of occupational accidents with lost time per million theoretical hours worked per year.\n\nThe 'severity rate of occupational accidents' relates to the number of  days  of  sick  leave  for  occupational  accidents  per  thousand theoretical hours worked per year.\n\nThe number of theoretical hours worked over the year fluctuates by country. It is calculated based on the number of employees in active employment (full-time equivalent), the number of annual theoretical working  days,  and  the  number  of  theoretical  hours  worked  per day in each country where the Group operates (as reported by the subsidiaries for the last two items).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 4\n\n4",

In this regard, Orange has made digital inclusion one of the pillars of its commitment in its Engage 2025 strategic plan, covering the period 2020-2025 (see Section 1.2.2 The Orange group strategy).\n\nOrange's commitment to inclusion covers:\n\n- -society,  through  schemes  promoted  by  its  Orange  Digital Centers, its support for entrepreneurship and its Foundations;\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- -its  customers, through the digital coverage of regions, social offers,  support  for  uses  and  complementary  services  to connectivity (banking services, energy, health services, etc.);\n- -its  employees,  with  a  policy  promoting  diversity  and  equal opportunities, the strengthening of commitment programs (skills sponsorship, volunteering).\n\nIt  is  supplemented  by  measures  aimed  at  promoting  a  range  of responsible products and services across its entire scope.\n\n## 4.3.1 Orange's commitment to inclusion for society\n\n## 4.3.1.1 Orange Digital Centers\n\nOrange has made a commitment to open an Orange Digital Center in each of its geographical areas (at least one site per country and s e v e n  a c r o s s  F r a n c e ) ,  i . e .  a t  l e a s t  t h i r t y - t w o  c e n t e r s  b y  2 0 2 5  ( e i g h t e e n in the MEA region, and seven in Europe excluding France).\n\nThe  Orange  Digital  Center  is  the  structuring  and  emblematic mechanism for Orange's commitment to make digital technology an opportunity for all.  It  is  a  place  that  brings  together  a  coding school, an Orange Fab and/or an incubator, a solidarity FabLab and an Orange Ventures branch, where this exists within the business scope in question.\n\nEntirely free and accessible to everyone, with particular attention paid to the professional integration of women, these centers offer a wide range of tools and services that provide access to digital skills  learning  paths  and  the  creation  of  activities  based  on  new technologies and with a strong social impact.\n\nDigital  inclusion  is  made  a  reality  through  a  coherent  and comprehensive course of free training in digital ecosystems, offering the opportunity to follow a unified pathway, ranging from help to increase the employability of young people in reintegration programs, to support for talent and entrepreneurs. Orange Campus programs (under  the  Orange  Digital  Center  brand)  is  also  able  to  support certain Orange employees or those outside the Group towards future digital professions (data and artificial intelligence, cybersecurity). The strength of Orange's action lies in a complete network of regions, in order to sustainably embed its inclusion initiative and roll it out across a multiplicity of sites in regions and rural areas (Maisons digitales, Orange 'Studios' in Poland). At the end of 2020, three Orange Digital Centers were already operational.\n\n## 4.3.1.2 Support for entrepreneurship\n\nIn a hyper-connected world, Orange promotes synergies between players by creating ecosystems for support and exchange and by sharing knowledge in an Open Innovation approach. Orange works hard to set up support systems at every stage in the life of start-ups to train, identify, assist and promote digital talent.\n\nThrough its numerous calls for bids, Orange picks the start-ups most likely  to  lead  the  coming  changes in digital habits and integrates them into the digital ecosystem. Orange provides various kinds of technical and expert support covering the spectrum from incubation to acceleration, as well as access to financing that is appropriate to the different levels of start-up maturity. Accelerators of start-ups, the  seventeen  Orange  Fabs  form  a  global  network  that  aims  to build commercial partnerships with the Group through managerial strengthening and commercial development programs. The Group also supports various incubators and incubator networks in France and Africa via its subsidiaries, particularly in Senegal, Guinea and Mali. In order to open up the field of impact entrepreneurship, Orange\n\nis supporting La Ruche (social business incubator) across France, Ronalpia in the Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes region, and is a partner of Incub'Innov, an incubator located in Seine-Saint-Denis dedicated to start-ups linked to African diasporas. The programs in which Orange is a partner, the UNDP's SDG Finance Geneva Summit and AFIDBA (AFD For Inclusive and Digital Business in Africa) support innovation with a positi ve i m p a c t  i n  e m e r g i n g  m a r k e t s ,  p a r t i c u l a r l y  o n  t h e  A f r i c a n continent.  Lastly,  Orange  encourages  entrepreneurial  initiatives combining employees and start-ups, with the Villa Bonne Nouvelle, Villa  Atlantique  and  Villa  Occitanie  incubators  and  corp-working (corporate/co-working) spaces in France.\n\nOrange provides  financial  support  via  investment  funds:  Orange Ventures (a 350-million-euro tech fund that invests globally), Teranga Capital (in Senegal) and Como\u00e9 (in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire);\n\nFinally, Orange also provides expertise and visibility, with:\n\n- -the  Orange  Start-up  platform,  dedicated  to  promoting  and supporting innovative companies in all the Group's geographical regions;\n- -digital tools such as Cloud Starter, a Cloud Computing platform for start-ups, and Orange Developer, which brings together all of Orange's API & SDK toolset and development kits;\n- -co-ordination in communities: Imagine with Orange, which is active in 56 countries, Villa Bonne Nouvelle, a showcasing of the Group's HR innovation, Les Ambitieuses TechForGood program, launched in partnership with La Ruche social innovation incubator, and the Orange Social Entrepreneur awards in Africa and the Middle East (POESAM), which identify and assist around fifty innovative start-ups every year at national and/or international level, to meet sustainable development challenges in this part of the world.\n\n## 4.3.1.3 Philanthropy and the Orange Foundation\n\nThe Orange Foundation works to promote the social and vocational integration of young people and women in difficulty: young people without qualifications or jobs, women in vulnerable situations and people with autism. For the past thirty years, the Foundation has provided them with access to education, health and culture, helping them integrate better into society. Orange also contributes to the democratization  of  culture  among  all  sections  of  the  population, by  promoting  access  to  vocal  music,  books  and  museums.  The Foundation is currently active in all these areas, ensuring that digital skills,  which  have  become  essential,  are  in  integral  part  of  equal opportunities.  Thus,  with  the  support  of  committed  employees, t h r o u g h  m o r e  t h a n  24 . 5  m i l l i o n  e u r o s  i n v e s t e d  i n  2 0 2 0  w i t h  5 74  p a r t n e r associations, the Orange Foundation is enabling its beneficiaries to make a new start.",

        "page_content": "As part of its new strategic plan covering the next five years, Orange has committed to:\n\n- -extend  opportunities  for  Group  employees  to  deliver  skills sponsorship (in a general interest association, one of the areas supported  by  the  Foundation  or  by  leading  digital  support workshops for employees who choose the Orange Solidarity association,  for  example),  until  now  only  available  under  the French part-time for seniors plans, to employees transferring within the Group. Since 2010, 3,120 employees have chosen this commitment as part of their French part-time for seniors (TPS) plans, through partner associations (420 active employees at the end of 2020). Since 2019, a pilot program has been underway on a skills sponsorship program for the Group's young talents. It allows them to undertake assignments for periods of three to six months in associations supported by the Foundation, such as FabLabs or 'Missions Locales' (French public system for the return to employment of disadvantaged young people);\n- -ensure the Foundation has a presence in each of the countries where it operates, grouping together the philanthropic programs within  a  common  structure  to  promote  synergy  between  the different actions it performs, in particular giving vulnerable young people and women access to digital tools. The foundation's actions are present in twenty-seven countries. In this scope, sixteen local foundations are operational, and work has begun in four other countries.\n\nIn this way, in 2020:\n\n- -1,000 Digital Schools in sixteen countries enabled 500,000  students  in  remote  schools  without  books  and  the Internet to access educational content;\n- -over 500,000 people benefited from the infrastructure of one hundred  'Orange  Villages'  in  eleven  countries:  water  points, health centers and schools for young people in Africa;\n- -despite the health crisis, 5,400 Digital Workshops (face-to-face or  remote)  organized  in  France  provided  digital  training  to 24,000 people in difficulty;\n- -since 2014, 131 FabLabs Solidaires in t went y-one countries have remotivated and trained young people who are unemployed or not in school in the digital industry, to prepare them for the jobs of the future, and 320 Maisons digitales in twenty-three countries have  helped  give  independence  back  to  several  thousand women by offering them digital training.\n\nIn addition, the Orange Foundation contributed to the solidarity effort in the fight against Covid-19 by funding equipment worth 2.75 million euros in 2020. Each country received health kits (masks, gloves, gel, etc.) and a fund for carrying out emergency actions. Orange also supported the FabLabs Solidaires for the manufacture of more than 220,000 visors for hospitals.\n\n## 4.3.2 Orange's commitment to inclusion for its customers\n\nMobile network coverage continues to increase on all continents. In  Europe, the population without coverage is estimated at 1% (1) , with  9%  in  the  North  Africa  and  the  Middle  East  region  (MENA) and  25%  in  Sub-Saharan  Africa (2) .  In  addition  to  coverage,  the population  excluded  from  digitization  for  reasons  of  purchasing power, technological skills or personal situation, particularly in terms of education or training, is estimated at an average of 24% in Europe, and 47% and 49% respectively in MENA and Sub-Saharan Africa. The  rapid  dematerialization  of  essential  services  in  everyday  life (employment, education, access to culture, access to social rights, etc.) creates a risk of social exclusion for populations who do not have access to online services or are not familiar with these tools.\n\nThe digital equality action program, included in Engage 2025, covers several areas, as described below:\n\n- -provide  access  to  as  many  people  as  possible:  extend  the coverage of fixed and mobile networks by investing actively in their development;\n- -propose inclusive offers, with a social offer per country in Europe by 2025;\n- -sell affordable smartphones, by offering multimedia devices at accessible prices in each country, such as the Sanza in Africa and the Middle East, or refurbished mobile phones in Europe;\n- -roll  out  support  programs  for  digital  uses,  with  one  Orange Digital Center per country and one per region in France, one Foundation per country and digital workshops in each European country by 2025.\n\n## 4.3.2.1 Providing access to as many people as possible\n\nTo bring the benefits of the digital world to all areas, and improve speeds for everyone, Orange is undertaking an ambitious action plan, based chiefly on:\n\n- -developing access infrastructures to extend fixed and mobile network coverage and to roll out new technologies (fiber, 4G, 5G);\n- -expanding  the  network  of  submarine  broadband  fiber  optic cables  as  well  as  IP  and  IPX  points  of  presence  to  improve Internet connectivity for Africa, the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent.\n\nFor more details, see Sections 1.5.1 Orange's networks and 1.2.2 The Orange group strategy - Faster digital development for regional communities.\n\n## 4.3.2.2 Offering accessible services and supporting appropriate use\n\nDriven  by  its  Engage  2025  strategic  plan,  Orange  has  launched an action program for digital equality, aiming firstly to remove the purchasing power barrier through the use of 'accessible offers' (for example, social offers such as the coup de pouce in France, Tarifa Social in Spain, and affordable smartphones), and secondly to offer free training sessions for everyone, in its stores, other locations and online, providing user support and skills for everyday use of digital services.\n\n## Offering accessible services\n\nAs  part  of  its  Engage  2025  strategic  plan,  Orange  made  the commitment to launch a social offer in the European countries where it operates, such as its Coup de Pouce Livebox offer in France. This offer, designed for low-income households who do not have home Internet access, includes (1) attractively-priced Internet-TV-Telephone access via ADSL or Fiber, (2) a refurbished laptop with a suite of office tools, and (3) free digital support available in certain Orange s t o r e s .

In Spain, the tarifa social offer, launched in fall 2020, includes a fiber access, a fixed line and a mobile line at a reduced price; it is reserved for households on minimum incomes. The education pass, available in some countries in the MEA region, provides access to online educational content at a price negotiated within the sponsored data mobile contract. This pass is available in Burkina Faso, Senegal, Mali, Guinea and the DRC. Many customers were able to benefit from the free provision of\n\n- 4\n\n4",

In Europe, Orange is supplementing its catalog with  a  proposal  for  refurbished  handsets,  which  provide  highperformance equipment at a discount compared to new equipment (see Section 4.4.1.1. Waste prevention and management - Giving a second life to equipment). In the MEA zone, the range of Sanza devices offered in thirteen countries in Africa and the Middle East (1) provides access to advanced features for a price starting at around 20 US dollars.\n\nOther areas also present opportunities for Orange to develop its business model: to counter digital exclusion related to disability or age, Orange has been delivering a 'designed for everyone' strategy f o r  s o m e  y e a r s  n o w.  I t s  o b j e c t i v e  i s  t o  a d a p t  p r o d u c t s  a n d  s e r v i c e s  f o r the needs of these people, and design specific products that combine innovation, simplicity and ergonomics, either directly or in partnership with start-ups in an Open Innovation approach. Orange has thus developed a range of offers and products that specifically meet the needs of disabled and elderly people, such as the Viktor cushion, a connected object designed to maintain intergenerational ties, Silver com, a service offering third-party professionals the opportunity to monitor the well-being and isolation of vulnerable people through analysis of their telephone habits across all their Orange lines, or Confort +, a free, downloadable web solution that aims to make the Internet accessible to everyone through personalization of the screen display.\n\n## Supporting appropriate use\n\nImplementing Orange's policy on the safe and responsible use of digital  technology involves several measures, which continued in 2020:\n\nfor the general public in France, digital workshops in small groups allow  participants  (seniors,  parents  and  children)  to  be  given  an hour's free support on various themes. In 2020, lockdown was an opportunity to test digital workshops online: organized from April to mid-July, they supported more than 1,000 customers. Three themes have been added to the catalog (Keeping in touch with loved ones with  the  WhatsApp  application,  protection  of  personal  data,  and i ntr o d u c t i o n  t o  O r a n g e  T V,  t h e  l a t t e r  t h e m e  b e i n g  i n t e n d e d  f o r  O r a n g e TV customers). From November 2020, in accordance with barrier gestures, the digital workshops were gradually re-launched online and face-to-face in around ten stores and third-party locations, in partnership  with  the  communities  of  municipalities.  Three  topics are presented face-to-face (Using your smartphone, Personal data protection, Exploring social networks). In addition, a pilot operation was carried out through five radio broadcasts, which gave listeners assistance  in  their  digital  use  directly  on  the  radio  and  live  on Facebook.\n\nIn total, by the end of 2020, around 5,000 customers had received support.\n\n## 4.3.2.3 Offer inclusive services that complement connectivity\n\nAs part of its overall development approach, Orange offers services to cover the basic needs of populations, based on its connectivity offer. Orange has identified several areas in which it is taking action: financial services, access to energy, health, and in the Africa-Middle East region: agriculture (mAgri, a range of decision-support services for the agricultural world and enabling virtual marketplaces to be set up), education and e-education.\n\n## Access to online financial services\n\nOrange Money was launched in 2008 (first launch in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire), to of f e r  a  p e r s o n - t o - p e r s o n  m o n e y  t r a n s f e r  s e r v i c e  a n d  f a c i l i t a t e  a c c e s s to  the  recharging  of  prepaid  communication  credits.  It  now  aids economic development in the countries where Orange operates, by enabling people without bank accounts to access financial services.\n\nOrange  Money  makes  it  possible  to  make  cash  deposits  and withdrawals,  money  transfers,  bill  payments,  etc.  Orange  Money is now considered an essential activity for Orange, with 49 million customers (including 21.9 million active customers) spread across sixteen countries at the end of 2020 within the scope of the Group's consolidated companies (see Section 3.1.3.3.1 Revenue - Africa & Middle East).\n\nFollowing Orange C\u00f4te d'Ivoire in 2018, Orange Guinea and Orange DRC obtained 'GSMA Mobile Money Certification' in 2019. A global initiative  that  provides  greater  security,  transparency  and  more secure and reliable mobile financial services to millions of mobile money users worldwide.\n\nInternational money transfers from mobile to mobile have seen an extension of the offer, with the opening of two new corridors between France on the one hand and Burkina Faso and Morocco on the other, adding to the service already offered from France to Senegal, Mali, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Madagascar and Guinea.\n\nFollowing a banking license from the Central Bank of West African States in 2019, Orange launched Orange Bank Africa in July 2020 in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire in order to expand its credit and savings offerings and thus promote access to financial services in a context where less than 20% of people in the UMOA zone hold bank accounts. Orange Bank Africa had 350,000 customers at the end of 2020.\n\n## Access to electricity\n\nAccess to electricity is a major issue for the African continent, where Orange  can  play  a  leading  role  by  capitalizing  on  its  brand,  its commercial presence and its technical assets. While ensuring the continuity of its own services, Orange is committed, in this domain with high operational stakes, to a diversification approach in this field, which strengthens the Group's positive, participatory presence in the MEA region and elsewhere.\n\nOrange is developing two distinct offers, for B2C customers and for electricity transmission and transport network operators:\n\n- -individual  electricity  generation  solutions  in  rural  and  remote areas that do not have access to the national grid, in the form of individual solar kits; at the end of 2020, this offer had been rolled out in nine countries (Burkina Faso, Cameroon, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Guinea, Madagascar, Mali, Senegal, Sierra Leone and the DRC); the objective is to provide access to solar energy in rural areas or towns where the quality of service of electricity providers is nil or inadequate. The service consists of allowing the regular use of a kit comprising a solar panel, a central unit containing a battery and a SIM card, lamps with LED bulbs, a multi-socket charging cable, a radio, a portable flashlight, and as an option, a television set or a fan. Customers become owners after a defined period. The kits are produced with partners selected by Orange for their quality and ability to offer integrated solutions and to meet large-scale demand. Payment via Orange Money means the service can be granted or re-established automatically and remotely for the required period of time. At the end of 2020, around 70,000 households were benefiting from this offer. In 2020, Orange also developed the OSE digital platform, to safely connect and manage these solar kits placed in homes;",

For electricity operators, it is now possible to carry out readings remotely, quickly and without loss of data, as well as to implement advanced customer management mechanisms such as avoiding load shedding in entire areas and limiting power to each household instead.\n\n## Access to healthcare\n\nIn 2020, Orange Business Services reorganized its health entities Enovacom  (leader  in  interoperability  in  France)  and  Orange Healthcare, to create a single division and comprehensively meet the needs of players in this sector as it undergoes digital transformation in France and internationally. The new structure's dedicated e-health software  and  service  offerings  address  four  major  challenges: protection of health data, exchanges and sharing between players in the healthcare ecosystem, the digitization of the patient pathway, and the use of health data.\n\nOrange  aims  to  accelerate  the  development  of  new  healthcare s o l u t i o n s  b a s e d  o n  t h e  m a s s i v e  u s e  o f  d a t a .  I t  i s  w i t h i n  t h i s  f r a m e w o r k that  the  project  was  launched  to  create  a  joint  venture  between Sanofi, Capgemini, Generali and Orange to develop e-health.\n\nIn  close  proximity  with  populations,  and  to  facilitate  access  to healthcare in areas with the weakest healthcare structures, Orange's service offering is based on partnerships with national healthcare organizations. It includes:\n\n- -information services via mobile phone, or hotline to answer health questions  (sexuality/birth  control,  AIDS,  STDs,  malaria,  etc.), vaccination  schedule  reminders  (service  via  USSD  launched as part of the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) on the recommendation of the WHO), family planning service via SMS and USSD;\n- -remote advice and monitoring services (by SMS/USSD and/or voice messages): M-vaccine and e-Vaccination in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, vaccination schedule reminders in Mali, Senvitale in Senegal, Gifted  Mom for maternal and infant health in Cameroon and CAR, Cycle M for family planning in the DRC;\n- -insurance and savings services: Sini Tonon in Mali, Indemnit\u00e9s hospitali\u00e8res (Hospital allowances) in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Activa Makala and AssurTous in Cameroon;\n- -geolocation and connection services (doctors, hospitals, on-call pharmacies,  appointment  scheduling,  etc.):  Gifted  Mom  in Cameroon and CAR, Health First in Cameroon, geolocation of on-call pharmacies in Mali.\n\nIn order to develop innovative e-health solutions, by improving access and quality of care through digital platforms that will in particular strengthen  links  between  healthcare  professionals  and  patients, in October 2019 Orange signed a partnership agreement with the Global Fund for the implementation of a digital plat for m for he a l th c a re professionals in Morocco, in collaboration with the Ministry of Health. Its aim is to facilitate monitoring of patients as part of the HIV and tuberculosis care pathways. This was extended in 2020 to other African countries including C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, the DRC and Burkina Faso.\n\n## 4.3.3 Orange's commitment to corporate inclusion\n\n## 4.3.3.1 Promoting diversity and inclusion\n\nOrange is convinced of the benefits of diversity and inclusion for its financial and social performance. The Group's Diversity and Inclusion policy seeks to welcome and develop all talents, and encourages the social commitment of its employees. It is based on the ambition to make the Company an ever more inclusive place that gives everyone the  opportunity  to  thrive  and  contribute  to  creating  value  for  the community. In addition to the fight against discrimination, it is based on three priorities: professional gender equality, equal opportunities and digital equality.\n\n## Diversity and inclusion assessment\n\nThe  Group  is  committed  to  the  evaluation  of  its  diversity  and professional equality policy and actions via the GEEIS and GEEIS Diversity  certification  (Gender  Equality  &  Diversity  European  and International  Standard),  obtained  in  twenty  entities  and  eighteen countries since 2011, following audits conducted every two years by an i n d e p e n d e n t  e x t e r n a l  b o d y.  I n  2 0 2 0 ,  c e r t i fi c a t i o n  w a s  c o n fi r m e d  i n s e v e n  e n t i t i e s  a n d  s i x  c o u n t r i e s :  E g y p t ,  S p a i n ,  I n d i a ,  J o r d a n ,  M a u r i t i u s and Russia, and obtained for the first time in Morocco. Orange is one of five international companies nominated for the GEEIS-SDG Trophy in 2019, which for the first time positioned gender equality as a driver for the achievement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nThe  December  2020  Diversity  Leaders  in  Europe  2021  ranking (Statista/Financial Times) placed Orange in sixty-second place out of 850 inclusive companies and in second place in the telecom sector.\n\nAt  the  same  time,  the  Group  participates  in  the  assessment  of discrimination and the measurement of inclusion through tools and barometers developed by its partners such as AFMD (Association Fran\u00e7aise des Managers de la Diversit\u00e9). In 2020, an Orange Diversit y footprint for France was established by Mixity on five dimensions of\n\ndiversity:  disability,  gender,  multi-cultural,  multi-generational  and LGBT.\n\nI n  F r a n c e ,  e q u a l i t y  i n  O r a n g e 's  r e c r u i t m e n t  p r o c e s s e s  i s  v e r i fi e d  e v e r y three years by an external body. In 2019, a review of the candidate pre-selection process concluded that there was no bias. From 2022, the review will be extended to all stages of recruitment.\n\nTo  promote  its  actions  and  contribute  to  progress  initiatives,  the Group is an active member in the work of international organizations such as the ERT (European Round Table of Industrialists), the ILO (International Labor Organization) and the GSMA.\n\n## Communication and awareness-raising\n\nOrange communicates with its employees to increase awareness of diversity and inclusion through the Diversity communities of the company's social network, events or the Group's communication campaigns,  for  example  during  the  International  Days  (women's rights, rights of people with disabilities, the fight against homophobia, etc.).\n\nThe Group also raises employee awareness of inclusive management and well-being at work through training content and, in particular, in 2020 developed an 'Experiencing diversity together' module, which will be rolled out in early 2021 in the various entities and countries where the Group operates. Since 2018, employees have learned about gender equality via an online training program that delivers a 'professional equality visa,' which has been followed by more than 13,000 employees in France. Building on its success, this training will be extended internationally in 2021, with a new version specifically designed in English and French.\n\nIn  France, the HR teams in charge of recruitment and managers are regularly trained on the impact of stereotypes and bias in decision-making, particularly during the recruitment process.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 4\n\n4",

O n  J u l y  17,  2 0 19 ,  t h e  G r o u p  i n t r o d u c e d a worldwide agreement with UNI global union on gender equality in  the  workplace,  combating  discrimination  and  violence,  and the work-life balance. This agreement is based on a participatory approach  by  all  stakeholders  and  structured  social  dialogue.  In twenty subsidiaries and entities around the world, local diversity/ professional equality committees, bringing together company and employee  representatives,  were  created  and  dedicated  liaison officers were appointed. The agreement is monitored jointly by the Group and UNI global union; it gave rise to two meetings in July and November 2020.\n\nIn France, Orange continued to implement the fifth agreement on gender equality and work-life balance, signed in January 2018 by Orange SA and all trade unions for a period of three years. Pending a new agreement, it has been extended until December 31, 2021.\n\nThe  professional  equality  policy  is  managed  by  the  Strategic Professional  Equality  Committee,  the  Group's  governance  body, which met three times in 2020. It is roll e d o u t i n t h e G r o u p i n  fi v e  a r e a s:\n\n- -gender balance in all of the Group's occupations, in particular in technical fields:\n\nthis  focus  is  reflected  notably  in  the  recruitment  and  training  of women undergoing  professional  reconversion  and  by  upstream awareness-raising  initiatives  for  young  girls.  Orange  has  been  a member of the Femmes@numerique Foundation since 2018, and a signatory of the Manifesto for the reconversion of women for digital professions since 2019. In France, through the Women's Technician Classes program, Orange trained nearly 550 female jobseekers in technical  professions  between  2012  and  2020,  of  whom  nearly three-quarters  were  hired  on  permanent  contracts.  In  addition, the  Group  has  set  itself  the  target  of  recruiting  30%  women  for the  integrated  classes  run  by  its  new  Apprentice  Training  Center (CFA).  Support  for  female  entrepreneurs  continued  in  2020:  the Women Start and #Femmes Entrepreneuses programs, successfully launched in 2018, were renewed. In addition, as part of the Orange Social Entrepreneur Awards in Africa and the Middle East (POESAM),\n\na new award was created for women. At the same time, initiatives in the area of education saw continued efforts in 2020 to overturn the educational stereotyping of girls and to awaken their interest in scientific and technical studies, with Shadowing days and a Girls'day in several countries, the Capital Filles p ro g r a m i n Fr a n c e a n d R o m a n i a and the Elles Bougent initiative in France.\n\n- -equal access by women to positions of responsibility:\n\nThe Group has set a target of 35% women in management bodies by  2025,  in  line  with  the  percentage  of  women  in  its  workforce. This  objective  is  integrated  into  the  talent  management  policy. The  Group's  Executive  Committee  comprises  28.5%  women since September 2020. The proportion of women in management networks, which include more than 1,300 executives and leaders, has risen steadily over the past eight years, from 23.6% in 2012 to 31.1% in 2019 and stabilized at this level in 2020. In the top 10% of positions with the highest responsibility, women represented 31.5% of executives at the end of 2020. Career development or mentoring programs  (including  by  the  Group's  Executive  Management)  are offered  to  high-potential  female  employees  in  several  countries; Orange also promotes internal networks that act in favor of gender equality and have more than 6,500 members worldwide. As part of the awards for the proportion of women in governing bodies of SBF 120 companies, Orange was ranked in ninth place in 2020.\n\n- -gender equality on pay:\n\nas part of the global agreement on gender equality in the workplace, t h e  G r o u p  h a s  s e t  i t s e l f  a  t a r g e t  o f  g e n d e r  e q u a l i t y  o n  p a y  i n  c o m p a r a b l e situations by 2025. The pay gap analysis methodology, common to all countries and used by the Group since 2018, is now used in all subsidiaries with more than 400 employees to measure pay gaps in a consistent manner. The analysis leads to action plans, adapted to the context of each country, in order to reduce the gaps identified.\n\nIn France, the maintenance of specific budgets in the annual salary rise exercises makes it possible to continue to reduce the pay gap between women and men, which, in comparable situations, is less than 1%. In accordance with the French law of September 5, 2018, which  stipulates  the  obligation  for  companies  to  publish  annual indicators relating to the pay gap between women and men and the actions undertaken to eliminate such gaps, the Economic and Social Unit obtained an overall score of 99 out of 100 points in 2020 (up five points compared to last year) for the indicators measured in 2019.\n\n- -work-life balance:\n\ni n t h e  g l o b a l  a g r e e m e n t  o n  g e n d e r  e q u a l i t y  i n  t h e  w o r k p l a c e  o f  J u l y  17, 2019,  Orange  undertook  to  facilitate  the  reconciliation  between professional and personal or family life, in particular by promoting teleworking and flexible working hours, the right to disconnect and a  number  of  support  measures  for  employees  who  are  parents or  caregivers. In 2020, the health crisis linked to the coronavirus pandemic accelerated the rollout of teleworking in all countries where the Group operates and particularly in countries in Africa and the Middle East, where this practice was less widespread.\n\n- -the fight against violence:\n\nas part of the global agreement of July 17, 2019, Orange reaffirmed its commitment to the prevention, detection, reporting and handling of all situations of sexism, harassment and violence. This commitment also  concerns  violence  within  couples,  for  which  Orange  offers employees who are victims, both women and men, and who so request, appropriate support measures according to the situation. In November 2020, as part of the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, Orange marked its support for this cause for the first time.",

        "page_content": "## 4.3.3.3 Orange for equal opportunities in the company\n\nOrange's equal opportunities policy is based on five areas.\n\n## Disability: employment and integration of people with disabilities\n\nThe French law of September 5, 2018 on the freedom to choose a professional future has changed the method of calculating the employment rate, with:\n\n- -the elimination on January 1, 2020 of the indirect employment rate achieved with purchases from the sheltered employment sector (STPA purchases), which is no longer taken into account in the employment rate but is deducted from the financial contribution in the event that the rate is lower than 6% and for each employee lacking in this shortfall. This explains the absence of integration rate data in 2020, and the addition of an employment rate line;\n- -the increase related to disabled employees aged 50 and over, which counts for 1.5.\n\n| Disabled employees -                                                        | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Orange SA                                                                   |        |        |        |\n| Number of disabled  employees  (1)                                          | 4,757  | 5,250  | 5,432  |\n| Amount invoiced by the  sheltered employment  sector (in millions of euros) | 19.1   | 20.1   | 19.6   |\n| Integration rate  (2)                                                       | -      | 7%     | 7.1%   |\n| Employment rate                                                             | 6.7%   | -      | -      |\n\n- (1) Disabled  employees  declared  in  the  French  mandatory  declaration  for  disabled employees (DOETH).\n- (2) Integration rate and Employment rate are calculated according to DOETH methods.\n\nFor Orange SA, the employment rate of disabled workers in 2020 was 6.69%, exceeding the legal requirement. In 2020, the amount of purchases by Orange from the sheltered and adapted work sector (STPA) declined (-5% vs. 2019), in a break from the steady rise of the last five years, due to the health context and the fall in services related to in-person events (leaflet printing, catering, etc.).\n\nOrange has reaffirmed its commitment to the inclusion of people with disabilities, which must remain a priority during and after the pandemic, through the joint statement by the members of the GBDN (Global Business and Disability Network) on November 30, 2020.\n\nLastly,  the  Group  adopted  the  new  GSMA  principles  set  out  on December 3, 2020 to make digital technology a lever for the inclusion of people with disabilities. Digital accessibility is recognized as a key priority  in  various  global  commitments,  including  the  Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), the Sustainable Development  Goals  (SDGs)  and  the  United  Nations  Disability Inclusion Strategy, which aim to ensure that no one is left behind in an increasingly digital world.\n\n## The origins\n\nIn 2020, as part of the partnership with the Club 21 e Si\u00e8cle, Orange's senior executives took part in the Barometer survey conducted with McKinsey. It aims to measure socio-cultural diversity in management bodies.  To  support  the  approach  and  examine  more  closely  the subject of representations of diversity within the company and better understand  the  expectations  of  internal  and  external  audiences, a  stakeholder  consultation  project  has  been  initiated  and  will  be conducted throughout 2021.\n\n## Integration of young people\n\nOrange has renewed its intergenerational agreement signed for the period 2019-2021: it covers the Group's companies in France and takes into account three major areas: the long-term integration of young people into employment, the employment of seniors, and the transmission of knowledge and skills.\n\nThe  Group  supports  associations  working  to  promote  equal opportunities:  Article  1,  \u00c9nergie  Jeunes,  Nos  Quartiers  ont  des Talents, Proxit\u00e9 and Capital Filles in France and Romania. In line with its commitment to 'France, a chance,' Orange benefits from the #UnJeuneUneSolution label, a label from the French Ministry of Labor to promote all its actions in favor of youth employment.\n\n## Identity\n\nTo promote the inclusion of LGBT+ people in the workplace, the Group is a member of the French association 'L'Autre Cercle' and participates in its activities, as well as the T\u00eatu Connect club.\n\nThe  Group  supports  the  internal  Mobilisnoo network of LGBT+ employees and friends and facilitates information for employees, in particular thanks to the LGBT+ Guide 'Sexual orientation and gender identity: understanding and acting at Orange in France,' updated in 2020 and circulated in France on the occasion of the International Day Against Homophobia.\n\n## Personal opinions\n\nIn France, a training course for managers and HR aims to facilitate the  understanding  of  the  expression  of  religious  convictions  in companies. Over the past three years, 355 people have been trained. The Group regularly participates in peer-to-peer discussions with the Club Entreprises et Religions.\n\n## 4.3.3.4 Digital  equality\n\nSee Section 4.3.4.1.2 Inclusive artificial intelligence.\n\nIn  France,  in  November  2020  Orange  launched  an  e-learning program, the 'Accessibility Visa,' to raise employee awareness of digital accessibility.\n\n## 4.3.3.5 Orange promotes employee commitment\n\nOrange facilitates the commitment of its employees to inclusion by making it possible for everyone to give their time, volunteer, or be involved in skills-based sponsorship.\n\nEach year, Orange SA runs a voluntary program 'for the integration of young people' among its employees in France. In 2020, 481 Orange volunteers supported 18,105 young people from the five associations supported by the Group.\n\nOrange is defining volunteering programs in all countries, which will be launched in 2021. These are based on:\n\n- -the  existing  skills  sponsorship  program,  open  to  employees starting the part-time work scheme at the end of their career (see Section 4.2.3 Work organization - Working hours organization); t h i s  p r o g r a m  i s  e x t e n d e d  t o  a l l  e m p l o y e e s  i n  t r a n s i t i o n  o r  b e t w e e n two positions for one-off assignments during their professional career, to help young people and people in training, in particular; it  reinforces the solidarity initiatives carried out in the Orange Foundations;\n- -the employee volunteering program previously applied, mainly to reinforce in-store staff teams during busy periods, and which extends  to  training  in  the  digital  workshops  and  the  Orange Digital Centers, in addition to the work of partner associations. In France in 2020, nearly 1,000 employee volunteers took part in running Orange workshops;\n- -openness to local volunteering by teams of employees, in the form of volunteering during solidarity events.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 4\n\n4",

It is aimed at Orange employees, in particular marketers and communicators, as well as users in order to enable them to adopt the proper reflexes described in the Group's policy (Section 2.2.4.3.1 Policy on excessive and inappropriate uses).\n\nOrange is gradually putting indicators in place to monitor the proper implementation of its policy. Data presented below detail the reporting scope for each year and not the application scope for the policy.\n\n## 4.3.4.1 Orange promotes responsible use\n\n## 4.3.4.1.1 Meaningful  marketing\n\nOrange has implemented a responsible marketing policy and offers support for best practices.\n\nInternally, the Marketing and Communication Departments are given guidelines that are enriched through forums, webinars, discussions and co-construction workshops on responsibility issues such as 'transparency' or 'supporting appropriate use.' In 2020, forty-six sessions  brought  together  a  total  of  722  participants  on  fifteen different themes. Since its creation in 2017, around 150 sessions have been held, bringing together nearly 2,200 participants.\n\nExternally, this policy has been followed by the Orange brand since 2019. Examples include the marketing campaign in all the countries where the Group operates, on the theme of 'we all have great powers, we all have great responsibilities,' calling on its customers to use digital  devices appropriately, in particular in terms of road safety, screen time and parents' vigilance on the use of digital devices by their children.\n\n## 4.3.4.1.2 Inclusive artificial intelligence\n\nTo  reflect  its  commitment  to  digital  equality,  with  the  Arborus Endowment Fund, Orange launched the International Charter for Inclusive Artificial Intelligence on April 21, 2020. This charter aims to create a framework of trust in the way AI systems are designed, developed and used. Based on seven commitments, it is a reference document  for  companies  implementing  AI.  It  aims  to  promote diversity by ensuring that the entire data value chain is responsible and that discriminatory biases are identified and controlled. Since its launch, this charter has been signed by around fifty organizations and companies, including Orange. In December 2020, the Group obtained  the  international  GEEIS  AI  label  for  inclusive  artificial intelligence, following an audit by an external certification body.\n\nIn  addition,  the  Group  is  a  partner  and  member  of  the  Strategic Committee of Objective IA, an e-learning program developed by Open Class  Room  with  the  Institut  Montaigne  and  the  Abenoa Foundation, which aims to train 1% of the French population in AI s u b j e c t s .

In 2021, it will be broadcast in French-speaking countries and available in an English version.\n\nOrange is gradually putting indicators in place to monitor the proper implementation of its policy. Data presented below detail the reporting scope for each year and not the application scope for the policy.\n\n## 4.3.4.2 Appropriate use of services\n\nTo answer questions about the consequences of the accelerated development of use of digital services, especially with young people and their use at a very early age, Orange has put in place tools, limited access offers, workshops and online training, sometimes in partnerships, to help parents and educators control children's use:\n\n- -Poland, Spain, Slovakia and France propose mobile offers with limited  access  to  certain  mobile  applications  so  that  parents can manage their children's use. Orange in Poland offers 'safe starter for your kid,' a low-cost offer including parental controls and  unlimited  calls  with  a  parent,  even  if  the  plan  limit  has been exceeded. Parental controls are integrated directly into the network, with no app to download or set up. Orange in Spain offers 'Kids Ready,' a subscription with unlimited calls between family members and the child, even if the plan limit has been exceeded. Parental controls can be set up in MyOrange, as well as a geolocation service for the child. Orange in Slovakia offers 'Prima  Kids,'  including  unlimited  calls  between  both  parents and the child, even if the plan limit has been exceeded. Parental controls are included for two months and then offered as an option. Orange France offers its customers parental controls on mobiles, PCs and TV and is continuing its partnership with the digital coach Xooloo for more comprehensive family protection; in  accordance  with  the  CNC T\u00e9l\u00e9com et Jeunesse opinion, Orange France systematically provides information and offers free  protection  tools  for  minors  (parental  controls,  option  to block multimedia purchases and SMS+) and dual information by SMS when subscribing to a mobile line for a minor. To do this,  Orange  has  invested  more  than  2.5  million  euros  in  the training of 10,000 in-store salespeople and the development of its information system;\n- -the  countries  have  also  set  up  information,  workshops  and training  systems  (mainly  virtual  in  2020),  supported  by  the Group's advertising campaign launched at the end of 2019 on screen time, and widely distributed in developing countries in 2020. In Spain, the Por Un uso Love de la technologia programs offer information and webinars for parents on topics such as 'how to become the best influencers of your children,' 'how to manage access to pornographic content with your children' or 'how technology affects your children's brains' and online training on security and data privacy on the Internet and social networks. In Belgium, a blog provides parents with information on children's screen time and cyberbullying. In Poland, several supports,  including  the  'Together  On-line  website'  platform, provide advice on safe and reasonable use of the Internet in order to prepare children for new uses, by making their phones safe and protecting them from online dangers (Internet abuse, access to  inappropriate  content,  online  hate  or  harassment). Orange Poland was tasked, in partnership with the Ministry of Education, with a 'MegaMission' project in primary schools, to  facilitate  the  distribution  of  messages  on  responsible  use of  the  Internet  (30,000  pupils  and  1,100  schools  in  2020).  In Slovakia, the Detinanete site deals with responsible digital uses for  children,  parents  and  teachers  (including  workshops  in schools with experts). An 'eSchools for the Future' program also supports digital skills and the responsible use of online media;",

In  2020,  the  Group  continued  to  improve  the  part of the radio waves section dedicated to 5G. Actions to raise public awareness  of  issues  relating  to  radio  waves  are  implemented  in each  country  in  accordance  with  their  culture  and  governance: dialogue committees organized by health and regulatory authorities, relations with local authorities, public information meetings in certain countries, etc.\n\nOrange  has  worked  with  professional  federations  (GSMA,  FFT, etc.) of which it is a member, at national and international levels, to  publish  official  information  and  learning  tools  for  the  general public  on  the  deployment  of  networks  and  mobile  phone  uses. For  example,  Orange  Poland,  in  collaboration  with  other  mobile telephone  operators  within  the  Association  of  Polish  Operators (PIIT), has undertaken extensive information and education projects related to the theme of the impact of electromagnetic fields and the role of modern telecommunication technologies in people's lives. This operator association has also published widely in the field of combatting network infrastructure attacks.\n\nOrange  is  actively  involved  in  scientific  research  through  the Fondation-Mines Telecom, a sponsor of the C2M (characterization,\n\nmodeling and management) chair on exposure to electromagnetic waves, together with the ANFr, the French Government Agency that manages the country's radio spectrum. Orange also works closely with global standard bodies such as the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC).\n\nOrange carries out standards assessment on new technologies in cooperation with the agencies concerned.\n\nOrange complies with the requirements of the authorities which, to improve public information and take account of developments in the ways of using and appearance of new devices that might expose consumers to radio waves, have extended the requirement to display the SAR (specific absorption rate) to all electrical radio equipment intended for use near the body, and no longer limited only to mobile phones. Orange has revised its process for approving the choice of radio equipment distributed by or bearing the Orange brand, in particular by strengthening its SAR requirements during production testing, and by conducting training and awareness-raising actions for marketing teams in France and abroad.\n\n| Specific absorption rate (SAR)  information                 | 2020   | 2019  (1)   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------|-------------|\n| % of countries in which mobile  phone SARs are displayed on |        |             |\n| the country's website                                       | 60%    | 60%         |\n\nHealth  recommendations  and  a  hands-free  kit  are  provided  to customers with all mobile handsets sold by Orange, across all activit y scopes.\n\nAntenna exposure limits are subject to international recommendations and national regulations. All antennas provided by Orange to its subsidiaries  meet  European  standards  and  the  company  carries out controls during installation using simulation tools. The Group regularly trains employees working near or at antennas on safety recommendations and how to use a dosimeter, in particular at the request of MEA countries. Security perimeters are assessed and defined around the antennas; their calculation is based on a tool made available to subsidiaries by the Group.\n\nThe time required to commission a site depends on the regulatory processes and the length of consultation required with stakeholders.\n\n| Time required to authorize the commissioning of a mobile  antenna   | 2020                                            | 2019  (1)                                        |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| Average time to deploy an antenna for a new site                    | 57% from 12 to 24months 43% from 6 to 12 months | 57% from 12 to 24 months 43% from 6 to 12 months |\n| Average deployment times for new technology for site redevelopment  | 28% from 6 to 12 months 72% from 3 to 6 months  | 28% from 6 to 12 months 72% from 3 to 6 months   |\n\nOf the seven subsidiaries that responded, 57% take between twelve and twenty-four months to develop a new site. These delays are mainly due to obstacles encountered during the deployment with town halls, landlords, local residents or other stakeholders. Similarly, 28% of responding countries take six to twelve months to deploy a new technology on an existing site. The objective is to shorten these deployment times as much as possible, while maintaining a period of consultation.\n\nOrange  has  introduced  the  risk  of  non-compliance  with  safety instructions by employees and subcontractors in its 2021 vigilance plan. The Group ensures that the technicians, employees of Orange, working on antennas in Europe are trained in safety instructions, including health aspects related to radio waves. These instructions are sent to subcontractors and repeated as part of the prevention plans during on-site operations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 4\n\n4",

and the entities of Orange Business Services operating in the country.\n- (2) Due to a lack of detailed data, in this table all Orange cables are listed under non-hazardous waste; however, some of the oldest cables contain hazardous substances, and therefore undergo special processing at the end of their life.\n\nOrange's waste prevention and management policy, both for itself and  its  customers,  is  based  on  extending  the  life  of  products and equipment, notably through their re-use and optimizing their end-of-life  treatment.  The  Group's  commitments  to  the  circular economy  in  the  Engage  2025  strategic  plan  are  presented  in Section 2.2.4.4.1 Orange's environmental commitment.\n\nIn 2020, 50,352 metric tons of internal waste were disposed of by the Group (+6.1% compared to 2019), this increase reflecting better traceability of waste outside France. In France, the volume of internal evacuated waste was down by 9.3%.\n\nThe  recovery  rate  of  internal  evacuated  waste  of  88.8%  marks a  significant  improvement  in  the  trend,  with  a  gain  of  4.3  points compared  to  2019.  97.8%  of  the  Group's  hazardous  waste  is recovered.\n\nThis  indicator  principally  concerns  waste  disposed  of  in  France (which  accounts  for  77.6%  of  Group  waste  disposed  of),  where\n\nthere are clear procedures for identifying and treating waste. This information is harder to obtain in other countries. In addition, only activities carried out directly by Orange are considered to generate internal waste.\n\nThe recovery rate in France improved once again, reaching 86.8% of internal evacuated waste in 2020 compared to 83.8% in 2019.\n\n## Optimizing the life cycle and end-of-life of equipment\n\nThe Group acts in several complementary ways:\n\n- -optimizing the management of waste and end-of-life equipment generated  internally,  by  implementing  processing  channels suited  to  each  category  of  waste  and  ensuring  that  they  are traceable;\n- -collecting  and  processing  used  electronic  equipment  from customers  through  approved  external  partners  or  collective channels (where they exist).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 4\n\n4",

The re-use might  be  due  to  a  change  in  technology  between  countries,  or technological redeployment between different geographical areas.\n\nA  new  impetus  was  given  to  this  approach  to  offer  end-to-end support open to the outside world for any transactions aiming at the recertification of equipment. The process involves four stages:\n\n- -planning  entity  requirements,  in  particular  by  integrating purchasing  opportunities  for  refurbished  equipment  and decommissioning plans;\n- -working with equipment suppliers to encourage recertification when choosing suppliers. Orange benefits from the levers of its partnerships with BuyIn (purchasing consortium with Deutsche Telekom  for  network  and  IS  equipment)  and  JAC  (Alliance between 15 operators initially built to pool supplier audits and whose functions have expanded to implementation of circular economy principles in the supply chain);\n- -providing support to keep the 'marketplace' active and optimize inventory management;\n- -developing recycling solutions for each subsidiary.\n\nWith  a  gradual  ramp-up  and  operational  implementation  since September 2020, more than 140,000 batches of equipment have been purchased or sold on this marketplace, generating more than 10 million euros in investment savings (CAPEX avoided or saved) for Orange.\n\nMetric tons of Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) collected from customers has significantly decreased at Group level, at 2,320 metric tons in 2020 (-38.1% on 2019). As with internal waste, this indicator mainly represents waste collected in France (France represents 85.7% of WEEE waste collected by the Group).\n\nThe  Group's  recovery  rate  of  80.0%  of  WEEE  waste  from  these customers in 2020 is down compared to the recovery rate of 82.2% in 2019.\n\n## Collection, recycling and refurbishing of mobile devices\n\nIn  2020,  the  collection  rate  for  mobile  phones  was  15.1%  in  the Group's  European  countries  (France,  Poland,  Spain,  Belgium, Slovakia, Romania), a decline of 1.2 points compared to 2019 largely due to the closure of stores - which are also collection points - during lockdown periods. These 1.2 million mobile phones collected in 2020 include  waste  collected  in  workshops  in  Africa  at  the  initiative  of Orange France. The collection rate of mobile phones in the Group's six  European  countries,  excluding  the  activity  of  these  African workshops, was 10.2% in 2020, compared to 11.7% in 2019. Since 2010, Orange has teamed up with Emma\u00fcs International and Ateliers du Bocage,  a  company  in  the  social  and  solidarity  employment sector, to open mobile waste collection workshops in Africa. In the absence of efficient local recycling structures, the collected waste is amassed and then sent to France for recycling in accordance with European environmental standards. These workshops have opened in five countries (Burkina Faso, Benin, Cameroon, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and Niger), have created 30 local jobs, and collect on average 12 metric tons of mobile phones waste annually, with more than 3.4 million mobiles collected.\n\nIn October, Orange launched its CR program, based on recycling, recovery  (financial  benefit  from  old  equipment  when  changing devices)  and  refurbishing  of  devices  (partnership  with  players  in the  sector  to  enrich  the  catalog  of  Orange  devices  with  a  range of  refurbished  devices)  in  France,  then  in  Europe.  This  program targets the entire eco-system, with collection being necessary to have devices to be refurbished, as refurbishing companies need a responsible specification to be able to grow.\n\nOrange has set up a program to buy back equipment in all countries where  5G  has  been  launched,  to  supplement  the  eco-citizen collection, which accounts for around 45% of the mobile phones collected.\n\nTo facilitate recycling, Orange also distributes the Fairphone mobile handset. The modular and repairable Fairphone 3 ex tends its average lifespan  by  two  years  compared  to  other  smartphones.  It  was designed using recycled materials, such as copper or plastic, and sourced from conflict-free areas; it has been distributed by Orange since its release in September 2019.\n\nOrange estimates that in 2020, 65% of the mobile phones it collects in France are refurbished and 35% are recycled.\n\n## Ecodesign, refurbishing of Liveboxes and set-up boxes\n\nAs  an  example,  Orange  has  applied  the  principle  of  the  circular economy by setting up a process for the ecodesign, collection and refurbishing of Liveboxes and set-up boxes, with the aim of reducing their  environmental  footprint,  reusing  the  resources  and  making significant savings.\n\nThe  refurbishing  requirement  is  included  from  the  design  stage and continued throughout the life  cycle  of  the  products.  Orange and  its  suppliers  joined  forces  to  eco-design  these  products  so that they can be disassembled and simply and easily repaired and given the necessary upgrades. In line with the initiatives undertaken with the Livebox 4 and the UHD TV set-up boxes, Orange worked with its ecosystem of partners to improve production and reduce the carbon footprint of the Livebox 5 launched in 2019. This has a  100% recycled plastic shell, is lighter and more compact, with fewer electronic components and a new design allowing passive ventilation, without a fan.\n\nA meticulously run and monitored collection scheme ensures that as many used products as possible are recovered, sorted, tested, rebooted and refurbished as new so that they can be reused several times in their life cycles.\n\nIn Europe, we are now seeing significant maturity in the approach of several countries including France, Spain, Poland and Belgium in terms of collection, sorting, testing, repairing and refurbishing of multimedia equipment (Liveboxes and Set-Top Boxes, in particular) l e a s e d  t o  o u r  c u s t o m e r s  t o  o f f e r  I n t e r n e t  a c c e s s  a n d  c o n t e n t  s e r v i c e s . The collection rate continues to improve and has now reached 92% in France compared to 90% in 2019. The refurbishing was entrusted to qualified subcontractors in Europe, overseen by the Supply Chain and Marketing teams in compliance with the principles of the circular economy, processing a total volume of more than 3.5 million units returned to the active portfolio in 2020, thus avoiding the purchase of new equipment as much as possible.\n\n## 4.4.1.2 Use of scarce and critical resources\n\nSince  2011,  Orange  has  applied  a  process  aimed  at  taking  into account issues associated with the scarce and critical resources used in the Group's products:\n\n- -a database, updated regularly and containing data sheets on each material, serves as the basis for carrying out risk analyses and seeking alternative resources. Discussions are held with suppliers to encourage them to limit the use of these resources and favor alternative and recycled resources;\n- -the Group has opened discussions with industrial operators in v a r i o u s  s e c t o r s  a n d  p u b l i c  a u t h o r i t i e s  t o  s u p p o r t  t h e  d e v e l o p m e n t of  efficient  channels  to  exploit  the  vast  reserves  of  scarce",

The study conducted in 2013, using the WBCSD (World Business Council for Sustainable Development) methodology, showed that the Group's impacts are generally low. The main impact is related to CO2 equivalent emissions, which are responsible for climate change, a major cause of loss of biodiversity.\n\nHowever, O r a n g e  c o n t i n u e s  t o  s u p p o r t  p r o g r a m s  t o  b e t t e r  u n d e r s t a n d the impacts of climate change on biodiversity:\n\n- -as part of a partnership with the CREA (Center for Research on Altitude Ecosystems), through which Orange provides the CREA with its antennas, installed in high mountain areas, and the sensors used to collect information on temperatures and levels of snow and ice, as well as the behavior of fauna and flora via photos and videos, on the Alpine Arc. Orange contributes to the processing and presentation of data to the scientific community and the general  public,  and  volunteer  employees  ensure  the maintenance  of  the  dedicated  equipment  and  participate  in observations of the fauna and flora of the Alps. This initiative received  an  award  from  the  United  Nations  during  COP23  CREA Mont-Blanc and Orange were the 2017 recipients of the Momentum for Change prize;\n- -in  another  area,  in  partnership  with  ARGO  (an  international consortium  launched  in  2000  by  the  Intergovernmental Oceanographic  Commission  of  UNESCO  and  the  World Meteorological Organization),  Orange Marine helped develop and maintain a global network of profiling floats, measuring the\n\ntemperature and salinity of the oceans in real time. The new buoys will soon incorporate biochemical data.\n\n## Soil use\n\nThe Group does not extend its control to the soil, except for the buildings in which it operates (offices and Data centers).\n\n## Taking into account nuisance specific to the activities of telecommunication operator\n\nRadio  mobile  relay  antennas  can  sometimes  be  considered  an eyesore. In some countries (France and Egypt, among others), the Group  has  undertaken  to  blend  a  number  of  antennae  into  the environment and landscape by adapting them to the local style and context (painting, incorporation in buildings, etc.).\n\nThe Group's activity does not generate noise pollution.\n\n## Paper consumption\n\nFor several years Orange has implemented programs to reduce its paper consumption or to use FSC-certified and/or recycled paper.\n\n## Water consumption\n\nThe main sources of water consumption in the Orange group are water  fountains,  toilet  facilities,  canteens  and  the  humidification systems of Data centers.\n\n## Releases into the air, soil and water\n\nThe  only  substances  released  into  the  environment,  with  the exception of CO2 emissions, are HCFCs used in cooling systems. Whenever possible, HCFCs are replaced with HFCs, and systems such as optimized ventilation and free cooling are put in place to reduce the use of air conditioners.\n\n## Food waste\n\nIn the context of the Group's activities, this issue relates to catering, which is mainly outsourced.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 4\n\n4",

The first benefits of the renewable electricity contract will be seen in 2021.\n\nIn Poland, the 4.7% reduction in CO2 equivalent emissions in 2020 compared to 2019 (i.e.  -19,873  metric  tons  of  CO2  equivalent)  is mainly due to the decrease in energy consumption (-5.4% between 2020 and 2019).\n\nFor all of their electricity consumption (Scope 2) in 2020, Orange Spain  and  Orange  Belgium  used  electricity  generated  from renewable sources through consumption contracts with a guarantee of origin (GO) certificate from suppliers; in addition, Orange produces electricity from renewable sources through its ESCO programs or its own equipment; taking into account the CO2 emission factors from t h e  e n e r g y  m i x  o f  t h e s e  c o u n t r i e s ,  t h i s  c o r r e s p o n d s  t o  16 9 , 0 0 0  m e t r i c tons of CO2 avoided in 2020, i.e. 13.3% of the Group's emissions (Scopes 1 and 2).\n\nFor  its  Scope  3,  Orange  publishes  information  each  year  on  the consumption based on the distances traveled  by  its  employees; Scope 3 was assessed as a whole in accordance with the rules of the GHG Protocol. Its assessment is inherently more imprecise than  that  of  Scopes  1  and  2.  In  2020,  the  Group's  total  Scope 3 emissions were estimated, for 2018, at approximately 7.2 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent. The Group's main Scope 3 items are the subcategories: purchases of goods and services (around 30% of Scope 3 emissions), fixed assets (around 45% of Scope 3 emissions) and use of products sold (around 15% of Scope 3 emissions).\n\nAs part of its Engage 2025 strategic plan, Orange has undertaken the following commitments:\n\n- -reduce its CO2 equivalent emissions by 30% by the end of the plan, compared to 2015; at the end of 2020, Orange had reduced its CO2 equivalent emissions by 12.3% compared to 2015.\n- -meet more than 50% of its electricity needs from renewable sources by the end of the plan. At the end of 2020 and taking into account both its own actions and the energy mix of the countries in which it operates, Orange meets 31% of its electricity needs from renewable sources.\n\n## 4.4.2.1 Network energy consumption\n\nA vast energy action plan, Green ITN 2020, launched in 2008 to reduce energy consumption related to the operation of networks and information systems is continuing in a second phase with the 'Green Program' focused on the commitments for 2025. It relies in particular on new levers, such as the use of artificial intelligence, advanced standby modes, and the ramp-up of active network sharing.\n\nThe energy consumption of the network and the information system represents 86.8% of the Group's total consumption and 84.5% of CO2 equivalent emissions (including network equipment in buildings). The action plans implemented have made it possible to limit the Group's energy consumption (Scopes 1 and 2) to +1.4% in 2020 compared to 2019, despite a particularly significant increase in traffic in 2020. The energy consumption of the network and the information system is linked more to its capacity than to the traffic actually transported.\n\nFor the two largest energy-consuming countries in the Group:\n\n- -the  change  in  energy  consumption  related  to  networks  and i nformation systems between 2020 and 2019 amounts to -2.5% for  France, due to the efficiency gains achieved, and despite the increase in the number of mobile sites with the coverage of dead zones, the continued rollout of 4G and the launch of 5G. From 2014 to 2018, the volume of data transported for mobile phones increased seven-fold, and the energy performance over the same period improved by 80% (i.e. quantity of electricity to transport 1 gigabyte);\n- -the change in energy consumption linked to networks and IT between 2020 and 2019 amounted to -2.5% for Poland.\n\nThanks to Green ITN program, between 2010 and 2019, at least 5  TWh  of  electricity  and  260  million  liters  of  fuel  oil  were  saved across the Group's network and IT scope. These savings prevented the release of at least 2.7 million metric tons of CO2 over this period.\n\nT h e s e  r e s u l t s  w e r e  m a d e  p o s s i b l e  b y  a  s e r i e s  o f  m e a s u r e s  i n t r o d u c e d , in  particular  the  increased cooperation with equipment suppliers with  a  view  to  developing  and  obtaining  highly  energy-efficient telecommunication equipment.\n\nThe Group is streamlining its Data centers, virtualizing servers and renewing the most energy-consuming equipment in order to benefit from new, less energy-consuming technologies. In France, following the example of the first eco-efficient data center commissioned in 2012, Orange has undertaken large-scale work to build two new Data centers, which will replace some ten sites across the country. At equivalent capacity, the eco-efficient data center consumes 30% less than the old ones. Thus, the PUE (power usage efficiency) of a newly-installed data center in France is less than 1.3. The average PUE of Data centers installed in France was 1.65 in 2020, compared to 1.68 in 2019 and 1.74 in 2018.\n\nIn  2020,  Orange  continued  its  efforts  to  significantly  reduce  the energy consumed by its cooling systems. To this end, effort has gone into liquid cooling systems, a technology which allows heat dissipated by telecom equipment and servers to be collected as close as possible to the components, without the liquid needing to be cooled beforehand using a cooling system, and allowing some of that energy to be reused for office heating.\n\nAt  Orange's  initiative,  a  European  standard  has  been  developed to  speed  up  the  development  of  this  technology.  In  addition, water-cooled  network  equipment  has  already  been  rolled  out  at equipment bay level with very promising results. This initiative will now be applied to servers.\n\nSince 2017, Orange France has been using a power supply solution based on a direct current architecture of 40 0VDC for new installations or upon site redevelopment; at the end of 2020, around thirty sites had been equipped with this solution.\n\nIn Africa and the Middle East, Orange is developing a series of action plans aimed at supplying energy from renewable sources. Thanks to an internal sourcing approach, at the end of 2020 Orange had equipped nearly 4,500 sites in the MEA region with photovoltaic solar panels (54% with solar as the only source of energy, 46% with hybrid solar solutions), i.e.:\n\n- -an annual saving of more than 53 million liters of fuel, or nearly 142,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent avoided;\n- -a renewable energy generation system in use at around 16% of the sites in the MEA region;\n- -annual generation from renewable sources of around 100GWh.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 4\n\n4",

The  aim  is  to  outsource investment, installation, modernization and operational management of  electricity  generating  infrastructures  with  a  view  to  optimizing electricity consumption, supply reliability, its environmental impact and energy costs. These projects were rolled out in eight countries in the MEA region: Democratic Republic of the Congo, Guinea Conakry, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Burkina Faso, Sierra Leone, Central African Republic, Liberia and Cameroon. This reduces fuel consumption by up to 80% (depending on the site). The implementation of this program should continue in other countries in the area. In 2020, Orange undertook to extend these solar fields to benefit neighboring populations;\n\nOrange is also rolling out solar farms: three solar farms have been set up in Jordan, with the aim of supplying around 70% of the energy needs of the subsidiary's sites connected to electricity operators ( i n c l u d i n g  r a d i o  s i t e s ,  o f fi c e  b u i l d i n g s  a n d  D a t a  c e n t e r s ) .  T h e  i n i t i a t i v e , which requires a regulation allowing remote own-consumption as well as distribution to all of our consumption points, is being studied for deployment in other countries in the area.\n\n## 4.4.2.2 Other energy consumption\n\n## Reducing emissions from buildings\n\nOf fi c e  b u i l d i n g s  a c c o u n t  f o r  8 . 9 %  o f  t h e  G r o u p 's  e n e r g y  c o n s u m p t i o n and 10.5% of CO2 emissions, down by 15.9% compared to 2019, notably due to site closures in the context of the health crisis.\n\nIn  France,  the  Energy  action  plan  covers  all  technical  areas  of buildings: heating, ventilation, air conditioning, lighting, etc. The use of meters to measure multi-fluid consumption continued, reaching 140 of the largest office and mixed sites. Audits and inspections of  service  providers  continued,  in  order  to  identify  opportunities to optimize the energy management of buildings. In 2020, Orange cemented its real estate energy and environmental policy with the renewal of its ISO 50001 certification and a newly operational HQE Global Management System. Orange was rewarded once again in 2020 by winning first place at the IFPEB's (French Institute for Building Efficiency) CUBE 2020 Contest.\n\nIn all European countries, tools for measuring the energy consumption of computer and office equipment have been set up so as to optimize energy consumption. Since optimization policies were established in 2015, several countries have reduced this equipment's energy use by 30%-50% due to better control of the equipment, in particular outside working hours.\n\n## Reducing transport emissions\n\nBusi n e s s  t r a v e l  a c c o u n t s  f o r  4 . 4 %  o f  t h e  G r o u p ' s  e n e r g y  c o n s u m p t i o n , down by 26.7% compared with 2019, and 5.0% of CO2 equivalent emissions. In addition to the reduction in travel, as a result of health measures  taken  by  the  authorities  around  the  world,  Orange  is continuing its action plans aimed at increasing the proportion of electrified vehicles in its fleet, limiting business travel and promoting collaborative and sustainable transport modes.\n\nThe  Group  has  a  large  fleet  of  company  vehicles  in  Africa  and especially in Europe, with France representing three-fourths of the Group's fleet.\n\nThe size of the fleet in France has been constantly decreasing by an average 3.5% per year since 2015, down to 16,800 vehicles at the end of 2020, with the aim of continuing this decrease by around a thousand vehicles by 2025. In France, Orange is now making the renewal of its fleet mandatory by eliminating Diesel technology, which emits fine particles (NOx), and boosting the use of electrified vehicles to control its CO2 emissions.\n\nAt the end of 2020, Orange was using more than 1,200 electrified vehicles. More than 850 charging points have been installed or are in\n\nthe process of being installed since the start of the fleet electrification program, and have been networked at nearly 200 Orange sites, now enabling supervision and monitoring of the terminals concerned. Each user of Orange's rechargeable electric vehicles has a web tool and a mobile app including a map of these charging stations and the ability to book them. Finally, these very vehicles are equipped with cards giving them access to a network of 15,000 public charging stations. The Group's aim is to be equipped with 7,000 electrified vehicles by 2025.\n\nLaunched in 2013 with around 100 vehicles, the car-sharing fleet had more than 3,750 dedicated vehicles at the end of 2020. Orange thus has the largest car-sharing fleet in France and Europe and wishes to continue optimizing this fleet with 6,000 shared vehicles by 2025.\n\nFur t h e r m o r e ,  s e v e r a l  G r o u p  e n t i t i e s  h a v e  i n t r o d u c e d  p l a n s  t o  l i m i t  t h e use of private cars (company travel plans, carpooling, car-sharing, road risk management and eco-driving training courses, etc.). For example, in France, Orange SA's car-pooling solution was offered to more than 18,000 employees and made it possible to car pool nearly 30,000 home/work trips in 2020, for an estimated total of 435,668 km and 27 metric tons of CO2 saved.\n\nEmployees,  moreover,  have  solutions  allowing  them  to  reduce business  travel  (video-conferencing  and  other  tools  for  remote collaborative work). Orange has around 270 video conference rooms in France and close to an additional 100 in the rest of the world.\n\n## 4.4.2.3 Alignment with TCFD recommendations\n\nIn the context of the committee monitoring the TCFD, Orange has prepared a cross-reference table  enabling  Orange's  response  to each of the TCFD recommendations to be identified. Orange will add to the table as it continues to align its operations with the TCFD's recommendations.\n\nFor  the  purposes  of  the  table,  Orange  defines  short-term  as  the completion of its current (2020) strategic plan, medium-term as its Engage 2025 strategic plan covering the 2020-2025 period, and long-term as 2050.\n\nThe  Group  has  already  achieved  a  significant  level  of  alignment with the nine recommendations identified by Orange. Furthermore, recommendation no. 5 was the subject of additional work in 2020:\n\n- -as  a  member  of  the  ITU,  Orange  has  made  a  significant contribution to the definition of sector trajectories for digital at the global level, respecting an average warming target limited to 1.5 \u00b0C in 2100 compared to pre-industrial levels. This work was carried out in cooperation with the GSMA, GeSI, the International Energy  Agency  and  SBTi.  The  associated  recommendation ITU-T L. 1470 is available (1) ; a specific guide for operators was published in the first half of 2020 jointly with SBTi (2).\n- -Orange also carried out a climate risk assessment project, which aims to determine the physical resilience of its businesses in relation to a warming scenario of more than 3 \u00b0C compared to the pre-industrial era (equivalent to IPCC scenario RCP4.5). This project, initially carried out on the scope of France, consisted of  reviewing  past  impacts  according  to  climatic  hazards  and network  components  (Data  centers,  access  nodes,  cables, poles, antennas, etc.). Climatic sensitivity thresholds were thus i dentifi e d,  f o c u s i n g  o n  t h e  m o s t  r i s k y  h a z a r d s  ( h e a t  w a v e s ,  s t r o n g winds, intense precipitation, lightning strikes, wild fires). These climate indicators were then projected according to two time horizons (2030 and 2050), based on data from M\u00e9t\u00e9o France. The project was subsequently extended to the other countries where the Group is present, with the same projection of climate indicators to 2030 and based on data from four climate models used in the IPCC's work (3).",

This is particularly the case for Orange France data.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4 -\n\n## 4.4.3 Business opportunities associated with reducing the environmental footprint\n\nOrange is developing innovative solutions for agriculture, cities and shared mobility that can satisfy the objective of implementing circular economy principles and optimizing energy consumption (see Sections 4.3.1 Orange's commitment to inclusion for society and 4.3.2.3 Offer inclusive services that complement connectivity). Orange Business Services offers its B2B and governmental customers remote work, video-conferencing and virtual IT infrastructure services that, under certain conditions, enable greenhouse gas emissions to be reduced (see Section 1.4.5 Enterprise).\n\n## Note on methodology - Environment\n\n## Reporting scope\n\nThe data shown cover the entire consolidated financial scope, unless otherwise mentioned.\n\n## Orange Business Services International\n\nThe international reporting by Orange Business Services was limited to eleven countries (ninety-five sites) in the sixty-seven countries (1) where  it  operates.  These  countries  represent  83%  of  the  OBS International workforce and 68% of the occupied floor space of its buildings (in square meters), namely, Australia, Brazil, Switzerland, Egypt,  Germany,  India,  Mauritius,  Russia,  Singapore,  the  United States and the United Kingdom.\n\nAs r e g a r d s  t h e  c o n s u m p t i o n  o f  e l e c t r i c a l  e n e r g y,  t h e  O B S  I n t e r n a t i o n a l reporting is based on 182 sites in forty (2) countries where OBS is located. These countries represent 88% of the occupied floor space of its buildings (in square meters) outside of France.\n\n## Elettra\n\nElettra, a subsidiary of the Orange group with a cable ship business, is excluded from the reporting scope to date.\n\n## Reporting methodology\n\nThe environmental repor ting of this se cti o n i s b a s e d o n a n o n -fi n a n c i a l information  system.  The  key  indicators  are  subject  to  quarterly reporting at country level and indicators of lesser materiality for the Group are reported on every six months or even annually.\n\nThe changes in methodology that had a Group-level effect greater than or equal to 5% of the indicator or a country-level effect greater than or equal to 20% of the indicator, and data updates following receipt of actual figures that had a significant effect on the Group are calculated on a comparable basis (pro forma). Adjusted data for the prior year in the report are indicated by an asterisk.\n\n## Characteristics of the indicators\n\n## Environmental Management System\n\nThe 'Group ISO 14001 certification rate' KPI is the ratio of electrical e n e r g y  c o n s u m e d  b y  a l l  a r e a s  o f  t h e  G r o u p  t h a t  a r e  I S O  14 0 0 1  c e r t i fi e d over the total electrical energy consumed by the Group.\n\nIt is calculated across the entities or divisions consolidated by the Group.\n\nAs  part  of  its  response  to  the  CDP,  Orange  assessed  the  order of  magnitude  of  the  potential  revenues  associated  with  these opportunities. These assessments are part of the Group's gradual alignment with the TCFD recommendations.\n\nOrange also offers and implements tools that significantly improve climate  change  monitoring  and  raise  public  awareness  (see Section 4.4.1.3 Other impacts on the environment).\n\n## Energy\n\nThe energy used by Data centers, buildings and stores is calculated using the online control tool that measures and controls in real time all of the buildings' systems, including IT, air conditioning, UPS, etc.\n\nThe energy consumption of the Orange France network is partly based on estimates; in particular, data relating to the fourth quarter are derived from the average of the first nine months of the year. Energy use by the Orange Spain network is extrapolated based on invoices supplied by the electricity supply companies. The electricity consumption of Poland is calculated using a statistical sampling of invoices received during the year.\n\nThe  'fuel  oil  consumption  (all  buildings  and  all  uses)'  indicator comprises consumption (excluding  vehicles)  of  domestic  fuel  oil, diesel and gasoline, as well as marine heavy fuel oil and diesel for Orange Marine's fleet.\n\nThe  energy  consumption  of  buildings  -  in  particular  stores  -  for which the Orange group is not directly invoiced, is not recorded. The consumption of energy from urban heating plants is not recognized due to the difficulty of estimating the associated CO2 emissions.\n\nWhen sharing  networks  with  a  third-party  operator  in  which  the technical environment is shared, only the electricity purchased by Orange for its own sites is recorded; this rule applies due to the fairly balanced nature of the division.\n\nPlease note: Orange Spain's electricity consumption declared until 2018  covers  an  estimate  of  the  electricity  consumed  by  Orange equipment located in third-party operator sites, as well as the entire electricity  consumption of the Orange Spain sites, although they host third-party equipment, thus suggesting an overestimation of the network's electricity consumption. From 2019, the above definition is applied. This new calculation method thus makes it possible to cover el e c t r i c i t y  c o s t s  u n d e r  t h e  s c o p e  c o v e r e d  b y  t h e  I S O  14 0 0 1  s t a n d a r d .\n\nThe Group's share of renewable energies takes into account the share of renewable energy in each country according to IEA data (International  Energy  Agency)  in  its  updated  version  for  2020  in proportion  to  Orange's  consumption  in  each  of  these  countries, restated for consumption of Orange's own renewable energy (own production).\n\n## Greenhouse gas emissions (GHG)\n\nFor the 2020 emissions related to electricity consumption, the IEA emissions factors in its updated version of September 2020 were used for all countries. Emissions from previous years have not been restated for these new emission factors. The emissions factors used for other fuels (natural gas, fuel oil, coal, gasoline, diesel fuel and LPG) come from the GHG Protocol.\n\nOrange Belgium and Orange Spain have used energy from renewable sources for all of their  electricity  consumption  (Scope 2) through consumption contracts with Guarantee of Origin (GoO) certificates",

Their GHG emissions related to their electricity consumption are therefore counted at zero and not according to the energy mix of the country in question.\n\nRefrigerant emissions are not exhaustive; even though this emission item is negligible (Carbon 4 study on the Group's Bilan Carbone (carbon footprint)), the Group is working to improve monitoring of these emissions.\n\nWith regard to transport, the GHG Protocol 'short-haul' air transport emissions factor (180g of CO2/passenger km) was used for all flights (short-,  medium-  and  long-haul),  suggesting  overestimation  of emissions from this mode of transport. The rail transport emissions factor is taken from the Bilan Carbone\u2122 method when this is available for the corresponding country; for other countries, a standard factor of 100g of CO2/passenger km is used.\n\n## Mobile phones collected\n\nCalculation of mobile phones collected takes into consideration five collection streams: responsible citizen collection, collection of mobile phone waste in Africa, B2C redemption offers, Enterprise redemption offers, and after-sales service returns. The percentage is calculated by dividing the number of mobile handsets collected by the number of mobile handsets sold by Orange through controlled channels, over the same period.\n\n## Evacuated waste and recovered waste\n\nEvacuated waste is waste that is no longer stored on Group premises or that is no longer under its direct control, as it is entrusted to a s e r v i c e  p r o v i d e r  o r  a n  e x t e r n a l  o r g a n i z a t i o n ,  w i t h  o r  w i t h o u t  a  fi n a n c i a l transaction. Recovered waste is waste that has been recovered in the form of reuse, recycling, material or energy recovery. These concepts apply for European countries.\n\nFor  non-European  countries,  and  taking  into  consideration  the gradual set-up of structured channels, the quantities of recovered waste concern, more broadly, all quantities of evacuated waste that have been sold.\n\nDespite the continuation of the process of identifying and collecting information on certain local waste channels, waste indicators are not exhaustive due, on the one hand, to the ongoing nature of work to  identify  and  make  waste  collection  and  treatment  channels  in the MEA region sustainable, and on the other hand, to difficulties in accessing data within the framework of contracts for the outsourcing of network operations in certain countries in Europe:\n\n- -fluorescent bulbs, PCB (polychlorinated biphenyls) and printer car t r i d g e  w a s t e  h a s  b e e n  a c c o u n t e d  f o r  u n d e r  ' O t h e r  h a z a r d o u s waste';\n\n- -different  specific  service  providers  are  involved  according  to the type of waste concerned (copper cables, paper, network equipment, batteries, wooden poles, etc.). Special attention is given to wooden poles in order to prohibit their reuse, taking into  consideration  regulatory  restrictions,  and  to  ensure  their appropriate destruction;\n- -f or leased sites, household or similar waste is not recoded as it is managed by the lessors;\n- -WEEE (Waste Electrical  and  Electronic  Equipment)  collected from B2C customers are WEEE (mobile handsets, fixed handsets and multimedia) returned to sales points, sent by mail or collected by service providers on behalf of Orange.\n\nThis  indicator  includes  the  mobile  telephones  of  the  Group's employees.  It  includes  batteries  and  rechargeable  cells  that  are part of equipment when it is returned by customers, and the other types of batteries and rechargeable cells collected separately at the various collection points.\n\nLikewise,  for  tertiary  and  network  waste  not  including  customer WEEE in France, only waste handled by a service provider that has signed a framework agreement with the Orange group is added to the reporting, except for a limited number of types of Orange Marine waste.  These  service  providers  represent  majority  of  the  waste handled. For the 2020 fiscal year, Network WEEE data for the third and fourth quarters are not yet available and have been estimated. Waste from the dismantling of telephone booths is included in the 'Other  non-hazardous  waste'  indicators  for  aluminum,  stainless steel, steel, glass and 'network WEEE' for WEEE.\n\nFor OBS, reused WEEE is recognized as recovered, and action plans are being implemented to increase reporting coverage. WEEE from OBS France's B2B customers is not recognized in this Customer WEEE indicator, but rather in the internal WEEE (network) indicator.\n\n## Water\n\nThe main sources of water consumption in the Orange group are water  fountains,  toilet  facilities,  canteens  and  the  humidification systems  of  Data  centers.  The  company  restaurants  are  the  sole responsibility  of  the  Works  Councils  and  are  not  included  in  the Orange group's consolidation scope.\n\nFollowing an evaluation, the Group believes that the volumes involved are not significant enough to warrant setting up a restrictive and verifiable  process  of  collecting  and  consolidating  data  on  water consumption.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 4\n\n4",

In 2017, the label evolved to take into account the new recommendations of the international standard ISO 20400, the\n\nfirst international standard on responsible purchasing. The France Purchasing Department obtained this label again in January 2019 and passed the interim assessment in 2020.\n\n## 4.5.1 Supplier CSR maturity assessment program for Orange subsidiaries\n\nIn  addition to the maturity assessments carried out by the BuyIn joint venture on the Group's main suppliers (network equipment, IT software and hardware, customer devices, and service platforms), since 2019, Orange has defined a new assessment program for local suppliers, which is gradually integrated by the subsidiaries. Its main objective is to increase the visibility of suppliers' CSR performance in  order  to  better  mitigate  risks  and  support  those  who  need  to strengthen their efforts in terms of CSR.\n\nThis  initiative  involves  assessing  the  CSR  maturity  of  suppliers belonging to the high CSR risk category and presenting a significant annual order value. In order to guarantee the independence and quality of the CSR analysis, supplier assessments were entrusted to a partner recognized in this field, whose methodology is based on international CSR standards and guidelines such as the Global Compact, ISO 26000, ILO or GRI.\n\nIn  2020,  this  initiative  was  extended  to  five  new  entities:  Orange Poland, Orange Romania, Orange Belgium, Sonatel in Senegal and OBS, which are added to the entities involved since 2019, notably\n\n## 4.5.2 On-site JAC audits\n\nIn  addition  to  its  coordinated  on-site  CSR  audit  program  (see Section  2.2.4.5  Management  framework  for  suppliers  and subcontractors) using its own resources, Orange works alongside other operators via the Joint Alliance for CSR (JAC). The JAC has expanded its scope since 2018, with the JAC Academy, a body whose objective is to train suppliers in the JAC's audit methodology and incorporate it into their supply chains.\n\nIn 2020, JAC conducted eighty-nine audits, including seventy on-site audits  carried  out  directly  by  the  JAC,  six  using  the  VAP  &  FLA standard (Validated Assessment Program, Fair Labor Association) and  thirteen  investigations  among  workers,  specifically  on  their\n\nOrange France, Orange Spain, Orange Slovakia, Orange Moldova, Orange Jordan, Orange Cameroon and Orange Madagascar.

Fifty-seven  suppliers  were  identified  as  requiring improvements in CSR performance. For these suppliers, Orange entities systematically request corrective action plans and monitor them.\n\nIn France, the process continued in 2020. A new assessment (or reassessment) campaign was conducted on suppliers in the high CSR risk purchasing categories, under local or Group contracts. The first corrective action plans were requested and monitored over the year 2020. At the same time, for consultations for high CSR risk purchasing categories, a CSR maturity assessment was requested. In addition, specific additional questionnaires may be sent out on certain Orange CSR requirements during these consultations.\n\nworking conditions.

It included a risk map, procedures for evaluating the position of subsidiaries, subcontractors and suppliers, appropriate actions for mitigating risks or preventing serious abuses, a whistleblowing mechanism and a mechanism for the collection of reports, and a system for monitoring the measures taken.\n\nEach year, Orange updates its information and draws up a new plan, including targets for improving the system as well as measures to implement and evaluate its effectiveness. The new plan is available on the website gallery.orange.com/CSR and the main elements of its implementation are described in chapters 2 for risk factors and their control framework, and 4 for implementation of the measures taken. See the Cross-Reference Table of the Management Report of the Board of Directors to the Shareholders' Meeting (Section 7.1.3).\n\n## 2021 vigilance plan\n\nThis is in line with the 2020 vigilance plan: it takes into account the Group's new orientations expressed through its corporate purpose and implemented in its Engage 2025 strategic plan covering the period  from  2020  to  2025.  Orange  has  specifically  identified  the exposure to physical and transient risks linked to climate change, and has committed to being Net Zero Carbon by 2040. Orange has also committed to digital inclusion, to strengthen everyday digital freedom  and  security  for  people  and  organizations.  Orange  has chosen the SDG analysis framework to report on the impacts of its activities on its stakeholders.\n\n## Governance\n\nThe vigilance plan and its report are presented to the Group's Ethics Committee and GCSERC, before approval by the Board of Directors.\n\nThe Group CSR Department, in charge of effectively defining and implementing the plan, acts in coordination with the other Group functions and has created a vigilance plan monitoring group that\n\nbenefits from the tools and networks of the CSR, Internal Control, Risk Management, Compliance, Purchasing, Human Resources and Legal Departments in order to communicate with Group entities and enable the appropriation and effective implementation of the action plans stemming from the vigilance plan.\n\nA  cross-functional  steering  group  for  the  implementation  of  the plan (mainly CSR, Audit, Control and Risk Management and Legal Departments) meets twice a month to define the new operational guidelines. In 2020, one person working full time on the coordination and control of the rollout of the plan was added to strengthen the team. This reinforces the involvement of the Group's subsidiaries and entities in actions related to the rollout of the vigilance plan. Each subsidiary or entity concerned by the plan has appointed a person in charge of implementing the vigilance plan within the subsidiary or entity considered.\n\nThe 2021 vigilance plan includes an updated risk map based on the action plans implemented in 2020. A summary appears below:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe risk of non-compliance with safety instructions by employees and subcontractors working in high-risk areas (work sites at height, work on antennas) has been added to the health, safety and security of people risk cluster.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 4\n\n4",

The main points are set out in chapter 4 Non-Financial Performance.\n\n## Scope of implementation of the plan\n\nThe  plan  is  intended  to  be  rolled  out  across  all  of  the  Group's consolidated subsidiaries.\n\nBased on a substantial but limited  number  of  entities  in  2018,  it was  extended  in  2019  to  cover  the  entities  selected  under  the Sarbanes-Oxley program, i.e. the main divisions and/or departments of Orange SA, and has been extended to subsidiaries with revenue of more than 100 million euros. Monitoring of the rollout of the plan\n\nin 2020 thus covers 95% of the Group's consolidated revenue for 2020 and is based on the Group's risk management methodology.\n\n## Implementation\n\nThe  vigilance  plan  steering  committee  has  supplemented  its implementation kit for Group entities to enable them to take ownership of their plan in a coordinated manner, using the tools provided under the Group's risk management methodology, and thus roll out their own action plans linked to the Group's vigilance plan. Internal audit was strongly involved, in particular, in the form of a questionnaire on CSR governance sent to all Group entities and subsidiaries; the response rate was 52%. In 2020, the Group's Audit Department began two new projects covering the scope of the rollout of the Vigilance Plan in Poland and Spain, whose recommendations will be known in 2021.\n\nA summary of the monitoring of the plan by type of risk is provided in the table below:\n\n| Risk                                                                                                                 | Governance                                                                                       | Indicator                                                                                                                                             | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Lack of vigilance plan, or shortcomings                                                                              | Lack of vigilance plan, or shortcomings                                                          | Lack of vigilance plan, or shortcomings                                                                                                               |        |        |        |\n| 1.

In addition, we have implemented a system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, the ethics requirements and French professional guidance.\n\n## Responsibility of the Statutory Auditor appointed as an independent third party\n\nOn the basis of our work, our responsibility is to provide a report expressing a limited assurance conclusion on:\n\n- -the compliance of the Statement with the requirements of Article R. 225-105 of the French Commercial Code;\n- -the  accuracy of  the  information  provided  in  accordance  with Article R. 225-105 I, 3\u00b0 and II of the French Commercial Code, i.e., the policy outcomes, including key performance indicators, and the measures implemented in view of the principal risks (hereinafter the 'Information').\n\nIt  is  our responsibility to express, at the request of the entity and outside  the  scope  of  accreditation,  a  conclusion  of  reasonable assurance that the information selected by the entity presented in the Appendix and identified by the symbol \u221a in the 'Non-financial performance' chapter has been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Guidelines.\n\nHowever,  it  is  not  our  responsibility  to  comment  on  the  entity's compliance with other applicable legal and regulatory requirements, in  particular the French Duty of Vigilance law and anti-corruption\n\nand tax evasion legislation nor on the compliance of products and services with the applicable regulations.\n\n## Nature and scope of our work\n\nOur work described below was carried out in accordance with the provisions of Articles A. 225-1 et seq. of the French Commercial Code, the professional doctrine of the Compagnie Nationale des Commissaires aux Comptes relating to this intervention, and the international standard ISAE 3000 (2) :\n\n- -we  obtained  an  understanding  of  all  consolidated  entities' activities, and the description of the principal risks associated;\n- -we assessed the suitability of the criteria of the Guidelines with respect to their relevance, completeness, reliability, neutrality and understandability, with due consideration of industry best practices, where appropriate;\n- -we verified that the Statement includes each category of social and environmental information set out in Article L. 225-102-1 III as well as information regarding compliance with human rights and anti-corruption and tax avoidance legislation;\n- -we verified that the Statement presents the information provided for in II of Article R. 225-105 when it is relevant in terms of the principal risks and includes, where applicable, an explanation of the reasons justifying the absence of information required by the 2nd paragraph of III of Article L. 225-102-1;\n- -we  verified  that  the  Statement  presents  the  business  model and  a  description  of  the  principal  risks  associated  with  all the  consolidated  entities'  activities,  including  where  relevant and  proportionate,  the  risks  associated  with  their  business relationships, their products or services, as well as their policies, measures implemented and the outcomes thereof, including key performance indicators associated with the principal risks;\n- -we referred to documentary sources and conducted interviews to:\n- -assess the process used to identify and confirm the principal risks as well as the consistency of the outcomes, including the key performance indicators used, with respect to the principal risks and the policies presented,\n- -corroborate the qualitative information (measures implemented and outcomes) that we considered to be the most important presented in the Appendix. For certain risks (3) , our work was carried out at the level of the consolidating entity; for other risks, work was carried out at the level of the consolidating entity and in a selection of entities (4).\n- -we verified that the Statement covers the scope of consolidation, i.e.  all  the  consolidated  entities  in  accordance  with  Article L. 233-16 of the French Commercial Code within the limitations set out in the Statement;\n- -we  obtained  an  understanding  of  internal  control  and  risk management procedures the entit y h a s p u t  i n  p l a c e  a n d  a s s e s s e d the  data  collection  process  to  ensure  the  completeness  and accuracy of the Information;",

This work was carried out on a selection of contributing entities and covers  between  43%  and  70%  of  the  consolidated  data selected for these tests;\n- -we assessed the overall consistency of the Statement based on our knowledge of all the consolidated entities.\n\nWe believe that the work carried out, based on our professional judgment, is sufficient to provide a basis for our limited assurance conclusion; a higher level of assurance would have required us to carry out more extensive procedures.\n\n## Means and resources\n\n- -Our work was carried out by a team of twelve people between November 2020 and February 2021 and took a total of around thirty weeks;\n- -We  were assisted in our work by our specialists in sustainable development  and  Corporate  Social  Responsibility.  We conducted around fifty interviews with the individuals responsible for  preparing  the  Statement  from  the  Risk  Management,\n\nCompliance, Human Resources, Health and Safety, Environment and Purchasing Departments.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nOn the basis of our work, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Consolidated Statement of Non-financial Performance is not presented in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements and that the Information, taken as a whole, is not presented fairly, in accordance with the Guidelines.\n\n## Comments\n\nWithout calling into question the conclusion expressed above and in accordance with the provisions of Article A. 225-3 of the French Commercial Code, we make the following comments:\n\n- -for the calculation of indicators relating to training, the Group has extended the scope of reporting, which now covers 80% of  the  Group's  consolidated  workforce  (compared  to  65%  in 2019), thanks to measures implemented to improve the reliability of the information;\n- -for the calculation of health and safety indicators, despite the strengthening  of  the  Group's  system  and  collection  tool,  the annual reporting by local entities can still be improved;\n- -for the calculation of waste indicators, despite the continuation of the process of identifying and collecting information on certain local channels that are still not very mature, the monitoring of the treatment of this waste after removal can still be improved. It should be noted that Orange France contributes to approximately 78% of the waste tonnage reported.\n\n## Reasonable assurance report on a selection of non-financial information\n\n## Nature and scope of our work\n\nWith regard to the information selected by the entity presented in the Appendix and identified by the symbol \uf0fc\uf0fc in the Statement of NonFinancial Performance chapter, we conducted the same procedures as those described in the Nature and scope of our work paragraph above for the information deemed most important. However, these procedures were conducted in greater depth, particularly regarding the number of tests.\n\nWe believe that these procedures enable us to express reasonable assurance  regarding  the  information  selected  by  the  entity  and identified by the symbol \uf0fc\uf0fc .\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn our opinion, the information selected by the entity and identified by the symbol \uf0fc\uf0fc in the Non-financial performance chapter has been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Guidelines.\n\nConsequently, the selected sample represents between 43% and 70% of the information identified by the symbol \uf0fc\uf0fc .\n\nParis-La\tD\u00e9fense,\tFebruary\t18,\t2021\n\nKPMG S.A.\n\nAnne Garans Partner Sustainability Services\n\nJacques Pierre Partner\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 4\n\n4",

The Public Prosecutor's Office appealed the general acquittal in July 2019, and the case was referred to the Court of Peer Appeals for trial in October 2020. Due to the state of health of one defendant, the case was adjourned and is expected to be heard in May 2021. There is no other official public offense or sanction pronounced by state or regulatory authorities against a Director or Officer;\n- -no Director or Officer has been barred by a court from serving as a member of a management or supervisory body of a listed company or from being involved in the management or business operations of a listed company.\n\n## Family ties\n\nTo the Company's knowledge, there are no family ties among Company Directors and Officers, or between the Directors and Officers and the Executive Committee members.\n\n## Conflicts of interest\n\nUnder Article 16 of the Internal Guidelines of the Board of Directors, which may be consulted on the Group's website at www.orange.com, under the heading Group/Governance (see Section 5.2.1.4 Internal Guidelines), each Director must notify the Chairman of the Board and the Lead Director of any situation concerning them liable to give rise to a conflict of interest with a Group company.\n\nIn  particular,  Article  10  of  the  Internal  Guidelines  of  the  Board  of Directors entrusts the Lead Director with a specific prevention role regarding conflicts of interest which could occur, primarily by carrying out awareness initiatives. The Lead Director informs the Governance\n\nand Corporate Social and Environmental Responsibility (GCSER) Committee,  and  the  Board  of  Directors,  should  he/she  deem  it appropriate, of any potential or actual conflicts of interest affecting Corporate Officers and the other members of the Board of Directors. He/she may make recommendations to the GCSER Committee and the Board of Directors on how to manage potential conflicts of interest of which he/she becomes aware of or which are reported to him/her (see Section 5.2.1.7 Lead Director).\n\nIn addition, Article 16.3 of these Internal Guidelines stipulates that for any situation concerning a Director that may create a conflict of interest, the Director concerned shall refrain from participating in the vote on the corresponding resolution.\n\nMoreover, a declaration relating to the existence or non-existence of a situation of conflict or divergence of interests (even potential) is requested annually from the Company's Directors and Officers as part of the preparation of the Universal Registration Document as well as when taking office and any renewals of office. At its meeting of February 11, 2021, the GCSER Committee also took note of the annual declarations of the Directors and Officers (see Section 5.2.1.2 Independent Directors).\n\nTo the best of the Company's knowledge and as of the date of this Universal Registration Document, there is no potential conflict of interests between the duties of Directors or Corporate Officers with regard to Orange and their private interests or other duties.\n\nTo the best of the Company's knowledge, there are no arrangements or agreements with any major shareholder, customer, supplier or any other third party under which any member of the Board of Directors or Corporate Officer has been appointed to the Board of Directors or Company's General Management (respectively).\n\n## 5.1.4.4 Shares and stock options held by members of the Executive Committee\n\nAs  of  the  date  of  this  document,  to  the  best  of  the  Company's knowledge, the members of Orange's Executive Committee, including St\u00e9phane Richard, Ramon Fernandez, and Gervais Pellissier, owned a t o t a l  o f  2 2 8 , 3 6 3  O r a n g e  s h a r e s ,  r e p r e s e n t i n g  0 . 0 0 9 %  o f  t h e  c a p i t a l .\n\nAs  of  the  date  of  this  document,  no  members  of  the  Executive Committee hold any stock options, as the last plan in force expired on May 21, 2017 (see Section 5.4.1.2 History of stock-option grants (table No.8)).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 5\n\n5",

The term of office for Directors is four years.\n\nPursuant to Government Order No. 2014-948 of August 20, 2014 relating to governance and transactions in the capital of companies with a public shareholding, given that the French State holds more than 10% of the Company's share capital, it is entitled to appoint a representative to the Board of Directors, and a number of positions in  proportion  to  its  stake  are  reserved  for  members  that  it  may nominate. The public sector has three representatives on the Board of Directors: one representative appointed by Ministerial Order and two Directors appointed by the Shareholders' Meeting.\n\n## 5.2.1.2 Independent Directors\n\nThe annual assessment of Directors' independence was carried out by the Board of Directors on February 17, 2021, on the basis of a proposal by the Governance and Corporate Social and Environmental Responsibility  Committee  (GCSERC).  In  assessing  Directors' independence,  the  Board  took  into  account  all  of  the  criteria  of the Afep-Medef Corporate Governance Code for listed companies, which state that a Director, to be considered independent, must not:\n\n- -be or have been within the last five years:\n- -an employee or executive Corporate Officer of the Company,\n- -an employee, executive Corporate Officer or Director of a consolidated subsidiary of the Company,\n- -an  employee,  executive  Corporate  Officer  or  Director  of the  parent  company  or  a  consolidated  subsidiary  of  the Company;\n- -an executive Corporate Officer of a company in which Orange, directly or indirectly, holds a position on the Board of Directors or in which an employee appointed as such, or a person who is currently or was at any time in the previous fi ve ye a r s a n exe c u ti ve Corporate Officer of Orange, is a Director;\n- -be a customer, supplier, commercial banker, investment banker or advisor:\n- -that is material to the Company or its Group, or\n- -for which the Company or its Group represents a significant share of business.\n\nThe  assessment  of  the  potential  significance  of  the  relationship with the Company or its Group must be debated by the Board, and the qualitative and/or quantitative criteria used in this assessment\n\n(continuity, economic dependence, exclusivity, etc.) must be explicitly stated in the Corporate Governance Report:\n\n- -not have close family ties with a Director or Officer;\n- -not have been a Statutory Auditor of the Company within the last five years;\n- -not have been a Director of the Company for more than twelve years.  Under  this  criterion,  loss  of  the  status  of  independent Director occurs on the date at which this period of twelve years is reached.\n\nThe Afep-Medef Code recommends presenting a summary table of each Director's position with regard to independence criteria. The analysis of the GCSERC was thus carried out with regard to these criteria; the summary table appears at the end of this section.\n\nThe  three  Directors  representing  the  public  sector  and  the  four Directors  elected  by  the  employees  or  representing  employee shareholders cannot, by definition, be deemed independent under the Afep-Medef Code. St\u00e9phane Richard, the Chairman and CEO, is not considered an independent Director because of the executive functions he holds within the Group.\n\nAs far as other Directors are concerned, the GCSERC reviewed, firstly,  their  annual  declarations  when  preparing  this  document, including a section on potential conflicts of interest, and, secondly, any business relationships between the Orange group and these Directors or companies that employ them, or in which they may hold terms of office (see Section 5.2.1.8 Board and committee activities during the fiscal year).\n\nThe GCSERC also examined the nature of business dealings and par t n e r s h i p s  w i t h  l i s t e d  c o m p a n i e s  i n  w h i c h  i t s  D i r e c t o r s  h o l d  o f fi c e s . This indicated that some of these companies are Orange Business Services customers for 'business' telecommunication services or Group suppliers in the normal course of business and for insignificant amounts across the Orange group. The Board also reviewed any potential consultancy services declared that had been carried out the Company's Directors.\n\nThe Board of Directors considered, given the nature and volume of  the  business  relationships  in  question  and  the  declaration  of independence made by each of the aforementioned Directors, that these relationships are insignificant for both the Orange group and each of  the  groups  or  entities  to  which  the  Directors  concerned belong. The Board of Directors concluded that these relationships are therefore not likely to call into question their independence.\n\nFollowing  the  discussions,  Anne-Gabrielle  Heilbronner,  Christel Heydemann and Helle Kristoffersen as well as Alexandre Bompard, Bernard Ramanantsoa, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Sanchez and Jean-Michel Severino were deemed to be independent under the criteria of the Afep-Medef Code, i.e. seven of the Board's fifteen members.\n\nExcluding the Directors elected by the employees or representing employee  shareholders,  who  are  not  taken  into  account  for  the purposes  of  calculating  the  proportion  of  independent  Directors under the Afep-Medef Code, the Board thus has seven independent Di r e c t o r s  o u t  o f  e l e v e n ,  i . e .  n e a r l y  t w o - t h i r d s  o f  t h e  B o a r d ,  a  p r o p o r t i o n that is well within the recommendations of the Afep-Medef Code.",

In  application  of  the criteria resulting from the laws of January 27, 2011 (on the balanced representation  of  women  and  men  on  Boards  of  Directors  and Supervisory Boards and on professional equality) and of May 22, 2019 (on growth and the transformation of companies, known as the\n\nPACTE law), the proportion of women on the Board was 45% (five women out of eleven).

They are available on the website www. orange.com, under the heading Group/Governance.\n\nThe Internal Guidelines specify, among other details, the respective responsibilities of the Board of Directors, the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer, stipulating limits to his powers; they also set the rules governing the composition, powers and operating procedures of each Board committee.\n\nThe Internal Guidelines also specify the rules governing the information provided to Directors and the meetings of the Board.\n\nThe Inter n a l  G u i d e l i n e s  h a v e  b e e n  u p d a t e d  o n  a  n u m b e r  o f  o c c a s i o n s by  the  Board  of  Directors  to  reflect  changes  in  the  Company's governance.  Its  last  review,  dated  February  12,  2020,  revised references  that  had  become  obsolete;  in  particular,  it  replaced references to the 'Orange Works Council Central Committee' with references to the 'Central Social and Economic Committee,' a new employee representative body since December 4, 2019.\n\n## 5.2.1.5 Chairman of the Board of Directors\n\nArticle 1 of the Internal Guidelines of the Board of Directors specifies the role and duties of the Chairman.\n\nThe  Chairman  represents  the  Board  of  Directors  and,  except  in unusual circumstances, is the only person authorized to act and speak in the Board's name. He organizes and steers the work of the Board of Directors and ensures the efficient running of corporate bodies in line with the principles of good governance. He serves as  a  liaison  between  the  Board  of  Directors  and  the  Company's shareholders,  in  coordination  with  the  General  Management;  he monitors the quality of the Company's financial information. When the roles of Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer  are  split,  he  may,  in  close  coordination  with  the  General Management, represent the Company in its upper-level  relations with  the  public  authorities,  the  Group's  major  partners  and  key customers, both within France and internationally. In this case, he is briefed regularly by the Chief Executive Officer on the significant events and situations relating to Group operations, and he may seek any i n f o r m a t i o n  f r o m  t h e  C E O  n e e d e d  t o  i n f o r m  t h e  B o a r d  o f  D i r e c t o r s and  its  committees.  The  Chairman  may  meet  with  the  Statutory Auditors in order to prepare the work of the Board of Directors and the Audit Committee. He may attend meetings of Board Committees under the conditions provided for in the Internal Guidelines.\n\nIn  accordance  with  Articles  29-1  and  29-2  of  French  Law  No. 90-568 of July 2, 1990, the Chairman of the Board of Directors also has the power to appoint and manage the civil servants employed by the Company.\n\nPursuant to the Company's Bylaws, the Chairman of the Board of Directors can hold his position until the age of 70.",

        "page_content": "## 5.2.1.6 Committees of the Board of Directors\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  is  supported  by  expertise  from  three specialized  committees.  Their  role  is  to  provide  informed  input for the Board's discussions and assist in preparing its decisions. These  committees  meet  as  often  as  is  necessary.  Their  powers and operating procedures are set out in the Internal Guidelines of the Board of Directors. In line with the Afep-Medef Code, significant responsibilities  are  given  to  independent  Directors.  Orange  also believes that it is important that each committee benefits from the\n\npresence  of  at  least  one  Director  representing  the  public  sector and at least one member representing employees or employee shareholders,  which  contributes  to  taking  into  account  different opinions in the work of the committees (see Section 5.2.1.8 Board and committee activities during the fiscal year).\n\nThus,  with  the  exception  of  the  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive Officer, all of the Directors sit on a committee, based on the choices discussed and made by the Board.\n\n## Composition of the Board Committees as of the date of this document\n\n| Audit Committee                                                                      |   Year created 1997 | Chairman Bernard Ramanantsoa  (1)   | Members S\u00e9bastien Crozier Christel Heydemann  (1)  Jean-Michel Severino  (1) (2)  Claire Vernet-Garnier   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Governance and Corporate Social and Environmental Responsibility  Committee (GCSERC) |                2003 | Anne-Gabrielle Heilbronner  (1)     | Fabrice Jolys Anne Lange                                                                                  |\n| Innovation and Technology Committee (ITC)                                            |                2014 | Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Sanchez  (1)               | Alexandre Bompard  (1)                                                                                    |\n\n## Audit Committee\n\nIn accordance with the Internal Guidelines of the Board of Directors, the  Audit  Committee  has  at  least  three  members  appointed  by the Board. At least two-thirds of members must be independent (excluding  Directors  representing  the  employees  or  employee shareholders, who are not taken into account). The Chairman of the Audit Committee is chosen from among the independent Directors.\n\nThe  composition  of  the  Audit  Committee  complies  with  the recommendations  of  the  Afep-Medef  Code,  with  three-quarters of  its  Directors,  excluding  Directors  elected  by  the  employees  or representing employee shareholders, being independent, and with no Corporate Officers on the Committee. The composition of the Audit Committee also complies with the provisions of Article L. 82319 of the French Commercial Code relating to the establishment of  a  specialized  committee to follow up questions relating to the preparation and control of accounting and financial information.\n\nI n  t h i s  r e g a r d ,  t h e  C o m m i t t e e  m o n i t o r s  t h e  fi n a n c i a l  r e p o r t i n g  p r o c e s s and  the  effectiveness  of  internal  control  and  risk  management systems relating to accounting and financial reporting procedures. It  issues  a  recommendation  regarding  the  Statutory  Auditors nominated for appointment, organizes their selection process and submits a reasoned recommendation to the Board regarding their choice and their compensation terms and conditions. It monitors the Statutory Auditors' fulfillment of their engagement and approves, where applicable, the provision of services other than the certification of the financial statements, for such services that are not prohibited by law or Orange's rules. The Committee also studies all investment or divestment projects that meet the criteria set out in Article 2 of the Internal Guidelines of the Board of Directors, and prepares related deliberations of the Board. The Audit Committee may also request that any audit or internal/external review be carried out on any matter it considers to fall within its remit.\n\nFurthermore, the Chairman of the Audit Committee is assigned a particular role, and reports to the Board of Directors on a regular basis on the execution of the Committee's functions, as well as the outcome of the statutory audit and the manner in which this has contributed to the integrity of the financial information, and the role the\n\nAudit Committee has played in this process. He immediately informs the Board of any difficulties encountered and submits a summary of the Audit Committee's discussions.\n\nThe responsibilities of the Audit Committee are detailed in Article 7 of the Internal Guidelines of the Board of Directors.\n\n## Financial expertise within the Audit Committee\n\nMembers  of  the  Audit  Committee  are  required  to  have  or  to gain  financial  or  accounting  expertise.  The  Audit  Committee,  in accordance with the provisions of Article L. 823-19 of the French Commercial Code and Section 407 of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act, must also comprise at least one person with specific expertise in the field of finance, accounting or statutory auditing, who must be independent (the 'financial expert').\n\nJean-Michel Severino was appointed financial expert of the Audit Committee during the Board of Directors' meeting of October 25, 2017, due to his role as Financial Inspector, his past functions as CEO of the Agence fran\u00e7aise de d\u00e9veloppement (AFD, French international development  agency)  and  Vice-President  of  the  World  Bank  for Asia,  and  his  current  position  as  manager  of  fund  management company I&P.\n\n## Governance and Corporate Social and Environmental Responsibility Committee\n\nI n  a c c o r d a n c e  w i t h  t h e  I n t e r n a l  G u i d e l i n e s  o f  t h e  B o a r d  o f  D i r e c t o r s ,  t h e Governance and Corporate Social and Environmental Responsibility Committee (GCSERC) has at least three members appointed by the Board.\n\nIts  composition is in line with the recommendations of the AfepMedef Code, as the ratio of independent Directors is 50% (excluding the Director elected by the employees, who is not included in this calculation).\n\nThe major areas of responsibility of this Committee, whose creation is recommended by the Afep-Medef Code, are namely appointments and compensation, Corporate Social Responsibility, and governance.

In these areas, it is tasked in particular with making proposals to the Board of Directors, as well as to the Chairman and, as necessary, the CEO. The CEO also keeps the Committee informed of any new appointments to the Group Executive Committee; the Committee may offer its opinion on the terms and conditions for calculating the compensation of these new members, or regarding multi-year variable  compensation  plans  (Long  Term  Incentive  Plans)  or  free share award plans in place at the Orange group. The Committee also ensures, with regard to succession plans, that a process is in place f o r  w h e n  o f fi c e s  e x p i r e  a n d  i n  s i t u a t i o n s  r e q u i r i n g  p a r t i c u l a r  a t t e n t i o n .\n\nThe Committee also examines, in line with the Group's strategy, the main thrust of the human resources and corporate social and environmental responsibility policies drawn up, based on discussions with the Group's stakeholders. Once a year, it reviews the Ethics Committee's  report  on  the  Group-wide  actions  to  implement ethics practices, and is informed about the rollout of the Group's compliance programs.\n\nArticle 8 of the Internal Guidelines of the Board of Directors details the responsibilities of the Committee.\n\n## Innovation and Technology Committee\n\nIn accordance with the Internal Guidelines of the Board of Directors, the Innovation and Technology Committee has at least three members appointed by the Board.\n\nThe  Committee  notably  reviews  the  significant  multi-annual i nvestment programs and the major technology par tnerships entered into by the Group, the Group's strategic policies in terms of innovation and technology, and its performance in this respect.\n\nArticle 9 of the Internal Guidelines of the Board of Directors details the responsibilities of the Committee.\n\n## Joint meeting of Board Committees\n\nIn accordance with Article 11 of the Internal Guidelines of the Board of Directors - and without constituting a specialized committee of the Board itself - the Audit Committee, the GCSERC and the Innovation and Technology Committee meet in a joint forum once a year under the chairmanship of the Chairman of the Audit Committee or chaired by the oldest member present. This Joint Committee is responsible for preparing the work of the Board of Directors relative to internal control and risk management systems. Its last meeting took place on September 16, 2020.\n\nThe  Internal  Guidelines  provide  that  during  this  meeting,  the Company's General Management presents the risk mapping in the Company, in particular the effectiveness of the risk management system, the major risks facing the Group and the mechanisms for preventing and detecting fraud.\n\n## Special-purpose committees\n\nArticle 5 of the Internal Guidelines of the Board of Directors provides that the Board may decide, for certain technical issues relating to the Company's operations and/or issues that may involve conflicts of interest and on which the Board of Directors is expected to give its view or make a decision, to establish a special-purpose committee to review these matters in consultation with the Company's General Management. Article 5 was amended at the request of the Board on December 5, 2018 in order to enable any Director to participate in such committees, provided that they have no conflicts of interest.\n\nThe Board of Directors appoints the Chairman, who is chosen from among the Committee's independent Directors.\n\n## 5.2.1.7 Lead Director\n\nThe Internal Guidelines of the Board of Directors allow the Board to appoint a Lead Director from among the independent Directors at\n\nthe proposal of the GCSERC. A Lead Director must be appointed if the same person is both Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer.\n\nThe Board of Directors of February 12, 2020 appointed Bernard Ramanantsoa, who is also Chairman of the Audit Committee, as Lead Director.

The Lead Director participates  annually  in  a  meeting  of  the  Risk Committee (see Section 5.2.2.3 Executive Committee and Group governance committees).\n\n## 5.2.1.8 Board and committee activities during the fiscal year\n\n## Board activities\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  met  twelve  times  in  2020.  Its  meetings had a collective attendance rate of 94.3%. Individual attendance rates are presented in the table located at the end of this section. Information  on  the  method  for  allocating  and  the  payment  of Directors'  compensation  is  presented  in  Section  5.4.2.1 Amount of compensation paid or allocated to Corporate Officers for 2020 activity. The typical Board meeting lasts around four hours.\n\nEach meeting is generally preceded by a meeting of one or more of the Board's committees with a view to preparing its work and deliberations. The issues discussed by the committees are reported on by their Chair(s) to the Board of Directors.\n\nIn  addition  to  the  regular  stages  of  the  Company's  life  (review  of operational  performance,  quarterly  results,  half-year  and  annual financial statements, review of the budget, risk factors, setting of the compensation of Corporate Officers, etc.), the Board notably exercised,  in  close  coordination  with  the  General  Management, reactive  and  vigilant  supervision  of  the  Group's  position  and  the measures implemented in connection with the crisis related to the Covid-19  pandemic  throughout  the  year,  to  ensure  the  smooth running of the business continuity plan and to monitor the effects of the crisis.\n\nIt  also  voted  in  favor  of  the  adoption  of  Orange  SA's  corporate purpose and its inclusion in the Company's Bylaws by the 2020 Shareholders' Meeting. In the course of its work, the Board ensures that it  takes into consideration not only social and environmental issues but also the corporate purpose in performing its duties.\n\nThe Board of Directors also reviewed the composition of the new management team appointed in June 2020. It ruled on the conclusion of certain structuring contracts in view of the amounts defined in Article 2 of its Internal Guidelines, and in this context examined an item relating to the acquisition of sporting rights to football matches in Spain. During the same period, the Board also examined Orange Bank's development plans.\n\nDuring  the  second  half  of  2020,  the  Board  was  kept  informed, in  connection  with  the  work  of  the  dedicated  special-purpose committee, of the progress of the auction process relating to the allocation  of  5G  spectrum.  It  also  reviewed  the  guidelines  of  the General Management following the favorable decision handed down by the French Conseil d'\u00c9tat on 13 November on a long-standing tax dispute, which enabled the Group to be reimbursed the sums paid in July 2013, i.e. around 2.2 billion euros. Finally, it approved the signing of an agreement to acquire a majority block of 54% of the  share  capital  of  Telekom  Romania  Communications  ('TKR'), as part of a transaction intended to accelerate Orange's strategy of becoming a convergent operator for its subscribers in Romania.\n\nIt  is  regularly  kept  informed  of  employee-related  news  within  the Company, such as the signing of agreements, internal elections and the health situation.\n\nIn  the  second half of 2020, the Board of Directors consulted the Central Social and Economic Committee (Central SEC) on strategic guidelines. This annual consultation gave rise to the presentation of a series of questions posed by the Central SEC during the Board of Directors' meeting of February 17, 2021.\n\nThe  Board  proposed  the  renewal  of  the  conditional  multi-year variable compensation plan (Long Term Incentive Plan, or LTIP) for Corporate Officers for the period from 2021 to 2023, with a review of the associated performance criteria in relation to the new strategic direction. The plan will be submitted for approval by the Shareholders' Meeting of May 18, 2021 (see Section 5.4.1). The Board of Directors' review  of  points  related  to  the  appointment,  compensation  and evaluation of Corporate Officers is conducted in the absence of the interested parties.\n\nOn  September  16,  2020,  it  also  examined  the  existence  and monitoring of the effectiveness of internal control and financial and non-financial risk management systems in the form of a joint meeting of the three committees.\n\nThe Board of Directors was presented with an update of the Group vigilance plan and the obligations regarding the Statement of NonFinancial  Performance.  It  also  approved  the  information  on  the corporate social and environmental issues of the Group included in the Report of the Board of Directors to the Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nPursuant to the new provisions of the Afep-Medef Code relating to gender balance within governing bodies, the Board has designated the executive management network of the Group's executives and leaders as a governing body, and has set an annual target of 35% women by 2025, in line with the percentage of women in the Group's workforce (see Section 2.2.4.2.4 Promoting diversity and inclusion - Gender equality in the workplace).\n\nThe Board also reviewed the implementation of the recommendations resulting from the evaluation of its operations carried out in the fourth quarter  of  2019  with  the  assistance  of  an  independent  firm  (see Section 5.2.1.9 Periodic review of the operations of the Board of Directors and its committees).\n\nAt the Board of Directors' meeting of February 17, 2021, Bernard Ramanantsoa reported on his role as Lead Director in 2020.\n\nThe main topics covered in his latest report are:\n\n- -the monitoring of potential crisis situations that could undermine the Company's governance;\n- -the quality of relations within the Board and between the Board of Directors and the General Management;\n- -periodic  review  of  independence  and  potential  conflicts  of interest.\n\nIn 2020, a new secure digital application dedicated to the work of the Board was rolled out to the members of the Board. The new application,  which  is  more  efficient  in  terms  of  functionality  and confidentiality, is gradually being rolled out at the same time across all of the Group's Boards in order to make its use more fluid and widespread by all internal Directors.\n\nLastly, the Board of Directors decided, at its meeting of February 17, 2021, to transfer Orange's registered office from 78, rue Olivier-deSerres,  75015  Paris  to  111,  quai  du  Pr\u00e9sident-Roosevelt, 92130  Issy-les-Moulineaux,  with  effect  from  the  close  of  the Shareholders' Meeting of May 18, 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5\n\n- 5",

Its meetings had a collective attendance rate of 100%.\n\nIt  met  regularly  with  Orange's  Senior  Management and the main managers of the Group's Finance Department, as well as with the Head of the Group Audit, Control and Risk Management Department and the Statutory Auditors in order to review with them their respective action plans and follow-up on these plans.\n\n## Financial reporting\n\nIn 2020, the Committee analyzed the Statutory and Consolidated Financial Statements for the 2019 fiscal year and the first half of 2020, together with the first and third quarter results for 2020. At its meeting on February 15, 2021, it reviewed the results of the fourth quarter of 2020, as well as the Statutor y a nd Consolidated Financial Statements for the 2020 fiscal year. It verified that the processes for producing accounting and financial information complied with regulatory and legal  requirements,  especially  in  terms  of  internal  control.  In  this respect,  the  Committee  reviewed  the  draft  Management  Report and heard the Statutory Auditors' Reports. It also reviewed the 2021 budget. The significant risks and off-balance sheet commitments and t h e i r  a c c o u n t i n g  i m p a c t ,  a s  w e l l  a s  t h e  r e s u l t s  o f  t h e  a s s e t  i m p a i r m e n t tests were also discussed.\n\nIn addition, the Committee reviewed all financial communications before their publication.\n\n## Internal control and risk management, ethics\n\nBefore approving each set of financial statements, the Committee undertook a review of the significant disputes in which the Group is involved.\n\nMoreover, the Committee examined the results of the annual evaluation of the internal financial control system, which were presented to it by the Group Internal Control Department, and concluded that the system was effective (see Section 2.2.3.2 Summary of works on Internal Control implemented under Section 404 of the SarbanesOxley Act).\n\nThe Committee also reviewed the major risks that the Company believes  could  have  a  significant  adverse  effect  on  its  business, financial position or earnings, particularly in light of its risk mapping. It also ensured that the recommendations formulated by the Group Audit, Control and Risk Management Department after the internal audit  assignments  were  correctly  implemented.  The  findings  of the audit assignments as well as the schedule of upcoming audit assignments were presented. The description of material risks is presented in Section 2.1 Risk factors.\n\nFinally, the Committee was presented with the external audit plan.\n\n## Management of debt and cash\n\nThe  Committee  regularly  reviewed  the  Group's  debt  refinancing and  cash  management  policy  and  was  given  a  presentation  on the annual update of the Group's derivative counterparty and cash investment limits.\n\n## Development projects and strategic plan\n\nThe Committee was informed about the position of certain of the Group's equity interests in Europe, Africa and the Middle East and reviewed the asset impairment tests conducted at the end of 2020 at the Group's main subsidiaries and equity interests, based on the entities' updated strategic plans, in order to take the 2021 budget as well as geopolitical and macroeconomic changes into account.\n\n## Statutory Auditors\n\nThe Committee reviewed the fees of the Statutory Auditors for 2020 and the financial terms of their work during the year. Following the work of a technical committee set up as part of the call for tenders for the selection of the Statutory Auditors, the Audit Committee made a recommendation to the Board of Directors to renew the appointment\n\nof KPMG and to appoint Deloitte as successor to Ernst & Young (EY), which could not be renewed by law. This decision will be submitted to the approval of the 2021 Shareholders' Meeting.\n\n## Governance and Corporate Social and Environmental Responsibility Committee (GCSERC)\n\nThe GCSERC met eight times in 2020. Its meetings had a collective attendance rate of 100%.\n\n## Compensation of Directors and Officers\n\nAt  the  beginning  of  2020,  the  Committee  determined  the  target proposals and calculation methods for the variable portion of the compensation of the Chairman and CEO and the Delegate CEOs for 2020. The calculation of the annual variable compensation of Corporate Officers is based on a weighted average of five indicators focused on the Group's growth, profitability, quality of service, and CSR performance. These indicators, their relative weighting and the results achieved are described in Section 5.4 Compensation and benefits paid to Directors, Officers and Senior Management.\n\nThe  proposed  targets  of  the  Corporate  Officers  for  2021  were examined  and  discussed  at  several  meetings,  and  defined  in February 2021.\n\nIn  addition,  the  Committee  monitored  the  implementation  of conditional  multi-year  variable  compensation  plans  (Long  Term Incentive Plans, or LTIP) for Corporate Officers and members of the Executive Committee for the 2018-2020 and 2019-2021 periods. In February 2021, on the proposal of the Committee, the terms and conditions of the LTIP 2020-2022 were renewed for the 2021-2023 period,  with  certain  adjustments,  particularly  in  terms  of  CSR performance criteria to take into account the strategic orientations of the Engage 2025 plan.\n\nThe terms, procedures and conditions of these LTIPs are described in Section 5.4.1.\n\nLastly, the Committee prepared the breakdown of compensation for Directors in respect of the 2020 fiscal year and defined the Directors' compensation policy for the 2021 fiscal year in the light of the changes made by Government Order No. 2019-1234 of November 27, 2019 relating  to  the  compensation  for  Directors  and  Officers  of  listed companies  (see  Section  5.4.2 Board of Directors' report on the compensation of non-executive corporate officers).\n\n## Governance and operation of the Board\n\nThe Committee reviewed the Board's Corporate Governance Report attached to the Management Report.\n\nIt also examined, as it does every year, the situation of each of the independent  Directors  with  regard  to  the  independence  criteria set out in the Afep-Medef Code (see Section 5.2.1.2 Independent Directors).\n\nAt its  meeting of February 11, 2021, the Committee took note of annual declarations made by Orange's Directors and Officers, in which certain information is required: number of Orange shares held and any related-party transactions, terms of office and positions held in 2020, personal situation, potential conflicts of interest, etc.\n\nMembers of the GCSERC noted that in light of the annual declarations made by Directors and Officers, no specific conflicts of interest had been identified. This review, together with other work carried out by the Committee, enabled it to recommend to the Board that it categorize seven Directors as independent within the meaning of the Afep-Medef Code (see Section 5.2.1.2 Independent Directors).\n\nThe Committee also considered the annual activity report of the Lead Director.\n\nAt the beginning of the year, the Committee examined the governance of the corporate purpose and how to integrate it into the Board's decision-making process and how to monitor its implementation. An action plan was presented to it in the last quarter of 2020 and will be regularly monitored by the GCSERC.",

        "page_content": "## Nomination\n\nThe  Committee  took  note  of  the  election,  by  the  Shareholders' Meeting  of  May  19,  2020,  of  Laurence  Dalboussi\u00e8re  as  Director representing  employee  shareholders,  to  replace  Philippe  Charry, whose term of office was due to expire, and of Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Sanchez, independent Director, replacing Charles-Henri Filippi, whose term of office was also due to expire. At this time, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Sanchez was asked to provide the Board with the benefit of his expertise and perspective  on  the  Innovation  and  Technology  Committee  (ITC) in order to observe its operation and suggest ways to improve or develop it, a subject that was among the recommendations resulting from the evaluation of the operation of the Board and its committees carried out at the end of 2019.\n\nOn  several  occasions,  the  Committee  has  had  to  vote  on  the appointment  of  the  new  Board  members  to  the  committees.  It first  recommended  to  the  Board  the  appointment  of  Laurence Dalboussi\u00e8re  and  Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric  Sanchez,  independent  Director,  as members of the Innovation and Technology Committee and then, the  appointment  of  Claire  Vernet-Garnier,  appointed  Director  by ministerial order of October 27, 2020 to replace H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Dantoine, as member of the Audit Committee. Finally, in a letter dated January 5, 2021, Bpifrance Participations informed the Chairman of the Board of  Directors  of  the  appointment  of  Thierry  Sommelet  as  its  new permanent representative to replace Nicolas Dufourcq. The GCSERC recommended to the Board his appointment to the ITC.\n\nIn  February  2021,  the  GCSERC  reviewed  the  conditions  for  the renewal of the office of legal entity Director Bpifrance Participations, whose term expires at the close of the Shareholders' Meeting of May 18, 2021.\n\nLastly, in accordance with another recommendation of the evaluation of the operation of the Board of Directors carried out at the end of 2019, the Committee, with the help of an external firm, undertook permanent monitoring work in order to regularly examine a list of Director  profiles  that  may  correspond  to  the  needs  of  the  Board and thus enable it to be ready for any necessary replacement. More specifically,  the  Committee  remains  attentive  to  any  profile  with expertise in the fields of innovation and technology, internationally where appropriate, and who is or has been a Senior Manager.\n\n## CSER, ethics, compliance\n\nThe Committee reviewed the strategy and important issues related to  the  Group's  corporate  social  and  environmental  responsibility policies. It examined the major achievements in this area in 2020. The Committee reported to the Board of Directors on its work on this subject.\n\nThe Committee was presented with a report on the progress of the rollout of the Group's corruption prevention program, in particular relating to the implementation of measures resulting from the French Law of December 9, 2016, known as the Sapin II Law, and from Government Order No. 2017-1180 of July 19, 2017 on the publication of non-financial information. The Committee examined notably the implementation of the Code of Conduct and the obligations regarding the Statement of Non-Financial Performance, and the rollout of the Group's  vigilance  plan.  The  Board  of  Directors  was  informed  on this matter.\n\nThe  Committee  also  examined  the  annual  report  on  ethics  and compliance  and  studied  the  Group-wide  actions  resulting  in the  implementation  of  the  ethics  and  compliance  program  (see Section  2.2  Activity and risk management framework).  It  also\n\nassessed the implementation of the vigilance plan and the obligations regarding the Statement of Non-Financial Performance.\n\nFinally,  as  part  of  the  periodic  review  of  the  Board's  work  (see Section  5.2.1.9  Periodic review of the operations of the Board of Directors and its committees),  the  Committee  continued  its discussions  on  the  development  and  monitoring  of  replacement plans for Corporate Officers.\n\n## Employment\n\nThe Committee monitored changes in the yearly indicators of the employee satisfaction survey. At its meeting of November 20, 2020, the  Committee  was  presented  with  a  detailed  annual  report  on workplace gender equality and equal pay at Orange, specifically covering the propor tion of women in the work force, an analysis of pay gaps, and the awareness and raising campaigns rolled out in 2020, and prepared the relevant Board discussions. The gender equality policy within the governing bodies was reviewed by the GCSERC and was the subject  of  a  recommendation  to  the  Board,  which, in  accordance with the new provisions of the Afep-Medef Code, determines the gender equality objectives within these bodies. This policy is supplemented by special attention paid to the percentage of women on the Boards of Directors of the Group's subsidiaries and to that of the specialized committees reporting to the Executive Committee.\n\n## Innovation and Technology Committee (ITC)\n\nThe  ITC  met  three  times  in  2020.  Its  meetings  had  a  collective attendance rate of 80%.\n\nThe  Committee  examined  an  update  on  Orange's  cyberdefense and security activities (B2B and B2C), was given a presentation of the Group's edge computing strategy and discussed the impacts of so-called Cloud Native networks such as that of mobile operator Rakuten in Japan.\n\n## Joint meeting of the Board Committees\n\nAt a joint meeting in September 2020, the members of the Audit Committee, the GCSERC and the ITC reviewed the effectiveness of the risk management system, with a review of 2020 and a focus on the Group's major risks, particularly from the point of view of the Group's security governance, the crisis situation linked to the pandemic, and competition between the United States and China, and its impact on supplies.\n\n## Special-purpose committee\n\nA special-purpose committee was created, as provided for in Article 5  of  the  Internal  Guidelines,  following  a  decision  of  the  Board  of Directors of October 28, 2019 concerning the auction process for 5G spectrum in France. It met several times during the year, chaired by the Chairman of the Audit Committee, and was able to closely monitor the procedure for allocating spectrum, alongside the General Management.\n\n## Strategic seminar\n\nAll  members of the Board of Directors met with the members of the Executive Committee for a strategic seminar on September 10, 2020. This meeting allowed the Directors to be presented with an initial impact of the health crisis on the organization of work and an update on the Group's financial position. The Directors also examined the topics relating to 5G, as well as the relevance of the objectives of the Engage 2025 plan in light of the lessons of the health crisis and the Group's development prospects.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5\n\n- 5",

Sanchez were elected Directors effective May 19, 2020.\n\n## 5.2.1.9 Periodic review of the operations of the Board of Directors and its committees\n\nThe  operating  procedures  of  the  Board  of  Directors  and  of  its committees are alternatively assessed internally via self-assessment, a s  w a s  t h e  c a s e  i n  2 0 18 ,  a n d  e x t e r n a l l y  w i t h  t h e  h e l p  o f  a n  i n d e p e n d e n t consultant, as was the case in 2019.\n\nAt the beginning of 2020, the GCSERC and then the Board were informed of the results of the assessment of the work of the Board and its committees, in which all Directors participated.\n\nDuring the GCSERC discussions, followed by those of the Board of Directors at its meeting of February 12, 2020, Directors expressed a very positive opinion about the operation of the Orange Board of Directors. A large majority of Directors are satisfied with the dynamic (quality of the interaction between the Directors and with members of management team) and the performance of the Board (quality of decisions made and how issues are managed). Directors believe that the governance bodies operate effectively and that the Board works in a collegial and cooperative fashion, in accordance with the best practice recommended by the Afep-Medef Code.\n\nAt the end of 2020, the GCSERC carried out an exercise to assess the  implementation  of  the  recommendations  made  during  this last  assessment.  A  number  of  the  recommendations  have  been addressed or are being addressed. Others were considered and it was decided not to implement them at this stage in view of the time constraints already imposed on Directors (organizing executive sessions for the Board and the Committees in particular). Lastly, some are faced with the current impossibility of implementing them given  the  health  crisis  (socializing,  meetings  outside  the  Board, international travel or site visits, etc.).\n\nThe main recommendations implemented or in the process of being implemented are:\n\n- -those relating to the renewal of the Board's skills and succession planning;\n\n- -those falling within the tasks and operation of the Innovation and Technology Committee (ITC);\n- -t h o s e  c o n c e r n i n g  t h e  t i m e  l i m i t s  o n  p r e s e n t a t i o n s  d u r i n g  m e e t i n g s to encourage more in-depth discussion, both in Board meetings and in strategic seminars.\n\nIn the course of 2021, the main recommendations that will be closely monitored by the GCSERC and the Board are:\n\n- -'Director watch' with the help of an external firm for half-yearly profile reviews;\n- -the implementation of the recommendations resulting from the ITC working party;\n- -the launch of a new cycle of assessment of the operation of the Board and the committees in mid-2021, which will take the form of a self-assessment by Directors, the principle adopted being the use of an external firm every three years.\n\n## 5.2.1.10 Description of the procedure for assessing ongoing agreements in place\n\nPursuant to Article L. 225-39 of the French Commercial Code as amended by the law of May 22, 2019 on the growth and transformation of companies (known as the PACTE law), the Boards of Directors of listed companies are required to implement a procedure to regularly assess  whether  agreements  relating  to  ongoing  operations  and entered into on an arm's length basis meet these conditions.\n\nOn December 3, 2019, the Orange SA Board of Directors adopted an internal procedure to assess whether the agreements concluded between (i) Orange SA and (ii) the Dire ctors and O f fi c e r s of O r a n g e S A or the public sector (including the French government, Bpifrance Participations, central government administrations and companies controll e d by t h e  g o v e r n m e n t )  o r  a n y  c o m p a n y  i n  w h i c h  a n  O r a n g e  S A Director or Officer holds a position, can continue to be described as agreements 'relating to ongoing operations concluded on an arm's length basis.",

        "page_content": "As part of the procedure, the Group Legal Department is responsible for (i) centralizing the recording of these freely negotiated agreements with  the  Legal  Departments  of  the  Orange  SA  divisions,  and (ii) carrying out a subsequent evaluation.\n\nThis  involves  assessing  agreements  prior  to  their  signature, agreements being classified on a case-by-case basis by the Legal Department  in  question,  with  the  support  of  the  Operational, Financial and Compliance Departments of the Group, on the basis of  cumulative  criteria  (the  operation  must  be  both  ongoing  and entered  into  on  an  arm's  length  basis),  and  a  re-examination  of these agreements is planned on an annual basis. An annual in-depth check is also carried out on material agreements to ensure that they continue to meet the criteria for ongoing and standard agreements at the level of Orange SA. Material agreements are those subject to\n\nsignificant commitments for Orange SA or decisions made in Group Investment Committees.\n\nA report on this procedure is presented annually to the Board of Directors for approval. The Board will examine the effectiveness of the procedure for evaluating standard agreements entered into on an arm's length basis within the Group.\n\nFor  the  year  ended  December  31,  2019,  the  above-mentioned report  established  that  the  agreements  identified,  subject  to  the procedure, could continue to be classified as ongoing agreements entered into on an arm's length basis. The report was presented to the Audit Committee on July 27, 2020 and was approved by the Board of Directors on July 29, 2020 on the recommendation of the Audit Committee. Its review led to the conclusion that the internal procedure was ef fective and that it was implemented under the same conditions in 2020.\n\n## 5.2.2 Operation of the General Management\n\n## 5.2.2.1 Form of exercise of the General Management\n\nOn February 23, 2011, the Board of Directors decided to combine the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and to appoint St\u00e9phane  Richard  as  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors  with responsibility  for  the  General  Management  of  the  Company.  It considered this management structure to be the most appropriate for the Company's organization and operation because it allows the General Management to benefit from his business knowledge and experience in order to bring forward and defend the Company's s t r a t e g y,  a n d  b y  p r o v i d i n g  g r e a t e r  t r a n s p a r e n c y  b e t w e e n  t h e  G e n e r a l Management and the Board of  Directors,  allows  coordination  of operations  within  the  Group  and  agile  decision-making  to  be optimized.\n\nIn this context, with an Executive Committee (see 5.2.2.3 Executive Committee and Group governance committees), thanks on the one hand to the presence of two Delegate CEOs with defined areas of expertise alongside the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and on the other hand a Lead Director with significant roles and powers, as well as the presence of seven independent Directors and frequent meetings of the Board of Directors (twelve meetings in 2020) and its  committees, Orange has ensured the existence of the means to  guarantee  robust  governance  that  focuses  on  efficiency  and performance while ensuring a balance of power. In addition, each of the three committees of the Board of Directors (Audit Committee, GCSER Committee and ITC Committee) is chaired by an independent Director. During the assessment process carried out at the end of 2019, and as with previous assessments, Directors were individually consulted.  They  expressed  the  view  that  combining  the  roles  of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  was  the  most  appropriate given the Company's position.\n\n## 5.2.2.2 Limits set on the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer's powers\n\nThe Chairman and Chief Executive Officer is invested with extensive powers to act in the Company's name. He exercises his powers within the limits of the corporate scope and subject to those powers that the law and Internal Guidelines of the Board of Directors expressly attribute to him. He is supported in this task by the Delegate Chief Executive Officers and the Executive Committee.\n\nArticle 2 of the Internal Guidelines of the Board of Directors provides that the Chairman and CEO must obtain the Board's prior authorization before committing the Company to:\n\n- -investments  or  divestments  exceeding  200  million  euros  per transaction  falling  within  the  consolidation  scope,  and  when the  total  consolidated  exposure  exceeds  the  Board's  prior authorization for such an investment; or\n- -any new investment (excluding acquisitions of telecom spectrum) under the Group's major multi-annual technology programs in its  main  geographies (such as FTTH, 5G, etc.) in an average amount per annum exceeding 2.5% of the Group's investments budgeted during the year in question.\n\nIn  addition,  acquisitions  of  telecom  spectrum  by  the  Group  in geographies representing at least 10% of consolidated revenue are subject to prior presentation to the Board of Directors, which will set a maximum amount that can be bid at auction.\n\nInvestments or divestments remain, as the case may be, subject to independent review by the governing bodies of the subsidiaries in question.\n\nFurthermore,  any  investment  or  divestment  that  falls  outside  the s c o p e  o f  t h e  C o m p a n y 's  s t r a t e g y  a n d  i n v o l v e s  a  t r a n s a c t i o n  i n  e x c e s s of 20 million euros must first be approved by the Board of Directors. Where relevant, the Board of Directors must be kept informed of any significant new developments regarding such transactions.\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer must also obtain the authorization of the Board of Directors annually, within ceilings determined by it, to carry out the issue by the Company of bonds or similar securities or arrange syndicated bank loans.\n\n## 5.2.2.3 Executive Committee and Group governance committees\n\nThe  Executive  Committee,  under  the  authority  of  the  Chairman and CEO, is responsible for managing the Group and coordinating the implementation of its strategy. It oversees the achievement of operational, employee-related and technical objectives, as well as of those relating to the allocation of financial resources. Its meetings are generally held weekly. Its composition is set out in Section 5.1.3.\n\nSt\u00e9phane Richard has delegated a series of powers and signing authorit y to e a c h  m e m b e r  o f  t h e  E x e c u t i v e  C o m m i t t e e ,  e a c h  o f  w h o m has applied them in their respective area of expertise.\n\nSeveral  specialized  committees  reporting  to  the  Executive Committee were created to apply or oversee the implementation of its directives throughout the Group. The main committees that support Group governance are the Group Investment Committee, the  Treasury  and  Financing  Committee,  the  Tax  Committee,  the Claims and Commitments Committee, the Risks Committee, the Employment and Skills Committee and the Disclosure Committee. Each committee has adopted Internal Guidelines or a charter defining their operating and deliberation procedures. These committees are also  responsible  for  monitoring  risk  management  with  regard  to financial liabilities, thereby helping limit the Group's overall exposure.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 5\n\n5",

The  Internal  Guidelines  of  this  Committee  (terms  of  reference) evolved in March 2020. Its role is to review projects implying financial commitments, off-balance  sheet  commitments  and  non-financial i mplications for the Group, also focusing on value creation. O ther than in extraordinary circumstances, the Committee has decision-making authority on investment projects in IT and service platforms exceeding 10 million euros as well as bids in response to calls for tender on the  Enterprise  market  whose  financing  needs  exceed  10  million euros, and on other investment projects exceeding 50 million euros (including implied operating expenses). It also rules on mergers and asset disposals, and the financing needs of subsidiaries in the event of an increase in the Group's financial exposure. This Committee meets as often as it deems necessary and in general once a week.\n\nThe Treasury and Financing Committee, chaired by the Delegate CEO, Executive Director Finance, Performance and Development, sets the guidelines for managing the Group's debt and financing on a quarterly basis, especially in respect of its liquidity, interest rate, exchange rate and counterparty risks.

It met four times in 2020.\n\nThe Tax Committee is  chaired  by  the Delegate  CEO,  Executive Director  Finance,  Performance  and  Development.  Its  role  is  to review the major tax issues in order to determine their accounting consequences, if any. The materiality threshold for tax matters that must be submitted to the Tax Committee is 10 million euros. This Committee meets twice a year. However, the Committee may hold special meetings to assess and approve the tax options to be taken on  issues  that  are  particularly  important  for  the  Group.  The  Tax Committee met twice in 2020.\n\nThe Claims and Commitments Committee, which is chaired by the General Secretariat, examines the Group's significant disputes and contractual commitments to ensure that the related risks are taken into account as necessary in the form of accounting provisions. The Committee's role also includes approving the information in the notes to the financial statements on significant disputes. The Committee met six times in 2020.\n\nThe Risks Committee, which operates under the authority of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, is chaired by the Delegate CEO, Executive Director Finance, Performance and Development. It  is  made  up  of  members  of  the  Executive  Committee,  eleven of  whom  are  permanent  members.  The  Committee's  role  is  to review the Group's principal risks and to propose to the Executive Committee all decisions regarding risk management and the quality of internal control, as well as to assist the General Management in its risk management reporting to the Audit Committee and Board of Directors. To that end, the Committee validates the risk mapping, validates and monitors the execution of the annual internal audit program and ensures the monitoring of the implementation of audit recommendations and corrective action plans. It monitors fraud and corruption prevention programs and reviews identified cases during meetings with the Lead Director. It is also informed of the main work on i n t e r n a l  c o n t r o l ,  a n d  e n s u r e s  t h e  c o n s i s t e n c y  o f  t h e  i n t e r n a l  c o n t r o l\n\nand internal audit plans with the risk management objectives. The Committee met five times in 2020.\n\nThe Employment and Skills Committee, under the authority of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, is chaired by delegation by the Delegate CEO, People & Group Transformation. It is made up of members of the Executive Committee or, by delegation, their representatives. The Committee plays a key role in implementing the Group's employment policy. The Employment and Skills Committee examines restructuring projects that may have a significant effect on jobs and skills, and job outlook and changes in the Group's business lines, divisions and countries. It also looks at all plans for external hires in France. It also issues recommendations on each candidate presented. The Committee meets several times a month.\n\nThe Disclosure Committee operates  under  the  authority  of  the Delegate  CEO,  Executive  Director  Finance,  Performance  and Development.  It  is  chaired,  by  delegation,  by  the  Group  Chief Accounting Officer,  and  includes  the  relevant  Department  heads within  the  accounting,  legal,  internal  audit,  management  control, investor  relations  and  communications fields.  It  ensures  integrity, accuracy, and compliance with applicable laws and regulations and recognized practices, and ensures the consistency and quality of the Group's financial information. It carries out this mission within the procedural framework for the preparation and validation of financial information as defined by the Group. Accordingly, it examines all financial  disclosures  made  by  the  Company:  the  Consolidated Financial Statements, the annual and half-yearly financial reports, the Registration Document (now called the Universal Registration Document) filed with the AMF, the US Annual Report (Form 20-F) filed with the SEC, as well as any press releases containing financial information and presentations to institutional investors. In addition, the  Committee  looks  at  financial  communication  issued  by  the principal listed subsidiaries. It met sixteen times in 2020.\n\nFurthermore,  in  terms  of  the  Group's  governance,  the  following committees  help  guide  strategy  in  the  area  of  non-financial performance and diversity at Orange.\n\nThe Group Ethics Committee deals  with  issues  of  compliance, ethics  and  social  responsibility  at  Orange.  It  is  made  up  of  six members of the Executive Committee, the Group's Inspector General and the Chief Compliance Officer. During a meeting in July 2019, the decision was made to expand its role to steering non-financial performance. It now reviews, notably, the Statement of Non-Financial Performance (SNFP) and the Orange group vigilance plan, which are included in the Management Report presented to the Shareholders' Meeting. The Group Ethics Committee met twice in 2020.\n\nThe  Professional  Equality  Strategy  Committee, created  in 2011, guides Orange's policy in the area of gender equality in the workplace. It is made up of members of the Executive Committee as well as individuals representing the Group's entities, and is led by the Group's Diversit y and Inclusion Depar tment. This commit tee sets the main lines of the policy for gender equality in the workplace, focusing on four main areas: equal pay, women's access to management positions,  balanced  gender  representation  in  all  of  the  Group's business  areas  including  technical  fields,  and  work-life  balance. As  such,  since  2020,  the  Committee  has  been  informed  of  the implementation of the global agreement on gender equality, the fight against discrimination and violence, and work-life balance, which was signed with UNI global union on July 17, 2019. The Professional Equality Strategy Committee met three times in 2020.",

        "page_content": "## 5.3 Reference to a Code of Corporate Governance\n\nOrange refers to the Afep-Medef Corporate Governance Code for listed companies revised in January 2020, which may be consulted on the Orange, Afep and Medef websites. The Company hereby\n\ndeclares that it complies with the recommendations of the AfepMedef Code as of the date of this document.\n\n## Main differences with the rules of the New York Stock Exchange\n\nOrange  has  endeavored  to  take  the  New  York  Stock  Exchange (NYSE) Corporate Governance rules into account. However, since the Company is not a US company, most of these rules do not apply to it, and the Company is allowed to follow the rules applicable in France instead. Accordingly, Orange has elected to refer to the AfepMedef Code, where the recommendations differ in some respects\n\nfrom the NYSE governance rules applicable to US companies listed on the NYSE.\n\nThe  main  differences  between  Orange's  practices  and  the  rules applicable to US companies are described in Orange's annual report (Form 20-F) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission of the United States.\n\n## 5.4 Compensation and benefits paid to Directors, Officers and Senior Management\n\n## 5.4.1 Report of the Board of Directors on compensation and benefits paid to Corporate Officers\n\nThe  Company  refers  in  general,  and  in  particular  with  regard  to compensation, to the Afep-Medef Corporate Governance Code for listed companies in its revised version of January 29, 2020.\n\nThis report presents the itemized total compensation and benefits of any kind paid to Directors and Officers during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, or awarded in respect of that same fiscal year as well as the policy regarding the compensation of Directors and Corporate Officers for their offices, pursuant to Article L. 225-37-2 I of the French Commercial Code.\n\nThis  report  was  prepared  under  the  aegis  of  the  Governance and Corporate Social and Environmental Responsibility (GCSER) Committee.\n\n## 5.4.1.1 Compensation policy for Corporate Officers\n\nOrange  aims  to  define  and  implement  a  balanced  and  socially equitable compensation policy for its Corporate Officers.\n\nThe executive compensation policy is consistent with the Group's strategy. It is not only a management tool for attracting, motivating, and retaining the talent the Company needs, but also meets the expectations of shareholders and other stakeholders, particularly in  terms  of  transparency,  performance  and  respect  for  CSR commitments.\n\nAll compensation and benefits are analyzed by item, then overall, to  obtain  the  appropriate  balances  between  fixed  and  variable, individual and collective, and short- and long-term compensation.\n\nOrange ensures that the criteria governing the annual and multi-year variable  components for  the  Corporate  Officers  are  aligned  with those for all the Company's Senior Management.\n\nThe compensation policy for Corporate Officers is set by the Board of Directors on the recommendation of the GCSERC.\n\n## Governance\n\nThe general principles and criteria for the compensation of Corporate Officers and the assessment thereof are prepared and examined by the GCSERC, which then makes recommendations to the Board of Directors for decision.\n\nThe GCSERC may use external benchmarks to assess the levels of  compensation  of  Corporate  Officers.  In  this  respect,  surveys are regularly used in order to ensure that compensation levels and structures  are  competitive  in  relation  to  a  panel  of  comparable companies, including companies based in France and internationally that are competitors of the Group in telecommunications, as well as service companies, some of which have a government shareholder.\n\nThe GCSERC listens to obser vations and requests made by investors and makes a point of taking them into account, while maintaining a consistent compensation policy, subject to the constraints imposed by the confidentiality of the information published.\n\nFinally,  the  GCSERC  ensures  the  consistency  of  compensation policies  for  Corporate  Officers  and  other  Senior  Management members  of  the  Company  with  regard  to  the  annual  variable compensation  and  the  grant  of  performance  shares,  and  more generally the balance of compensation packages within Orange with the analysis of changes in equity ratios.\n\nThe GCSERC defines, at the end of the prior year, the structure of Corporate Officer compensation and at the start of the current year sets the targets and criteria governing variable compensation packages,  in  line  with  the  Group's  strategy  and  the  contribution demanded from Corporate Officers.\n\nIn  2020,  the  GCSERC examined the compensation of Corporate Officers in five meetings.\n\nThe issue of the compensation of Corporate Officers was dealt with during four meetings of the Board of Directors in 2020. Corporate Officers do not participate in the discussions of the Board of Directors about their own pay.\n\n- 5\n\n5",

Each of these items is more fully detailed below.\n\n## Fixed compensation\n\nFixed compensation of Corporate Officers is based on:\n\n- -the importance and complexity of their responsibilities;\n- -the experience and background of the people holding the various positions; and\n- -market analysis for comparable positions.\n\n## Annual variable compensation\n\nThe purpose of annual variable compensation is to inspire Corporate Of fi c e r s  t o  a c h i e v e  t h e  a n n u a l  p e r f o r m a n c e  t a r g e t s  s e t  f o r  t h e m  b y  t h e Board of Directors, in line with the Company's strategy. Pursuant to the Afep-Medef Code, the potential amount of variable compensation is expressed as a percentage of fixed compensation.\n\nThis  variable  compensation  depends  on  performance  levels applied to the financial (50%) and non-financial (50%) parameters representing the overall performance expected. The entire variable compensation is determined on the basis of precise targets, most importantly a quantitative performance measurement, including for non-financial indicators.\n\n## Multi-year variable compensation\n\nIn 2015 and 2016, Corporate Officers benefited from two conditional multi-year variable compensation plans (LTIP) in cash (LTIP 2015-2017 and LTIP 2016-2018).\n\nSince 2017, the Board of Directors has decided to modify the LTIP scheme  as  a  further  means  of  retaining  Corporate  Officers  and aligning their interests with the interests of the Company and the shareholders. In line with market practices, the scheme is based on a performance share allocation plan and criteria that recognize the officers' direct contribution to the Company's overall long-term performance. Employees holding key positions within the Orange group are also eligible for the scheme.\n\n## Exceptional compensation\n\nUntil  2018,  the  Board of Directors applied the principle by which certain Corporate Officers were paid exceptional compensation in\n\ncertain circumstances that was disclosed in detail, with supporting documentation,  subject  however  to  the  shareholders'  approval. Since this option was not used in 2018 or in prior years, the Board of Directors decided, for the sake of transparency, that this provision could no longer be used from 2019.\n\n## Directors' fees\n\nCorporate officers do not receive Directors' compensation (formerly 'Directors' fees') for the duties and offices carried out in the Group's companies.\n\n## Plans related to termination of service\n\nThere is no compensation or benefit due or likely to be due because of  the  termination  or  change  of  office  of  Corporate  Officers,  nor any commitment to pay any compensation in consideration for a non-competition clause.\n\nHowever, if a Corporate Officer is appointed via external hiring, the Board of Directors reserves the right to apply such provisions in keeping with the law and in compliance with the Afep-Medef Code.\n\n## Supplemental retirement plan\n\nCorporate officers do not benefit from any supplemental retirement plan for their services in addition to the basic and supplementary pension plans required by law.\n\nIf,  before the Officer took up office, he or she was eligible for the defined-benefit retirement plan set up for employees classified as 'off the matrix' (a plan that was canceled for people recruited from 2011), th at p l a n's  c o v e r a g e  i s  s u s p e n d e d ,  a n d  n o  r i g h t s  a r e  g e n e r a t e d during the term of office.\n\n## Benefits in kind\n\nCorporate Of ficers are provided, if they so desire, with a company car with driver, consulting services providing personal legal assistance related to their duties, an annual health check, Internet or telephone access, and equipment, including IT equipment, necessary for the performance of their duties.\n\n## Miscellaneous\n\nThe Chairman and CEO as well as the Delegate CEOs are enrolled in the Orange group's death and disability and supplemental health insurance plans, which are applicable to Corporate Officers (see Section  6.7  Statutory Auditors' Special Report on related-party agreements).",

Ramon  Fernandez and  Gervais  Pellissier  each  received  variable  compensation  of 278,280 euros in respect of the same fiscal year.\n\nFor 2020, St\u00e9phane Richard was entitled to variable compensation of 80% of his annual fixed compensation, subject to the achievement of targets, and up to 100% for out-performance.\n\nFor 2020, Ramon Fernandez and Ger vais Pellissier were each entitled to  variable  compensation, subject to the achievement of targets, capped at 60% of their annual fixed compensation.\n\n## Reminder of targets and results achieved for 2020\n\nIn 2020, the annual variable compensation of the Corporate Officers was based on the weighted average of five indicators emphasizing the  Group's  growth,  its  profitability,  customer  experience,  and performance on employee-related issues. The expected performance levels were set by the Board of Directors, with financial indicators based on the Group's budget.\n\nFor the calculation of the achievement rate, an elasticity curve is constructed so that a rate reflecting the level of achievement can be assigned for each indicator.\n\n## Revenue growth (for 15%)\n\nThe  revenue  growth  target  (on  a  comparable  basis)  set  for  the Corporate Officers for 2020 was in line with the Group's budget. With change of 0.3%, the elasticity curve puts the achievement rate of this indicator at 0% for St\u00e9phane Richard, Ramon Fernandez and Gervais Pellissier.\n\n## Organic cash flow (telecom activities) (for 15%)\n\nThe  organic  cash  flow  target  set  for  the  Corporate  Officers  for 2020 was in line with the Group's budget. With organic cash flow of 2,494 million euros, the elasticity curve puts the achievement rate of this indicator at 119.7% for St\u00e9phane Richard, Ramon Fernandez and Gervais Pellissier.\n\n## EBITDAaL (for 20%)\n\nthe elasticity curve puts the achievement rate of this indicator at 0% for St\u00e9phane Richard, Ramon Fernandez and Gervais Pellissier.\n\n## Customer experience (for 17%)\n\nThe  customer  experience  indicator  is  broken  down  into  two sub-indicators: a mass-market customer experience indicator (B2C customer survey), which accounts for 75% of the result, and a global B2B customer experience indicator (B2B customer survey) for 25%.\n\nThe B2C and B2B sub-indicators are mean recommendation scores (MRS) given by customers. These surveys are conducted in several countries: in France, in the Europe region as well as the MEA region, and with the B2B customers of Orange Business Services.\n\nIn 2020, the target for the B2C indicator was 81.3; the actual figure was  81.3.  For  the  B2B  indicator,  the  target  was  7.57;  the  actual figure was 7.73.\n\nThe elasticity curve applied to the B2C indicator puts the achievement rate  of  this  indicator  at  100%  for  St\u00e9phane  Richard,  Ramon Fernandez and Gervais Pellissier. The elasticity curve applied to the B2B indicator puts the achievement rate of this indicator at 110% for St\u00e9phane Richard, Ramon Fernandez and Gervais Pellissier.\n\n## Performance on employee-related issues (for 33%)\n\nThe  aim  was  to  achieve  overall  progress  in  the  indicator's  six components:\n\n- -three  relate  to  the  result  of  the  employee  survey,  which  is conducted  on  an  annual  basis  by  an  external  body,  with  a weighting of 70%. Results are reviewed based on the employees' perceptions in connection with the three themes: skills, collective agility, commitment;\n- -three  relate  to  changes  in  HR  indicators,  with  a  weighting  of 30%: the learner Net Promoter Score (NPS), the frequency rate of  occupational  accidents  and  the  percentage  of  women  in management networks.\n\nThe result for each component is measured in the following way:\n\n- -target not achieved: result of -1;\n- -target achieved: result of 0;\n- -target exceeded: result of +1.\n\nAll three items in the employee survey improved in relation to 2019. The result was assessed at +3.\n\nThe learner NPS and the percentage of women in the management net works are on target. T he f re q u e n c y r a te  o f  o c c u p a t i o n a l  a c c i d e n t s , for its part, exceeded the target. The result was assessed at +1.\n\nThe EBITDAaL target set for the Corporate Officers for 2020 was in line with the Group's budget. With EBITDAaL of 12,680 million euros,\n\n| Criterion       | 2020 employee experience results   | 2020 employee experience results   | 2020 employee experience results   | Scoring                                                       |\n|-----------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                 | Minimum                            | Actual                             | Maximum                            |                                                               |\n| Employee survey | -3                                 | 3                                  | 3                                  | Delegate CEOs 70%;  Chairman and CEO 87,5% Delegate CEOs 30%; |\n| HR indicators   | -3                                 | 1                                  | 3                                  | Chairman and CEO 32,5%                                        |\n| Total           |                                    |                                    |                                    | Delegate CEOs 100%;  Chairman and CEO 120%                    |\n\nThe elasticity curve puts the achievement rate of this indicator at 120% for St\u00e9phane Richard, and 100% for Ramon Fernandez and Gervais Pellissier.",

of May 19, 2020.\n\n## Results of the LTIP 2018-2020\n\nThe performance conditions of this plan are measured using the following two indicators:\n\n- -comparative change between the Orange Total Shareholder Return (TSR) and the TSR of the Stoxx Europe 600 Telecommunications index over the duration of the plan for 50%;\n- -organic cash flow (telecom activities), as defined by the plan, measured over three fiscal years and compared annually with the budget forecast for 50%.\n\nThe  result  is  adjusted  in  accordance  with  five  criteria  based  on the Essentials2020 strategic plan: adjusted EBITDA, diversification revenue, average mobile and fixed data speed, mobile brand power and the net promotor score (NPS). Each criterion is scored +3% if the target is achieved and -3% if not.\n\nTotal Shareholder Return (TSR)\n\nThe TSR was not met for the 2018-2020 period. Orange's TSR was -21.369%, below that of the Stoxx Europe 600 Telecommunications index, which was -16.964%. This gives a valuation of 0%.\n\nOrganic cash flow, as defined by the plan\n\nThe target was achieved for 2019 and 2020, and not achieved for 2018. This gives a valuation of 33.33%.\n\nAdjustment criteria\n\nThe  combined  results  of  the  five  adjustment  criteria  give  a  total result of -9%:\n\n| Criterion                    | Weight-ing   | Result       | Scoring   | Targets                                                              |\n|------------------------------|--------------|--------------|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Diversification revenue      | 3.00%        | not achieved | -3.00%    | 1.3 billion euros mobile speeds: 35 Mps fixed                        |\n| Mobile and fixed data speeds | 3.00%        | achieved     | 3.00%     | speeds: 84 Mps                                                       |\n| Brand power                  | 3.00%        | not achieved | -3.00%    | increase in at least 2/3 of countries leader on 75% of customer base |\n| NPS                          | 3.00%        | not achieved | -3.00%    | increase in at least 2/3 of countries leader on 75% of customer base |\n| Adjusted EBITDA  (1)         | 3.00%        | not achieved | -3.00%    | three-year budget achieved                                           |\n| Total adjustment             |              |              | -9%       |                                                                      |\n\n- (1) Transition from adjusted EBITDA to EBITDAaL in 2019.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 5\n\n5",

A resolution on this free share allocation plan will be submitted for approval by the Shareholders' Meeting of May 18, 2021, to authorize the Board of Directors to award free shares to Corporate Officers and to certain staff members holding key positions within the Group (see Section 6.5 Draft resolutions, thirty-first resolution).\n\nThe use of a long-term cash incentive scheme may again be considered in the future if regulatory changes or any other circumstances were to make it difficult or impossible for the Company to use a performance share-based  scheme.  Similarly,  if  the  Shareholders'  Meeting  of May 18, 2021 does not approve the thirty-first resolution, the Board of  Directors  may  decide  to  pay  sums  due  in  respect  of  the  LTIP 2021-2023 in cash.\n\n## Performance indicators\n\nThe Board of Directors has selected the following indicators for the new LTIP, which still has a term of three years:\n\n- -a market indicator, the Total Shareholder Return (TSR) based on the relative performance over three fiscal years compared with the Stoxx Europe 600 Telecommunications index, with a weighting of 30%;\n\n- -organic cash flow (telecom activities), whose grow th is measured on a multi-year basis over the term of the plan, with a weighting of 50%;\n- -a composite CSR indicator, with a weighting of 20%, made up of the following criteria:\n- -reduction in CO2 emissions (10%),\n- -percentage of women in management networks (10%).\n\n## Performance conditions\n\n- -organic cash flow (telecom activities):\n- -organic  cash  flow  will  be  assessed  over  the  plan  period against the target set by the Board of Directors,\n- -if the result is below 95% of the target: no award,\n- -i f  t h e  r e s u l t  i s  e q u a l  t o  o r  a b o v e  t h e  t a r g e t :  10 0 %  o f  t h e  a w a r d ,\n- -straight-line variation between 80% and 100% between the two previous limits,\n\n## -T S R :\n\n- -if the Orange TSR is equal to or greater than the change in the Stoxx Europe 600 Telecommunications index over the pl a n  p e r i o d :  10 0 %  o f  t h e  a w a r d .  H o w e v e r,  s h o u l d  t h e  O r a n g e TSR reach the target but be negative, the result would be submitted to the Board of Directors for approval,\n- -if the change in Orange TSR is below that of the index: no award;\n- -composite CSR indicator, for each CSR criterion:\n- -if the result is lower than the target defined by the Board of Directors: no award,\n- -i f  t h e  r e s u l t  i s  a b o v e  o r  e q u a l  t o  t h e  t a r g e t :  10 0 %  o f  t h e  a w a r d .\n\n## Condition of continued employment\n\nThe vesting of shares is subject to the condition that the Corporate Officers are still in office on the date of the definitive assessment of the performance conditions for the vesting period.",

Compensation  allocated  to  Directors representing the government will be paid to the government budget. In addition, the Directors elected by the employees have requested that their compensation be paid to their trade union.\n\n| Compensation for activity  (in euros)   | Gross amounts  paid in 2021

The resolution approved remains valid until a new decision is made by the Shareholders' Meeting. The Shareholders' Meeting of May 27, 2014 set this amount at 750,000 euros, due in particular to the increased work of the Board's committees.\n\nWithin  the  limit  decided  by  the  Shareholders'  Meeting,  and on  a  proposal  from  the  Governance  and  Corporate  Social  and Environmental Responsibility Committee (GCSERC), the Board of Directors sets the compensation policy for non-executive Directors for the current year at the beginning of each fiscal year. These items are then submitted to the Shareholders' Meeting for approval.\n\nAt  its  meeting  of  February  17,  2021,  the  Board  of  Directors  set the compensation policy for non-executive Directors. It decided to renew, for 2021, the allocation rules and methods for calculating fixed compensation for 2020, namely:\n\n- -a fixed amount of 10,000 euros per Director per year calculated pro rata temporis where applicable;\n- -an amount directly related to attendance and participation in the work of the Board and its committees, namely:\n- -2,000 euros per meeting of the Board of Directors and the Strategic Seminar,\n- -2,000  euros  per  meeting  of  the  Audit  Committee,  the GCSERC and the Innovation and Technology Committee,\n- -1,000  euros  additional  per  Committee  meeting  for  the Chairmen of the Committees.\n\nIn addition, the Internal Guidelines of the Board of Directors provide for:\n\n- -the creation of ad hoc committees, when the Board of Directors decides to assign, on an exceptional basis, a task to one (or several)  of  its  members  or  one  (or  several)  third  parties,  with the Board of Directors deciding the main characteristics of this task (Article 5);\n- -the appointment by the Board of Directors, on the proposal of the GCSERC, of a Lead Director from among the independent Directors (Article 10).\n\nIn this context, it is recommended that the following scale be used:\n\n- -a fixed amount, decided by the Board of Directors during the creation of an ad hoc committee, pursuant to Article 5 of the Internal Guidelines of the Board, taking into account in particular the nature and duration of the committee's assignment and the time needed to complete it;\n\n- -a fixed amount of 15,000 euros per year for the Lead Director for his or her assignment.\n\nIt is specified that the compensation of the members of the ad hoc committee, where applicable, or of the Lead Director, can be paid in the same form as the compensation allocated to Directors (Directors' fees), and in these two cases under the same conditions relating to any maximum amount and reductions applying to sums allocated under non-executive Director compensation.\n\nT h e  D i r e c t o r s  e l e c t e d  b y  t h e  e m p l o y e e s  a n d  t h e  D i r e c t o r s  r e p r e s e n t i n g employee  shareholders  receive  compensation  for  their  activities under the same conditions and in the same manner as any other non-executive Director.\n\n## 5.4.2.3 Other  compensation\n\nThe following table sets out the compensation paid to the Directors elected by the employees and the Directors representing employee shareholders, excluding compensation for their activities as nonexecutive Directors (already mentioned above).\n\n| Gross amounts  (in euros)   | Amounts  paid in  2020   | Amounts  paid in 2019   |\n|-----------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Philippe Charry  (1)        | 45,038                   | 55,894                  |\n| S\u00e9bastien Crozier           | 208,993                  | 207,312                 |\n| Laurence Dalboussi\u00e8re  (2)  | 51,139                   | N/A                     |\n| Fabrice Jolys               | 41,456                   | 41,242                  |\n| Luc Marino  (3)             | N/A                      | 33,173                  |\n| Ren\u00e9 Ollier                 | 37,378                   | 37,308                  |\n\n- (2) As of May 2020.\n\nT h e  d i r e c t o r s  e l e c t e d  b y  t h e  e m p l o y e e s  a n d  t h e  d i r e c t o r s  r e p r e s e n t i n g employee shareholders are employed by Orange SA as civil servants or private company employees contractually covered by the national telecommunication  collective  bargaining  agreement.

The LTIP 2017-2019 allows for 14,000 shares to be awarded to the Deputy CEOs and 10,000 shares to the Senior Executive  Vice-Presidents.

See Note 13.4 TDIRAs to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Potential issuance of new shares\n\nThe table below shows the number of new shares that would be issued if all securities giving access to the capital outstanding at December 31, 2020 were converted or redeemed in shares and all stock options existing on the same date were exercised, as well as the number of shares that would comprise the Company's capital following the issuance of such shares.\n\n|                                            | Corresponding shares   |   % of the capital   (on a fully   diluted basis) |\n|--------------------------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| Perpetual bonds redeemable for shares  (1) | 26,506,128             |                                              0.99 |\n| Share subscription options  (2)            | 0                      |                                              0    |\n| Subtotal                                   | 26,506,128             |                                              0.99 |\n| Capital at December 31, 2020               | 2,660,056,599          |                                             99.01 |\n| Total                                      | 2,686,562,727          |                                            100    |\n\n- (2)  See Section 5.4.1.2 History of stock-option grants (table No.8) and Note 7.3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nNote  15.7  Earnings per share  to  the  Consolidated  Financial Statements (Section 3.3) presents the weighted average number\n\nof outstanding and dilutive shares, calculated in accordance with IAS 33 Earnings per share.\n\n## 6.1.3 Authorizations to carry out capital increases\n\nThe Orange SA Shareholders' Meeting of May 21, 2019 approved various  financial  authorizations  that  delegated  to  the  Board  of Directors  the  authority  to  increase  the  capital  of  the  Company by  issuing  shares  or  other  securities,  with  or  without  preferential subscription rights (public offering, contribution of securities, etc.) and subject to cer tain c o n d i t i o n s  (o u t s i d e  t h e  p e r i o d s  o f  p u b l i c  t e n d e r offers for the Company's securities, ceilings, etc.).\n\nCurrent  delegations  granted  to  the  Board  of  Directors  by  the Shareholders' Meeting in terms of capital increases and the use made of these delegations are mentioned in Section 6.6 Report of the Board of Directors on the resolutions.\n\nThe Shareholders' Meeting of May 18, 2021 will once again be asked to authorize the Board of Directors to carry out capital increases (see Section 6.6 Report of the Board of Directors on the resolutions).\n\nThe Orange SA Shareholders' Meeting also delegated authority to the Board of Directors to carry out capital increases reserved for members of the Group savings plan.\n\n## 6.1.4 Treasury shares - Share Buyback program\n\nThe  Shareholders'  Meeting  of  May  21,  2019  renewed  the  share Buyback program for 18 months within a limit of 10% of the share capital outstanding at the date of this Meeting. On February 17, 2021 the Board of Directors resolved to ask the Shareholders' Meeting of May 18, 2021 to renew this authorization under the same conditions.\n\nA description of the program for 2021 appears in the Report of the Board of Directors on the eighteenth resolution submitted to the Shareholders' Meeting of May 18, 2021 (see Section 6.6 Report of the Board of Directors on the resolutions).\n\nIn the context of French Financial Markets Authority (Autorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s financiers - AMF) decision no. 2018-01 of July 2, 2018, Orange and Rothschild Martin Maurel entered into a new liquidity contract on February 11, 2019, replacing the contract executed in May 2007.

R\u00e9gions.\n- (2) Includes shares held as part of the Group savings plan, in particular through the Orange Actions and Orange Ambition International mutual funds, or directly by employees in registered form.\n\nThe public sector (the French State and Bpifrance Participations) and  the Orange Actions  mutual  fund  of  the  Group  savings  plan invested in Orange shares have double voting rights for their shares held in registered form for over two years (see Section 6.4.1 Rights, preferences and restrictions attached to shares).\n\nThe  French  State  and  Bpifrance  Participations  hold  in  concert 22.95% of the capital and 29.43% of voting rights at Shareholders' Meetings, taking into consideration the double voting rights.\n\nAt December 31, 2020, the mutual funds of the Group savings plan invested in  Orange shares represented 5.66% of the Company's capital and 8.96% of voting rights at Shareholders' Meetings. The regulations  governing  the  mutual  funds  state  that  voting  rights attached  to  securities  held  as  fund  assets  are  exercised  by  the Supervisory Boards of these funds. In the absence of an express reference  in  the  regulations  to  the  cases  where  the  Supervisory Boards must gather the prior opinions of unit holders, the Supervisory Boards decide on the tender of securities held as fund assets to public tender or exchange offers, in accordance with Article L. 214-164 of the French Monetary and Financial Code.\n\nAs  of  the  date  of  this  document,  to  Orange's  knowledge,  no shareholder other than the French State, Bpifrance Participations and Group employees (in particular via the Orange Actions mutual fund) held, directly or indirectly, more than 5% of the capital or voting rights.\n\n## 6.2.1.1 Changes in the distribution of capital held by major shareholders over the last three fiscal years\n\nIn  the  last  three  fiscal  years,  the  Company  has  bought  and  sold treasury shares, and notably purchased 300,000 treasury shares in September 2020 as part of its 2020 share Buyback program (see Section 6.1.4 Treasury shares - Share Buyback program). These purchases are intended to honor obligations related to long-term incentive  plans  for  Corporate  Officers  and  members  of  Senior Management (LTIP).  To  Orange's  knowledge,  there  has  been  no major change in the distribution of capital and voting rights since December 31, 2020.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 6\n\n6",

        "page_content": "6 -\n\n## 6.2.1.2 Information on shareholders' agreements\n\nOn  February  23,  2016,  the  French  Financial  Markets  Authority (Autorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s financiers - AMF ) was notified of the execution, on February 18, 2016, of a new shareholders' agreement between the French Republic and Bpifrance Participations. This agreement replaces the previous shareholders' agreement signed between the same parties on December 24, 2012, formalizing the existing concert action between them with respect to their shareholding in Orange.\n\nThe shareholders' agreement has been established for a period of two years (renewable), and stipulates that the parties will:\n\n- -consult  on  the  vote  of  resolutions  put  to  the  Shareholders' Meeting, with a commitment to exchange respective views and\n- seek a common position on resolutions, without being under any obligation to reach a joint position;\n- -consult each other on the form (within the meaning of Article L.  228-1  of  the  French  Commercial  Code)  of  their  Orange securities.\n\n## 6.2.1.3 Additional information on the distribution of the free float\n\nOrange regularly identifies its shareholders, notably via the procedure known as 'Identifiable Bearer Shares' (IBS).

As is the case with all Orange's shareholders, these shares carry double voting rights when held in registered form for over two years (see above Sections 6.2.1.2 Information on shareholders' agreements and 6.2.1 Distribution of capital and voting rights). While not giving it as such the ability to exercise control over the Company, this level of holding could, based on the attendance rate at Shareholders' Meetings in the past, allow the public sector to block the adoption of resolutions requiring a qualified majority vote by the Shareholders.\n\nIn light of the recommendations of the Afep-Medef Code, revised in January 2020, Orange has put in place Corporate Governance rules to ensure the proper operation of the Board of Directors and its specialist committees in respecting the interests of all shareholders. The  Board  of  Directors  comprises  seven  independent  Directors including  a  Lead  Director  (See  Section  5.2  Operation of the management and supervisory bodies). Orange therefore feels there is no risk that the French State may exercise control in an abusive manner.\n\nNo other natural or legal persons exercise or could exercise control over Orange, be it directly or indirectly, or individually, jointly or in concert.\n\nTo Orange's knowledge, there is no agreement which, if implemented, could, at a later date, entail a change in its control.\n\n## 6.3 Dividend distribution policy\n\nOrange distributed a dividend of 0.50 euro per share for the 2019 fiscal year.\n\nFor the 2020 fiscal year, the Shareholders' Meeting of May 18, 2021 will be asked to approve the payment of a dividend of 0.70 euros per share, plus 0.20 euros per share linked to the favorable decision of the French Conseil d'\u00c9tat concerning a long-standing tax dispute, amounting to a total dividend of 0.90 euros per share. Taking into account an interim dividend of 0.40 euros paid on December 9, 2020, the balance of the dividend, subject to approval by the Shareholders' Meeting, will amount to 0.50 euros per share and will be paid in cash on June 17, 2021. The ex-dividend date will be June 15, 2021.\n\nWith respect to the 2021 fiscal year, the payment of a dividend of 0.70 euros per share will be proposed to the Shareholders' Meeting in 2022. An interim dividend of 0.30 euros per share will be paid in December 2021.\n\n## Past dividend payments\n\n| Fiscal year                    |   2019 |   2018 |   2017 |   2016 |   2015 |\n|--------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Dividend per  share (in euros) |    0.5 |    0.7 |   0.65 |    0.6 |    0.6 |",

Each share shall entitle its holder to a portion of the corporate profits and assets proportional to the amount of capital represented thereby. Furthermore, each share shall entitle its holder to vote and be represented in the Shareholders' Meetings in accordance with provisions of the law and of the Bylaws. Ownership of one share implies, ipso jure, adherence to the Bylaws and the decisions of the Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nThere is no clause in the Bylaws providing for double or multiple voting rights for Orange shareholders. However, in accordance with legal stipulations, double voting rights are automatically granted to all  shares held in registered form by the same holder for at least two years.\n\nThe shareholders shall only be liable for losses within the limits of their contributions to the Company's capital.\n\n## Payment of dividends\n\nThe terms and conditions for the payment of the dividends approved by the Shareholders' Meeting are determined by the Shareholders' Meeting, or in l i e u,  b y  t h e  B o a r d  o f  D i r e c t o r s .

the Board of Directors to allocate free shares of the Company, on one occasion and under conditions that it shall determine, within the limits set in this authorization, existing or new, to Corporate Officers (within the meaning of II of Article L. 225-197-1 of the French Commercial Code)  and  certain  employees  of  the  Company  or  companies  or groups affiliated  with  the  Company  within  the  meaning  of  Article L. 225-197-2 of the French Commercial Code.\n\nThis authorization is granted for a period of 12 months as from this Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nThe total number of free shares allocated pursuant to this resolution will not represent more than 0.07% of the Company's capital as of the date of this Shareholders' Meeting, it being specified that the total number of free shares granted to the Company's Corporate Officers pursuant to this resolution may not exceed 100,000 shares.\n\nThe  Shareholders'  Meeting  resolves  that  any  award  decided  by the Board of Directors under this resolution will be subject to the achievement  of  the  following  performance  conditions,  as  these conditions may be specified by the Board of Directors.\n\nThe performance conditions are the following:\n\n- -the amount of the Group's organic cash flow (50% of the final entitlement), the achievement of the target being assessed at the end of a three-year period (including the year in which the free  shares  are  granted)  in  relation  to  the  organic  cash  flow target set for this multi-year period as previously approved by the Board of Directors;\n- -the  relative  change  in  the  Orange  Total  Shareholder  Return (TSR) (30% of the final entitlement), which will be assessed at the end of a three-year period by comparing (i) the change in the Orange TSR calculated by comparing the average Orange share  price  between  September  1,  2020  and  December  31, 2020  (i.e.  9.69  euros)  with  the  average  Orange  share  price between September 1, 2023 and December 31, 2023, (ii) the change in  the  sector  TSR  calculated  according  to  the  same methodology using the Stoxx Europe 600 Telecommunications index as the benchmark or any other index that may replace it,  it  being  understood that the result will be recorded on the hit-or-miss principle between the changes in the Orange TSR and the sector TSR calculated on the basis of the Stoxx Europe 600 Telecommunications index;\n- -the reduction in CO2 emissions compared with 2015 (10% of the final entitlement), observed on the hit-or-miss principle, and the increase in the proportion of women in the Group's management networks (also 10% of the final entitlement), the achievement of  which  will  be  assessed  at  the  end  of  a  three-year  period (including the year in which the free shares are granted), in order to support the ambition in terms of the Orange group's social and  environmental  responsibility  as  part  of  its  Engage  2025 strategic plan.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n-

It should also be noted that the statutory reserve is already equal to the minimum required and therefore does not require any additional funds.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  has  decided  to  propose  a  dividend  of 0.70 euros per share, plus 0.20 euros per share linked to the favorable decision  of  the  French Conseil d'\u00c9tat  dated  November  13,  2020 concerning a long-standing tax dispute, amounting to a total dividend of 0.90 euros per share. Subject to the approval of this payment by\n\nthe Shareholders' Meeting, and in view of the payment of an interim dividend of 0.40 euro per share on December 9, 2020, the balance of the dividend to be paid amounts to 0.50 euro per share. It will be paid in cash.\n\nThe balance will be paid on June 17, 2021 to holders of shares entitled to receive a dividend, i.e. those holding Orange shares with dividend rights for fiscal year 2020 on the ex-dividend date (in France, that being two business days before the payment date, i.e. June 15, 2021).\n\nThe  interim  dividend  paid  on  December  9,  2020  amounted  to 1,063,526,852.40 euros and, based on the number of shares eligible to receive dividends at December 31, 2020, the total amount of the balance of the dividend amounts to 1,329,395,750.00 euros. Treasury shares are not eligible to receive dividends.\n\nAs the number of shares eligible to receive dividends may change up until the payment date, the Shareholders' Meeting grants full authority to the Board of Directors to determine the final total amount of the dividend, the balance of the distributable income and, consequently, the amount to be entered under 'retained earnings'.\n\nPursuant to Article 117 quater of the Fre nch General Ta x Code, natural persons domiciled in France for ta x purposes are subject to a flat-rate levy on dividends received (currently 12.8%), plus the contributions provided for in Article L. 136-7 of the French Social Security Code (currently 17.2%). However, as an express and irrevocable option, such individuals may request that the dividend be included in their overall income under the conditions provided for in paragraph 2 of Article 200 A of the French General Tax Code in order to benefit from the 40% tax allowance pursuant to paragraphs 2 and 3 of Article 158 of the French General Tax Code.\n\nThe  table  below  summarizes  the  amount  of  dividends  paid  with respect to the last three fiscal years, which were fully eligible for the tax allowance provided for in Article 158-3-2 of the French General Tax Code:\n\n|   Fiscal year | Number of shares   | Dividend per share   | Share of dividend eligible for the 40% allowance   |\n|---------------|--------------------|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------|\n|          2017 | 2,658,547,775      | \u20ac0.65                | 100%                                               |\n|          2018 | 2,652,992,864      | \u20ac0.70                | 100%                                               |\n|          2019 | 2,658,562,160      | \u20ac0.50                | 100%                                               |\n\n## Fourth resolution\n\n## Agreements provided for in Articles L. 225-38 et seq. of the French Commercial Code\n\nNo related-party agreements were approved by the Board of Directors during  fiscal  year  2020.  Only  previously  authorized  agreements whose effects have continued are dealt with in the Statutory Auditors' Special Report, of which the shareholders are asked to take note.\n\nThose agreements were also presented to the Board of Directors for annual review at its meeting of February 17, 2021, in accordance with the provisions of Article L. 225-40-1 of the French Commercial Code.\n\nThe agreements concerned are the same as those appearing in the Statutory Auditors' Special Report submitted to your Shareholders' Meeting, namely:\n\n- -the  agreement  concluded  with  Compagnie  Francaise  des Expositions (COFREX), a company wholly owned by the French State and responsible for the preparation and organization of the French delegation to Expo 2020 Dubai, which remained in force due to the postponement of the event. Under the terms of that agreement, Orange SA undertook, in particular, to provide a fleet of mobile telephones together with network coverage and connectivity equipment for the entire French Pavilion, as well as a range of services including the supply and installation of dedicated equipment and its cabling and connection, in a total amount estimated at approximately 1.8 million euros;\n- -the amendments concluded with Novalis to extend to Corporate Officers the benefits of the Group's policies covering (i) healthcare costs  and  (ii)  death,  incapacity  and  disability.

Their new terms of office will thus expire at the close of the Ordinary Shareholders' Meeting called to approve the financial statements for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2026.\n\nThe purpose of the eighth and ninth resolutions is to propose to the Shareholders' Meeting the appointment of Deloitte and BEAS as new Principal Statutory Auditors and Alternate Statutory Auditors respectively  (replacing  Ernst  &  Young  Audit  and  Auditex),  for  the same period. Their new terms of office will therefore also expire at the close of the Ordinary Shareholders' Meeting called to approve the financial statements for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2026.\n\nPlease  note  that  the  terms  of  office  of  Ernst  &  Young  Audit  and Auditex, Principal Statutory Auditors and Alternate Statutory Auditors of  the  Company since September 18, 1991, could not be legally extended  as  they  had  reached  the  maximum  legal  duration  as amended following the transposition of the European audit reform into French law.\n\nThe selection of the Statutory Auditors whose appointment or renewal is put to the Shareholders' Meeting was made in accordance with a process complying in all respects with the recommendations of the Afep-Medef Corporate Governance Code for Listed Companies, without  the  aim  of  reappointing  all  or  part  of  the  auditors.  The Audit Committee was thus entrusted with the task of overseeing the  selection  procedure,  notably  through  the  validation  of  the tender  process  and  the  specifications,  and  of  proposing  to  the Board of Directors the candidates selected for designation by your Shareholders'  Meeting.  A  Technical  Committee,  chaired  by  the Chairman of the Audit Committee, was tasked with examining written tenders, interviewing candidates, and carrying out additional checks in  conjunction  with  the  Audit  Committee.  The  Audit  Committee subsequently issued a recommendation regarding the designation of the Principal Statutory Auditor and Alternate Statutory Auditor to the Board of Directors at its meeting of February 12, 2020. The main criteria used in the selection of candidates, for both written and oral presentations,  were  the  understanding  of  the  Group's  activities, the  expertise  of  the  audit  teams,  the  future  audit  approach,  the implementation of the audit work and the price offered.\n\nThe recommendation submitted by the Audit Committee to the Board of  Directors, which ensured the selection of the most attractively priced tenders, as recommended by the Afep-Medef Code, aimed at appointing a panel of Statutory Auditors that will ensure:\n\n- -an  approach  guaranteeing  audit  security,  adapted  to  the Group's organization and multinational character, and the risks associated with its businesses;\n- -effective  operating  procedures  between  the  joint  Statutory Auditors;\n- -an ability  to  make  practical  and  innovative  recommendations contributing to the Group's continual improvement process and allowing an increase in value added;\n- -an amount of fees positioned at the best level enjoyed by other European operators.\n\nTo be able to par ti c i p a t e  i n  t h e  c a l l  f o r  t e n d e r s ,  c a n d i d a t e s  h a d  t o  h a v e a network of legally autonomous and independent entities sufficient to audit a group with the geographical spread and high international reputation  of  Orange,  as  well  as  the  skills  and  accreditations necessary to meet the needs arising from our listing in the United States. The firms put to your vote naturally meet those requirements.\n\nThe  prospective  Statutory  Auditors  have  already  informed  the Company that they will accept the engagement in the event of a favorable vote on these resolutions. KPMG has further informed the Company that it received 10.2 million euros for its role as Statutory Auditor for the 2020 fiscal year, together with 643 thousand euros as fees for services not directly related to the statutory audit engagement provided to companies within the Company's scope of consolidation.\n\nDeloitte  has  never  served  as  Statutory  Auditor  for  the  Company, and has indicated that it received fees in the amount of 1.3 million euros for fiscal year 2020 only for services not directly related to the statutory audit assignment provided to companies within the Company's scope of consolidation.\n\n## Tenth resolution\n\n## Approval of the transfer of the registered office\n\nAt its meeting of February 17, 2021, the Board of Directors decided to transfer the Company's registered office to 111, quai du Pr\u00e9sident Roosevelt in Issy-les-Moulineaux, with effect from the close of the Shareholders' Meeting of May 18, 2021.\n\nOrange's new registered office in Issy-les-Moulineaux will reflect the Group, housing its commercial (France B2B Department), corporate and international activities. It will bring together 2,900 employees from 10 sites in Paris in an area of 56,000 sq.m, with its eight floors divided into dynamic workspaces adapted to the activities and tasks of each department. This is designed to facilitate interaction between teams and foster collective decision-making, to be a place looking out onto the city, to promote encounters and exchanges, and to offer spaces conducive to interaction alongside others that respect confidentiality. Meeting rooms of different configurations and lounges favoring discussion and exchange will be available to site employees and Orange employees in France or internationally.\n\nYour Shareholders' Meeting is asked to ratify this transfer  of  the registered office.\n\n## Eleventh to fourteenth resolutions\n\nApproval of the information mentioned in I of Article L. 22-10-9 of the French Commercial Code relating to the compensation of Directors & Officers presented in the Report on Corporate Governance approved by the Board of Directors, as presented in the Universal Registration Document\n\nPursuant to I of Article L. 22-10-34 of the French Commercial Code, shareholders are asked to vote on certain information included in the  Report  on  Corporate  Governance  approved by the Board of Directors at its meeting of February 17, 2021 and mentioned in I of Article L. 22-10-9 of the French Commercial Code.

detailed presentation of the compensation of Corporate Officers is shown in Section 5.4.1.2 Amount of compensation paid or allocated to Corporate Officers for 2020 of the Company's Universal Registration Document relating to the fiscal year 2020.\n\n## Fifteenth to seventeenth resolutions\n\n## Approval of the compensation policy for Directors and Officers\n\nPursuant  to  Article  L.  22-10-8  of  the  French  Commercial  Code, shareholders are required to approve in a Shareholders' Meeting the compensation policy for all Directors and Officers.\n\nThe purpose of the fifteenth and sixteenth resolutions is therefore to ask shareholders to vote on the compensation policy for fiscal year 2021 for the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (fifteenth resolution),  and  the  Delegate Chief Executive Officers (sixteenth resolution).\n\nThe  purpose  of  the  seventeenth  resolution  is  therefore  to  ask shareholders to vote on the compensation policy for non-executive Directors.\n\nDetails  on  this  policy  are  shown  in  the  Report  on  Corporate Governance drawn up by your Board of Directors, and in particular in  Sections  5.4.1.3  Structure of the compensation of Corporate Officers for 2020 and 5.4.2.2 Compensation policy for Non-executive Directors of the Company's Universal Registration Document relating to the fiscal year 2020.\n\n## Eighteenth resolution\n\n## Authorization to be granted to the Board of Directors to purchase or transfer Orange shares\n\nYour  Board  of  Directors  asks  that  you  authorize  it  to  buy  back Company shares within the limit of a number of shares representing 10% of the capital and at the maximum price of 24 euros per share\n\n(this price may be adjusted in the event of capital transactions). The maximum amount of funds allocated to the share Buyback program is therefore set at 6,384,135,837.60 euros.\n\nThis authorization will be valid for a period of 18 months from the date of the Shareholders' Meeting and may be implemented at any time except in the event of a public tender offer for the Company's shares.\n\nThe purpose of the Buyback program would be to (i) enable the Company to fulfill obligations related to securities giving access to the capital or to stock option programs or any other type of share allocation or grant to employees (in particular, free share awards or employee shareholding plans), (ii) ensure the liquidity of the Orange Share pursuant to a liquidity contract with an investment services provider  in  compliance  with  French  Financial  Markets  Authority (Autorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s financiers - AMF) decision no. 2018-01 of July 2, 2018, (iii) retain shares to deliver in exchange or in payment for external growth transactions, and (iv) reduce the Company's capital.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  will  have  full  powers  to  implement  this delegation and set the terms.\n\nThe adoption of this resolution would terminate the authorization to buy back shares granted by the Combined Ordinary and Extraordinary Shareholders'  Meeting  of  May  19,  2020.  This  authorization  was used to purchase shares (other than under the liquidity contract) in September 2020 to honor obligations related to the allocation of shares to employees and to purchase shares within the framework of  the  liquidity  contract  with  an  independent  investment services provider  (ISP)  (Rothschild)  (see  Section  6.1.4  Treasury shares Share Buyback program of the Company's Universal Registration Document relating to the fiscal year 2020). This contract was revised in February 2019 further to changes in regulation regarding liquidity contracts.\n\nThe Board of Directors will inform you, in its Annual Report, of share purchases, transfers or cancellations and, as the case may be, of the allocation of shares acquired for the various objectives pursued.",

As this delegation of authority expires on November 18, 2021, your Board of  Directors  asks you to terminate it, with immediate effect as of the date of the Shareholders' Meeting, and to renew it for the same duration of 18 months (thirty-fourth resolution).\n\nTogether, these delegations of authority will provide the Board of Directors with the means enabling it, if necessary by means of a call on the financial markets, to quickly and flexibly raise the financial resources necessary for the development of your Company.\n\nThese delegations of authorit y give the Board of Directors the powers necessary to ensure their execution (record their completion, make any  changes  to  the  Bylaws,  complete  any  formalities,  etc.),  with the right to delegate to Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer, pursuant to the law.\n\nFinally,  the  summary  table  attached  in  the  Appendix  shows  the transactions carried out during the 2020 fiscal year pursuant to these delegations of authority.\n\n## Nineteenth and twentieth resolutions\n\nThe nineteenth resolution is a delegation of authority to the Board of Directors to issue Company shares and complex securities, with shareholders' preferential subscription rights, which may only be exercised outside the period of a public tender offer.\n\nThe Shareholders' Meeting, using the legal mechanism of an overall delegation of authority, is asked to delegate its authority to the Board of Directors, for a period of 26 months, to issue, with shareholders' preferential subscription rights,\n\n- (i) Company shares,\n- (ii) equity  securities  giving  access  to  other  equity  securities  or entitling the holder to the allocation of debt securities of the Company,\n- (iii) securities giving access to equity securities to be issued,\n- (iv) securities giving access to equity securities to be issued by a Subsidiary of the Company, and\n- (v) equity securities giving access to existing equity securities or entitling holders to the allocation of debt securities of an entity in  which  the  Company  holds,  directly  or  indirectly,  rights  in the capital, all within the limit of a maximum nominal capital increase of 2 billion euros, it being specified that any securities issued pursuant to this resolution will be taken into account for the application of the overall limit of 3 billion euros provided for specifically in the thirtieth resolution.\n\nThe twentieth resolution authorizes the Board of Directors to use the delegation of authority provided for in the nineteenth resolution during the period of a public tender offer for the Company's shares, for the same duration and with the same ceiling.\n\n## Twenty-first to twenty-fourth resolutions\n\nThe  twenty-first  and  twenty-third  resolutions  are  delegations  of authority to the Board of Directors to issue Company shares and complex  securities,  with  the  waiver  of  shareholders'  preferential subscription rights, exercisable only outside the period of a public tender offer.\n\nThe Shareholders' Meeting is asked, using the legal mechanism of an overall delegation of authority, to delegate to the Board of Directors, for a period of 26 months, the authority to issue by way of public offering ( twenty-first resolution ) and/or by an offer addressed to qualified  investors  or  to  a  restricted  circle  of  investors  within  the meaning  of  the  French  Monetary  and  Financial  Code,  generally known  as  a  'private  placement'  ( twenty-third resolution ), with the waiver of shareholders' preferential subscription rights, (i) Company shares, (ii) equity securities giving access to other equity securities or entitling holders to the allocation of debt securities of the Company, (iii) securities giving access to equity securities to be issued, (iv) securities giving access to equity securities to be issued by a Subsidiary of the Company, and (v) equity securities giving access to existing equity securities or entitling holders to the allocation of debt securities of an entity in which the Company holds, directly or indirectly, rights in the capital, all within the limit of a maximum nominal capital increase of 1 billion euros, it being specified that any securities  issued  pursuant  to  these  resolutions  will  be  taken into account for the application of the overall limit of 3 billion euros provided for specifically in the thirtieth resolution.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 6\n\n6",

To that end, it will take into account factors including the nature of the securities issued, trends in the broader stock market and in the market for the Orange Share, the relevant interest rates if the securities issued consist of debt securities, the number of ordinary shares to which those securities entitle holders and, more generally, all the characteristics of the securities issued.\n\nThe Board of Directors may also establish a priority right in favor of shareholders.\n\nUnder  the  regulations  as  they  currently  stand,  the  issue  price of  new  shares  issued  as  part  of  a  public  offering  ( twenty-first resolution ) or as part of an offer addressed to qualified investors or to a restricted circle of investors within the meaning of the French Monetary and Financial Code ( twenty-third resolution ),  with  the waiver of shareholders' preferential subscription rights, by a company whose shares are admitted to trading on a regulated market may not be lower than the weighted average of the prices of the three trading days preceding the beginning of the public offering within the meaning of the Regulation (EU) 2017-1129 of June 14, 2017, less, where applicable, a maximum discount of 10%.\n\nFinally, the twenty-first and twenty-third resolutions exclude all issues of preference shares and securities giving immediate or future access to preference shares.\n\nThe twenty-second and twenty-fourth resolutions authorize the Board of Directors to use the delegations of authority provided for in the twenty-first and twenty-third resolutions respectively during the period of a public tender offer for the Company's shares, for the same duration and with the same ceiling.\n\n## Twenty-fifth resolution\n\n## Delegation of authority to the Board of Directors to increase the number of securities to be issued in the event of the issue of securities\n\nThe purpose of this resolution, commonly known as the greenshoe option, is to authorize the Board of Directors, in the event of a capital increase  with  or  without  shareholders'  preferential  subscription rights, to increase the number of shares to be issued in the event of excess requests, under legal conditions and subject to compliance with the ceiling provided for in the resolution pursuant to which the shares are issued.\n\nThis resolution can only be used for issues made pursuant to the nineteenth to twenty-fourth resolutions.\n\nThe system, which is  governed  by  law,  would  give  the  Board  of Directors the power to carr y out additional c a pi t a l i n c r e a s e s  u n d e r  t h e s a m e  c o n d i t i o n s  a s  t h e  i n i t i a l  i s s u e .

This ceiling does not take into account the nominal amount of the Company shares that would have to be issued to preserve the rights of holders of securities giving access to Company shares, in accordance with the law; it would be given for the same duration of 26 months from the date of the Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nThe terms of application of the twenty-third resolution would apply to issues carried out pursuant to this twenty-sixth resolution, with the exception of those relating to the issue price of shares and securities gi v i n g  a c c e s s  t o  s h a r e s ,  a n d  t h e  p r i o r i t y  r i g h t  i n  f a v o r  o f  s h a r e h o l d e r s .\n\nThe twenty-seventh resolution authorizes the Board of Directors to use the authorization provided for in the twenty-sixth resolution during the period of a public tender offer for the shares of the Company, for the same duration and with the same ceiling.\n\n## Twenty-eighth and twenty-ninth resolutions\n\nThe twenty-eighth resolution is a delegation of authority to the Board of Directors to issue shares and complex securities, with the waiver of shareholders' preferential subscription rights, as consideration for contributions in kind granted to the Company, which may only be exercised outside the period of a public tender offer.",

In any event, this amount is below the legal ceiling of 10% of the share capital (as it will exist the date of this Shareholders' Meeting) which, based on the share capital at December 31, 2020, represents a nominal amount of 1,064,022,639 euros.\n\nIt gives the Board of Directors the authority necessary to issue shares or securities giving access to existing or new Company shares as consideration for such contributions when Article L. 22-10-54 of the French Commercial Code is not applicable (public exchange offer, see the twenty-sixth resolution).\n\nShareholders' preferential subscription rights to shares and securities thus issued would be waived in favor of holders of equity securities or securities offered as contributions in kind.\n\nThis delegation of authority also entails the waiver by shareholders of their preferential subscription rights to the shares to which the shares and securities prospectively issued may entitle them.\n\nIn the event of the implementation of the twenty-eighth resolution, the Board of Directors would rule on the report of the Contribution Auditor(s) under the same conditions as if the Shareholders' Meeting had itself voted: it would accordingly have authority to approve the valuation of contributions in kind and the granting of special benefits, and to record the capital increase; it would also have authority to reduce the valuation of the contributions or the consideration paid for special benefits, if the contributors agree.\n\nThe twenty-ninth resolution authorizes the Board of Directors to use  the  delegation  of  authority  provided  for  in  the  twenty-eighth resolution during the period of a public tender offer for the Company's shares, f o r  t h e  s a m e  d u r a t i o n  a n d  w i t h  t h e  s a m e  c e i l i n g .\n\n## Thirtieth resolution\n\n## Overall limit on authorizations\n\nThe maximum nominal amount of capital increases, immediate and/ or  future,  that  may  be  carried  out  pursuant  to  the  nineteenth  to twenty-ninth resolutions is set at 3 billion euros.\n\n## Thirty-first resolution\n\nAuthorization given to the Board of Directors to allocate free shares of the Company to Corporate Officers and certain Orange group employees and involving the waiver of shareholders' preferential subscription rights\n\nShareholders  are  once  again  asked  this  year  to  authorize  the allocation of free Orange shares in the form of performance shares to  Corporate Officers and certain employees of the Company or companies or groups affiliated with the Company (subsidiaries and shareholdings). This scheme is intended to offer Orange group Senior Management comparable schemes to those offered to managers holding comparable positions in other major groups.\n\nAwards  of  this  nature  would  fall  within  the  framework  of  the long-term incentive plan (LTIP) established for Corporate Officers of the Company and members of the Executive Committee who are not Corporate Officers of the Company for the 2021-2023 period. This  LTIP  extends  to  employees  designated  as  'Executives'  and 'Leaders' under the same terms (excluding the number of shares) and conditions. These terms and conditions are described in the Report  on  Corporate  Governance  produced  by  your  Board  of\n\nDirectors (see Section 5.4.1.3 Compensation structure for Corporate Officers in 2021 of the Company's Universal Registration Document relating to the fiscal year 2020).\n\nThe characteristics of this allocation have been reviewed and approved by your Board on the basis of the GCSERC's recommendations:\n\n- -the total number of shares may be allocated is limited to 0.07% of the share capital including the shares awarded to Corporate Officers of the Company, it being stated that the total number of these latter shares shall be limited to 100,000;\n- -they will either be existing shares or newly-issued shares;\n- -the  duration  of  the  authorization  is  limited  to  12  months;  the Board of Directors' aim is to award the free shares soon after the Shareholders' Meeting in order to allow an assessment of the performance conditions over the 2021-2023 period.\n\nThis authorization is subject to performance conditions relating to:\n\n- -t h e  a m o u n t of o r g a n i c c a s h fl o w ( f o r  5 0% of t h e fi n a l e n t i t l e m e n t);\n- -the relative change in the Total Shareholder Return (TSR) (for 30% of the final entitlement); and\n- -CSR criteria (for 20% of the final entitlement), (i) half of which relates to CO2 emission reductions compared to 2015 (reduction targeted  for  this  indicator)  and  (ii)  half  to  the  increase  in  the proportion  of  women  in  the  Group's  management  networks (increase targeted for this indicator) (see below).\n\nThe achievement of the organic cash flow target will be assessed on a multi-year basis over the entire 2021-2023 period. Its achievement wil l  b e  m e a s u r e d  i n  r e l a t i o n  t o  t h e  o r g a n i c  c a s h  fl o w  t a r g e t  e s t a b l i s h e d for that period as part of the Engage 2025 strategic plan. This criteria will be verified by applying a graduated system where achieving or exceeding this organic cash flow target over the period will result in 100% of the final entitlement for this criteria.\n\nThe relative change in the Orange Total Shareholder Return (TSR) will be assessed in comparison with the change in the telecommunication sector's  TSR.  Change  in  the  Orange  TSR  will  be  calculated  by comparing the average Orange Share price between September 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020 (i.e.  9.69  euros)  with  the  average Orange Share price between September 1, 2023 and December 31, 2023. The change in the telecommunication sector's TSR will be calculated  according  to  the  same  methodology  using  the  Stoxx Europe 600 Telecommunications index or any other index replacing it as a benchmark. This criteria will then be verified according to the 'hit or miss' principle.\n\nThe CO2 emission reduction criterion (Scopes 1 & 2 compared to 2015, as established under the GHG (Greenhouse Gas) Protocol covering greenhouse gases within the Kyoto Protocol), is measured at Group level. It allows the Group's progress to be measured against t h e  c o m m i t m e n t  m a d e  i n  i t s  s t r a t e g i c  p l a n  t o  r e d u c e  i t s  C O 2 emissions by 30% compared to 2015 (Scopes 1 & 2). This commitment is set out on an annual basis in the environmental roadmaps developed by the CSR, Diversity, Partnerships and Solidarity Department with each Group entity, which are themselves an integral part of the budget process and the Company's strategic plan. This criteria will then be assessed according to the 'hit-or-miss' principle.\n\nThe calculation is based on the aggregation of the energy consumption of each country in the Group's scope of consolidation, which is then translated into CO2 emissions, to which the IEA (International Energy Agency) conversion factors are applied for electricity consumption and those of the GHG Protocol for fuels (gas, oil, coal, gasoline, diesel and LPG). Energy consumption from renewable sources (produced by Orange or from consumption contracts with a guarantee of origin certificate from their suppliers) is subtracted from this calculation. The level of emissions used as a reference for 2015 is 1,451,012 metric tons of CO2.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6\n\n- 6",

An annual t a r g et i s set, with the target for 2025, in accordance with the Engage 2025 strategic plan and the global agreement on gender equality in the workplace signed on July 17, 2019 with the UNI global union (international  trade  union  federation),  being  a  proportion  of  35% women, in line with the proportion of women in the Group's workforce, which stood at 36% at the end of 2020. This criterion reflects Orange's strong intention to manage and prioritize this change. It necessitates specific  efforts  by  the  Group  in  terms  of  support  and  training, including technical training, for the Company's female employees, both in France and abroad, and confirms the positioning of diversity and gender balance as levers for value creation.\n\nThe definitive acquisition of the shares (delivery to the beneficiaries) may not occur before the vesting date of March 31, 2024, it being stipulated that:\n\n- -no lock-up period will be applicable to the beneficiaries;\n- -the beneficiaries must still be employed within the Group on the last day of the period for assessing the performance conditions.\n\nAs  an  exception  to  the  foregoing,  the  Company's  beneficiary Corporate Officers must hold at least 50% of the shares they receive until the end of their duties.\n\n## Thirty-second resolution\n\nDelegation of authority to the Board of Directors to issue shares or complex securities reserved for members of savings plans and involving the waiver of shareholders' preferential subscription rights\n\nThe purpose of this resolution is to permit the issue of shares or securities giving access to shares of the Company, to be subscribed in  cash,  in  favor  of  members  of  the  Orange  group  savings  plan. Where applicable, under such issuance, shares or securities giving access to shares of the Company could be allocated free of charge, to replace all or part of the discount provided for hereinafter and/or the employer's contributions.\n\nThe nominal amount of an immediate or future capital increase of the Company, resulting from all issuances carried out pursuant to this delegation, would be set at 200 million euros, without taking into account the nominal value of the shares to be issued, to preserve, in accordance with the law, the rights of the holders of the securities giving access to the shares.\n\nThe subscription price  of  the  new  shares  would  be  equal  to  the average quoted share price during the 20 trading days preceding the day of the decision establishing the opening date of the subscription, reduced by the maximum discount provided for by law on the day the Board of Directors makes its decision, it being specified that the Board of Directors could reduce this discount if it deems appropriate.\n\nShareholders' preferential subscription rights to shares thus issued would  be  waived  in  favor  of  the  members  of  the  Orange  group savings plan.\n\nThe term of this delegation would be 18 months.\n\nAt December 31, 2020, Group employees held, via the mutual funds of the Group savings plan, 5.66% of the capital and 8.96% of the\n\nvoting rights.  At  December 31, 2020, some employees also held Orange shares in registered form resulting from previous transactions ( i n  p a r t i c u l a r  f r e e  s h a r e  a w a r d  p l a n ) ,  r e p r e s e n t i n g  0 . 4 8 %  o f  t h e  c a p i t a l and 0.71% of voting rights.\n\n## Thirty-third resolution\n\nDelegation of authority to the Board of Directors to increase the capital of the Company by incorporation of reserves, profits or premiums\n\nThe purpose of this resolution is to all ow th e c a p i t a l to b e i n c r e a s e d  b y the incorporation of reserves, profits or premiums. The law subjects its  approval by a vote by the Shareholders' Meeting solely to the quorum and majority conditions required for Ordinary Shareholders' Meetings. For this reason it is the subject of a special resolution.\n\nThe purpose of this delegation of authority is to authorize the Board of Directors, if it deems it necessary, either by creating new shares or by i ncreasing the par valu e (c u r r e n t l y  4  e u r o s  p e r  s h a r e ) ,  t o  s t r e n g t h e n  t h e share capital by incorporation of reserves or premiums for example.\n\nOrange SA has share premiums amounting to 15, 8 billion euros.\n\nThe delegation of authority, which would also be granted for a period of 26 months, would allow the Board of Directors to proceed, on one or more occasions, with a capital increase within a maximum nominal amount of 2 billion euros, it being specified that this ceiling is set (i) without taking into account the par value of the Company's shares that may be issued in view of adjustments made to protect the holders of securities giving future access to ordinary shares, and (ii) independently of ceilings for capital increases resulting from issues of shares or securities authorized pursuant to the nineteenth to twenty-ninth resolutions.\n\n## Thirty-fourth resolution\n\n## Authorization to cancel repurchased shares\n\nThe Board of Directors proposes that you authorize, for a period of  18  months  from  the  date  of  the  Shareholders'  Meeting,  the cancellation of all or part of the Orange shares that may have been acquired,  whether  under  the  share  Buyback  program  authorized under the eighteenth resolution, or under share Buyback programs pr i o r  o r  s u b s e q u e n t  t o  t h e  S h a r e h o l d e r s '  M e e t i n g ,  a n d  c o n s e q u e n t l y, to reduce the capital.\n\nBy law, total shares cancelled per 24-month period may not exceed 10% of the Company's capital.\n\n## Thirty-fifth resolution\n\n## Powers for formalities\n\nI t  i s  p r o p o s e d ,  a s  i s  c u s t o m a r y,  t h a t  t h e  S h a r e h o l d e r s '  M e e t i n g  c o n f e r full powers on the holder of an original, a copy, or an extract of the minutes of the Shareholders' Meeting for the purposes of carrying out all legal or administrative formalities and completing all filings and public disclosures provided for under current law.\n\nIf the Board of Directors' proposals meet your approval, we request that you approve them by voting on the resolutions submitted to you, following review of the reports drawn up by the Statutory Auditors in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.",
