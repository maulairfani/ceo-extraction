        "page_content": "## Dear shareholders and stakeholders,\n\nOur sustainable and fully integrated business model has allowed us to maximize shared value with all our stakeholders, even during a year characterized by the global recession triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, con/fi.ligarming our leading role in the energy transition.\n\nWe are the largest private renewable energy operator in the world, with 49 GW of managed capacity, and the largest private electricity distribution company globally, with 74 million end users connected to the world's most advanced digitalized grids. We manage the largest customer base in the world among private companies, with approximately 70 million customers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur strategy of basing all our business on digital platforms, together with industrial leadership, allows us to optimally seize oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities arising from the energy transition now under way around the globe.\n\nOur solid /fi.liganancial and sustainability pe/r\\_f.ligaormance in recent years has enhanced investor con/fi.ligadence in us. This is demonstrated by the 17% increase in the Enel stock price during the year, outpe/r\\_f.ligaorming both the sector index (EURO STOXX Utilities: +10%) and the general Italian index (FTSE-MIB: -5%).\n\nEnel's leadership in sustainability is also con/fi.ligarmed worldwide by the Group's presence in a number of impo/r\\_t.ligaant sustainability ratings, indices and rankings, including the AAA rating from MSCI and con/fi.ligarmation of our presence in the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes, the Dow Jones World and Europe sustainability indices, the CDP Climate 'A' List, the Vigeo Eiris rating in which the Group is ranked /fi.ligarst in all sectors and the Euronext Vigeo Eiris 120 index, the ESG rating of Re/fi.liganitiv and the FTSE4Good index, being the sector leader in both cases. Enel is also present in the three main indices that monitor corporate gender diversity pe/r\\_f.ligaormance: Bloomberg Gender Equality Index, Re/fi.liganitiv Top 100 Diversity and Inclusion Index, and Equileap Gender Equality Top 100 ranking.\n\nIn 2020 we con/fi.ligarmed ourselves as the leading European utility by market capitalization and the second in the world.\n\n## The macroeconomic environment\n\nThe global economic environment in 2020 was characterized by an unprecedented recession, caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The health crisis and the resulting restrictions have had a negative impact on supply and demand, leading to a contraction in world GDP estimated at around 3.7% in 2020.\n\nThe waves of the pandemic had a strong impact on the euro area, with GDP contracting by about 6.8% during the year, and on the United States, where the contraction in GDP was 3.5%.\n\nIn response to the recession, the European Central Bank has pursued an expansionary monetary policy, keeping its main interest rates at very low levels through the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program. For its pa/r\\_t.liga, the European Commission is using the Next Generation EU program to channel \u20ac750 billion, divided into loans and subsidies, to the Member States.\n\nThe US government has also adopted major expansionary /fi.ligascal policies to suppo/r\\_t.liga families and /fi.ligarms, and the Fed has implemented an unlimited public and private debt purchase program.\n\nIn Latin America, economic developments were highly in/fl.ligauenced by the pandemic and the consequent responses of the individual countries, which varied considerably and in some cases exacerbated existing structural problems. The Chilean economy was among the most resilient thanks to its considerable openness, with expo/r\\_t.ligas driven by the Chinese recovery (GDP -6.1%), while in Brazil economic activity in 2020 was suppo/r\\_t.ligaed by a broad /fi.ligascal stimulus program in suppo/r\\_t.liga of families (GDP -4.4%).\n\nDuring 2020, the oil market was characterized by sharp volatility, with oil prices collapsing during the 1st Qua/r\\_t.ligaer due to weak demand, followed by a sharp rise in the 2nd Half of the year thanks to the reopening of the main world economies.\n\nThe gas market also experienced strong volatility during 2020. During the 1st Half of the year, the benchmarks of all the main European hubs contracted by almost 50% compared with the same period of 2019, while prices in the last qua/r\\_t.ligaer returned to the average levels seen in 2019.\n\nThe price of CO 2 displayed excellent resilience. Recent statements by the European Commission about the central role of the ETS in achieving decarbonization and climate neutrality goals have suppo/r\\_t.ligaed the market, leaving prices on a gradually rising path towards long-term equilibrium.\n\nEND USERS",

        "page_content": "## Pe/r\\_f.ligaormance\n\nPe/r\\_f.ligaormance achieved in 2020, which was also the fruit of our business model, based on the central role of digitalization and platforms, key tools in dealing with the pandemic emergency, underscored the resilience of the Group from both an operational and /fi.liganancial point of view. Despite the economic crisis, the Group continued its growth path by continuing to generate value.\n\nThe 2020 /fi.liganancial year closed with ordinary EBITDA of \u20ac17.9 billion, in line with last year's results. Ordinary pro/fi.ligat, on which the dividend is calculated, reached \u20ac5.2 billion, up 9% compared with the previous year. The dividend for 2020 amounts to about \u20ac0.36 per share, up 8% compared with 2019. The FFO/net debt ratio, an indicator of /fi.liganancial strength, reached 25% at the end of the year. Net debt is equal to \u20ac45.4 billion, lower than the forecasts previously provided to the market.\n\n## Main developments\n\nAs in previous years, Enel reached a new record for renewables generation capacity in 2020, adding 3,106 MW of new renewables capacity globally, while at the same time increasing our pipeline of future renewables projects, reaching 180 GW worldwide at the end of the year.\n\nThe consolidated installed renewables capacity reached 45 GW, again exceeding thermal generation capacity, which fell to about 36 GW (-3.3 GW compared with 2019). Fu/r\\_t.ligahermore, 2020 was the /fi.ligarst year in which consolidated renewable generation also surpassed thermal output, with 105.4 TWh. This is an impo/r\\_t.ligaant step in the Group's journey towards a cleaner and more sustainable energy mix and an acceleration of the decarbonization process, which was also underscored by the rapid decline in speci/fi.ligac CO 2 emissions, which reached 214 gCO 2eq /kWh, a decrease of 28% compared with 2019.\n\nThanks to our investments in grids and the simultaneous focus on the digitization of systems and processes, we continued to improve the quality of the service o/ff.ligaered to our customers, reducing the average per-customer duration of outages by 12% compared with the previous year, registering a global SAIDI of 258.9 minutes. Fu/r\\_t.ligahermore, with the Grid Blue Sky project, we are completely overhauling the operating model of the distribution grids. The goal is to create a single global operating platform by 2022, which will enable the e/ffi.ligacient integrated management of our grids in all the geographical areas in which we operate, suppo/r\\_t.ligaing the sustainable development of the asset po/r\\_t.ligafolio in order to maximize value. The bene/fi.ligats associated with the project are manifold. These include increasing the value of our services for customers, the rapid implementation of innovative solutions, an increase in the e/ffi.ligaciency of our processes and the creation of shared value in the communities in which we operate.\n\nDuring 2020, the development of public and private charging infrastructure for electric vehicles continued and, thanks in pa/r\\_t.liga to interoperability agreements, we have exceeded 185,000 charging points worldwide. The Group has also suppo/r\\_t.ligaed the electri/fi.ligacation of public transpo/r\\_t.liga thanks to the supply of charging stations for electric buses, with Enel X closing 2020 with over 900 electric buses managed globally. We were once again the leader in terms of the number of lighting points operated, at 2.8 million worldwide. We also con/fi.ligarmed our ability to assist industrial customers in using energy more e/ffi.ligaciently, bringing active demand management capacity to 6.0 GW and total ba/t\\_t.ligaery capacity installed at those customers or directly connected with distribution and transmission grids to 123 MW.\n\nWith regard to the digital transformation, the decision to migrate 100% of applications to the cloud has enabled Enel to guarantee the continuity of supply of essential services even during the pandemic. The digitalization of plants and grids has enabled remote operation of our infrastructure, signi/fi.ligacantly reducing the number of interventions in the /fi.ligaeld. The complete transition to the cloud has also facilitated the adoption of continuous /fl.ligaexible working measures for all employees whose activities can be managed remotely. Between April and December 2020, approximately 53% of personnel worked remotely, suppo/r\\_t.ligaed by the robustness and resilience of the Group's digital infrastructures and the enhanced IT equipment swiftly made available to those without appropriate devices, enabling a massive transition to working from home.\n\nAmong extraordinary corporate transactions, in December 2020, the Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting of Enel Am\u00e9ricas approved the merger of EGP Am\u00e9ricas into Enel Am\u00e9ricas, as well as the removal of the limits in that company's a/r\\_t.ligaicles of association that currently do not permit a single shareholder to own more than 65% of shares with voting rights. In 2020, as pa/r\\_t.liga of the restructuring of the joint venture with General Electric, Enel Green Power No/r\\_t.ligah America closed the sale of 255 MW of hydroelectric capacity and 27 MW of wind capacity in Canada and 25 MW of hydroelectric capacity in the United States.\n\nFrom a /fi.liganancial point of view, on September 1, 2020, an equity-accounted perpetual hybrid bond of \u20ac600 million was issued, the /fi.ligarst of its kind for an Italian industrial group. At the same time, Enel also launched a voluntary purchase o/ff.ligaer for hybrid bonds maturing in 2076 with a nominal value of \u00a3250 million.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "In October, after the issue in 2019 of the world's /fi.ligarst general-purpose bonds linked to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), Enel successfully launched a \u00a3500 million 'Sustainability-Linked Bond', the /fi.ligarst of its kind in that currency. The issue is linked to the achievement of a target for the percentage of consolidated installed renewables capacity, in line with the commitment to achieve the United Nations SDGs. Thanks to its success on the market, Enel has obtained savings of about 15 basis points compared with /fi.liganancial instruments with the same characteristics but not linked to the pursuit of the SDGs.\n\n## Strategy and forecasts for 2021-2023\n\nThe energy transition, driven by the /fi.ligaght against climate change and facilitated by decarbonization, the electri/fi.ligacation of energy consumption and digitalization, is revolutionizing not only the energy sector but all areas of the economy, in a world in which the role of electricity will be increasingly signi/fi.ligacant.\n\nIn this context, it is essential to extend the time horizon of our strategic vision to the medium and long term. Guided by this intuition, in November 2020 the Group presented the new Strategic Plan with a vision that reaches 2030, placing the acceleration of the energy transition at the center of the strategy, which, in enabling sustainable and pro/fi.ligatable growth, o/ff.ligaers the concrete prospect of simultaneously generating signi/fi.ligacant shared value for all stakeholders and a satisfactory return for shareholders.\n\nWith the new Strategic Plan, the Group has indicated its direction for the next ten years, mobilizing approximately \u20ac190 billion between direct and third-pa/r\\_t.ligay investments, in order to achieve our objectives in a decade that promises to be full of oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities, to be seized through two complementary business models: the traditional Ownership model, based on direct investments to suppo/r\\_t.liga long-term sustainable development, in which platforms contribute to business growth and value maximization; and a new Stewardship model, in which the use of platforms enables new services, products and know-how by catalyzing third-pa/r\\_t.ligay investments.\n\nThe 2021-2023 Strategic Plan is ideally placed as the /fi.ligarst step in a growth path that spans the entire coming decade. The Group's ambitions are re/fl.ligaected in a marked increase in investments, both direct and indirect, to enable the acceleration of trends in decarbonization and electri/fi.ligacation.\n\nIn the 2021-2023 period, the Group expects to directly invest around \u20ac40 billion, of which \u20ac38 billion through the Ownership model, mainly in expanding and upgrading grids and developing renewables, and around \u20ac2 billion through the Stewardship model, while mobilizing an additional \u20ac8 billion in investment by third pa/r\\_t.ligaies.\n\nThese investments will allow the Group to increase the renewables capacity it manages from around 49 GW in 2020 to around 68 GW at the end of 2023, with renewables capacity reaching around 70% of the total by the end of 2023.\n\nThe Group also plans to invest in improving the service quality and resilience of our distribution grids, in new connections and digitalization. The acceleration of investment will grow the Group's regulatory asset base (RAB) by 14% to about \u20ac48 billion in 2023.\n\nThe remainder of the investments envisaged in the plan will be allocated to the retail businesses and Enel X, to suppo/r\\_t.liga the electri/fi.ligacation of consumption by o/ff.ligaering new 'beyond commodity' services through platforms, generating an increase in the value of B2C and B2B customers of 30% and 45%, respectively, and suppo/r\\_t.ligaing the decarbonization of cities. In suppo/r\\_t.liga of these objectives, by 2023 the Group plans to achieve some 780,000 charging points, 10.6 GW of active demand management capacity and 5,500 electric buses globally.\n\nAbout 90% of 2021-2023 consolidated investment is in line with the United Nations SDGs and it is estimated that between 80% and 90% of investments will be aligned with the criteria of the European taxonomy, given their substantial contribution to climate change mitigation.\n\nThis testi/fi.ligaes to how sustainable development represents the intrinsic basis of our strategy, helping to direct all our actions towards increasingly sustainable and consequently less risky choices and approaches.\n\nThe Group's strategy is aligned with a target of reducing direct CO 2 emissions to 82 gCO 2eq /kWh by 2030, down 80% compared with 2017 in accordance with a scenario that limits global warming to 1.5 \u00b0C compared with pre-industrial levels, as ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligaed by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), and achieving carbon neutrality by 2050.\n\nAs for pe/r\\_f.ligaormance, the Group expects that ordinary EBITDA will reach between \u20ac20.7 and 21.3 billion by 2023, with a CAGR of 5%-6% over the results achieved in 2020. At the same time, ordinary pro/fi.ligat is expected to reach between \u20ac6.5 and 6.7 billion, with a CAGR of between 8% and 9%. The intrinsic sustainability of our business model, combined with a determination to achieve strategic objectives, has enabled Enel to establish a guaranteed /fi.ligaxed dividend per share that will increase over the Plan period to \u20ac0.43 per share in 2023.",

        "page_content": "## The Integrated Annual Repo/r\\_t.liga and materiality analysis\n\nAs an expression of integrated thinking, the Integrated Annual Repo/r\\_t.liga seeks to represent the capacity of the business model to create value for stakeholders in the sho/r\\_t.liga, medium and long term, ensuring the connectivity of the information it contains.\n\nThe Group maintains ongoing relationships with all stakeholders in order to understand and meet their repo/r\\_t.ligaing needs, taking account of the impo/r\\_t.ligaance of the impact of the Group's business model for all interests involved, with a view to creating shared value.\n\nThe /fi.liganancial and non-/fi.liganancial information presented within the various documents of the corporate repo/r\\_t.ligaing system are selected based on their materiality determined on the basis of speci/fi.ligac frameworks, methodologies and assessments.\n\nThe following represent the key principles underpinning the preparation of the Repo/r\\_t.liga on Operations, with the basis of preparation of the consolidated /fi.liganancial statements being discussed in the section 'Form and content of the /fi.liganancial statements'.\n\nThe Repo/r\\_t.liga on Operations includes /fi.liganancial and non-/fi.liganancial information selected on the basis of a materiality analysis pe/r\\_f.ligaormed in accordance with the requirements set out in Practice Statement 2 'Making Materiality Judgments', issued by the International Accounting Standards Board  (IASB),  with  speci/fi.ligac  consideration  of  the  United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (i.e. A/ff.ligaordable and Clean Energy (SDG 7); Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure (SDG 9); Sustainable Cities and Communities (SDG 11) and Climate Action (SDG 13)) and on the activities implemented to contribute to their achievement in order to meet the expectations of the main stakeholders in the Integrated Annual Repo/r\\_t.liga.\n\nThe Enel Group also pe/r\\_f.ligaorms the materiality analysis in accordance with the Sustainability Repo/r\\_t.liga.\n\nAs pa/r\\_t.liga of the analysis, the main stakeholders of the Group are identi/fi.ligaed and assessed on the basis of their relevance to the Group. They may prioritize business and governance issues, social issues and environmental issues. The priorities thus de/fi.liganed by the stakeholders are then compared against those of the Group and the business strategy. This joint view of the two perspectives makes it possible to identify the issues of greatest impo/r\\_t.ligaance both for the\n\nGroup and for the stakeholders (material issues), and to verify the 'alignment' or 'misalignment' between external expectations and internal impo/r\\_t.ligaance. The result of this analysis is represented in the Group's priority matrix (or materiality matrix), which, in giving a comprehensive view of all stakeholders, provides complete sustainability disclosure that incorporates the positive and negative impacts on society, the environment and the economy, and therefore the Group's contribution to sustainable development, as illustrated in the Sustainability Repo/r\\_t.liga.\n\nFor the purposes of the Integrated Annual Repo/r\\_t.liga, the issues that have a direct impact on the creation of entrepreneurial value were identi/fi.ligaed, applying a /fi.ligalter to so-called primary users, i.e. the '/fi.liganancial community' stakeholders. (1) The analysis identi/fi.ligaed the following three priority issues:\n\n- \u203a ecosystems and platforms;\n- \u203a sound governance and transparent conduct;\n- \u203a decarbonization of the energy mix.\n\nIn addition to the concept of materiality, the qualitative and quantitative /fi.liganancial and non-/fi.liganancial information reported in the Repo/r\\_t.liga on Operations have been prepared and presented in such a way as to ensure their completeness, accuracy, neutrality and comprehensibility.\n\nThe information contained in the Repo/r\\_t.liga on Operations is also consistent with the previous year, unless otherwise indicated.\n\nAccordingly, the Group applies the same methodologies from year to year, unless otherwise speci/fi.ligaed, in compliance with international best practices for integrated repo/r\\_t.ligaing and non-/fi.liganancial repo/r\\_t.ligaing.\n\nFor the purposes of preparing non-/fi.liganancial information, especially quantitative information, the Group mainly applies the provisions of the Global Repo/r\\_t.ligaing Initiative (GRI) Standard, in line with the Sustainability Repo/r\\_t.liga, and the 'Aspects' of the GRI supplement dedicated to the Electric Utilities sector ('Electric Utilities Sector Disclosures'). Consideration was also given to the indicators proposed in the white  paper  'Towards  Common  Metrics  and  Consistent Repo/r\\_t.ligaing of Sustainable Value Creation' of the World Economic Forum (WEF) and the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), the details of which are highlighted in the section below on the WEF and in the 'Pe/r\\_f.ligaormance & Metrics' chapter of this document.\n\nTaking account of the results of the priority matrix and the\n\n<!-- image -->",

In 2019, Enel, responding to the call for action from the United Nations, signed a commitment to act to limit the increase in global temperatures to 1.5 \u00b0C and be net zero across its entire value chain by 2050.\n\nThe business model delineates how the organizational units of the Company, linked to our three main businesses, must work to reap all the possible bene/fi.ligats from the main trends in the sector, possibly accelerating their implementation as well.\n\nThe role de/fi.liganed for all the major organizational units is also intended to enable them to e/ff.ligaectively address all the risks posed by developments in the rapidly changing energy industry.\n\nWorking transversally across organizational units, thanks to the platform-based digital models implemented to connect assets, data and solutions, it will also be possible to seize new oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities to create value through two complementary business models:\n\n- \u203a the Ownership business model, in which platforms are promoters of the business in suppo/r\\_t.liga of the pro/fi.ligatability of direct investments in renewables, grids and customers, suppo/r\\_t.ligaing sustainable long-term growth, in which platform-based operating models also play an impo/r\\_t.ligaant enabling role;\n- \u203a the Stewardship business model, in which the Group offers impo/r\\_t.ligaant services, products or know-how through platforms that mobilize investments, including third-party investors, to maximize value creation. More speci/fi.ligacally, this comprises:\n- -operating  platforms,  which  deliver  services  to  third pa/r\\_t.ligaies using know-how and best practices developed over time;\n- -business platforms, which generate new products and services and thus new business oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities for a broad range of customers;\n- -joint ventures and pa/r\\_t.liganerships, in which joint investment oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities foster the creation of value thanks to platforms that enable third-pa/r\\_t.ligay investments.\n\nIn this design, each Country organization acts within its territory in a matrix relationship with the broader and more Global Business Lines, managing activities such as relations with local communities, regulation, the retail market and\n\nlocal communication. The mission of each business can be summarized as follows:\n\n- \u203a Global Power Generation: the Group operates through this Business Line to accelerate the energy transition, continuing  to  increase  investments  in  new  renewable energy capacity, and manages the decarbonization of its generation mix and the countries in which it operates, always aiming to ensure the safety and capacity of electrical systems.\n- \u203a Global Trading: this Business Line manages our integrated margin as a single po/r\\_t.ligafolio in which Generation and Retail operations are always balanced e/ff.ligaectively. In addition, the line manages all trading operations on international desks.\n- \u203a Global Infrastructure and Networks: in developing and operating infrastructure that enables the energy transition, the Group ensures the reliability in the supply of energy and the quality of service to communities through resilient and /fl.ligaexible networks, leveraging e/ffi.ligaciency, technology and digital innovation, and ensuring appropriate returns on investment and cash generation.\n- \u203a End-user Markets: through its sales relationships with end users, the Group interacts locally with millions of families and companies. Thanks to our technology, the platform model enables us to improve customer satisfaction and the customer experience, while at the same time achieving ever higher levels of e/ffi.ligaciency. The business units optimize the supply of power to their customer base, maximizing the value generated by that resource and fostering long-term relationships with customers.\n- \u203a Enel X: this Business Line is enabling the energy transition by acting as an accelerator for the electri/fi.ligacation and decarbonization of customers, helping them to use energy more e/ffi.ligaciently, driving circularity and leveraging the assets of the Enel Group through the delivery of innovative 'beyond commodity' services.\n\nBy exploiting the synergies between the di/ff.ligaerent business areas, implementing actions through the lever of innovation and deploying Open Power approaches, the Enel Group seeks to develop solutions to reduce environmental impact, meet the needs of customers and the local communities in which it operates and ensure high safety standards for employees and suppliers.\n\n<!-- image -->",

An economic activity is de/fi.liganed as environmentally sustainable if:\n\n- \u203a it makes a substantive contribution to at least one of the six environmental objectives;\n- \u203a it does no signi/fi.ligacant harm (DNSH) to the other /fi.ligave environmental objectives;\n- \u203a it meets minimum safeguards.\n\nIn July 2018, the European Commission established a Technical Expe/r\\_t.liga Group (TEG) on sustainable /fi.liganance to develop recommendations for technical screening criteria for economic activities that can make a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation or adaptation while avoiding signi/fi.ligacant harm to the four other environmental objectives.\n\nBased on the contribution of the TEG and a wide range of stakeholders and institutions, the taxonomy regulation was published in the O/ffi.ligacial Journal of the European Union on June 22, 2020 and entered into force on July 12, 2020. Sta/r\\_t.ligaing from January 2022, companies which are subject to the obligation to publish a Non-Financial Declaration\n\n(NFD) must make public the share of their turnover, capital expenditure and ordinary operating expenditure that qualify as environmentally sustainable.\n\nBased on this approach, Enel has classi/fi.ligaed all its economic activities in the value chain into the following three categories:\n\nEligible: an economic activity that meets both of the following two conditions:\n\n- \u203a it was explicitly included in the European taxonomy regulation because it contributes substantially to climate change mitigation or adaptation;\n- \u203a it satis/fi.ligaes the criteria set out in the European taxonomy regulation for the two environmental objectives.\n\nIneligible: an economic activity that meets both of the following two conditions:\n\n- \u203a it was explicitly included in the European taxonomy regulation because it contributes substantially to climate change mitigation or adaptation;\n- \u203a it does not satisfy the criteria set out in the European taxonomy regulation for the two environmental objectives. Not covered: an economic activity that:\n- \u203a was not included in the European taxonomy regulation because it does not contribute substantially to climate change mitigation or adaptation and therefore no speci/fi.ligac technical criteria have been developed. The European Commission believes that this type of activity may not have a signi/fi.ligacant impact on climate change mitigation/adaptation or could be integrated into the European taxonomy regulation at a later stage.\n\nThe existence of this third category makes it impossible to achieve a business model that is fully compliant with the European taxonomy criteria, since currently some activities within the electric utilities value chain are not considered to substantially contribute to climate change mitigation.\n\n## Statement on the compliance of Enel's business with the European taxonomy\n\nAlthough the European taxonomy regulation establishes an obligation for companies to declare compliance with the taxonomy sta/r\\_t.ligaing from January 2022, given its impo/r\\_t.ligaance\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "for the /fi.liganancial community and policymakers, Enel has decided to highlight this in the 2020 Integrated Annual Repo/r\\_t.liga and in the 2020 Sustainability Repo/r\\_t.liga, to which reference should be made for fu/r\\_t.ligaher information.\n\nThe summary of results and results by Business Lines in the 'Pe/r\\_f.ligaormance & Metrics' chapter contain the results of the statement on compliance with the European taxonomy for the activities of the Enel Group in 2020 and 2019.\n\nIn analyzing these results, it is helpful to consider the following elements as they are relevant for the preparation of the statement:\n\n- \u203a the  statement  was  prepared  exclusively  following  the criteria established in the draft version of the delegated act of the European taxonomy concerning the climate change mitigation goal because at the time of the preparation of the 2020 annual repo/r\\_t.ligas the /fi.liganal version had not yet been published. Final publication could introduce impo/r\\_t.ligaant changes that might signi/fi.ligacantly a/ff.ligaect the result presented in this statement;\n- \u203a one change that could signi/fi.ligacantly a/ff.ligaect the /fi.liganal result concerns the manner in which the retail business segment will /fi.liganally be represented in the European taxonomy. Enel, together with other utilities, has asked the European Commission to include this business activity because, similarly to electricity distribution, it contributes substantially to climate change mitigation as an enabler of the decarbonization of other industries by promoting the electri/fi.ligacation of energy consumption;\n- \u203a Enel pe/r\\_f.ligaormed a detailed mapping of all its hydroelectric assets on the basis of the 'power density' metric required in the draft delegated acts. For plants with a power density lower than 5 W/m 2 , a fu/r\\_t.ligaher analysis was conducted to verify that the emissions (calculated over the entire life cycle) were below the speci/fi.ligac emission limit of 100 gCO 2eq /kWh. The /fi.ligandings indicated that 99% of the installed hydroelectric capacity is eligible in accordance with the European taxonomy criteria for climate change mitigation only, while only 1% - for which it was not possible to conduct a timely assessment due to the lack of robust data - was ruled out on a conservative basis;\n- \u203a in order to maintain this conservative approach, the business activity relating to the generation of electricity from geothermal sources was considered almost entirely ineligible pending ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacation by an independent third pa/r\\_t.ligay of compliance with the threshold for geothermal plants of 100 gCO 2eq /kWh for the entirety of Group's geothermal assets;\n- \u203a activities relating to the infrastructure and networks business in Chile, Colombia, Peru and Argentina were considered ineligible, again adopting a conservative approach. However, during 2021 an in-depth analysis will be pe/r\\_f.ligaormed for the distribution and transmission system, which\n\ncould lead to a change in eligibility status;\n\n- \u203a the Enel X po/r\\_t.ligafolio was analyzed at the Business Line and product cluster level, as it was not possible to associate all the /fi.liganancial metrics required by the European taxonomy with each individual product. However, as a precaution, only the Business Lines and product clusters that fully meet the criteria were designated as eligible, excluding the others (for example 'e-home' and 'distributed energy');\n- \u203a the  statement  was  prepared  without  pe/r\\_f.ligaorming  an exhaustive review of the DNSH criteria, which will be carried out once the delegated acts are approved in the second qua/r\\_t.ligaer of 2021. Nonetheless, Enel is con/fi.ligadent that it can demonstrate a high level of pe/r\\_f.ligaormance, as over the years it has implemented complete and comprehensive environmental management systems that go beyond legal requirements and are applied throughout the value chain. Additional information on Enel's environmental pe/r\\_f.ligaormance is available in the 'Environmental Sustainability' chapter of the 2020 Sustainability Repo/r\\_t.liga;\n- \u203a the European Commission has not yet /fi.liganished drafting the  delegated  acts  for  the  other  four  environmental objectives. The la/t\\_t.ligaer could strengthen the compliance of Enel's business model with the European taxonomy, considering that the current statement only covers the climate change mitigation objective;\n- \u203a the aggregates being analyzed refer to the 'sector' level and only include items in respect of third pa/r\\_t.ligaies. Accordingly, they do not include inter-sectoral exchange between sectors;\n- \u203a although not explicitly required, Enel has also pe/r\\_f.ligaormed an assessment in terms of the ordinary gross operating pro/fi.ligat, as it believes that this metric represents the effective /fi.liganancial pe/r\\_f.ligaormance of integrated utilities such as Enel. A metric that only considers revenue is strongly in/fl.ligauenced by business activities with a high volume of revenue (such as the wholesale market) that do not contribute propo/r\\_t.ligaionately to the growth of the gross operating pro/fi.ligat like other business activities.\n\nThe statement also gives a view that excludes 'not covered' activities to underscore the compliance of the Group for only the economic activities for which the European taxonomy has developed criteria and therefore the most signi/fi.ligacant from the point of view of the climate change mitigation objectives.",

The board review also speci/fi.ligacally sought to verify the directors' perception of the Board's involvement with sustainability issues and the integration of sustainability into corporate strategy.\n\n- \u203a The Board of Directors and the Board of Statutory Auditors have approved, each within their own sphere of competence, speci/fi.ligac diversity policies that set out the characteristics considered optimal for the members of these bodies, so that each can exercise their duties most e/ff.ligaectively, taking decisions that can e/ff.ligaectively draw on the contribution of a plurality of quali/fi.ligaed points of view, able to examine the issues under discussion from di/ff.ligaerent perspectives. The policy approved by the Board of Directors establishes that with regard to the types of diversity and the associated objectives:\n- -the optimal composition of Board members should provide for a majority of independent directors;\n- -even when the regulatory provisions on gender balance expire, it is impo/r\\_t.ligaant to continue to ensure that at least one-third of the Board of Directors, both at the time of appointment and during its term of o/ffi.ligace, shall be made up of directors of the least represented gender;\n- -the international scope of the Group's activities should be taken into consideration, ensuring that at least one-third of directors should have adequate experience in the international arena, which is also considered useful for preventing the standardization of opinions and the emergence of 'group thought';\n- -in order to achieve a balance between the need for continuity and renewal in management, it would be necessary to ensure a balanced combination of people of di/ff.ligaering seniority - and age - within the Board of Directors;\n- -non-executive directors should have a management and/or professional and/or academic and/or institutional background such as to create a diverse and complementary set of skills and experience.\n- \u203a In July 2015 the Board of Directors also approved (and subsequently amended in February 2019) a number of recommendations aimed at strengthening the corporate governance of Enel subsidiaries with shares listed on regulated markets and ensuring the implementation of local best practices in this area by those companies. Among other issues, these recommendations concern the composition of the management body, with regard to which it is also suggested to integrate a diversity of professional and management experience and skills, combined, where possible, with a diversity of gender, age and seniority, without prejudice to the provisions of applicable local legislation.\n\nFor more detailed information on the corporate governance system, please see the Repo/r\\_t.liga on Corporate Governance and Ownership Structure of Enel, which has been pu-\n\nblished on the Company's website (h/t\\_t.ligap://www.enel.com, in the 'Governance' section).",

This system is embodied in a dynamic set of rules constantly  oriented  towards  incorporating  national  and international best practices that everyone who works for and with Enel must respect and apply in their daily activities. The system is based on speci/fi.ligac compliance programs, including: the Code of Ethics, the Compliance Model under Legislative Decree 231/2001, the Enel Global Compliance Program, the Zero-Tolerance-of-Corruption Plan, the Human Rights Policy and any other national compliance models adopted by Group companies in accordance with local laws and regulations.\n\n## Code of Ethics\n\nIn 2002, Enel adopted a Code of Ethics, which expresses the Company's ethical responsibilities and commitments in conducting business, governing and standardizing corpo-\n\nrate conduct on the basis of standards aimed to ensure the maximum transparency and fairness with all stakeholders. The Code of Ethics is valid in Italy and abroad, taking due account of the cultural, social and economic diversity of the various countries in which the Group operates. Enel also requires that all associates and other investees and its main suppliers and pa/r\\_t.liganers adopt conduct that is in line with the general principles set out in the Code. Any violations or suspected violations of Enel Compliance Programs can be repo/r\\_t.ligaed, including in anonymous form, through a single Group-level platform (the 'Ethics Point'). In 2020, the Code was updated to re/fl.ligaect the main international measures concerning human rights and align the duties of the units responsible for updating the document with current organizational arrangements. In pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, the Code expresses  our  commitments  and  ethical  responsibilities in the conduct of business, regulating and standardizing corporate conduct in accordance with standards based on maximum transparency and fairness towards all stakeholders. In February 2021, the Board of Directors approved a fu/r\\_t.ligaher update of the Code of Ethics in order to align its content with the current context, including the current corporate mission and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, the current organizational structure and the system of procedures, as well as national and international best practices in the areas of diversity and privacy.\n\nWith regard to the Code of Ethics, the following table repo/r\\_t.ligas the average number of training hours per person, total repo/r\\_t.ligas of violations received and violations con/fi.ligarmed.\n\n|                                                                     |     |   2020 |   2019 | Change   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-----|--------|--------|----------|\n| Average number of hours of training per person                      | no. |   38.6 |   42.3 | (3.7)    |\n| Total repo/r\\_t.ligaed violations of the Code of Ethics received     | no. |  151   |  166   | (15)     |\n| Con/fi.ligarmed violations of the Code of Ethics  (1)               | no. |   26   |   38   | (12)     |\n| - of which violations involving con/fl.ligaicts of interest/bribery | no. |    2   |   10   | (8)      |\n\n- (1) The analysis of repo/r\\_t.ligas received in 2019 was completed in 2020.

It is a governance mechanism aimed at strengthening the Group's ethical and professional commitment to preventing the commission of crimes abroad that could result in criminal liability for the company and do harm to our reputation. Identi/fi.ligacation of the types of crime covered by the Enel Global Compliance Program - which encompasses standards of conduct and areas to be monitored for preventive purposes - is based on illicit conduct that is generally considered such in most countries, such as corruption, crimes against the government, false accounting, money laundering, violations of regulations governing safety in the workplace, environmental crimes, etc.\n\n## Zero-Toleranceof-Corruption Plan and the anti-bribery management system\n\nIn compliance with the tenth principle of the Global Compact, according to which 'businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including exto/r\\_t.ligaion and bribery', Enel is commi/t\\_t.ligaed to combating corruption.

This policy sets out the commitments and responsibilities in respect of human rights on the pa/r\\_t.liga of the employees of Enel SpA and its subsidiaries, whether they be directors or employees in any manner of those companies. Similarly, with this formal commitment, Enel explicitly becomes a promoter of the observance of such rights on the pa/r\\_t.liga of contractors,\n\nsuppliers and business pa/r\\_t.liganers as pa/r\\_t.liga of its business relationships.\n\nEnel conducts speci/fi.ligac human rights due diligence for the entire value chain in the various countries in which it operates. The process was developed in accordance with the main international standards such as the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the OECD guidelines and international best practices.

In total, around 170 actions have been planned, covering 100% of the operations and sites.\n\nWith regard to the sustainability of the supply chain, Enel evaluates suppliers' human rights pe/r\\_f.ligaormance, regardless of the level of risk, through a dedicated questionnaire in which the characteristics of potential suppliers are analyzed with regard to inclusion and diversity, protection of workers' privacy, veri/fi.ligacation of their supply chain, forced or child labor, freedom of association and collective bargaining, and application of fair working conditions (including adequate wages and working hours). During 2020, the questionnaire was supplemented with additional questions in order to obtain a more accurate assessment of the potential supplier. Among other things, the Group requires its contractors/providers and subcontractors to respect and protect internationally recognized human rights and comply with ethical and social obligations regarding: the protection of children and women in the labor force, equal treatment, the prohibition of discrimination, freedom of trade unions and the right of association and representation, the prohibition of forced labor, the protection of health, safety and the environment, the safeguarding of health and hygie-\n\nne conditions and compliance with regulatory, remuneration, contribution, insurance and tax requirements.

In pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, the following analyses are pe/r\\_f.ligaormed:\n\n- \u203a an analysis of macroeconomic, energy and climate scenarios: assessments and projections at the global and local levels to identify the main macroeconomic, energy and climate drivers in the sho/r\\_t.liga, medium and long term;\n- \u203a competitive  landscape  analysis:  a  comparison  of  the economic, /fi.liganancial, industrial, ESG (Environmental, Social  &  Governance)  pe/r\\_f.ligaormance  of  companies  in  the utilities sector and other industries (for example, automotive, technology, oil & gas) in order to monitor, shape and suppo/r\\_t.liga the Group's competitive advantage and leadership position;\n- \u203a industrial vision: an overview of the macro-trends in new technologies a/ff.ligaecting the company's business, with an assessment of the potential impacts on the Group's business based on a broad internal and external collaborative e/ff.ligao/r\\_t.liga to identify actions to prevent, adapt to and manage disruption and changes in our business.\n\nThe analysis of what is happening and what could happen in the external environment underpins the phase of designing our strategic options and consequent positioning and planning, which is structured into the following main activities:\n\n- \u203a strategic dialogue: the de/fi.liganition of the Group's strategy is based on a continuous process of active dialogue throughout the year, through which the issues relevant for the evolution and growth of the Group are identi/fi.ligaed, analyzed, discussed and addressed. This dialogue is pa/r\\_t.liga of a strategic design phase, where communication between executives in di/ff.ligaerent businesses makes a valuable contribution to developing new strategic options, with an emphasis on the need for cultural or organizational change and synergies between businesses. This process, which is coordinated at the Group level, /fi.ligarst involves the identi/fi.ligacation of topics through consensus among top managers and approval by the CEO. The next phase  of  the  strategic  dialogue  process  involves  the structuring of working groups with all the professional expe/r\\_t.ligaise necessary for the proper analysis of each topic.\n\nThey prepare dedicated workshops or strategic options to be discussed. This process enables the correct de/fi.liganition of the oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities associated with each speci/fi.ligac topic (including any operational, economic or /fi.liganancial impacts) and the eventual roadmap for implementing the necessary initiatives. These outputs are then discussed by top management in dedicated meetings. These meetings include one special event, called Top Team O/ff.ligasite, usually scheduled in June, where the most relevant topics are discussed by all top management. Following this meeting, some of the conclusions are incorporated in the Group's long-term planning, then become pa/r\\_t.liga of the storytelling and are presented to the Board of Directors at the Strategic Summit, usually organized in October in order to agree the annual update of the Strategic Plan. This type of framework enables adequate governance of the treatment of strategic issues, while at the same time ensuring swift identi/fi.ligacation of emerging trends and the necessary cross-business involvement for a complete analysis of complex and interdependent issues in the presence of an organizational structure based on the Country/Business Line/sta/ff.liga matrix;\n\n- \u203a strategic planning process: this process, which is driven on an ongoing basis by feedback from the strategic dialogue, transforms the information to be processed into quantitative models in order to obtain an overview of the industrial, economic and /fi.liganancial evolution of the Group, supplemented  by  possible  extraordinary  transactions and active po/r\\_t.ligafolio management operations. The evaluation of strategic options over a time horizon extends beyond that used in industrial planning, with (i) the de/fi.liganition and the quantitative and qualitative development of alternative macroeconomic, energy and climate scenarios against which overall strategy can be assessed, and (ii) analysis based on stress testing for various factors, including the evolution of the industrial sector, technology, competitive structure and policies;\n- \u203a long-term positioning: the analyses and decisions described in the previous points generate information for long-term positioning on multiple topics and the assessment of ambitions and targets for the Group;\n- \u203a analysis of ESG factors and assessment of materiality in the /fi.ligaeld of sustainability: the method Enel uses to perform ESG and materiality analysis was developed on the basis of the guidelines set out in numerous international standards (for example, the Global Repo/r\\_t.ligaing Initiative, UN Global Compact, SDG Compass, etc.), with the aim of identifying and evaluating priorities for stakeholders and\n\n<!-- image -->",

The investments will mainly be focused on the countries in which the Group has an integrated presence, but the involvement of a variety of areas will enable natural derisking of the volatility of renewable resources. To achieve this, the Group will capitalize on a pipeline of renewable projects (some 206 GW in December 2020), combined with a global platform-based model for business development, engineering and construction and  operation  and  maintenance  activities.  In  addition,  the Group plans to invest an additional \u20ac5 billion in the hybridization of renewable sources and storage systems, the potential of which is expected to reach around 20 TWh by 2030. Signi/fi.ligacant oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities will also come from the green hydrogen segment, in which the Group plans to integrate electrolyzers into renewables plants that produce electricity for direct sale or for dispatching services, while also selling green hydrogen to industrial customers. The Group plans to increase its green hydrogen capacity to over 2 GW in 2030.\n\nThe increase in renewables capacity and the simultaneous reduction in thermal capacity, which includes the early closure of coal plants by 2027, represent the two main strategic levers that the Group intends to use to decarbonize its generation mix.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Group will play an enabling role in the electri/fi.ligacation process, accelerating the  transition  of  customers  towards  sustainability  and energy e/ffi.ligaciency, combining its traditional range of services with 'beyond commodity' services. This business will bene/fi.ligat from the largest customer base globally, digital platforms and a growing integrated po/r\\_t.ligafolio of products and services. The Group's strategy will encompass all segments: B2C (business to customer), B2B (business to business) and B2G (business to government).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWith regard to the Stewardship business model, in 20212030 the Group expects to invest approximately \u20ac10 billion directly, while at the same time mobilizing some \u20ac30 billion in third-pa/r\\_t.ligay investments, for a total of around \u20ac40 billion, mainly in renewable energy, /fi.ligaber optics, electric mobility and /fl.ligaexibility services.\n\nIn pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, in the Customers sector, the two business models will promote customer value in all segments through combined product o/ff.ligaering:\n\n- \u203a in the B2C segment, the Group will promote the electri/fi.ligacation of the customer base through an integrated o/ff.ligaer of power and services o/ff.ligaered by Enel X. The volume of electricity sold on the free market in Europe is expected to increase by 2.5 times compared with 2020, reaching around 100 TWh in 2030 compared with 39 TWh in 2020;\n- \u203a in the B2B segment, the Group intends to be a leading energy pa/r\\_t.liganer for global and local companies on their path towards sustainability and energy e/ffi.ligaciency. Traditional products, such as PPAs, will be combined with new services, including /fl.ligaexibility services, solutions for electric mobility and the enhancement of circularity. The Group's gross margin in B2B operations in Europe is expected to reach \u20ac1.9 billion in 2030, compared with about \u20ac1.1 billion in 2020, driven by 'beyond commodity' services;\n- \u203a in the B2G segment, the Group will suppo/r\\_t.liga city governments in achieving ambitious long-term decarbonization and sustainability objectives, through the electri/fi.ligacation of public transpo/r\\_t.liga, supplementing the product range with digital mobility services (such as city analytics), intelligent lighting and other advanced services. By 2030, the Group expects to increase the number of electric buses to over 10,000 (12 times the number in 2020), while public lighting points are expected to exceed 4 million in 2030, up from 2.8 million in 2020 (up 1.5 times). In addition, charging points for electric vehicles are expected to increase to over 4 million and demand response solutions to grow by more than three times, to around 20 GW compared with about 6 GW in 2020.\n\nAcross the segments, the progressive digitalization of customer relationships, suppo/r\\_t.ligaed by the evolution of digital management platforms, should produce a substantial reduction in costs in real terms.\n\nThe strategic vision of an action based on sustainability, integrated along the entire value chain, will be rewarded by an increase in the value generated by the Group within the 'sustainability = value' strategic paradigm. It is expected that the Group's ordinary EBITDA will achieve a CAGR of 5%-6%, while ordinary net pro/fi.ligat will show a CAGR of 6%7% between 2020 and 2030.",

This growth will be driven by the renewables business, whose ordinary EBITDA is expected to rise to about \u20ac6.5 billion in 2023 (+\u20ac1.8 billion compared with about  \u20ac4.7  billion  in  2020),  while  ordinary  EBITDA  from thermal generation is expected to decline to about \u20ac1.2 billion in 2023, down from about \u20ac2.2 billion in 2020.\n\nIn the Infrastructure and Networks business, the Group expects to invest \u20ac16.2 billion over the three-year period, bringing average annual investment to around \u20ac5.4 billion. Of this, 65% will be dedicated to improving the service quality and grid resilience, about 23% to new connections and about 12% to digitalization. The acceleration of investments is also expected to expand the Group's RAB by 14%, reaching about \u20ac48 billion in 2023 (from about \u20ac42 billion in 2020).\n\nAt  the  operational  level,  the  number  of  end  users  is expected to increase to around 77 million in 2023, of which 64% equipped with sma/r\\_t.liga meters, from around 74 million in 2020 (of which 60% equipped with sma/r\\_t.liga meters). Furthermore, on the service quality front, the SAIDI and the system  average  interruption  frequency  index  (SAIFI)  are expected to decline by 12% and 14%, respectively. Therefore, the Group's networks are expected to become more e/ffi.ligacient, while net operating expenditure per user will drop to around \u20ac34 in 2023, from around \u20ac41 in 2020 (a reduction of 17%).\n\nThe  ordinary  EBITDA  of  Infrastructure  and  Networks  is expected to reach about \u20ac9.5 billion at the end of 2023, an increase of 23% compared with about \u20ac7.7 billion in 2020, thanks in pa/r\\_t.liga to e/ffi.ligaciency improvements linked to the implementation of operating platforms.\n\nThe remainder is associated with the Customers business, where the value of B2C customers is expected to increase by approximately 28%, while the value of B2B customers is projected to rise by about 45%, thanks to the expansion of the po/r\\_t.ligafolio of free-market customers and developments in the electri/fi.ligacation of energy consumption, which will drive demand for 'beyond commodity' services.\n\nIn the B2C segment, free market sales volumes in Europe are expected to increase by 55% (from about 39 TWh in 2020 to around 62 TWh in 2023). In the B2B segment, the  gross  margin  is  expected  to  increase  from  around \u20ac1.1 billion in 2020 to around \u20ac1.4 billion in 2023 (+27%), mainly thanks to 'beyond commodity' services. Finally, in the B2G segment, the Group plans to continue suppo/r\\_t.ligaing the transition of cities towards electric mobility, adding around 200,000 public charging points in 2021-2023 and contributing, with direct and indirect investments, to putting about 5,500 electric buses into circulation (up about 6 times compared with 2020). Street lighting is expected to expand from 2.8 million points in 2020 to about 3.4 million in 2023 (+21%).\n\nAt the end of the Plan period, Enel X aims to reach about 780 thousand public and private charging points - including interoperable points - available globally, up from about 186 thousand in 2020 (+4 times), approximately 10.6 GW of demand response capacity, up from the 6 GW o/ff.ligaered in 2020 (+1.8 times), as well as 527 MW of storage capacity, up from 123 MW in 2020 (+4.3 times).\n\nOrdinary EBITDA associated with the Customers business is expected to reach \u20ac4.5 billion at the end of 2023, compared with \u20ac3.4 billion in 2020, with a contribution of about \u20ac500 million from B2C, about \u20ac400 million from B2B, and about  \u20ac100  million  from  B2G.  E/ffi.ligaciency  improvements, driven by an operating platform that uni/fi.ligaes and digitalizes operations for customers, will contribute about \u20ac300 million to ordinary EBITDA in 2023.\n\nAt the Group level, the aggregate e/ff.ligaects of the Ownership and Stewardship business models will have a substantial impact on the creation of value, with ordinary EBITDA expected to reach between \u20ac20.7 billion and \u20ac21.3 billion in 2023, with a CAGR of 5%-6%. At the same time, ordinary pro/fi.ligat is expected to rise to between \u20ac6.5 billion and 6.7 billion in 2023, with a CAGR of between 8% and 9%. The Group expects to achieve these results thanks to the continuous optimization of Enel's /fi.liganance operations, notably an expansion of sources of sustainable funding, with a consequent reduction in the cost of borrowing.\n\n<!-- image -->",

For 2021, projections remain positive given the country's large foreign currency reserves and its low exposure to foreign debt payments;\n\n- \u203a in Colombia, despite the severity of the consequences of the pandemic (GDP contracted by 7.5%), expectations for 2021 are improving given the recovery of the oil sector and the absence of political instability in the medium term;\n- \u203a although Peru was among the hardest hit countries (GDP down 12%), its good /fi.ligascal and /fi.liganancial position together with rising mineral prices put the country among the area's favorites to post a strong economic recovery in the sho/r\\_t.liga term despite the political instability linked to the elections scheduled for next April, which could worsen the economic outlook.\n\nIn general, despite the fact that the prospects for an exit from the pandemic in 2021 have improved thanks to progress in vaccine development and the beginning of vaccine distribution, unce/r\\_t.ligaainty linked to the spread of new cases and the possible imposition of new restrictions persists, with its elimination depending signi/fi.ligacantly on the progress of vaccination on the global scale.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The reform includes the replacement of ce/r\\_t.ligaain benchmark indices, including the Euribor and LIBOR, with alternative risk-free benchmark rates.\n\nFor more details on the reform of the IBORs and the results of the analyses conducted by the Group, please see note 47.1 of the consolidated /fi.liganancial statements.\n\n## The energy industry\n\n## Energy - commodity conditions\n\nDuring 2020, the oil market experienced considerable volatility, with prices collapsing in the 1st Qua/r\\_t.ligaer, largely due to the impact of the pandemic, before pa/r\\_t.ligaially reversing the losses in the 2nd Half of the year, thanks to the gradual reopening of the world's major economies and sharp production cuts by the OPEC countries. At the beginning\n\nof December, Brent and WTI prices reached their highest levels since March, thanks above all to expectations for a recovery in demand fueled by the arrival of vaccines and the agreement reached in the last OPEC meeting to increase production sta/r\\_t.ligaing from January 2021, containing the fall in oil prices to about 33% compared with levels in 2019.\n\nThe gas market was also bu/ff.ligaeted by strong volatility during 2020, with the 1st Half of the year characterized by a contraction of almost 50% in prices on all the main European hubs compared with 2019. A combination of record levels of stocks, resilient supply and mild weather put pressure on prices. The restrictions on mobility imposed to counter the pandemic and the pressure of a market already experiencing clear oversupply also caused European gas demand to contract by 5%.\n\nIn the 2nd Half of the year, demand for gas recovered thanks to low coal and nuclear generation in Europe, reduced /fl.ligaows from Russia, the decline in LNG impo/r\\_t.ligas and the recovery of Asian demand, as well as an increase in demand for gas for heating, which returned prices to a level in line with the averages for 2019, even though they were still well below the annual average levels registered in 2017 and 2018.\n\n|       |       |   2020 |   2019 | Change   |\n|-------|-------|--------|--------|----------|\n| Brent | $/bbl |     43 |     64 | -32.8%   |\n| API2  | $/ton |     50 |     61 | -18.0%   |\n| TTF   | \u20ac/MWh |      9 |     14 | -35.7%   |\n| CO 2  | \u20ac/ton |     25 |     25 | -        |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

These e/ff.ligaects will probably become more pronounced in the 2nd Half of the century, with the impact increasing up to 2100. In the RCP 2.6 scenario, the e/ff.ligaects will be similar but less intense, with the trend slowing in the 2nd Half of the century, thereby producing a substantial di/ff.ligaerential between the two scenarios by 2100.\n\nThe climate scenarios are global in nature. Accordingly, in order to determine their e/ff.ligaects in the areas of relevance for the Group, a collaborative initiative has been sta/r\\_t.ligaed with the Ea/r\\_t.ligah Sciences depa/r\\_t.ligament of the International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP) of Trieste. As pa/r\\_t.liga of this collaboration, the ICTP provides projections for the major climate variables with a grid resolution varying from about 12 km 2 to about 100 km 2 and a forecast horizon running from 2030 to 2050. The main variables are temperature, rainfall and snowfall and solar radiation. Compared with the analysis conducted in 2019, the current study is no longer based on the use of a single regional climate model (that developed by the ICTP) but rather on the union of three models, selected as being representative of the ensemble of climate models currently available in the literature. This technique is usually used in the scienti/fi.ligac community to obtain a more robust and bias-free analysis, mediating the di/ff.ligaerent assumptions that could characterize the single model.\n\nIn 2020, future projections were analyzed for Italy, Spain and Brazil, obtaining - thanks to the use of the set of models - a more highly de/fi.liganed representation of the physical scenario.\n\nThe analyses carried out for the physical scenarios considered both chronic and acute phenomena. Some of these phenomena require an additional level of complexity, as they depend not only on climate trends but also on the speci/fi.ligac characteristics of the territory and require fu/r\\_t.ligaher modeling to obtain a high resolution representation. For this reason, in addition to the climate scenarios provided by ICTP, the Group also uses natural hazard maps.\n\nThis tool makes it possible to obtain, with a high spatial resolution, recurrence intervals for a series of events, such as storms, hurricanes and /fl.ligaoods. As described in the section 'Strategic risks and oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities connected with climate change', this tool is widely used within the Group, which already uses historical data to optimize insurance strategies. In addition, work is under way to be able to take advantage of this information developed in accordance with climate scenario projections.\n\n## Italy\n\nAcute phenomena: heat waves were de/fi.liganed in collaboration with the ICTP and Infrastructure and Networks to obtain the most appropriate description of the climate phenomenon for characterizing this critical event for the business.  The  conditions  identi/fi.ligaed  (persistence  of  high temperatures for at least /fi.ligave consecutive days with no precipitation)  were  sought  in  the  projections  to  20302050 provided by the ICTP, /fi.liganding an increase in both the frequency and geographical distribution of such events in all the scenarios analyzed.

The Group has analyzed it using the Fire Weather Index (FWI), which takes account of factors such as relative humidity, precipitation, wind speed and temperature. Days at extreme risk (2) were selected in the 2030-2050 period and compared with those in the 1990-2010 period. In all the scenarios analyzed, the number of days at extreme risk increases compared with historical levels, with di/ff.ligaerent intensities at the geographical level. In some regions, the RCP 2.6 scenario shows a slightly higher number of extreme risk days than the other scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) due to factors such as lower humidity, contributing to the /fi.ligare risk assessment.\n\nChronic phenomena: the average annual temperature is expected to increase over the 2030-2050 period in all scenarios analyzed. In pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, an average temperature increase of around 1.4 \u00b0C is expected in 2030-2050 compared with the pre-industrial period, falling with a range of between 1.1-2.0 \u00b0C for the RCP 8.5 scenario. In the RCP\n\n4.5 scenario, on the other hand, an increase of between 1.0-1.7 \u00b0C is expected with an average value of about 1.3 \u00b0C, while for the RCP 2.6 scenario the interval is 0.9-1.5 \u00b0C with an average value of around1.2 \u00b0C. The di/ff.ligaerential between the RCP 2.6 scenario and the RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios will grow signi/fi.ligacantly in the 2nd Half of the century. Chronic temperature changes can be analyzed to obtain information about the potential e/ff.ligaects on the cooling and heating demand of local energy systems. The indicators used to measure the thermal requirement are Heating Degree Days (HDDs), i.e. the sum, for all days of the year with a T average \u2264 15 \u00b0C, of the di/ff.ligaerences between the internal temperature (with T internal assumed to be 18 \u00b0C) and the average temperature, and Cooling Degree Days (CDDs), i.e. the sum, for all days of the year with T average \u2265 24 \u00b0C, of the di/ff.ligaerences between the T average and the T internal (assumed to be 21 \u00b0C), respectively, for heating and cooling requirements. In 2030-2050, the heating requirement is expected to decrease by 17% compared with 1990-2017, which is constant in all scenarios, while CDDs are always greater than historical data, with an increasing trend going from the RCP 2.6 scenario (+55%) to RPC 8.5 (+91%).\n\n<!-- image -->",

The panorama is varied and presents scenarios, sometimes from the same provider, which cover most of the spectrum delineated by\n\n## Global transition scenarios to 2040-2050 and temperature increase\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRenewable generation %\n\nThe available evidence, including the scenarios developed by the leading global agencies, indicates that the policies implemented by governments around the world are currently not su/ffi.ligacient to achieve the Paris objectives. (3) The most likely global climate pathway under existing policies, i.e. those declared by individual countries, is a RCP 4.5 scenario lying between RCP 2.6 and 8.5. Although it is a less ambitious path than the RCP 2.6, it is consistent with the policies approved or announced and which are unlikely to be disregarded.\n\nThe transition scenarios used by the Group globally are the result of the benchmark analysis of external scenarios and currently known policy objectives. For the main countries in which it operates, the Group develops consistent transition scenarios using system energy models. Where internal models are not available, risks and oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities are assessed through the analysis of scenarios produced by third pa/r\\_t.ligaies, as described above.\n\nthe potential temperature increase linked to the di/ff.ligaerent RCP trajectories: each scenario is associated, more or less strictly, with a speci/fi.ligac RCP and consequently with a range of temperature increase.\n\nThe scenarios can be divided into two macro-categories: those that, in accordance with the Paris Agreement, seek to limit the temperature increase compared with the pre-industrial period to less than 2 \u00b0C, and those that describe developments in systems that will lead to higher temperatures.

        "page_content": "4\n\nThe main assumptions considered in developing the transition scenarios concern:\n\n- \u203a local policies and regulatory measures to combat climate change, such as measures to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, increase energy e/ffi.ligaciency, decarbonize the electricity sector and reduce oil consumption;\n- \u203a the global macroeconomic and energy context (for example, gross domestic product, population and commodity prices), considering international benchmarks including those produced by the International Energy Agency (IEA), Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF), the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) and others. As regards the IIASA, for example, we have considered the fundamentals of commodity demand and the population underlying the 'Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs)',  which  project  di/ff.ligaerent  scenarios  describing socioeconomic  developments  and  policies  consistent with climate scenarios. The information from the SSPs is used, together with the internal modeling, to suppo/r\\_t.liga long-term forecasts, such as those for commodity prices and electricity demand;\n- \u203a the evolution of energy production, conversion and consumption technologies, both in terms of technical operating parameters and costs.\n\nOn the basis of the framework described, the transition scenario framework with which the Group conducted the impact analyses relating to the risks and oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities inherent in climate change envisages two scenarios: an 'ine/r\\_t.ligaial' (Referen-\n\n## PHYSICAL SCENARIO\n\n## TRANSITION SCENARIO\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nce) scenario, constructed mainly on the basis of existing or announced policies and speci/fi.ligac internal assumptions for the evolution of individual variables, and a more ambitious scenario (Brighter Future), consistent with the achievement of the Paris objectives, which presupposes more stringent targets for reducing carbon dioxide emissions or increasing energy e/ffi.ligaciency, as well as a possible acceleration in the reduction of the costs of ce/r\\_t.ligaain technologies. This second case assumes incremental growth in renewable generation and greater demand for electricity due to the greater electri/fi.ligacation of /fi.liganal consumption, mainly driven by more ambitious objectives in terms of energy e/ffi.ligaciency and decarbonization.\n\nOf course, if the countries with the highest emissions do not adopt e/ff.ligaective decarbonization policies, remaining on inertial or deteriorating paths, any pa/r\\_t.ligaicularly ambitious transition trajectories de/fi.liganed at the local level could coexist with climate change scenarios that are worse than the Paris scenarios. In fact, the ambitions of individual countries for mitigation actions are not su/ffi.ligacient on their own to determine the long-term trajectories of emissions and the consequent RCP pathways.\n\nTo develop the transition scenarios for the countries under analysis, the Group has equipped itself with quantitative tools that, given the assumptions regarding the evolution of policies, technologies and other contextual variables, produce the corresponding projections for energy demand, electricity demand, electricity production, penetration of renewables, electric vehicles, etc. In other words, all the relevant variables that characterize a national energy system with respect to the Group's activities.\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|",

        "page_content": "Once  the  medium/long-term  transition  scenarios  have been determined, the scenario framework makes it possible to conduct analyses of the longer-term chronic physical e/ff.ligaects determined locally by the climate pathways considered. One example is the analysis of the impact of the change in temperature on electricity demand. For this purpose, the Reference and Brighter Future scenarios for Italy and Spain have been supplemented with the Heating Degree Days and Cooling Degree Days under RCP 4.5 and RCP 2.6 respectively. It was thus possible to quantify the e/ff.ligaect that the change in temperature will have on energy demand (total, not just electricity) for cooling and heating in the residential and commercial sectors. The time horizon of the analysis is 2030-2050, where the current policies of the European Union connected with the carbon neutrality objective, in both the Reference and Brighter Future scenarios,  converge  towards  decarbonized  and  electri/fi.ligaed energy systems in 2050.\n\nThe use of integrated energy system models makes it possible to quantify the individual service demand of a country. This level of detail therefore makes it possible to discriminate the speci/fi.ligac e/ff.ligaects that a change in temperature can have on energy requirements. Considering the entire time horizon analyzed, the greater speed of the Brighter Future scenario in achieving carbon neutrality makes it more e/ffi.ligacient and electri/fi.ligaed than the Reference scenario. This di/ff.ligaerence in the speed of the transition leads to an average increase of between 3% and 4% in electricity demand in the Brighter Future scenario compared with the Reference scenario in the 2030-2050 period. When the e/ff.ligaect of temperature is also considered and the di/ff.ligaerences between the two scenarios associated with RCP 4.5 and 2.6 are analyzed, the average increase in electricity demand is less than 1% in both the Reference and Brighter Future scenarios. In the most extreme years, this impact can reach 2%. Considering the integrated view, the potential e/ff.ligaect of more ambitious transition scenarios has a more signi/fi.ligacant impact on electricity demand than the increase in temperature resulting from climate change.\n\nscenario with RCP 8.5, in addition to RCP 4.5. Assuming this additional increase in temperature, with the same energy transition, leads to an increase of less than 1% in demand in the RCP 8.5 Reference scenario compared with the RCP 4.5 Reference scenario.\n\n## Average impact on electricity demand (2030-2050) comparing RCP 2.6 and RCP 4.5\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWhile on the one hand the trends in degree days are similar, the substantial di/ff.ligaerence between Italy and Spain concerns the energy system in 2030. For the la/t\\_t.ligaer, in fact, the Reference scenario is very similar to the Brighter Future scenario, in line with the national energy plan, which is already very challenging. It follows that the temperature e/ff.ligaect between RCP 2.6 and 4.5 remains small as with Italy, less than 1% and in the same direction, and the transition e/ff.ligaect is negligible. (4)\n\nWhile the role of temperature is small for Italy and Spain, Brazil, another country of pa/r\\_t.ligaicular interest for the Group, could experience a more marked increase in demand in response to the increase in temperature, equal to a few percentage points of total demand. This would be driven by the higher cooling demand expected in the country. However, these estimates are subject to a signi/fi.ligacant degree of unce/r\\_t.ligaainty, given the signi/fi.ligacant volatility of Brazilian economic growth.\n\nIn order to investigate the e/ff.ligaect of temperature on transition scenarios fu/r\\_t.ligaher and at the same time expand the range of assumptions regarding climate change, a sensitivity analysis was carried out by associating the Reference",

Upside and downside developments may occur as time unfolds.\n\nBefore being able to approve the Strategic Plan, a quantitative analysis of the risks and oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities associated with the Group's strategic positioning is presented annually to the Control and Risk Commi/t\\_t.ligaee appointed by the Board of Directors. In pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, risk factors such as macroeconomic and energy variables (such as exchange rates, in/fl.ligaation, commodity prices and electricity demand), regulatory developments, weather and climate events and risks connected with the competition are identi/fi.ligaed.\n\nBased on the nature of the risk and oppo/r\\_t.ligaunity drivers, the analytical approach that best represents their volatility is selected. In practice, we pe/r\\_f.ligaorm a scenario analysis for all those variables whose market time series provide a robust foundation to estimate levels of correlation and representative volatility for future risk, and a deterministic analysis ba-\n\nsed on what-ifs and expe/r\\_t.liga judgments of the possible evolution of the business with respect to the main risk factors for the execution of the Business Plan.\n\nThe validity of the results is also monitored with ex-post analyses by risk cluster. In 2020, most of the actual upside and downside events fell well within the limits estimated by the risk models of the Strategic Plan presented at the end of 2019, despite the strong downside impact of the COVID-19 emergency.\n\nFocusing on the scenario risk analysis for the Strategic Plan, exchange rates, electricity demand and the volatility of energy and commodity prices represent almost all the volatility of the drivers. In pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, in addition to the US dollar the most impacting currencies are the Chilean peso, the Colombian peso and the Brazilian real. Neve/r\\_t.ligaheless, the Group's very structure ensures that the volatility of the South American currencies has only a negligible impact on pro/fi.ligat, as demonstrated in the presentation at the Capital Markets Day. Italy and Spain represent nearly all of the Group's exposure to the impact of the volatility of energy prices and commodity price /fl.ligauctuations on margins.\n\nExamining the other risk factors, such as those connected with weather and climate events, we can see that geographical diversi/fi.ligacation signi/fi.ligacantly reduces the exposure to the risk associated with renewable resources - a highly positive factor considering the Group's positioning and the steady  expansion  of  renewable  generation.  Fu/r\\_t.ligahermore, with regard to climate change, the risk associated with 'acute' events is managed as pa/r\\_t.liga of investment for adaptation to climate change and the Group's insurance strategy. With regard to risk factors estimated deterministically, the monitoring of all possible regulatory issues is crucial for assessing any upside or downside impact on the Group. In general, correlations between all the risk factors create diversi/fi.ligacation e/ff.ligaects that substantially mitigate total exposures.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This process also includes an assessment of the robustness of the country's institutions and the political context and an in-depth analysis of social phenomena, measuring the level of well-being, inclusion and social progress. To complete the analysis, a quanti/fi.ligacation of extreme climate events as a cause of stress at the environmental and economic level is also pe/r\\_f.ligaormed and the e/ff.ligaectiveness of the energy system and its positioning within the energy transition process is measured, as these are all essential factors for evaluating the sustainability of investments in the medium to long term.\n\nIn order to mitigate this risk, the model suppo/r\\_t.ligas the capital allocation and investment evaluation processes. To fu/r\\_t.ligaher suppo/r\\_t.liga the investment evaluation process, Enel has adopted a methodology called 'Total Societal Impact' that, adopting an integrated approach based on advanced economic models, clearly and robustly expresses the direct, indirect and induced impacts of investment initiatives at the national, regional or local levels. By quantifying standard international metrics, Total Societal Impact covers a wide range of economic, social and environmental indicators that play a strategic role in correctly assessing the social and environmental contribution of Enel's projects. In fact, considering some of the indicators that can be analyzed, such as the contribution to GDP, the increase in income of the weakest social groups, the calculation of carbon dioxide emissions avoided and the recovery of end-of-life materials from a circular economy perspective, it is clearly now essential to have a broad overview of the situation in order to evaluate a speci/fi.ligac project in a speci/fi.ligac country with a view to creating shared value for all.\n\nIn  2020,  the  world  economy  was  severely  impacted  by the COVID-19 pandemic, which spread rapidly around the world, signi/fi.ligacantly undermining the outlook for economic growth in the sho/r\\_t.liga to medium term. The crisis caused world GDP to contract by an estimated 4% on an annual basis in 2020, which should be followed by a rebound of around 5% in 2021.\n\nThe risks threatening the outlook for 2021 are mainly associated with the continued spread of COVID-19, which could generate a third wave of the disease in many countries, for-\n\ncing local governments to extend restrictions on mobility and services (especially in the ente/r\\_t.ligaainment, restaurant and tourist industries).\n\nRecent data show that growth prospects for 2021 are more optimistic than the previous year, thanks to recent developments in the production and subsequent distribution of vaccines. These changes have prompted an upward revision of forecasts, pointing to a signi/fi.ligacant rebound in the growth rates of many countries for 2021. However, there are severe risks associated with potential logistical obstacles to the production and distribution of vaccines that could slow the vaccination process and, consequently, delaying the emergence of many countries from the economic and health crisis. In addition, new variants of the virus have been identi/fi.ligaed that have signi/fi.ligacantly increased the number of cases in some countries (for example, the United Kingdom) and generated greater unce/r\\_t.ligaainty about the e/ffi.ligacacy of the new vaccines.\n\nThe governments and central banks of the major countries (/fi.ligarst and foremost, the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Bank of England) have adopted ultra-accommodative monetary policies (interest rates on re/fi.liganancing operations close to zero and large volumes of securities purchases on the market, ensuring the availability of inexpensive liquidity) and /fi.ligascal policies (subsidies) to suppo/r\\_t.liga the economic recovery and reduce the damage to the labor market. These actions have heavily burdened the budgets of governments and other institutions. The ability of institutions to continue to implement these expansionary policies in suppo/r\\_t.liga of the economy in 2021 is exposed to substantial risks.\n\nIn July, the European Council reached an agreement on a recovery plan, the Next Generation EU program, which envisages \u20ac750 billion in funding (around 5.5% of EU27 GDP  in  2019),  divided  between  loans  (\u20ac360  billion)  and grants (almost \u20ac390 billion) to Member States. The actual implementation of this plan depends on the national governments, who must present projects eligible to receive funding, and the methods of selecting projects vary at the country level. In this regard, Enel can turn to Total Societal Impact, which is an e/ff.ligaective tool for exploring the relevant aspects that meet the needs of the Green Deal when selecting investments.\n\nEconomic and socio-political risk factors in Latin America, one of the areas most severely a/ff.ligaected by the pandemic,\n\n<!-- image -->",

In pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, the political unce/r\\_t.ligaainty associated with presidential elections in Peru, the vote in a Chilean referendum at the end of 2020 for the creation of a new constitution by 2022, the Brazilian elections in the medium term and the presidential elections in Colombia in 2020 all contribute to fueling downward risks for the economic recovery, as they could push governments to  implement  populist  (/fi.ligascally  expansionary)  measures that may not be welcomed by investors, accelerating capital out/fl.ligaows from their respective countries. On the la/t\\_t.ligaer point, Brazil, which implemented a very generous /fi.ligascal measures in 2020 (around 8% of GDP) in order to suppo/r\\_t.liga families and stimulate domestic demand, now has debt equal to around 90% of GDP and a government de/fi.ligacit of around 14%, which undermine its resilience in the sho/r\\_t.liga-medium term. The possibility of a fu/r\\_t.ligaher extension of the family aid program ('Coronavoucher') in 2021 and delays in the approval of structural reforms could fu/r\\_t.ligaher compromise the economic stability and competitiveness of the country.\n\nFinally, Argentina, which has been in a recession since 2017, is concerned about its /fi.ligascal instability and the unce/r\\_t.ligaainties about ongoing debt restructuring negotiations with the International Monetary Fund.\n\n## Climate change\n\n## The identi/fi.ligacation and management of risks connected with climate change\n\nClimate change and the energy transition will impact Group activities in a variety of ways.\n\nIn order to identify the main types of risk and oppo/r\\_t.ligaunity and their impact on the business associated with them in a structured manner consistent with the TCFD, we have adopted a framework that explicitly represents the main relationships between scenario variables and types of risk and oppo/r\\_t.ligaunity, specifying the strategic and operational approaches to managing them, comprising mitigation and adaptation measures.\n\nThere are two main macro-categories of risks/oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities: those connected with developments in physical variables and those linked to the evolution of the transition scenarios. The framework described has been created with a view to ensuring overall consistency, making it possible to analyze and evaluate the impact of physical and transition phenomena within solid alternative scenarios, constructed using  a  quantitative  and  modeling  approach  combined with ongoing dialogue with both internal stakeholders and external authorities.\n\nPhysical risks are divided in turn between acute (i.e. extreme events) and chronic, with the former linked to extremely\n\nintense meteorological conditions and the la/t\\_t.ligaer to more gradual but structural changes in climate conditions.\n\nExtreme events expose the Group to the risk of prolonged unavailability of assets and infrastructure, the cost of restoring service, customer disruptions and so on. Chronic changes in climate conditions expose the Group to other risks or oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities: for example, structural changes in temperature could cause changes in electricity demand and have an impact on output, while alterations in rainfall or wind conditions could impact the Group's business by increasing or decreasing potential electricity generation.\n\nThe energy transition towards a more sustainable model characterized by a gradual reduction of CO 2 emissions has risks and oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities connected both with changes in the regulatory and legal context and trends in technology development and competition, electri/fi.ligacation and the consequent market developments.\n\nConsistent with the climate and transition scenarios used by  Enel  to  determine  risks  and  oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities,  the  main transition-related phenomena are beginning to emerge in relation to customer behavior, industrial strategies being adopted in all economic sectors and regulatory policies. By 2030, the transition trends will become visible in response to the evolution of the context: the Enel Group has decided to guide and facilitate the transition, preparing to seize all the oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities that may arise. As discussed previously, our strategic choices, which are already strongly oriented towards the energy transition, with more than 90% of investments directed at improving a number of the Sustainable Development Goals, enable us to incorporate risk mitigation and oppo/r\\_t.ligaunity maximization 'by design', adopting a positioning that takes account of the medium and long-term phenomena we have identi/fi.ligaed. The strategic choices are accompanied by the operating best practices adopted by the Group.",

Within climate change scenarios, the acute physical component plays a leading role in de/fi.liganing the risks to which the Group is exposed, both due to the broad geographical diversi/fi.ligacation of its asset po/r\\_t.ligafolio and the primary importance of renewable resources in electricity generation. Acute physical phenomena, in di/ff.ligaerent cases such as wind storms, /fl.ligaoods, heat waves, cold snaps, etc., are characterized by considerable intensity and a frequency of occurrence that, while not high in the sho/r\\_t.liga term, is clearly trending upwards in medium and long-term climate scenarios. Therefore, the Group, for the reasons described above, is\n\nalready managing the risk associated with extreme events in the sho/r\\_t.liga term. At the same time, the methodology is also being extended to longer time horizons (up to 2050) in accordance with the climate change scenarios that have been developed (RCP 8.5, 4.5 and 2.6).\n\n## Extreme event risk assessment methodology\n\nIn order to quantify the risk deriving from extreme events, the Group uses a consolidated catastrophic risk analysis approach, which is adopted in the insurance sector and in the IPCC repo/r\\_t.ligas. (5) Through its insurance business units and the captive insurance company Enel Insurance NV, the Group manages the various phases of assessing the risks connected with natural disasters: from assessment and quanti/fi.ligacation to the corresponding insurance coverage to minimize impacts.\n\nThe methodology is applicable to all extreme events that can be analyzed, such as wind storms, heat waves, tropical cyclones, /fl.ligaooding, etc. In all of these types of natural disaster, three independent factors can be identi/fi.ligaed, as brie/fl.ligay described below.\n\n- \u203a The  event  probability  (hazard),  i.e.  the  theoretical  frequency of the event over a speci/fi.ligac time frame: the re-\n\nrrence interval. In other words, a catastrophic event that has, for example, a recurrence interval of 250 years has a probability of occurrence in any given year of 0.4%. This information, which is necessary for assessing the level of frequency of the event, is then associated with the geographical distribution of Group assets.\n\nFor this purpose, the Group adopts the hazard map tool, which  associates  the  estimated  frequency  associated with an extreme event, for the di/ff.ligaerent types of natural disasters, with each geographical point of the global map. This information, organized in geo-referenced databases, can be obtained from global reinsurance companies, weather consulting /fi.ligarms or academic institutions.\n\n- \u203a Vulnerability, which indicates in percentage terms how much value would be lost upon the occurrence of a given catastrophic event. In more speci/fi.ligac terms, reference can be made to the damage to material assets, the impact on the continuity of electricity generation and/or distribution or the provision of electrical services to end users.\n\nThe Group, especially in the case of damage to its assets, conducts and promotes speci/fi.ligac vulnerability analyses for each technology in its po/r\\_t.ligafolio: solar, wind and hydroelectric generation plants, transmission and distribution grids, primary and secondary substations, etc. These analyses are naturally focused on the extreme events that most impact the di/ff.ligaerent types of technologies. This produces a so/r\\_t.liga of matrix that associates the signi/fi.ligacantly impacted type of asset with the individual natural catastrophic events.\n\n- \u203a Exposure is the set of economic values present in the Group's po/r\\_t.ligafolio that could be materially impacted in the presence of catastrophic natural events. Again, the dimensions of the analyses are speci/fi.ligac for the di/ff.ligaerent production technologies, distribution assets and services to end users.\n\nThe three factors described above (hazard, vulnerability and exposure) constitute the fundamental elements of any assessment of the risk associated with extreme events.

The two main programs, in terms of coverage and volumes, are the following:\n\n- \u203a the Prope/r\\_t.ligay Program for material damage to assets and the resulting business interruption. Accordingly, in addition to the costs of rebuilding assets (or pa/r\\_t.ligas thereof), the /fi.liganancial losses due to the stoppage of electricity generation and/or distribution are also covered, within the limits and conditions de/fi.liganed in the policies;\n- \u203a the Liability Program, which insures harm caused to third pa/r\\_t.ligaies, including the impact that extreme events may have on the Group's assets and business.\n\nBased on e/ff.ligaective risk assessment, it is possible to specify appropriate limits and insurance conditions within the policies, and this also applies in the case of extreme natural events linked to climate change. In fact, in the la/t\\_t.ligaer case, the impacts on the business can be signi/fi.ligacant but, as has happened in the past in various locations around the world, the Group has demonstrated a high degree of resilience, thanks to the ample insurance coverage limits, thanks in pa/r\\_t.liga to the Group's solid reinsurance capabilities through the captive company Enel Insurance NV.\n\nThe presence of this e/ff.ligaective insurance coverage does not make the actions that the Group takes in the preventive maintenance of its generation and distribution assets any less impo/r\\_t.ligaant. In fact, while on the one hand the e/ff.ligaects of these activities are immediately re/fl.ligaected in the mitigation of the impacts of extreme events, on the other hand they are a necessary prerequisite for optimizing and minimizing the cost of the Group's global insurance coverage programs for its risks, including the risk associated with natural catastrophic events.\n\nThe intensi/fi.ligacation of the e/ff.ligaects of climate change means it is essential to adopt adaptive behaviors: each catastrophic event represents a lesson learned for Enel, from which we draw inspiration to strengthen design techniques and preventive measures to ensure the resilience of the asset po/r\\_t.ligafolio.\n\nFrom this perspective, the method and the information extracted from the ex post analysis of events play a crucial role in determining the processes and practices to be deployed in mitigating such events in the future.\n\n## Generation\n\nWith regard to generation, over time the Group has implemented targeted measures at speci/fi.ligac sites and established ad hoc management activities and processes. Measures implemented for speci/fi.ligac sites in recent years\n\ninclude:\n\n- \u203a improving cooling water management systems for certain plants in order to counter the problems caused by the decline in water levels on rivers, such as the Po in Italy;\n- \u203a installing fogging systems to improve the /fl.ligaow of inlet air and o/ff.ligaset the reduction in power output caused by the increase in ambient temperature in CCGTs;\n- \u203a installing drainage pumps, raising embankments, periodic cleaning of canals and interventions to consolidate land adjacent to plants to prevent landslides in order to mitigate /fl.ligaood risks;\n- \u203a periodic site-speci/fi.ligac reassessments for hydro plants of /fl.ligaood scenarios using numerical simulations. The scenarios developed are managed with mitigation actions and interventions on civil works, dams and water inlets.\n\nThe Group adopts a series of best practices to manage the impact of weather events on power generation, such as:\n\n<!-- image -->",

A speci/fi.ligac policy has been developed (No. 486: 4R Innovative Resilience Strategy for Power Distribution Networks) to de/fi.ligane the measures to be taken both in preparation for an emergency within the network and for the prompt restoration of service once climate events have caused damage to assets and/or outages. The 4R strategy is divided into four phases.\n\n- \u203a Risk prevention: this includes actions that make it possible to reduce the probability of losing network components because of an event and/or to minimize its e/ff.ligaects, i.e. interventions aimed both at increasing the robustness of the infrastructure and maintenance interventions. The former, in pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, are not directed so much at impro-\n\nng service quality as they are at reducing the risk of prolonged and extended interruptions in the event of rare and high-impact critical events, using a probabilistic approach.\n\n- \u203a Readiness: this includes all measures aimed at increasing the speed with which a potentially critical event can be identi/fi.ligaed,  ensuring  coordination  with  Civil  Protection authorities and local institutions and preparing the necessary resources once a grid disruption has occurred.\n- \u203a Response: this represents the phase in which the operational capacity to cope with an emergency upon the occurrence of an extreme event is assessed. It is directly related to the ability to mobilize operational resources in the /fi.ligaeld and the capacity to remotely restore power supply through resilient backup systems.\n- \u203a Recovery: this is the last phase, in which the goal is to return the network to ordinary operating conditions as soon as possible in cases where an extreme weather event has caused service interruptions despite the increased resilience measures taken previously.\n\nFollowing this approach, the Business Line has prepared various policies for speci/fi.ligac actions to address the various aspects and risks associated with climate change.

In this manner, actions are selected that, when implemented, will minimize the impact on the network of pa/r\\_t.ligaicularly critical extreme events in a given area/region. The policy therefore covers the /fi.ligarst two phases of the 4R approach, suggesting measures regarding risk prevention and readiness.\n\nIn Italy, this policy has already been implemented through the Resilience Plan that e-distribuzione has prepared each year since 2017, which represents an addendum to the Development Plan for investments over a 3-year time horizon to reduce the impact of extreme events in ce/r\\_t.ligaain critical areas, namely heat waves, icing and windstorms (with the associated risk of falling trees). In 2017-2019, some \u20ac400 million were invested and a similar amount will be invested in the following three-year period (about \u20ac130 million/year), as speci/fi.ligaed in the addendum to the 2020-2022 Plan, a/ff.ligaecting approximately 3 million customers and up to 4,000 km of medium voltage lines. For example, in the case of icing, a phenomenon linked to the breakage of the conductors of overhead lines in the event of accumulation of wet snow, the risk of such interruptions has been assessed on the basis of the probability of losing segments of the grid and then calculating the relative impact in terms of customers without power and the loss in terms of power not delivered. To address these risks, investments include the targeted replacement of uninsulated lines with insulated conductors, the creation of less vulnerable alternative routes to restore power and the use of remote control systems to isolate the section of the grid a/ff.ligaected by the fault as quickly as possible.\n\nAs in Italy, similar issues are being explored in other countries, both in Europe and South America, in order to prepare an ad-hoc investment planning process to enhance the resilience of networks to extreme events, taking due account of the distinctive characteristics of each territory.\n\nAn integrated approach is taken to the emergency management approach applied in the case of forest /fi.ligares, both where they are caused by the grid itself and where they are of external origin, that could potentially threaten Enel plants. The document provides guidelines to be implemented in the various territories involved to identify areas/plants at risk, de/fi.ligane speci/fi.ligac prevention measures (e.g. evaluation of speci/fi.ligac maintenance plans and any upgrades) and, in the event of a /fi.ligare, manage the emergency optimally in order to limit its impact and restore service as soon as possible.\n\nThese include the implementation of systems for weather forecasting, monitoring the status of the network and evaluating the impact of critical climate phenomena on the network, the preparation of operational plans and the organization of speci/fi.ligac exercises. Pa/r\\_t.ligaicularly impo/r\\_t.ligaant in this regard are advance agreements for the mobilization of extraordinary resources to respond to emergencies, comprising both internal personnel and contractors.\n\nMoreover, with a view not only to assessing weather emergencies in the sho/r\\_t.liga/medium term, but also in consideration of the climate change we are witnessing, Infrastructure  and  Networks  is  collaborating  with  leading  research institutes to analyze trends in most critical threats (Table 1) to the assets of the power distribution network in the various countries in which the Group operates, and to esti-\n\nmate their future impact on the network in the medium and long term. The following are some examples.\n\n## Heat waves\n\n- \u203a During 2020, heat waves in the countries in which Infrastructure and Networks operates were investigated further.

These analyses have provided initial results for Italy, given the especially extensive historical records of such events and the experience gained with the measures provided for in the Resilience Plan. In light of the climate scenarios developed to evaluate trends in heat waves in Italy and the historical correlation of the extreme event-costs, taking a pa/r\\_t.ligaicularly critical year as a reference (2017, selected both because of the intensity of heat waves that year and their extension across the entire country), an initial estimate was obtained for any costs associated with an increase in heat waves in 2030-2050.

Similar e/ff.ligaects are highly likely in other areas, such as No/r\\_t.ligah America.\n\nWith regard to the electri/fi.ligacation of consumption, however, the Brighter Future scenario envisages higher penetration rates of the most e/ffi.ligacient electrical technologies. In particular, a substantial increase in electric vehicles and heating/cooling systems based on heat pumps would give rise to a 5% increase in demand compared with the Reference scenario, with positive impacts both on the Retail business and on the 'beyond commodity' services o/ff.ligaered by Enel X. The greater penetration of heat pumps could at the same time lead to a reduction in gas sales in the Retail segment as a result of gradual switching to electricity. However, it is expected that the overall e/ff.ligaect on EBITDA pe/r\\_f.ligaormance would be positive, accompanied by a reduction in Scope 3 CO 2 emissions connected with the SBTi targets.\n\nAs noted above, the Brighter Future scenario will entail a considerable increase in the complexities that will have to be managed by grids in the various geographical areas.\n\nIn fact, we expect a signi/fi.ligacant increase in distributed generation and other resources, such as storage systems, the greater penetration of electric mobility with the related charging infrastructures, as well as the growing rate of electri/fi.ligacation of consumption and the appearance of new actors with new modes of consumption.\n\nThese developments will lead to the decentralization of power withdrawal/injection points, an increase in electricity demand and the average power required, and strong variability of energy /fl.ligaows, requiring dynamic and /fl.ligaexible management of the network. The Group, therefore, expects that in this scenario incremental investments will be needed to ensure connections and adequate levels of quality and resilience, encouraging the adoption of innovative operating models. These investments must be accompanied by consistent policy and regulatory scenarios to ensure adequate /fi.liganancial returns within the distribution Business Line.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Fu/r\\_t.ligahermore, in order to meet its medium and long-term commitments, Enel pursues a borrowing strategy that provides for a diversi/fi.ligaed structure of funding sources, which it uses to meet its /fi.liganancial needs, and a balanced maturity pro/fi.ligale.\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Group, while solvent, would not be able to discharge its obligations in a timely manner or would only be able to do so on unfavorable terms or in the presence of constraints on disinvestment from assets with consequent capital losses, owing to situations of tension or systemic crises (credit crunches, sovereign debt crises, etc.) or changes in the perception of Group riskiness by the market.\n\nAmong the factors that de/fi.ligane the risk perceived by the market, the credit rating assigned to Enel by rating agencies plays a decisive role, since it in/fl.ligauences its ability to access sources of /fi.liganancing and the related /fi.liganancial terms of that /fi.liganancing. A deterioration in the credit rating could therefore restrict access to the capital market and/or increase of the cost of funding, with consequent negative e/ff.ligaects on the /fi.liganancial position, /fi.liganancial pe/r\\_f.ligaormance and cash /fl.ligaows of the Group. In 2020, Enel's risk pro/fi.ligale did not change compared with 2019. Accordingly, at the end of the year, Enel's rating was: (i) 'BBB+' with a stable outlook for Standard & Poor's; (ii) 'A-' with a stable outlook for Fitch; and (iii) 'Baa2' with a positive outlook for Moody's. On January 15, 2021, Moody's increased its Enel rating to Baa1. The upgrade re/fl.ligaected the progress achieved in improving the\n\n<!-- image -->",

Cyber a/t\\_t.ligaacks have evolved dramatically in recent years: their number has grown exponentially, as has their complexity and impact (theft of company data on customers), making it increasingly di/ffi.ligacult to promptly identify the source of threats. In the case of the Enel Group, this exposure re/fl.ligaects the many environments in which it operates (data, industry and people), a circumstance that accompanies the intrinsic complexity and interconnection of the resources that over the years have been increasingly integrated into the Group's daily operating processes.\n\nThe Group has adopted a holistic governance approach to cyber security that is applied to all the sectors of IT (Information Technology), OT (Operational Technology) and IoT (Internet of Things). The framework is based on the commitment of top management, on global strategic management, on the involvement of all business areas as well as on the units involved in the design and management of our systems. It seeks to use cu/t\\_t.ligaing edge technologies, to design ad hoc business processes, to strengthen people's IT awareness and to implement regulatory requirements for IT security.\n\nIn addition, the Group has developed an IT risk management methodology founded on 'risk-based' and 'cyber security by design' approaches, thus integrating the analysis of business risks into all strategic decisions. Enel has also created its own Cyber Emergency Readiness Team (CERT) in order to proactively respond to any IT security incidents.\n\nFinally, back in 2019, the Group also took out an insurance policy for cyber security risks in order to mitigate IT threats.\n\nThe Group is carrying out a complete digital transformation of how it manages the entire energy value chain, developing new business models and digitizing its business processes, integrating systems and adopting new technologies. A consequence of this digital transformation is that the Group is increasingly exposed to risks related to the functioning of the IT systems, which are integrated across the Company with impacts on processes and operations, which could expose IT and OT systems to service interruptions or data losses.\n\nThese risks are managed using a series of internal measures developed by the Global Digital Solutions (GDS) unit, which is responsible for guiding the Group's digital transformation. It has set up an internal control system that introduces control points along the entire IT value chain, enabling us to prevent the emergence of risks engendered by such issues as the creation of services that do not meet business needs, the failure to adopt adequate security measures and service interruptions. The internal control system of the Global Digital Solutions unit oversees both the activities pe/r\\_f.ligaormed in-house and those outsourced to external associates and service providers. Fu/r\\_t.ligahermore, Enel is promoting the dissemination of a digital culture and digital skills within the Group in order to successfully guide the digital transformation and minimize the associated risks.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n/r\\_t.liga\n\n/r\\_t.liga\n\nCYBER SECURITY\n\nDIGITALIZATION, IT EFFECTIVENESS AND SERVICE CONTINUITY",

These risks were identi/fi.ligaed through an analysis of the main events that have occurred in the last three years. In pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, in terms of probability of occurrence, mechanical incidents (falls, collisions, crushing and cuts) are the most common, while the most severe in terms of potential associated impact are electrical incidents (possibly fatal injuries).\n\nIn addition, in relation to the presence of the Group in di/ff.ligaerent areas of the world, employees and contractors could be exposed to health risks connected with potential emerging infectious diseases of a pandemic and potentially pandemic nature, which could have an impact on their health and well-being.\n\nEnel has adopted a Declaration of Commitment to Health and Safety, signed by the Group's top management.\n\nIn implementing the policy, each Group Business Line has its own Occupational Health and Safety Management System compliant with the international standard BS OHSAS 18001, which is based on the identi/fi.ligacation of hazards, the qualitative and quantitative assessment of risks, the planning and implementation of prevention and protection measures, the veri/fi.ligacation of the e/ff.ligaectiveness of the prevention and protection measures and any corrective actions. This system also considers the rigor employed in the selection and management of contractors and suppliers and the promotion of their involvement in programs for continuous improvement of safety pe/r\\_f.ligaormance. The Enel Group has de/fi.liganed a structured health management system, based on prevention and protection measures, which also plays a role in the development of a corporate culture aimed at promoting the psycho-physical health and organizational well-being of workers, as well as helping to balance personal and professional life.\n\nFu/r\\_t.ligahermore, with regard to emergencies relating to health, safety and the environment, a unit has been set up within the HSEQ depa/r\\_t.ligament of the Parent with liaisons in each Business Line and Country in order to ensure the de/fi.liganition of the global strategy and policies for emergency management and their adoption in every Group organization. In pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, this organizational structure and the related management processes make it possible to direct, integrate and monitor, both at Group level and in the individual countries in which it operates, all the prevention, protection and intervention actions aimed at protecting the health of employees and contractors, also in relation to exogenous health risk factors that may not be strictly related to work activities.\n\nHEALTH AND SAFETY",

In some cases, the synergistic e/ff.ligaects between these impacts, such as global warming and the increasing exploitation and degradation of water resources, have increased the risk of environmental emergencies in the most sensitive areas of the planet, with the risk of sparking competition among di/ff.ligaerent uses of water resources such as industrial, agricultural and civil uses.\n\nIn response to these needs, governments have imposed increasingly restrictive environmental regulations, placing ever more stringent constraints on the development of new industrial initiatives and, in the most impactful industries, incentivizing or requiring the elimination of technologies no longer considered sustainable.\n\nIn this context, companies in every sector, and above all industry leaders, are ever more aware that environmental risks are economic risks. As a result, they are called upon to increase their commitment and accountability for developing and adopting innovative and sustainable technical solutions and development models.\n\nEnel has made the e/ff.ligaective prevention and minimization of environmental impacts and risks a foundational element of each project across its entire life cycle.\n\nThe  adoption  of  ISO  14001-ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligaed  environmental  management  systems  across  the  entire Group ensures the implementation of structured policies and procedures to identify and manage the environmental risks and oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities associated with all corporate activities. A structured control plan combined with improvement actions and objectives inspired by the best environmental practices, with requirements exceeding those for simple environmental regulatory compliance, mitigate the risk of impacts on the environment, reputational damage and litigation. Also contributing are the multitude of actions to achieve the challenging environmental improvement objectives set by Enel, such as those regarding atmospheric emissions, waste production and water consumption, especially in areas with high water stress.\n\nThe risk of water scarcity is directly mitigated by Enel's development strategy, which is based on the growth of generation from renewable sources that are essentially not dependent on the availability of water for their operation. Special a/t\\_t.ligaention is also devoted to assets in areas with a high level of water stress, in order to develop technological solutions to reduce consumption. Ongoing collaboration with local river basin management authorities enables us to adopt the most e/ff.ligaective shared strategies for the sustainable management of hydroelectric generation assets. Finally, appropriate terrestrial, marine and river monitoring actions are being implemented in ecosystems to verify the e/ff.ligaectiveness of the measures adopted to protect, restore and conserve\n\nbiodiversity.\n\nThe purchasing processes of Global Procurement and the associated governance documents form a structured system of rules and control points that make it possible to combine the achievement of economic business objectives with full compliance with the fundamental principles set out in the Code of Ethics, the Enel Global Compliance Program, the Zero-Tolerance-of-Corruption Plan and the Human Rights Policy, without renouncing the promotion of initiatives for sustainable economic development. The procedures governing procurement processes are all designed to ensure conduct imbued with the utmost respect for key values such as loyalty, professionalism, collaboration, transparency and traceability of decision-making processes.\n\nThese principles have been incorporated into the organizational processes and controls that Enel has voluntarily decided to adopt in order to establish relationships of trust with all its stakeholders, as well as de/fi.ligane stable and constructive relationships that are not based exclusively on ensuring /fi.liganancial competitiveness but also take account of best practices in essential areas for the Group,\n\n<!-- image -->",

Enel uses the quali/fi.ligacation system - even before the procurement process begins - to verify that its potential suppliers are in line with its strategic vision and expectations in all the areas mentioned and that they are inspired by the same values.\n\nThe global supplier quali/fi.ligacation system enables the accurate assessment of companies wishing to pa/r\\_t.ligaicipate in procurement procedures and represents a guarantee for Enel, since it gives the Group an updated list of suppliers of proven reliability to draw from and makes it possible, in compliance with applicable regulations, to call on suppliers in procurement tenders initiated by Group companies.

Direct procurement without a competitive tender can only be used in exceptional cases, duly motivated, in compliance with applicable legislation.\n\nThe e/ff.ligaectiveness of supply chain risk management is monitored using a number of pe/r\\_f.ligaormance indicators (including the concentration of contracts with individual suppliers or industrial groups, the supplier's dependence on Enel, the turnover rate of suppliers, etc.), for which thresholds are speci/fi.ligaed that guide the de/fi.liganition of the procurement strategy.\n\nThe actions taken to counter the impact of the COVID-19 emergency have focused in di/ff.ligaerentiating supply sources to avoid interruptions in the supply chain and the remote pe/r\\_f.ligaormance of activities that would ordinarily require physical interaction between Enel and the supplier (e.g. inspections at the company).\n\nThe profound transformations of the energy sector, which has experienced sweeping technological developments, require companies in the industry to recruit people with new experience and professional skills, as well as imposing the need for major cultural and organizational changes. Organizations must move to adopt new, agile and /fl.ligaexible business models. Policies to enhance diversity and to manage and promote talent have become key factors for companies that are managing the transition and have a widespread geographical presence.\n\nEnel places the people who work for it at the center of its business model: the management of human capital is a priority for which speci/fi.ligac objectives have been established. The main goals include: the development of the digital capabilities and skills made necessary by the Fou/r\\_t.ligah Industrial Revolution, as well as the promotion of reskilling and upskilling programs for employees in order to suppo/r\\_t.liga the energy transition; the e/ff.ligaective involvement of employees in the pursuit of the corporate purpose, which ensures the achievement of be/t\\_t.ligaer results while o/ff.ligaering greater satisfaction to our people; the development of systems for evaluating the working environment and pe/r\\_f.ligaormance; the dissemination of diversity and inclusion policies to all countries in which the Group operates, as well as instilling an inclusive organizational culture based on the principles of non-discrimination and equal oppo/r\\_t.ligaunity, a key driver in ensuring that everyone can make an e/ff.ligaective contribution. In addition, Enel is developing speci/fi.ligac initiatives to foster the di/ff.ligausion of agile working methods in business processes. The Group is commi/t\\_t.ligaed to enhancing the resilience and /fl.ligaexibility of organizational models through simpli/fi.ligacation and digitalization in order to enable the e/ff.ligaectiveness and autonomy of our people within new /fl.ligaexible working schemes, which have already been e/ff.ligaectively tested in the response to the COVID-19 pandemic emergency, which will be a key element of future approaches to work.",

Consequently, the Group's new business model requires the management of an increasingly large and growing volume of personal data in order to achieve the /fi.liganancial and business results envisaged in the 2021-2023 Strategic Plan.\n\nThis exposes Enel to the risks connected with the protection of personal data (an issue that must also take account of the substantial growth in privacy legislation in most of the countries in which Enel operates). These risks may result in the loss of con/fi.ligadentiality, integrity or availability of the personal information of our customers, employees and others (e.g. suppliers), with the risk of incurring /fi.liganes determined on the basis of global turnover, the prohibition of the use of ce/r\\_t.ligaain processes and consequent /fi.liganancial losses and reputational harm.\n\nIn order to manage and mitigate this risk, Enel has adopted a model for the global governance of personal data that provides for the establishment of positions responsible for privacy issues at all levels (including the appointment of Data Protection O/ffi.ligacers at the global and country levels) and digital compliance tools to map applications and processes and manage risks with an impact on protecting personal data, in compliance with speci/fi.ligac local regulations in this /fi.ligaeld.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n/r\\_t.liga\n\n/r\\_t.liga\n\n/r\\_t.liga\n\n/r\\_t.liga\n\n/r\\_t.liga\n\n/r\\_t.liga\n\n/r\\_t.liga\n\n/r\\_t.liga\n\n/r\\_t.liga\n\nRISKS CONNECTED WITH THE PROTECTION OF PERSONAL DATA\n\n/r\\_t.liga/r\\_t.liga\n\n/r\\_t.liga/r\\_t.liga",

        "page_content": "## DEFINITION OF PERFORMANCE INDICATORS\n\nIn order to present the results of the Group and the Parent and analyze their /fi.liganancial structure, Enel has prepared separate reclassi/fi.ligaed schedules that di/ff.ligaer from the schedules envisaged under the IFRS-EU adopted by the Group and Enel SpA and presented in the consolidated and separate /fi.liganancial statements, respectively. These reclassi/fi.ligaed schedules contain di/ff.ligaerent pe/r\\_f.ligaormance indicators from those obtained directly from the consolidated and separate /fi.liganancial statements, which management believes are useful in monitoring the pe/r\\_f.ligaormance of the Group and the Parent and representative of the /fi.liganancial pe/r\\_f.ligaormance of our business.\n\nWith  regard  to  those  indicators,  on  December  3,  2015, CONSOB issued Communication no. 92543/2015, which gives force to the Guidelines issued on October 5, 2015, by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) concerning  the  presentation  of  alternative  pe/r\\_f.ligaormance measures in regulated information disclosed or prospectuses published as from July 3, 2016. These Guidelines, which update  the  previous  CESR  Recommendation  (CESR/05178b), are intended to promote the usefulness and transparency  of  alternative  pe/r\\_f.ligaormance  indicators  included in regulated information or prospectuses within the scope of application of Directive 2003/71/EC in order to improve their comparability, reliability and comprehensibility.\n\nAccordingly, in line with the regulations cited above, the criteria used to construct these indicators are the following.\n\nGross operating pro/fi.ligat : an operating pe/r\\_f.ligaormance indicator, calculated as 'Operating pro/fi.ligat' plus 'Depreciation, amo/r\\_t.ligaization and impairment losses'.\n\nOrdinary gross operating pro/fi.ligat : de/fi.liganed as 'Gross operating pro/fi.ligat' from core businesses connected with the new Ownership and Stewardship business models. It does not include costs connected with corporate restructurings and costs directly a/t\\_t.ligaributable to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOrdinary  operating  pro/fi.ligat :  de/fi.liganed  as  'Operating  pro/fi.ligat'\n\nfrom core businesses connected with the new Ownership and Stewardship business models.\n\nIt is calculated by adjusting 'Operating pro/fi.ligat' for the effects of transactions not connected with core operations referred to with regard to the gross operating pro/fi.ligat and excluding signi/fi.ligacant impairment losses on assets and/or groups of assets following impairment testing (including reversals or impairment losses) or classi/fi.ligacation under 'Assets held for sale'.\n\nGroup ordinary pro/fi.ligat : it is de/fi.liganed as 'Group pro/fi.ligat' generated by Enel's core business connected with the new Ownership and Stewardship business models.\n\nIt is equal to 'Group pro/fi.ligat' adjusted primarily for the items discussed under 'Ordinary operating pro/fi.ligat', net of any tax e/ff.ligaects and non-controlling interests.\n\nLow carbon ordinary EBITDA : it is the ordinary gross operating pro/fi.ligat of the set of products, services and technologies included in the following Business Lines: Enel Green Power, Infrastructure and Networks, Enel X and End-user Markets (excluding gas).\n\nGross global value added from continuing operations : this is de/fi.liganed as value created for stakeholders and is equal to 'Revenue', including 'Net income/(expense) from commodity management' net of external costs de/fi.liganed as the algebraic sum of 'cost of fuels', 'cost of electricity purchases', 'costs of materials', 'capitalized costs of internal projects', 'other costs' and 'costs for services, rentals and leases', with the la/t\\_t.ligaer net of 'costs for /fi.ligaxed water diversion fees' and 'costs for public land usage fees'.\n\nNet  non-current  assets : calculated  as  the  di/ff.ligaerence between 'Non-current assets' and 'Non-current liabilities' with the exception of:\n\n- \u203a 'Deferred tax assets';\n- \u203a 'Securities'  and  'Other  /fi.liganancial  assets'  included  in 'Other non-current /fi.liganancial assets';\n- \u203a 'Long-term borrowings';\n- \u203a 'Employee bene/fi.ligats';\n- \u203a 'Provisions for risks and charges (non-current po/r\\_t.ligaion)';\n- \u203a 'Deferred tax liabilities'.\n\nNet working capital : calculated as the di/ff.ligaerence between 'Current assets' and 'Current liabilities' with the exception of:\n\n- \u203a 'Current  po/r\\_t.ligaion  of  long-term  loan  assets',  'Factoring\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "The Group's ambition for leadership in the /fi.ligaght against climate change was fu/r\\_t.ligaher strengthened in 2020: the target for the reduction of direct emissions from generation by 2020, which was set in 2015 at 350 g eq /kWh of CO 2 with a 25% reduction compared with 2007, had already been achieved in 2018, two years early. The year 2020 closed with a reduction of 40% in speci/fi.ligac emissions from thermal generation compared with the base year of 2007. In 2020, direct emissions of CO 2 equivalent (Scope 1) amounted to 45.26 million tons equivalent, a decrease of 35.3% on 2019. As noted earlier, the reduction is a/t\\_t.ligaributable to a decline in thermal generation a/t\\_t.ligaributable essentially to a sharp decline in coal-/fi.ligared generation as a result of the absence of\n\nthe contribution of the Reftinskaya plant, which was sold in 2019, and a concomitant decrease in Italy, Spain and Chile owing to the acceleration of the energy transition. In addition, generation by other higher-emission plants also declined in favor of renewable generation.\n\nThe electricity generated by Enel in 2020 from zero-emission sources amounted to 63.4% of total output, a signi/fi.ligacant increase compared with 2019 (54.9%) due to the increase in the contribution of solar and wind power.\n\nDue to the contraction in coal generation, SO 2 and pa/r\\_t.ligaiculate emissions fell sharply, with drops of about 83.1% and 91.7% respectively compared with 2019. NO x emissions also decreased by 40% due to the decline in thermal generation.\n\n## Responsible water resource management\n\n|                                                            |                     |   2020 | 2019   | Change   | Change   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|--------|--------|----------|----------|\n| Total withdrawals                                          | (millions  of m 3 ) |   51.5 | 77. 3  | (25.8)   | -33.4%   |\n| Water withdrawals in water-stressed areas  (1)             | (%)                 |   22.9 | 25.4   | (2.5)    | -9.8%    |\n| Speci/fi.ligac water withdrawals for total generation  (2) | (l/kWh)             |    0.2 | 0.33   | (0.13)   | -39.4%   |\n| Total water consumption                                    | (millions  of m 3 ) |   20.4 | 58.1   | (37.7)   | -64.9%   |\n| Water consumption in water-stressed areas                  | (%)                 |   31.6 | 23.7   | 7. 9     | 33.3%    |\n\n- (1) The /fi.ligagure for 2019 has been recalculated on the basis of the change in scope of plants in water-stressed areas.\n\nWater is an essential pa/r\\_t.liga of electricity generation, and Enel therefore believes that the availability of this resource is a critical pa/r\\_t.liga of future energy scenarios.\n\nEnel constantly monitors all generation sites located in areas at risk of water scarcity ('water-stressed' areas) in order to ensure the most e/ffi.ligacient management of the resource.\n\nSite monitoring is conducted through the following levels of analysis:\n\n- \u203a mapping  of  generation  sites  in  water-stressed  areas identi/fi.ligaed on the basis of the (baseline) water stress conditions indicated by the World Resources Institute 'Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas';\n- \u203a identi/fi.ligacation of 'critical' generation sites, i.e. those located in water-stressed areas that draw fresh water for operating needs;\n- \u203a veri/fi.ligacation of the water management procedures adop-\n\nd in these plants in order to minimize consumption and maximize withdrawals from lower quality or more abundant sources (waste, industrial or sea water).\n\nAbout 11% of the Enel Group's total electricity output uses fresh water in water-stressed areas. In 2020 total water withdrawals were 51.5 million cubic meters, 33.4% less than in 2019, re/fl.ligaecting a decrease in thermal generation compared with the previous year. The speci/fi.ligac withdrawals for 2020 were about 0.20 l/kWh, 39.4% less than in 2019.\n\n## Preserving biodiversity\n\nPreserving biodiversity is one of the strategic objectives of Enel's environmental policy.

Quantities decreased in the following regions in pa/r\\_t.ligaicular: Italy (-7.3 TWh), Spain (-8.7 TWh), Latin America (-6.9 TWh) - mainly in Brazil (-2.7 TWh) - and Romania (-0.9 TWh). In addition, gas sold by Enel in 2020 totaled 9.7 billion cubic meters, a decline of 1.1 billion cubic meters compared with the previous year.\n\nEnel's leadership position has been gained thanks to the attention we place on the customer in providing quality services: aspects that concern more than just the provision of electricity and/or natural gas, extending, above all, to intangible aspects of our service that relate to the perception and satisfaction of our customers.\n\nThrough our products for both the residential and business markets, Enel provides dedicated o/ff.ligaers with a lower environmental impact and a concentration on the most vulnerable segments of the population. In fact, all the countries in which the Group operates provide forms of suppo/r\\_t.liga (often linked to government initiatives) which assist these segments of the population in paying their electricity and\n\ngas bills, so as to give everyone equal access to electricity. Enel has also established numerous processes to ensure customers receive a high level of service. In Italy, the commercial quality of all our contact channels (customer service calls, Enel Points and stores, utility bills, app, e-mail, social media, account manager, fax) is ensured through systematic monitoring of the sales and management processes.\n\nThe goal is to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations and respect for the privacy, freedom and dignity of our customers.\n\nEnel is also continuing its e/ff.ligao/r\\_t.ligas to expand digitalization, electronic invoicing and new services. With Enel X, we offer innovative solutions to residential customers (technological solutions for sma/r\\_t.liga homes, home automation, solar and photovoltaic systems, boilers, maintenance services, lighting, etc.), government customers (public lighting, monitoring services for sma/r\\_t.liga cities, security systems, etc.) and large  customers  (demand  response  services,  consulting and energy e/ffi.ligaciency solutions). We also promote electric mobility through the development of public and private charging infrastructures.\n\nEnel charging points increased by 25,672 units in 2020 compared with 2019.\n\nPrivate charging points increased by 21,033, mainly in No/r\\_t.ligah America and Italy, while public charging points increased by 4,639, primarily in Italy and Spain.",

        "page_content": "## Financial impact of COVID-19\n\nIn compliance with recent recommendations of ESMA and CONSOB, the Group has initiated internal analyses to assess the real and potential impacts of COVID-19 on business activities, on the /fi.liganancial position and on pe/r\\_f.ligaormance.\n\nIn light of the macroeconomic scenario discussed earlier, the impact of COVID-19 is most signi/fi.ligacant for the business segments most closely involved with the market such as End-user Markets and Enel X, taking account of the fact that they have been a/ff.ligaected by a signi/fi.ligacant reduction in demand and a general slowdown in the acquisition of new customers.  More  speci/fi.ligacally,  End-user  Markets  are  affected by the overcontracting of electricity as demand and the related volumes decline, as well as the slowdown in col-\n\nlections on accounts receivable, due both to the e/ff.ligaects of the crisis and the lockdowns that a/ff.ligaected the timeliness of payments and the practices adopted in ce/r\\_t.ligaain countries that suspended the possibility of cu/t\\_t.ligaing o/ff.liga electricity supply to defaulting customers. Enel X, on the other hand, has experienced a general slowdown in the development of its po/r\\_t.ligafolio of new businesses in the /fi.ligarst nine months of 2020, much of which it recouped in the 4th Qua/r\\_t.ligaer, especially in Italy, in light of the measures adopted by the government to encourage the revival of economic activity.\n\nBearing in mind the current climate of unce/r\\_t.ligaainty and based on the best information available to date, the estimated /fi.liganancial impact of COVID-19 on the gross operating pro/fi.ligat, the ordinary gross operating pro/fi.ligat, operating pro/fi.ligat, ordinary operating pro/fi.ligat, Group pro/fi.ligat and Group ordinary pro/fi.ligat are repo/r\\_t.ligaed below.\n\n| Millions of euro                      | Demand   | COVID-19 costs   | Impairment of  receivables   | Total   |\n|---------------------------------------|----------|------------------|------------------------------|---------|\n| Gross operating pro/fi.ligat          | (727)    | (133)            | -                            | (860)   |\n| Operating pro/fi.ligat                | (727)    | (133)            | (290)                        | (1,150) |\n| Group pro/fi.ligat                    | (298)    | (86)             | (154)                        | (538)   |\n| Ordinary gross operating pro/fi.ligat | (727)    | -                | -                            | (727)   |\n| Ordinary operating pro/fi.ligat       | (727)    | -                | (290)                        | (1,017) |\n| Group ordinary pro/fi.ligat           | (298)    | -                | (154)                        | (452)   |\n\nThe gross operating pro/fi.ligat was a/ff.ligaected by the COVID-19 emergency mainly in terms of a decrease of \u20ac727 million in demand for electricity, with a decrease in sales volumes and the related margins, mainly in End-user Markets of Italy and Spain and in Distribution in Latin America. This /fi.ligagure was determined by using benchmark prices to measure the reduction in quantities distributed and sold, as observed during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in the various countries in which the Group operates.\n\nAnother factor impacting the gross operating pro/fi.ligat was the direct cost of the health emergency (\u20ac133 million) for workplace sanitization activities, personal protective equi-\n\nent and donations. These costs do not impact the determination of the ordinary gross operating pro/fi.ligat.\n\nAt the same time, taking into account the most recent collection status and the results of the valuation model used to measure the recoverability of receivables, the Group recognized an increase in impairment losses on receivables of about \u20ac290 million at the marketing companies, in pa/r\\_t.ligaicular in Italy, Spain and Brazil.\n\nTaking account of tax e/ff.ligaects and minority interests, the overall impact of COVID-19 on the Group's pro/fi.ligat at December 31, 2020 was a negative \u20ac538 million (\u20ac452 million on Group ordinary pro/fi.ligat).",

This  decline  was  compounded  by  adverse exchange rate developments in 2020 (\u20ac402 million), pa/r\\_t.ligaicularly in Brazil;\n- -the recognition of provisions for early-retirement incentives in Spain following the changes introduced in the agreement on the voluntary suspension or resolution of employment contracts (\u20ac315 million);\n- -the lower quantities transpo/r\\_t.ligaed, together with application of the new rates in Spain, which went into e/ff.ligaect for 2020-2025;\n- -the positive e/ff.ligaects recognized in 2019 as a result of the Edesur se/t\\_t.ligalement agreement (\u20ac209 million) and the indemnity for the sale of Enel Rete Gas (\u20ac50 million), as described above.\n\nThese factors were only pa/r\\_t.ligaially o/ff.ligaset by:\n\n- -the modi/fi.ligacation of the electricity discount bene/fi.ligat in Spain (\u20ac269 million) following the signing of the 5th Endesa Collective Bargaining Agreement, which led to the pa/r\\_t.ligaial reversal of the provision;\n- -an increase of \u20ac158 million in income in Italy resulting from application of ARERA Resolutions nos. 50/2018 and 461/2020 for the reimbursement of system charges and network fees;\n- \u203a End-user Markets (-\u20ac213 million) as a result of the negative impact of the COVID-19 health emergency on electri-\n\n demand, pa/r\\_t.ligaicularly on the free markets in Italy and Spain, above all in the business-to-business segments.

In addition to the factors discussed with regard to the gross operating pro/fi.ligat, this increase was due mainly to the decrease of \u20ac407 million in depreciation and amo/r\\_t.ligaization and the impairment losses recognized in 2019 for a number of coal plants in Italy, Spain, Chile and Russia for a total of \u20ac4,010 million. More speci/fi.ligacally:\n\n- \u203a in Chile, an impairment loss of \u20ac356 million was recognized for two plants following an agreement with the Chilean government on their early decommissioning;\n- \u203a in Russia, as a result of an agreement for the sale of the Reftinskaya coal plant, its carrying amount was adjusted to take account of the sale price (\u20ac127 million);\n- \u203a in Spain, the worsening of the marketplace in relation to the trend in commodities prices and to the functioning of the CO 2 emissions market in the 3rd Qua/r\\_t.ligaer of 2019 compromised the competitiveness of the coal plants in the country. In Italy, in addition to a deterioration in market conditions, the implementation of the new system for remunerating generation capacity availability (the capacity market) narrowed the future scope for using plants with higher levels of CO 2 emissions, providing for the exclusion of coal-/fi.ligared plants from the electricity market. For these reasons, the carrying amount of a number of coal-/fi.ligared plants in Italy and Spain, including dismantling charges, was impaired by a total of \u20ac3,527 million.\n\n## These e/ff.ligaects were pa/r\\_t.ligaially o/ff.ligaset by:\n\n- \u203a the impairment loss recognized in 2020 on the Bocamina II coal plant in Chile, given the decision by the Enel Group to close the plant early in order to accelerate achievement of the Group's strategic objective for the decarbo-\n\nzation of generation processes (\u20ac737 million);\n\n- \u203a the impairment losses on coal-/fi.ligared plants in Italy in the amount of \u20ac135 million, including Unit 2 of the Brindisi power plant;\n- \u203a the impairment losses on the Mexico, Argentina and Australia CGUs in the total amount of \u20ac750 million;\n- \u203a other impairment losses  of \u20ac159 million, the most signi/fi.ligacant of which regarded the solar panel manufacturing plants of Enel Green Power Italia (\u20ac65 million) and the Snyder plant in the United States (\u20ac47 million);\n- \u203a an increase of \u20ac141 million in impairment losses on receivables, mainly due to the deterioration in the collection status of receivables in the wake of the COVID-10 emergency.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

The new bond issues, including a bond of \u00a3500 million (equivalent to \u20ac557 million) linked to sustainability objectives issued by Enel Finance International in October 2020, were easily o/ff.ligaset by redemptions, positive exchange rate developments and the accounting e/ff.ligaects of the consent solicitation directed at the holders of three non-conve/r\\_t.ligaible subordinated hybrid bonds denominated in euros in order to align their features with those of new issues, for a total amount of \u20ac1,797 million. More speci/fi.ligacally, the main change  to  those  instruments  regarded  their  maturity, which was transformed from /fi.ligaxed to perpetual, which means that they will be redeemed only in the event of liquidation. As a result, those bonds are no longer recognized as debt instruments but as equity instruments;\n- \u203a bank borrowings in the amount of \u20ac10,032 million, of which \u20ac8,038 million related to sustainable /fi.liganancing. These borrowings increased by \u20ac504 million compared with the previous year due mainly to the use of new /fi.liganancing, only pa/r\\_t.ligaially o/ff.ligaset by exchange gains and repayments during the year.

More speci/fi.ligacally, the increase mainly involved Chile (\u20ac447 million), the United States (\u20ac447 million), South Africa (\u20ac143 million), Russia (\u20ac74 million), India (\u20ac47 million), Italy (\u20ac43 million) and Brazil (\u20ac20 million, net of the signi/fi.ligacant adverse impact of exchange rate developments in the amount of \u20ac241 million). These increases were only pa/r\\_t.ligaially o/ff.ligaset by a decrease in investment in Iberia (\u20ac305 million), Mexico (\u20ac334 million), Canada (\u20ac84 million), Greece (\u20ac98 million), and Australia (\u20ac25 million).\n\nIn order to enhance grid resilience in response to increasingly volatile weather events, investment in electricity distribution also increased.\n\nInvestment in distribution increased in Italy (\u20ac213 million) for quality and remote control projects and in Romania (\u20ac13 million) for e/ff.ligao/r\\_t.ligas related to service quality and new connections. These increases were primarily o/ff.ligaset by reductions in capital expenditure in South America (\u20ac179 million, especially in Argentina, Colombia and Brazil, with the la/t\\_t.ligaer primarily re/fl.ligaecting adverse exchange rate developments) and in Spain. Capital expenditure on electronic meters decreased due to a slowdown in the mass replacement e/ff.ligao/r\\_t.liga as a result of the pandemic.\n\nCapital expenditure by Enel X increased in Latin America in\n\nrelation to the e-Bus project in Colombia and in Italy due to increased investment in public lighting and the development of the e-Home and Vivi Meglio businesses. These effects were pa/r\\_t.ligaially o/ff.ligaset by decreased capital expenditure on storage distributed energy and demand response in the United States and on the e-Home business in Spain, due mainly to a change in business model and to a slowing of capital expenditure in response to COVID-19.\n\nInvestment in thermal generation plants and trading decreased, especially in Iberia (\u20ac57 million) and Latin America (\u20ac73 million).\n\nWith regard to capital expenditure, the results of the alignment of this metric with the European taxonomy are reported as previously speci/fi.ligaed in the section 'European Union taxonomy'.\n\n4",

In addition, the business structure is arranged as follows: Thermal Generation and Trading, Enel Green Power, Infrastructure and Networks, End-user Markets, Enel X, Services and Holding/ Other.\n\nIn order to improve the presentation of the pe/r\\_f.ligaormance of the various Business Lines, as from March 31, 2020 the data pertaining to large customers managed by the generation companies in South America and Mexico have been reallocated to the End-user Markets Business Line. Consequently, in order to ensure full comparability of the /fi.ligagures for the two years under review, the comparative /fi.ligagures for 2019 have been adjusted appropriately.\n\nHolding\n\n| Regions and  Countries   | Global Business Lines   | Global Business Lines   | Global Business Lines   | Global Business Lines       | Global Business Lines   | Local Business    | Local Business   |\n|--------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------|------------------|\n|                          | Thermal Generation      | Trading                 | Enel Green Power        | Infrastructure and Networks | Enel X                  | End-user  Markets | Services         |\n| Italy                    |                         |                         |                         |                             |                         |                   |                  |\n| Iberia                   |                         |                         |                         |                             |                         |                   |                  |\n| Europe                   |                         |                         |                         |                             |                         |                   |                  |\n| Africa, Asia and Oceania |                         |                         |                         |                             |                         |                   |                  |\n| No/r\\_t.ligah  America    |                         |                         |                         |                             |                         |                   |                  |\n| Latin  America           |                         |                         |                         |                             |                         |                   |                  |\n\n4",

All of this caused a worldwide recession of unprecedented severity in recent history, leading to an estimated 4% contraction in world GDP on an annual basis in 2020.\n\nThe specter of the crisis prompted the world's governments to adopt accommodative /fi.ligascal and monetary measures to suppo/r\\_t.liga the various productive sectors, the labor\n\nmarket and domestic demand.\n\nIn pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, the United States experienced a contraction of 3.5% in GDP and an increase in the unemployment rate of over 8 percentage points, reaching the record levels registered during the 2008-2009 /fi.liganancial crisis. In response to this recession, the government adopted major expansionary /fi.ligascal policies to suppo/r\\_t.liga families and businesses.\n\nIn the euro area, the pandemic caused an estimated fall in GDP of 6.8% and in/fl.ligaation stood at 0.3% on an annual basis",

The labor market, however, proved more resilient thanks to subsidies from many governments.\n\nBoth the Fed and the ECB intend to keep their main interest rates low until in/fl.ligaation stabilizes at around 2%. Fu/r\\_t.ligahermore, in July the European Council reached an agreement on the Next Generation EU, a recovery plan that includes \u20ac750 billion in funding.\n\nAs for Latin America, the pandemic crisis and the various responses of individual governments have created a rather diverse macroeconomic picture.\n\nThe world economic outlook for 2021 is more optimistic, albeit still burdened by the COVID-19 pandemic. Growth projections will depend signi/fi.ligacantly on the development of new vaccines and the speed of vaccination campaigns in di/ff.ligaerent countries.\n\nThe crisis has also impacted the /fi.liganancial markets. The main European equity indices closed 2020 with losses. The Italian FTSE-MIB index slipped 5.4%, the Spanish Ibex35 index declined 15.5%, and the French CAC40 index was down 7.1%. By contrast the German DAX30 rose 3.5%.\n\nThe euro-area Utilities sector (EURO STOXX Utilities) closed the year with an increase of 9.8%.\n\nFinally, as regards the Enel stock, 2020 ended with a price of \u20ac8.276 per share, an increase of 17.0% compared with the previous year, outpe/r\\_f.ligaorming both the European and Italian sector indices.\n\nAt the end of 2020 Enel had a weight of 14.9% in the FTSE-MIB and 21.7% in the EURO STOXX Utilities.\n\nOn January 22, 2020 Enel paid an interim dividend of \u20ac0.16 per share from 2019 pro/fi.ligats and on July 22, 2020 it paid the balance of the dividend for that year in the amount of \u20ac0.168. Total dividends distributed in 2020 amounted to \u20ac0.328 per share, about 17% higher than the \u20ac0.28 per sha-\n\nibuted in 2019.\n\nIn relation to ordinary pro/fi.ligat for 2020, on January 20, 2021 an interim dividend of \u20ac0.175 was paid, while the balance of the dividend is scheduled for payment on July 21, 2021.\n\nThe outlook for investors is changing rapidly: the changes taking place and the challenges the world presents us today are also impacting the way we invest. Companies are no longer seen as closed systems, but rather as open systems that generate wealth through interaction with the environment and the communities in which they operate, and towards which they are accountable.\n\nIn this context, Enel's pursuit of a strategy that, through decarbonization and seizing the oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities o/ff.ligaered by electri/fi.ligacation, seeks to create value for customers, society and the environment has been understood and appreciated by institutional investors, whose stake in Enel at December 31, 2020 reached an all-time high of 62.3% (compared with 60.3% at December 31, 2019), while the share of individual investors has fallen to a record low of 14.1% (compared with 16.1% at December 31, 2019). The interest of the Ministry for the Economy and Finance was unchanged at 23.6%.\n\nThe number of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) investors continued to rise steadily: at December 31, 2020, socially responsible investors (SRIs) held about 14.6% of share capital (against 10.8% at December 31, 2019), while investors who have signed the Principles for Responsible Investment represent 47.8% of share capital (43% at December 31, 2019).\n\nFor fu/r\\_t.ligaher information we invite you to visit the Investor Relations section of our corporate website (h/t\\_t.ligap://www.enel. com/investors) and download the 'Enel Investor Relations' app, which contains /fi.liganancial data, presentations, real-time updates of the share price, information on the composition of corporate bodies and the rules of Shareholders' Meetings, as well as periodic updates on corporate governance issues.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

        "page_content": "## INNOVATION AND DIGITALIZATION\n\nFor Enel, innovation and digitalization are key pillars of its strategy to grow in a rapidly changing context while ensuring high safety standards, business continuity and operational e/ffi.ligaciency, and thus enabling new uses of energy and new ways of managing it, making it accessible to an ever larger number of people.\n\nIn pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, data management plays a fundamental role in suppo/r\\_t.ligaing the decision-making process with the development and application of advanced analytics and in creating new synergies. Enel's digital transformation is based on pillars (assets, customers, people), enablers (platforms, cloud, cyber security) and approaches to connect pillars and enablers (agile, data-driven). Robotics, a/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacial intelligence, cyber security, big data and the cloud are some of the main areas in which Enel is investing, thus con/fi.ligarming digitalization as one of the key dimensions of the 20212023 Strategic Plan to suppo/r\\_t.liga business development. The digital strategy is moving towards maximizing margins and reducing operating costs, to facilitate the energy transition. Enel  also  operates  through  an  Open  Innovability\u00ae  model, a consensus-based ecosystem that makes it possible to connect all areas of the Company with sta/r\\_t.ligaups, industrial pa/r\\_t.liganers, small and medium-sized enterprises, research centers and universities through a variety of system, such as crowdsourcing platforms and the Innovation Hub network. The Company has numerous innovation pa/r\\_t.liganership agreements that, in addition to Enel's traditional lines of business in the renewables and conventional generation sectors, have promoted the development of new solutions for e-mobility, microgrids, energy e/ffi.ligaciency and the industrial Internet of Things (IoT).\n\nEnel's innovation strategy leverages the online crowdsourcing platform (openinnovability.com) and a global network of 10 Innovation Hubs (of which 3 are also Labs) and 22 Labs (of which 3 are dedicated to sta/r\\_t.ligaups), which consolidates the new model of collaboration with sta/r\\_t.ligaups and SMEs. The la/t\\_t.ligaer o/ff.ligaer innovative solutions and new business models, and Enel makes its skills, testing facilities and a global network of pa/r\\_t.liganers available to suppo/r\\_t.liga their development and possible scale-up. The Hubs are located in the most impo/r\\_t.ligaant innovation ecosystems for the Group (Catania,\n\nPisa, Milan, Silicon Valley, Boston, Rio de Janeiro, Madrid, Moscow, Santiago de Chile and Tel Aviv), they manage relationships with all the players involved in innovation activities and are the main source of scouting for innovative sta/r\\_t.ligaups and SMEs. The Labs (among which those in Milan, Pisa, Catania, S\u00e3o Paulo, Haifa and Be'er Sheva are the most representative) allow sta/r\\_t.ligaups to develop and test their solutions together with the Business Lines.\n\nDuring 2020, thanks to the Group's positioning in innovative ecosystems and the consolidation of the Hub and Lab network, more than 40 bootcamps were organized in different technological areas and sta/r\\_t.ligaup scouting activities expanded to two new areas (Canada and Australia). A new FinSec Lab was opened in Be'er Sheva (Israel), thanks to Enel X and Mastercard, and is aimed at the development of early stage sta/r\\_t.ligaups in the FinTech and cyber security /fi.ligaelds. All this has enabled Enel to meet more than 2,600 sta/r\\_t.ligaups and to launch more than 70 new collaborative relationships despite the pandemic.\n\nEvery increasing impo/r\\_t.ligaance is begin taken on by activities to promote and develop the culture of innovation and entrepreneurship within the Company, working through the Innovation  Academies  and  the  Innovation  Ambassadors project.\n\nFu/r\\_t.ligahermore, in 2020 the activities of the innovation communities continued, involving di/ff.ligaerent areas and skills within the Company. Energy storage, blockchain, drones, augmented and vi/r\\_t.ligaual reality, additive manufacturing, a/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacial intelligence, wearables, robotics and green hydrogen are the areas and technologies addressed within these communities. In one example, in recent years Enel has intensi/fi.ligaed the use of drones in the monitoring and maintenance of its assets, inspecting solar /fi.ligaelds, wind farms, dams and hydroelectric reservoirs, closed components in traditional plants and distribution lines with the aim of increasing the e/ffi.ligaciency of operational and maintenance processes and above all reduce workers' exposure to risks. Fu/r\\_t.ligahermore, storage systems, in addition to guaranteeing ongoing suppo/r\\_t.liga for current business activities, pave the way to new frontiers of sustainable business.\n\nAs  of  2020,  \u20ac111  million  (including  personnel  expenses) have been invested in innovation (R&D spending).\n\n4",

The investments focused on all the Group's Global Business Lines and mainly concerned internally developed software (i.e. internal customization of software purchased externally). Among these, we highlight:\n\n- \u203a the technological infrastructure of Paytipper, consisting of an application bus into which peripheral inte/r\\_f.ligaaces developed to meet di/ff.ligaerent operational needs are integrated, with the goal of handling millions of /fi.liganancial transactions per day. Other monitoring and control modules\n\nenable users to carry out supervisory, audit and pe/r\\_f.ligaormance analysis activities;\n\n- \u203a investments in networks for the management of sma/r\\_t.liga meters, remote grid control and communication software;\n- \u203a investments at Enel X in demand response systems;\n- \u203a investments in power generation for predictive maintenance systems;\n- \u203a additional customizations of Group ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning).\n\nThe patent activity of the Group is also proving to be proli/fi.ligac, involving as many as 837 applications for patents in 137 technological families. Of these, 692 have been granted and 145 are pending.\n\nThe increase in the size of the entire po/r\\_t.ligafolio of intellectual prope/r\\_t.ligay  rights  held  by  the  Enel  Group  corresponds  to growing internal e/ff.ligao/r\\_t.ligas to strengthen the information infrastructure necessary for the immediate identi/fi.ligacation of the innovation generated, its evaluation and protection, as well as the ongoing monitoring of the po/r\\_t.ligafolio's evolution, with a view to ensuring continuous and close alignment between technological and commercial trajectories and corresponding forms of safeguarding the competitive advantage provided by intellectual prope/r\\_t.ligay rights.\n\nThe Group also intends to continue to suppo/r\\_t.liga and encourage the development of its innovation model through speci/fi.ligac projects for internal dissemination by the Intellectual Property unit and through the creation of speci/fi.ligac tools to identify, asce/r\\_t.ligaain, protect and preserve on an iterative basis all information of value generated in Enel in accordance with the Open Innovability\u00ae model.",

This global-scale response was made possible by the /fl.ligaexible working experience gained in Italy since as early as 2016 and then gradually extended throughout the Group and by the technological transformation launched in 2014, which led to the integration of digitalization into corporate strategy, making Enel the /fi.ligarst utility company to fully operate in the cloud.\n\nThe adoption of /fl.ligaexible working has also meant giving people the tools they need to work from home, ensuring the circulation of information and the e/ff.ligaective organization of activities. Initiatives were also launched to suppo/r\\_t.liga the transition to the new digital reality, promote a work culture based on autonomy, delegation and trust, and encourage\n\nbe/t\\_t.ligaer time management by suppo/r\\_t.ligaing the well-being of people and their families.\n\nGrowing automation and technological evolution open up new scenarios for the Group and its people and are driving the need for new technical and professional expe/r\\_t.ligaise and the simultaneous waning of other skills. In this context, the targeted reskilling and upskilling programs have therefore been strengthened, the former to learn skills and expe/r\\_t.ligaise that enable people to /fi.ligall new positions and roles, while the la/t\\_t.ligaer involve the development of training and empowerment courses that enable employees to improve their pe/r\\_f.ligaormance in their job, increasing the skills available to them in their current position. In pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, Enel signed an agreement with the trade unions in December 2020 for the implementation of an upskilling and reskilling training plan in Italy, which includes over 40 training courses and the involvement of more than 20,000 people. The planned initiatives range from digital transformation for operational and commercial personnel, to job shadowing projects as\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

External skilling initiatives were also unde/r\\_t.ligaaken, from the perspective of stewardship - responsible management of relations with Enel's external stakeholders - which provide for the accompaniment and growth of people outside the Company (institutions, external entities, suppliers) for the acquisition of new skills. These include initiatives aimed at female students in the last two years of high school in order to promote a culture of STEM studies.\n\nEnel promotes training activities for its people as a key element in ensuring their constant development. We have developed career paths to foster the evolution of our talent, the valorization of passions and personal aptitude and the\n\ndevelopment of new languages, also promoting the formation of internal trainers ('train the trainer'). In 2020, more than 2.7 million hours of training were provided, a slight increase compared with the previous year despite the fact that almost all training was delivered remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This was made possible by the upgrading of digital tools and the E-Ducation platform, which ensured broad access to content and expanded the culture of digitalization for learning. The training courses covered issues related to conduct, technical issues, safety, new skills and digital culture.\n\nTotal Group training costs in 2020 amounted to more than \u20ac18 million (1) .\n\n## AVERAGE TRAINING HOURS PER EMPLOYEE\n\n|                                             |             | 2020   | 2019   | Change   | Change   |\n|---------------------------------------------|-------------|--------|--------|----------|----------|\n| Average number of training hours            | hrs/ person | 40.9   | 38.8   | 2.1      | 5.4%     |\n| Average number of training hours by level:  |             |        |        |          |          |\n| - senior manager                            | hrs/ person | 31.9   | 58.4   | (26.5)   | -45.4%   |\n| - middle manager                            | hrs/ person | 41.4   | 44.9   | (3.5)    | -7. 8 %  |\n| - o/ffi.ligace sta/ff.liga                  | hrs/ person | 35.7   | 29.6   | 6.1      | 20.6%    |\n| - blue collar                               | hrs/ person | 51.4   | 49.6   | 1.8      | 3.6%     |\n| Average number of training hours by gender: |             |        |        |          |          |\n| - men                                       | hrs/ person | 40.4   | 39.7   | 0.7      | 1.8%     |\n| - women                                     | hrs/ person | 42.7   | 35.0   | 7. 7     | 22.0%    |\n\nIn a rapidly changing work environment, accelerated by the pandemic crisis, the Group has set itself the ambitious goal of promoting digital sustainability in the coming years through a series of training initiatives that illustrate all those technologies that enable our people to work and coexist sustainably with the surrounding environment.\n\nWith regard to personal development activities, the quantitative and qualitative Pe/r\\_f.ligaormance Assessment process in 2020 involved the various levels of Group personnel in a /fl.ligauid process. More speci/fi.ligacally, 100% of eligible employees were involved in the 2019 Pe/r\\_f.ligaormance Evaluation Campaign, which was completed in July 2020. A review of the process has been planned for the upcoming 2020 Campaign - to be conducted between the 2020 and 2021 calendar years - that will enhance the speci/fi.ligac features of individuals and leverage people's talents and inclinations.\n\n## Listening and improvement of organizational well-being\n\nIn light of the digitalization of relations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Listening Channel has undergone a review. Accordingly, in 2020 a project was launched to make direct involvement approaches more constant and dynamic, for the de/fi.liganition of action plans aimed at improving organizational well-being. The Open Listening survey was also launched. This interview is intended to help build our future, with 70% of personnel responding. People were asked to imagine the future of work in the 'new normal' era: from ways of working remotely to workspaces, new technologies, psychological and physical well-being and new models for the leadership of the future. Of total respondents, 93.5% declared a high level of involvement (People Engagement rate). In the course of 2021, global and spe-",

In 2019, the global workplace harassment policy was published. It sets out the principle of respect for integrity and dignity of the individual in the workplace and addresses the issue of sexual harassment and harassment connected with discrimination, the principles of which are delineated\n\nin the Statement against Harassment in the Workplace. Enel's approach is based on the fundamental principles, enunciated in the diversity and inclusion policy, of non-discrimination, equal oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities and human dignity in all its forms, inclusion and promoting work-life balance. The application of this policy has enabled the development of global and local projects that focus on diversity in terms of gender, disability, age, nationality and disseminating the culture of inclusion at all levels of the organization.\n\nthrough a global repo/r\\_t.ligaing process that measures the performance of a comprehensive set of KPIs on all dimensions for internal and external purposes. In pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, with regard to gender, Enel has set itself two public objectives: to ensure equal representation of the two genders in the initial stages of the selection processes (50% by 2021) and to increase the number of female managers and middle managers. In 2020, women represented 44% of people involved in the selection process, an increase on previous years (42% in 2019), while the number of female managers and middle managers increased by 6%.\n\nThe steady increase in female managers in recent years has been accompanied by a simultaneous increase in the Equal Remuneration Ratio (2) (ERR), which in 2020 was equal to 83.3%, a slight improvement on the 83.2% registered in 2019 (equal to 82.4% on a unchanged euro exchange rate basis). These results are evidence of the management actions taken to valorize the presence of women in top positions, the e/ff.ligaects of which will be fully appreciable in the medium/long term, taking due account of generational dynamics.\n\nThe following table demonstrates Enel's commitment to diversity and inclusion, showing the propo/r\\_t.ligaion of disabled personnel or personnel belonging to protected categories, the number of women in management positions and the ratio for basic salary and average remuneration between women and men.\n\nThe  progress  of  D&I  policies  is  monitored  periodically\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

We are therefore commi/t\\_t.ligaed to developing and promoting a strong culture of safety that ensures a healthy work environment and protection for all those working with and for the Group. Safeguarding our own health and safety and that of the people with whom we interact is the responsibility of everyone who works for Enel. For this reason, as provided for in the Group 'Stop Work Policy', everyone is required to promptly repo/r\\_t.liga and halt any situation of risk or unsafe behavior. The constant commitment of us all, the integration of safety both in corporate processes and training, the repo/r\\_t.ligaing and detailed analysis of all information, near misses, safety warnings, non-compliance, controls, rigor in the selection and management of contractors, the sharing of experience and best practices throughout the Group as well as benchmarking against the leading international players are all cornerstones of Enel's culture of safety. These values are pa/r\\_t.liga of the SHE project, launched in 2018 and fu/r\\_t.ligaher strengthened in 2020.The project involves the Group's people and suppliers with initiatives regarding safety, health and the environment. It is aimed at fostering continuous growth with\n\nour contractors, operational improvements and safety with equipment, tools and processes.\n\nSafety is closely integrated into tender processes, and we closely monitor our contractors' pe/r\\_f.ligaormance both upstream with our quali/fi.ligacation system and ongoing as the contracts progress through numerous control processes and tools such as the Supplier Pe/r\\_f.ligaormance Management (SPM) system. During 2020, we fu/r\\_t.ligaher improved and integrated the HSE Terms into all contracts. These are binding conditions that companies must agree to when contracts are awarded. The document, unique for the Group, de/fi.liganes the requirements regarding health, safety and signi/fi.ligacant environmental aspects that the contractor must comply with and enforce with their subcontractors during the execution of works. In addition, during the year considerable impulse was given to the 'Safety Supplier Assessment', speci/fi.ligac audits on safety issues to be unde/r\\_t.ligaaken at the suppliers' premises and their worksites. The audits are pe/r\\_f.ligaormed during the quali/fi.ligacation phase for each new supplier in cases where critical issues have emerged (severe or fatal injuries) or where the supplier has received a low SPM rating. In 2020, despite the COVID emergency, a total of 1,185 contractor assessments were pe/r\\_f.ligaormed.\n\nThe following table repo/r\\_t.ligas the main workplace safety indicators.",

In 2020, 1 fatal accident occurred in Brazil involving Enel Group employees, and 8 fatal accidents involving contractors (5 in Brazil and one each in Italy, Spain and Colombia). The causes of these nine fatal accidents were mainly associated with electrical incidents. Also in 2020, 3 'high consequence' accidents occurred involving employees of the Enel Group, while 20 such accidents involved contractors. They were mainly of a mechanical nature. Training and awareness-raising activities concerning issues relating to the protection of health and safety are a key element of the Group's safety culture. A number of communication campaigns were carried out during the year in areas of speci/fi.ligac importance for the Company. At the same time, some 903,802 hours of training on safety issues were provided to Enel personnel.\n\nThe Enel Group has established a structured health management system, based on prevention measures to develop a corporate culture that promotes psycho-physical health, organizational well-being and a balance between personal and professional life. With this in mind, the Group conducts global and local awareness campaigns to promote healthy lifestyles, sponsors screening programs aimed at preventing the onset of diseases and guarantees the provision of medical services. More speci/fi.ligacally, we have a policy for the prevention of local diseases and provide suppo/r\\_t.liga in the event of diseases or accidents abroad. A sma/r\\_t.ligaphone application is also available with travel information and guidelines on vaccinations, while a new global insurance policy has been taken out for all employees traveling abroad.

The Group also constantly monitors epidemiological and health developments in order to implement preventive and protective measures for the health of employees and those who work with the Group, both locally and globally. Since the outset of the COVID-19 emergency in February 2020, Enel has taken steps to protect the health of all workers and ensure the continuity of electricity supply to the communities in which it operates. A global task force has been created, as well as local task forces in each country where Enel is present, to monitor the progress of the pandemic with dedicated indicators and immediately take all necessary prevention measures. Given the persistence of the COVID-19 emergency and its spread on a global scale, at the end of 2020 a HSE Emergency Management unit was set up within the Parent's HSEQ depa/r\\_t.ligament, with a focus on health, safety and environmental emergencies, with the objective of integrating the HSE emergency management process into the company organization and ensuring the integration and continuous alignment of strategy and the management of emergency events at the Business Line and Country level.\n\nSince the beginning of the pandemic, new operating models have been activated to minimize the risk of contagion and speci/fi.ligac prevention protocols have been implemented, dynamically adapting the activity plan and the measures de/fi.liganed in response to developments in the pandemic at a global level. All personnel whose jobs could be done remotely have been working using /fl.ligaexible working arrangements since the beginning of the emergency.  For  operational  units  (about  13,000  employees), who necessarily work in the /fi.ligaeld, stringent measures to contain the spread of the disease were applied through the division of teams into smaller nuclei (elementary cells) and the adoption of temporal and/or physical segregation measures. Stress tests were conducted for critical infrastructures with the aim of verifying their operation in various possible contagion scenarios. Information and training initiatives were launched for employees on the prevention measures to be adopted. Enel also invited its suppliers on a global scale to take all actions deemed appropriate to ensure the protection of the health of their workers and the limitation of the spread of the disease. In/fl.ligauenza vaccination programs were implemented as a preventive health measure in all the main countries in which Enel operates.\n\n## Responsible relations with communities\n\nLast year was marked by the health emergency, which had sweeping socio-economic consequences at a global level. The economic e/ff.ligaects of the crisis have also increased vulnerability and inequality in the communities in which the Group operates, but thanks to our strong and extensive roots in those communities we have been able to identify measures to provide immediate suppo/r\\_t.liga to address health and socio-economic emergencies. From Europe to Latin America, Asia, Africa and Australia, the Enel Group implemented about 450 sustainability projects as an immediate response in two main areas:\n\n- \u203a containment of the health emergency with aid initiatives for hospitals and people working on the front line;\n- \u203a suppo/r\\_t.liga for the economic revitalization of communities, through programs to suppo/r\\_t.liga food security, development of micro-entrepreneurship, services for vulnerable customers and professional and educational distance training.\n\nOur  knowledge  of  speci/fi.ligac  local  circumstances  and  constant listening to the needs of stakeholders have also made it possible to develop concrete responses to the new context delineated by restrictions such as social distancing and travel bans and the multiplicity of economic, social and cultural realities in which Enel operates and of which it is an integral pa/r\\_t.liga in the operation of our assets. Speci/fi.ligac initiatives have focused on local socio-economic development plans, with targeted solutions to stimulate economic recovery through the development of local markets, speci/fi.ligac services dedicated to vulnerable customers and actions aimed at combating energy pove/r\\_t.ligay and ensuring social inclusion for the weakest categories of the population by leveraging access to new technologies and circular economy approaches.\n\nThe continuous a/t\\_t.ligaention to social and environmental factors, combined with the objective of contributing to the economic and social progress of the communities, makes it possible to create long-term value for the Company and for the communities in which it operates, promoting a new balanced development model that leaves no one behind. This model has been incorporated along the entire value chain: analyzing the needs of communities right from the development phases of new activities; taking account of social and environmental factors in the establishment of sustainable worksites; managing assets and plants to make them sustainable development platforms to the bene/fi.ligat of the territories in which they are located. Another development was the extension of this approach to the design, development and supply of energy services and products, helping to build increasingly sustainable communities.\n\nIn 2020, Enel developed over 2,100 projects with 8 million",

The projects to ensure access to a/ff.ligaordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy (SDG 7) have involved 9.8 million people to date, (4) those to foster the economic and social development of communities (SDG 8) have reached 3 million bene/fi.ligaciaries, (5) while initiatives to promote quality education (SDG 4) have bene/fi.ligated 2.3 million people. (6)\n\nA fundamental lever in implementing these projects is the use  of  about  1,000  pa/r\\_t.liganerships  with  social  enterprises, non-pro/fi.ligat  organizations,  sta/r\\_t.ligaups  and  institutions  operating both locally and internationally that promote the development of the territory through innovative and tailor-made interventions. The search for social innovation ideas and solutions through the Open Innovability\u00ae ecosystem is constant, based on openness and sharing through various tools such as, for example, crowdsourcing platforms (openinnovability. com) and the Innovation Hub network.\n\nThe progress in terms of the Group's contribution to achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) has also enabled Enel to revise its 2030 goals, doubling the number of people it intends to bene/fi.ligat through projects to ensure quality education (SDG 4: target of 5 million bene/fi.ligaciaries by 2030) and access to energy (SDG 7: target of 20 million bene/fi.ligaciaries by 2030). The commitment to initiatives to promote long-lasting, inclusive and sustainable economic growth has also been con/fi.ligarmed (SDG 8: target of 8 million bene/fi.ligaciaries by 2030).\n\n## Sustainable supply chain\n\nIn addition to meeting ce/r\\_t.ligaain quality standards, the services of our vendors must also go hand in hand with the adoption of best practices in terms of human rights and working conditions, health and safety and environmental and ethical responsibility. Our procurement procedures are designed to guarantee service quality in full respect of the principles of economy, e/ff.ligaectiveness, timeliness, fairness and transparency. The procurement process plays a central role in value cre-\n\nation in its various forms (safety, savings, timeliness, quality, earnings, revenue, /fl.ligaexibility) as a result of ever-greater interaction and integration with the outside world and the di/ff.ligaerent pa/r\\_t.ligas of the company organization. In 2020, we signed agreements with a total of more than 24,000 vendors.\n\nVendor management involves three essential stages, which integrate social, environmental and governance issues: the quali/fi.ligacation system, the de/fi.liganition of general terms and conditions of contract, and the Supplier Pe/r\\_f.ligaormance Management (SPM) system in the evaluation process. Enel's global vendor quali/fi.ligacation system (with about 12,000 active quali/fi.ligacations as at December 31, 2020) enables us to accurately assess businesses that intend to pa/r\\_t.ligaicipate in tender processes through the analysis of compliance with technical, /fi.liganancial, legal, environmental, health and safety, human and ethical rights and integrity requirements, representing a guarantee for the Company. As regards the tendering and bargaining process, Enel continued to introduce aspects related to sustainability in tendering processes, with the introduction of a speci/fi.ligac 'K for sustainability' factor, which takes account of environmental and social factors and supplier safety. Fu/r\\_t.ligahermore, speci/fi.ligac contractual clauses regarding sustainability are envisaged in all contracts for works, services and supplies, including respect for and protection of human rights and compliance with ethical and social obligations. The SPM system is designed to monitor vendor services in terms of the quality, timeliness and sustainability of contract execution.\n\nFu/r\\_t.ligahermore, we continued working on those activities that enable the ever-greater integration of environmental, social and governance issues in the supply chain strategy, creating shared value with vendors. These include meetings and information initiatives with contractors on sustainability issues, with speci/fi.ligac regard to safeguarding health and safety.\n\n- (4) Cumulative 2015-2020 /fi.ligagures for total number of SDG 7 bene/fi.ligaciaries to date.\n- (5) Cumulative 2015-2020 /fi.ligagures for total number of SDG 8 bene/fi.ligaciaries to date.\n- (6) Cumulative 2015-2020 /fi.ligagures for total number of SDG 4 bene/fi.ligaciaries to date.\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## The circular economy\n\nFor  Enel,  the  circular  economy  represents  a  strategic  driver and a fundamental choice for achieving competitiveness objectives, both in economic terms and in terms of risk reduction, and, at the same time, creating a fully sustainable business model to respond to the great global environmental and social challenges.\n\nThe Group's vision is based on /fi.ligave pillars, which act through three main levers: design, methods of use and the closure of cycles.\n\nFor the result to be e/ff.ligaectively transformative, the circular approach must inevitably embrace the entire value chain. For this reason, it has been implemented in all the Group's activities, acting both through the Business Lines, as regards technologies and business models, and through the Countries, as regards cross-sectoral synergies, collaborations and ecosystems. To this end, the main areas of activity address the following aspects.\n\n- \u203a Suppliers: the Circular Procurement strategy with suppliers has been operational since 2018 to measure the circularity of what we purchase, reward the most vi/r\\_t.ligauous and co-innovate to rethink assets and products together.\n- \u203a Assets: the Global Power Generation and Global Infrastructure  and  Networks  Business  Lines  are  both  reviewing the value chain of the main projects they have unde/r\\_t.ligaaken recently, such as sma/r\\_t.liga meters, photovoltaics and wind power, from a circular point of view and leveraging their operational assets. Global Trading, bearing in mind the speci/fi.ligacities of the various assets involved, is suppo/r\\_t.ligaing this transition by extending its skills to the areas of new materials and secondary raw materials.\n- \u203a Customers: Enel X is marketing itself as an accelerator of the circularity of its customers, both by continuously measuring and improving its products and services and by providing measurement and consulting services to customers to increase their circularity.\n\nSince the initial stages of adopting a circular approach, Enel has placed a strong focus on measuring the environmental and economic bene/fi.ligats of circularity, with the awareness that a model that exceeds and, ideally, eliminates the consumption of non-renewable resources must be measurable in order to be not only sustainable but also economically competitive. As pa/r\\_t.liga of the 2020 Capital Markets Day, for example, a new circularity indicator was introduced for generation assets, supplementing existing indicators on direct emissions. This additional indicator photographs the evolution over the years of the consumption of materials per MWh generated on a whole life basis, measuring the consumption of mate-\n\nrials throughout the life cycle: from production to installation, to decommissioning of generation assets.\n\nA concrete example of the Group's circular approach is the 'Circular Sma/r\\_t.liga Meter' project, which represents a vi/r\\_t.ligauous example of the application of the principles of the circular economy in Global Infrastructure and Networks. As the plan to replace 32 million /fi.ligarst generation meters in Italy moves forward, Enel has decided to transform their disposal into an oppo/r\\_t.ligaunity, using the material from the discontinued meters to build the new 'Circular Open Meter'. To develop the device, a process for selecting and regenerating the polycarbonate from the discontinued meters was also developed, which in the future could also be extended to the other Country segments of the Group, where technically possible. In June 2020 the NMi Ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacation Body (Nederlands Meetinstituut) for the MID (Measuring Instruments Directive) approved the use of regenerated plastic for the Open Meter, and the manufacture of the initial lot of 30,000 Circular Open Meters began. Produced with 100% regenerated plastic, the new meters minimize the environmental impact for the bene/fi.ligat of customers, the territory and the environment. More speci/fi.ligacally, the new process is estimated to have reduced CO 2 emissions by 210 tons for the /fi.ligarst lot compared with the traditional process, using a life cycle assessment method. Fu/r\\_t.ligahermore, thanks to the reintegration of the waste material from the old devices (mainly plastic) into the production process of the new Circular Open Meters, waste has also been reduced by an estimated 31.5 tons. In percentage terms, 48% by weight of the new meters consists of regenerated materials, ensuring the vi/r\\_t.ligauous management of their end of life, for which the recyclability and reuse of materials (metals in addition to plastic) is estimated at about 79% by weight.",

The order also provided for the seizure of Enel Produzione assets and receivables in an amount of about \u20ac523 million. On August 1, 2018, the Lecce Public Prosecutor lifted its seizure of the Brindisi plant, with the consequent termination of the judicial custody/administration of the facility and the restitution of the other seized assets to Enel Produzione, on the basis of the repo/r\\_t.liga prepared by the expe/r\\_t.ligas appointed by the investigating magistrate at the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Lecce, which fully con/fi.ligarmed the appropriateness of the operation of the plant.\n\nHowever, the preliminary investigation is continuing both against the accused individuals and the company pursuant to Legislative Decree 231/2001.\n\nOn January 9, 2020, the original notices of the preliminary hearing set for January 29, 2020 were received. Due to a number of irregularities in the notices, the hearing was initially postponed until April 8, 2020. However, owing to the measures imposed to counter the COVID-19 pandemic, the hearing was again postponed until June 10, 2020 and then again until November 20, 2020, as a result of the impossibility of conducting the argument phase with the necessary guarantees provided for in health and safety guidelines. This hearing was also not held due to the persistence of the health emergency. In any event, the Region of Puglia and the City of Brindisi /fi.ligaled to join the proceeding as civil plainti/ff.ligas, the admissibility of which was discussed at the hearing of March 4, 2021. Following the discussion, the cou/r\\_t.liga did not issue a ruling and adjourned the hearing to April 21, 2021.\n\n## Criminal proceedings connected with Pietra/fi.liga/t\\_t.ligaa plant\n\nWith regard to the Pietra/fi.liga/t\\_t.ligaa thermal generation plant, the Perugia Public Prosecutor had sta/r\\_t.ligaed an investigation in-\n\nvolving a number of o/ffi.ligacers of Enel Produzione SpA, as well as ce/r\\_t.ligaain third pa/r\\_t.ligaies who are today owners of the land adjacent to the plant - formerly Enel's - on which ash was found.\n\nThe alleged o/ff.ligaenses are as follows: failure to restore the site (A/r\\_t.ligaicle 452terdecies of the Italian Criminal Code) for a number of areas a/ff.ligaected by the spillage of ash produced up to the 1980s by the Pietra/fi.liga/t\\_t.ligaa power plant and ash from other company plants, and other areas where contamination with polychlorinated biphenyls ('PCBs') was found associated with decommissioned mining equipment; environmental pollution (A/r\\_t.ligaicle 452bis of the Criminal Code) connected with the PCB contamination, with respect to which Enel Produzione SpA was also charged with administrative liability pursuant to Legislative Decree 231/2001. In the summer of 2019, Enel Produzione SpA /fi.ligaled a petition for dismissal, which was accepted by the prosecutor for the crime of environmental pollution, with consequent dismissal of the charge pursuant to Legislative Decree 231/2001. A number of environmental associations /fi.ligaled an objection to the dismissal, and on February 21, 2020 a hearing was held before the investigating magistrate, which ended with dismissal of the charges (May 28, 2020), which, in brief, accepted all of Enel's defenses and con/fi.ligarmed the dismissal of any other possible charges - even if not brought by the Prosecutor's O/ffi.ligace - relating to the possible health e/ff.ligaects\n\ncaused by the presence of the ash.\n\nAccordingly, the criminal proceedings are continuing with sole regard to the crime of failure to restore the site, with respect to which in December 2019 the Enel Produzione SpA employees presented an application for a stay of proceedings with probation, consisting in the implementation of a program agreed with the Prosecutor's O/ffi.ligace for propo/r\\_t.ligaionate and fair restoration with respect to the complaints /fi.ligaled against the defendants. The probation hearing was held on October 29, 2020, when the investigating magistrate of the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Perugia granted the request for probation. The hearing was then postponed to February 18, 2021, when the program proposed by Enel Produzione was approved, se/t\\_t.ligaing a deadline of nine months for its execution.",

The construction of the 475 MW section of the solar plant involved an investment of around R$1.4 billion, equivalent to approximately $390 million. Once fully up and running, the 475 MW section of the plant will be able to generate over 1,200 GWh per year while avoiding the emission of over 600,000 metric tons of CO 2 into the atmosphere.\n\n## Funac and the ICMS tax relief\n\nWith Law 20416 of February 5, 2019, the state of Goi\u00e1s sho/r\\_t.ligaened from January 27, 2015 to April 24, 2012 the period of operation of the Funac fund (established with Law 17555 of January 20, 2012) and the tax bene/fi.ligat system (created with Law 19473 of November 3, 2016) that allowed Celg Distribui\u00e7\u00e3o SA to o/ff.ligaset payment obligations in respect of the ICMS Imposto sobre Circula\u00e7\u00e3o de Mercadorias e Servi\u00e7os (tax on the circulation of goods and services). On February 25, 2019, Celg-D appealed the provisions of Law 20416 before the Cou/r\\_t.liga of the state of Goi\u00e1s, /fi.ligaling a writ of mandamus and an accompanying petition for a precautionary suspension, which was denied on a preliminary basis on February 26, 2019. Celg-D appealed this ruling and the Cou/r\\_t.liga of the state of Goi\u00e1s allowed the appeal on June 11, 2019. On October 1, 2019, the Cou/r\\_t.liga of the state of Goi\u00e1s issued an order revoking the precautionary measure previously granted in favor of Celg-D and, accordingly, the e/ff.ligaects of the law were restored as from that date. Celg-D /fi.ligaled an appeal against this decision, claiming that the right to guarantee tax credits has both a legal and contractual basis and that, therefore, the actions that the state of Goi\u00e1s has taken in order to fully suspend the application of these laws are patently unfounded. On October 2, 2019, the appeal /fi.ligaled by Celg-D was denied. On November 21, 2019, Celg-D challenged this decision before the Superior Tribunal de Justi\u00e7a (STJ). On February 27, 2020, the Tribunal de Justi\u00e7a (TJ) declared inadmissible the appeal by Celg-D, which on May 5, 2020 appealed this decision before the STJ. These proceedings are under way. It is impo/r\\_t.ligaant to note that the coverage of the Funac fund is provided for in the\n\nagreement for the acquisition of Celg-D by Enel Brasil SA. On April 26, 2019, Law 20468 was promulgated. With the law, the state of Goi\u00e1s fully revoked the tax relief referred to above. On May 5, 2019, Celg-D /fi.ligaled an ordinary petition and a request for a precautionary suspension against the state of Goi\u00e1s to contest this law. On September 16, 2019, the Cou/r\\_t.liga of the state of Goi\u00e1s denied the petition for precautionary relief, citing the absence of any danger in delay, a requirement for the granting of precautionary relief. On September 26, 2019, Celg-D /fi.ligaled an appeal ( agravo de instrumento ) before the Cou/r\\_t.liga of the state of Goi\u00e1s against the decision denying the precautionary suspension, claiming that the repeal of the tax credit law is unconstitutional to the extent that these credits were established in accordance with applicable law and constitute acquired rights. As pa/r\\_t.liga of the same appeal proceeding, the state of Goi\u00e1s initiated  an  action  to  challenge  the  admissibility  of  the Celg-D petition, which was granted on a preliminary basis and subsequently challenged by Celg-D. On September 7, 2020, the state of Goi\u00e1s submi/t\\_t.ligaed its reply to the precautionary petition /fi.ligaled with the appeal.\n\nMoreover, the Brazilian association of electricity distribution companies (ABRADEE) had /fi.ligaled an action for a ruling on constitutionality with the Constitutional Cou/r\\_t.liga of Brazil (Supremo Tribunal Federal) with regard to Laws 20416 and 20468. This was denied on June 3, 2020 with an individual Decision by the judge-rappo/r\\_t.ligaeur for lack of formal requirements. On June 24, 2020, the ABRADEE /fi.ligaled an appeal (agravo regimental) against that decision. On September 21, 2020, the Supreme Cou/r\\_t.liga of Brazil, without going into the merits of the case, rejected ABRADEE's appeal for formal reasons and the proceeding was concluded. On October 15, 2020, ABRADEE /fi.ligaled an appeal against this decision.\n\n## Hydroelectric concessions\n\nItalian regulations governing large-scale hydroelectric concessions were recently modi/fi.ligaed by the 'Simpli/fi.ligacations Decree' (Decree Law 135 of 2018 rati/fi.ligaed with Law 12 of February 11, 2019), which introduced a series of innovations regarding  the  granting  of  such  concessions  upon  their expiry, or in the event of fo/r\\_f.ligaeiture or renunciation, and the valorization of the assets and works connected to them to be transferred to the new concession holder.

To this end, Enel entered into two new share swap agreements (the 'share swap transactions') with a /fi.liganancial institution. On May 28, 2020, following the se/t\\_t.ligalement of two share swap transactions entered into in June 2019 with a /fi.liganancial institution, the stake held by Enel SpA in Enel Am\u00e9ricas amounted to 62.3%. Subsequently, on August 18, 2020, Enel SpA increased its holding in Enel Am\u00e9ricas to 65% of that company's share capital, following the se/t\\_t.ligalement of the two share swap transactions entered into in April 2020.\n\nThe above transactions are in line with the announced goal of the Enel Group to increase its shareholding in the Group companies operating in South America, thus reducing the presence of non-controlling shareholdings.\n\n## Early closure of Unit 2 of the Brindisi plant is authorized\n\nOn May 28, 2020, Italy's Ministry for Economic Development gave Enel the green light for the early closure of Unit 2 of the Federico II thermal power plant in Brindisi as from January 1, 2021, following the Company's request presented in January 2020. This is the /fi.ligarst of the plant's four coal-/fi.ligared generation units set to be closed de/fi.liganitively. In line with Enel's strategy to decarbonize its electricity generation mix and with the objectives of Italy's Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan, in recent months the Company has sta/r\\_t.ligaed the permi/t\\_t.ligaing process for the conversion of the site into a high e/ffi.ligaciency gas-/fi.ligared plant. This process is necessary to ensure the complete closure of the Brindisi coal plant by 2025, while also guaranteeing the security of the national electricity grid. In addition, Enel is developing projects for the installation of photovoltaic capacity within the site, as pa/r\\_t.liga of the broader development initiative for the installation of new renewables capacity throughout Italy.\n\nThe early closure of Unit 2 of the Federico II plant in Brindisi is pa/r\\_t.liga of Enel's commitment to the energy transition towards an increasingly sustainable model.",

More speci/fi.ligacally, on May 28, 2020 Enel SpA announced that its Chilean subsidiaries Enel Chile SA and Enel Generaci\u00f3n Chile SA had informed the market of the decision of their respective Boards of Directors to expedite the closure of the Bocamina coal-/fi.ligared plant located in Coronel. Speci/fi.ligacally, Enel Generaci\u00f3n Chile asked the Chilean National Energy Commission (CNE) to authorize the termination of operations at Units I (128 MW) and II (350 MW) of the plant by the scheduled dates. The closure, which is subject to that authorization, has been accelerated compared with the original plans of Enel Generaci\u00f3n Chile in the national decarbonization plan signed with the Ministry of Energy of Chile on June 4, 2019, a plan that provided for the closure of Bocamina I by the end of 2023 and of Bocamina II by 2040. The Enel Group will ensure the re-employment of the workers at Bocamina within the Group, and at the same time will evaluate the possible conversion of the plant's structures.\n\n## Enel Board authorizes the issue of hybrid bonds in the maximum amount of \u20ac1.5 billion\n\nOn June 10, 2020, the Board of Directors of Enel SpA, meeting under the chairmanship of Michele Crisostomo, authorized the issue by Enel, by December 31, 2021, of one or more hybrid non-conve/r\\_t.ligaible subordinated bonds in the maximum amount of \u20ac1.5 billion, to be placed exclusively with EU and non-EU institutional investors, including through private placements. The new issues are intended to re/fi.liganance outstanding hybrid bonds for which early repayment options may be exercised as from this year, thus allowing the Enel Group to maintain a /fi.liganancial structure that is consistent with the assessment criteria of rating agencies and to actively manage maturities and the cost of debt.\n\nThe Board of Directors has also delegated the Chief Executive O/ffi.ligacer with the task of deciding the issue of the new bonds and their respective characteristics, and therefore to establish, for each issue, times, amount, currency, interest rate and fu/r\\_t.ligaher terms and conditions, as well as placement\n\nmethods and any listing on regulated markets or multilateral trading facilities, taking account of developments in market conditions.\n\n## Enel included in MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes for the /fi.ligarst time\n\nOn June 17, 2020, Enel was included for the /fi.ligarst time in the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes following the annual review carried out by the leading Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) research and index provider MSCI of its sustainability indices. This capitalization-weighted index series provides exposure to companies with high ESG pe/r\\_f.ligaormance relative to their sector peers. In addition, Enel has been con/fi.ligarmed in the prestigious FTSE4Good Index series and Euronext Vigeo Eiris 120 Indices. The indices, designed for institutional investors willing to integrate ESG factors into investment decision processes, uses a best-in-class approach by only selecting companies with the highest MSCI ESG ratings, which measure a company's resilience to long-term, /fi.liganancially-relevant ESG risks. In 2019 Enel received for the /fi.ligarst time the highest MSCI ESG rating ('AAA'), paving the way for the Company's inclusion this year in the MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes, the most prestigious among MSCI's index series measuring companies' sustainability pe/r\\_f.ligaormance. In addition, the inclusion is a/t\\_t.ligaributable to Enel's continued investments in renewables and to its ambitious carbon emissions reduction target aligned with the Paris Agreement, under which the Company commits to a 70% reduction in its direct greenhouse gas emissions per kWh by 2030 with respect to 2017 levels.\n\n## Enel reaches 64.9% of the share capital of Enel Chile\n\nOn July 7, 2020, Enel SpA announced that it had increased its stake in its Chilean subsidiary Enel Chile SA to 64.9% of the company's share capital, se/t\\_t.ligaling two share swap transactions entered into in December 2019 with a /fi.liganancial institution to acquire up to 3% of the share capital of Enel Chile, as announced to the /fi.liganancial markets at the time.\n\n## Enel accelerates energy transition towards decarbonization\n\nEnel, in its role as a leader of the energy transition, has pla-\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

The 2020-2022 Strategic Plan provides for a signi/fi.ligacant increase in installed renewables capacity, from the current 46 GW to 60 GW at the end of 2022, and the progressive reduction of coal-/fi.ligared capacity and generation. More speci/fi.ligacally, it is expected that such capacity will decrease by more than 40% in 2022 compared with 2019. In order to manage renewable and thermal generation assets around the world in an integrated manner and guide and accelerate its transformation, Enel created a new Business Line in 2019.\n\nIn this context, on July 2, 2020 Enel began restructuring the activities associated with the energy transition process,  which  will  involve  thermal  generation  plants  in  all the geographical areas in which the Group operates. The consequent revision of processes and operating models will require changes in the roles and skills of employees, which the Group intends to implement with highly sustainable plans based on redeployment programs, with major upskilling and reskilling plans and voluntary individual early retirement agreements that will involve around 1,300 people worldwide.\n\nThe restructuring plan will be implemented with procedures and timing that will di/ff.ligaer in the various countries in which we are present, initiating the appropriate dialogue with local communities and the competent institutions and social pa/r\\_t.liganers.\n\n## Enel launches sustainability-linked share buyback program suppo/r\\_t.ligaing its 2020 Long-Term Incentive Plan\n\nOn July 29, 2020, the Board of Directors of Enel, implementing the authorization granted by the shareholders at their meeting held on May 14, 2020 and in compliance with the terms disclosed to the market, approved the launch of a share buyback program involving 1.72 million shares (the 'Program'), equal to about 0.017% of Enel's share capital. The purpose of the Program, which ran from September 3 to December 7, 2020, was to suppo/r\\_t.liga the 2020 Long-Term Incentive Plan for the management of Enel and/or its subsidiaries pursuant to A/r\\_t.ligaicle 2359 of the Italian Civil Code (2020 LTI Plan), which was also approved by the shareholders at their meeting held on May 14, 2020.\n\nThe Program involved the purchase of a total of 1,720,000 Enel shares (equal to 0.016918% of share capital), at a volume-weighted average price of \u20ac7.4366 per share for a total of \u20ac12,790,870.154.\n\nConsidering the treasury shares already held in its po/r\\_t.ligafolio, on October 28, 2020, Enel holds a total of 3,269,152 treasury shares, equal to 0.032156% of share capital.\n\n## Enel issues perpetual hybrid bonds\n\nOn September 1, 2020, Enel successfully launched a euro-denominated,  non-conve/r\\_t.ligaible  bond  for  institutional investors on the European market in the form of a subordinated perpetual hybrid bond, with an aggregate principal amount of \u20ac600 million. The transaction was oversubscribed by more than six times, with total orders of more than \u20ac3.7 billion.\n\nAt the same time, Enel launched of a non-binding voluntary o/ff.ligaer to repurchase, and subsequently cancel, its \u00a3500 million hybrid notes due in 2076 with the goal of repurchasing a total of \u00a3200 million. As a result of the transaction, hybrid bonds with a total nominal value of \u00a3250 million were repurchased in cash.\n\n## Enel Board of Directors votes to sell 40%-50% of OpEn Fiber to Macquarie\n\nOn September 17, 2020, the Board of Directors of Enel SpA received notice of a binding o/ff.ligaer submi/t\\_t.ligaed by Macquarie Infrastructure & Real Assets (MIRA) for the acquisition of the 50% stake held by Enel in OpEn Fiber SpA.\n\nThe o/ff.ligaer provides for a price of about \u20ac2,650 million, net of debt, for the purchase of the investment, with adjustment and earn out mechanisms.\n\nEnel's Board of Directors acknowledged that it received the notice and is awaiting updates on the details that may emerge following an examination with MIRA of the details of the o/ff.ligaer.\n\nOn December 17, 2020, the Board of Directors of Enel SpA, meeting under the chairmanship of Michele Crisostomo, resolved to initiate the procedures for the sale of a stake of between 40% and 50% of the share capital of OpEn Fiber SpA to MIRA, giving the CEO speci/fi.ligac authority to pursue the transaction.\n\nBased on MIRA's /fi.liganal o/ff.ligaer, the price for the sale of 50% of OpEn Fiber is equal to \u20ac2,650 million and includes the transfer to MIRA of 100% of Enel's po/r\\_t.ligaion of the shareholder loan granted to OpEn Fiber, including accrued interest, amounting to an estimated \u20ac270 million at June 30, 2021, the date by which the transaction is expected to close. Should 40% of OpEn Fiber be sold, as MIRA's /fi.liganal o/ff.ligaer envisages a proportional reduction of the above values, the price would amount to \u20ac2,120 million, Enel's po/r\\_t.ligaion of the shareholder loan granted to OpEn Fiber being transferred to MIRA would be equal to 80%, with an estimated value at June 30, 2021 of around \u20ac220 million.

The o/ff.ligaer also provides for the payment of two di/ff.ligaerent earn-outs in favor of Enel related to future and unce/r\\_t.ligaain events. One earn-out is linked to the positive conclusion, with a /fi.liganal judgment, of the dispute initiated by OpEn Fiber against TIM SpA for anticompetitive conduct by the la/t\\_t.ligaer. Speci/fi.ligacally, this earnout will pay Enel 75% of any net damages that OpEn Fiber should subsequently collect and is expected to be paid to Enel based on the dividends distributed by OpEn Fiber to its shareholders for any reason. The earn-out will be calculated in propo/r\\_t.ligaion to the actual stake sold by Enel to MIRA. The other earn-out is related to the creation of value deriving from the possible implementation of the so-called 'single broadband network' between OpEn Fiber and TIM. It is based on investor returns and envisages that, should MIRA's stake in OpEn Fiber be transferred, resulting in a return on investment (IRR) greater than 12.5%, Enel will be paid 20% of the amount achieved by MIRA exceeding the above threshold, up to a maximum of \u20ac500 million should 50% of OpEn Fiber be sold and \u20ac400 million should 40% of the company be sold.\n\nThe signing of the purchase agreement between the parties is subject to ce/r\\_t.ligaain conditions, including:\n\n- \u203a OpEn Fiber issuing an authorization to MIRA to share the information acquired during the due diligence process with a small number of potential co-investors in order to syndicate the price;\n- \u203a the non-exercise of the right of pre-emption that the OpEn Fiber bylaws give CDP Equity SpA (CDPE, which is in turn 50% shareholder of OpEn Fiber);\n- \u203a in the event of the sale of 50% of OpEn Fiber, the agreement between MIRA and CDPE of the modi/fi.ligacation of ce/r\\_t.ligaain aspects that currently regulate the governance of OpEn Fiber.\n\nThe closing of the transaction is in turn subject to a series of conditions, including:\n\n- \u203a OpEn Fiber's lending banks obtaining the waivers required for the transfer of Enel's stake in OpEn Fiber to MIRA;\n- \u203a obtaining various administrative authorizations needed for the transfer of Enel's stake in OpEn Fiber to MIRA, speci/fi.ligacally relating to the golden power procedure with the Presidency of Italy's Council of Ministers and the authorization to be issued by the EU Antitrust Authority.\n\n## Enel Group begins reorganization of renewables business in Central and South America\n\nOn September 22, 2020, Enel SpA announced that the Board of Directors of its Chilean listed subsidiary Enel Am\u00e9ricas SA had resolved to commence the process to approve a merger as pa/r\\_t.liga of a corporate reorganization of the Enel Group's shareholdings, with the intention of integrating the non-conventional renewable energy businesses of the Enel Group in Central and South America (except Chile) into Enel Am\u00e9ricas. The transaction, consistent with Enel's strategic objectives, will fu/r\\_t.ligaher simplify the Group's corporate structure and align the structure of Enel Am\u00e9ricas' business with the rest of the Group.\n\nThe corporate reorganization provides for the integration into  Enel  Am\u00e9ricas  of  the  current  non-conventional  renewable assets of the Enel Group in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Panama and Peru, through a series of transactions culminating in a merger of those assets into Enel Am\u00e9ricas. The merger, which will increase Enel's stake in Enel Am\u00e9ricas, will also involve the amendment of the la/t\\_t.ligaer's bylaws by its Shareholders' Meeting to remove the existing limitation whereby a single shareholder may not hold more than 65% of the voting rights. That Shareholders' Meeting was also asked to approve the merger as a transaction with related pa/r\\_t.ligaies in compliance with applicable Chilean law.\n\nEnel has given Enel Am\u00e9ricas a favorable preliminary opinion on the reorganization provided that it:\n\n- \u203a is carried out on market terms and conditions;\n- \u203a ensures that Enel Am\u00e9ricas has a /fi.liganancial position that suppo/r\\_t.ligas the future development of the renewables business and the growth prospects of the company.\n\nThe favorable preliminary opinion is subject to an asses-\n\nsment by Enel of the /fi.liganal terms and conditions to be submi/t\\_t.ligaed for approval of the shareholders of Enel Am\u00e9ricas. On December 18, 2020, Enel SpA announced that the Extraordinary  Shareholders'  Meeting  of  the  listed  Chilean subsidiary Enel Am\u00e9ricas had adopted resolutions on that date concerning the implementation of the corporate reorganization intended to integrate the non-conventional renewable business of the Enel Group in Central and South America (excluding Chile) into Enel Am\u00e9ricas.\n\nOn December 17, 2020, Enel announced that as pa/r\\_t.liga of the  corporate  reorganization  intended  to  integrate  the non-conventional renewable energy business of the Enel Group in Central and South America (excluding Chile) into\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

The O/ff.ligaer was launched in March 2021 (for more details, please see note 55 to the consolidated /fi.liganancial statements). The O/ff.ligaer is also subject to Chilean, US and any other applicable regulations.\n\nAs announced on November 13, 2020, the Extraordinary Shareholders'  Meeting  of  Enel  Am\u00e9ricas  was  called  for December 18, 2020 to resolve on (i) the merger of EGP Am\u00e9ricas SpA into Enel Am\u00e9ricas with a consequent increase in the share capital of Enel Am\u00e9ricas in suppo/r\\_t.liga of the merger, and (ii) the amendment of the bylaws of Enel Am\u00e9ricas in order to remove the limits that currently do not allow a single shareholder to own more than 65% of shares with voting rights. The O/ff.ligaer is an oppo/r\\_t.ligaunity for non-controlling shareholders who wish to reduce their ownership interest in Enel Am\u00e9ricas after the merger is completed. In this respect, the O/ff.ligaer provides shareholders an oppo/r\\_t.ligaunity to sell shares for more than the price of 109.8 Chilean pesos per share that Enel Am\u00e9ricas will o/ff.ligaer in accordance with Chilean law to dissenting shareholders who intend to exercise their withdrawal rights.

The loan is linked to the key pe/r\\_f.ligaormance indicator (KPI) of Installed Renewables Capacity Percentage (i.e., consolidated installed renewables capacity as a percentage of total consolidated installed capacity) and to the related achievement of a Sustainability Pe/r\\_f.ligaormance Target (SPT) equal to or greater than 60% by December 31, 2022 (as of June 30, 2020, the /fi.ligagure was equal to 51.9%). Based on the achievement of the SPT by the target date, the credit line provides for a step-up/ step-down mechanism that will impact the interest spread applied to drawings on the line, thus re/fl.ligaecting the value of sustainability. The loan re/fl.ligaects the commitment of Enel, leading private electricity company in the world by installed renewables capacity, to contribute to the achievement of SDG 7.2, i.e. to 'Increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix by 2030'.\n\n## Enel launches a consent solicitation for holders of ce/r\\_t.ligaain hybrid bonds\n\nOn October 23, 2020, Enel announced that it had launched a consent solicitation addressed to the holders of a number of subordinated non-conve/r\\_t.ligaible hybrid bonds issued by the Company in order to align the terms and conditions of the bonds with those of the perpetual subordinated, non-conve/r\\_t.ligaible hybrid bond launched by Enel on September 1, 2020.

During the DJSI World selection process, Enel stood out in most of the 27 criteria assessed by SAM (the S&P Global Division in charge of ESG -  environmental, social and governance - related research acquired in 2020 from RobecoSAM, an a/ffi.ligaliate of asset management /fi.ligarm Robeco).\n\nSpeci/fi.ligacally, the Company achieved a score higher than 90/100 in more than 70% of the criteria, among which some of the most signi/fi.ligacant ones are climate strategy and market oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities, both criteria aimed at assessing the pe/r\\_f.ligaormance of electric utilities on leading the transition towards a low-carbon energy model. Enel also ranks /fi.ligarst in DJSI Europe for the 'Electric Utilities' sector and second globally in the overall family of Dow Jones Sustainability Indices for the same sector.\n\nEnel also excelled in other criteria focused on assessing responsible business management practices including risk and crisis management, environmental policy and management, operational eco-e/ffi.ligaciency, water-related issues, human rights, human capital development as well as transparency on social and environmental pe/r\\_f.ligaormance.\n\nThe Group's Spanish subsidiary Endesa has also been included in this year's DJSI World, marking the company's twentieth straight year in the index.

The unprecedented score achieved in the sustainability pe/r\\_f.ligaormance assessment, which doubles the average score, led to Enel being con/fi.ligarmed in the 2nd Half 2020 review of the Euronext Vigeo Eiris World 120 index. Powered by V.E's data, twice a year, the Euronext Vigeo Eiris World 120 index lists the 120 most sustainable companies out of the 1,500 largest companies in terms of free-/fl.ligaoat market capitalization in No/r\\_t.ligah America, Asia-Paci/fi.ligac and Europe.

As announced on December 18, 2015 and on July 28, 2016, the Contract had provided for the contribution to the newly established Slovak Power Holding BV (HoldCo) of the entire stake held by Enel Produzione in Slovensk\u00e9 elektr\u00e1rne, equal to 66% of the la/t\\_t.ligaer's capital, and governed the subsequent sale of 100% of HoldCo in two stages to EP Slovakia BV for a total of \u20ac750 million, subject to adjustment based on ce/r\\_t.ligaain criteria (the /fi.ligarst phase of the transaction was completed on July 28, 2016 with the sale to EP Slovakia of 50% of the share capital that Enel Produzione held in HoldCo).\n\nUnder the new general term agreement, which is subject to a number of conditions, Enel Produzione and EPH agreed a number of amendments to the Contract, which regard the /fi.liganancial suppo/r\\_t.liga provided to Slovensk\u00e9 elektr\u00e1rne for the completion of units 3 and 4 of the Mochovce nuclear power plant as well as the mechanisms governing the exercise of the put or call options concerning the transfer of the residual stake in HoldCo. More speci/fi.ligacally, with regard to the /fi.liganancial suppo/r\\_t.liga, the amendments provide that Enel Produzione will grant, directly or through other companies of the Enel Group, loans to the HoldCo - which will in turn make them available to Slovensk\u00e9 elektr\u00e1rne - in the maximum amount of \u20ac570 million falling due in 2032. These loans will be made available in accordance with the\n\nneeds and timing envisaged for the completion of the con-\n\nstruction of units 3 and 4 of the Mochovce nuclear power plant (the 'Project'). The disbursement of the /fi.ligarst loan, amounting to \u20ac270 million, is subject to ce/r\\_t.ligaain conditions, in pa/r\\_t.ligaicular the amendment of ce/r\\_t.ligaain loan agreements between Slovensk\u00e9 elektr\u00e1rne and its lender banks, in order to take account of the progress of the Project, and other conditions customary for these kinds of transactions. The disbursement of this /fi.ligarst loan is a condition for the effectiveness of the additional amendments to the Contract agreed between the pa/r\\_t.ligaies and illustrated below. The loans of up to \u20ac570 million come in addition to the loan of \u20ac700 million (jointly referred to as the 'Loans') already made by the Enel Group in line with the agreements amending the Contract signed by the pa/r\\_t.ligaies in 2018, whose maturity will also be extended to 2032. The new agreement between the pa/r\\_t.ligaies also envisages that EPH will grant an additional loan of \u20ac200 million to fund the Project.\n\nWith regard to the amendments related to the mechanisms governing the exercise of the put or call options, new rules have been introduced governing the so-called 'trigger  events'  under  which  Enel  Produzione  and  EPH  can exercise their respective options. Speci/fi.ligacally, the so-called 'Long Stop Date' has been eliminated (the date after which Enel Produzione and EPH were entitled to exercise their respective put and call options, even without completion of units 3 and 4 of the Mochovce nuclear power plant) and therefore the put or call options can be exercised after the latest of the following events:\n\n- \u203a six months from the date of completion of the trial run of Mochovce's unit 4 (i.e., the moment in which that plant will be able to send power to the grid and sell the generated electricity);\n- \u203a the date of completion of the /fi.ligarst outage of Mochovce's unit  4  (i.e.,  the  mandatory  annual  technical  shutdown of the plant to ensure adequate safety levels), which is expected to occur within a maximum of 12 months from the trial run; and\n- \u203a the Loans fall due, set for 2032.\n\nThe new agreement also gives EPH an early call option that can be exercised in the period between six months after the signing of the updated text of the Contract and the /fi.ligarst of the following dates:\n\n- \u203a four years from the completion of the trial run of unit 4 of the Mochovce plant; and\n- \u203a December 2028.\n\nThe total price of \u20ac750 million is subject to an adjustment mechanism, which will be calculated by independent experts in accordance with a formula de/fi.liganed in the Contract, for which the new agreement envisages a number of amendments relating to the exclusion of pa/r\\_t.liga of the investments planned for the completion of Mochovce's unit 4 and set-",

The Plan has a total value of more than \u20ac1,824 billion and provides for reinforcing the multiannual /fi.liganancial framework for 2021-2027 by \u20ac1,074 billion to rapidly direct investment where it is most needed (strengthening the Single Market, driving the green and digital transition and intensifying cooperation in areas such as health and crisis management) and establishes a new instrument - Next Generation EU - wo/r\\_t.ligah a total of \u20ac750 billion, to temporarily (2021-2024) increase the resources available in the EU budget and suppo/r\\_t.liga an immediate response to the crisis by kick-sta/r\\_t.ligaing the European economy through sustainable and resilient growth.\n\nWith pa/r\\_t.ligaicular regard to Next Generation EU, the most signi/fi.ligacant resources are focused on the Recovery and Resilience Facility, which provides for the allocation of \u20ac672.5 billion (\u20ac312.5 billion in the form of grants and \u20ac360 billion in loans) to suppo/r\\_t.liga investments and essential reforms for a lasting recovery (with a focus on investments connected with the green and digital transitions).\n\nIn this context, the Member States are called upon to prepare National Recovery and Resilience Plans (NRRPs), which must pursue the general objective of economic/social cohesion and resilience, mitigate the impact of the crisis and suppo/r\\_t.liga the green and digital transition, in line with the seven /fl.ligaagship areas (7) indicated in the guidelines published by the European Commission in September 2020. The NRRPs should be submi/t\\_t.ligaed by April 30, 2021 but many Member States have already initiated discussions with the Commission over draft plans (this was possible from October 15, 2020).\n\n## The European Green Deal\n\nFollowing the European Green Deal communication presented at the end of 2019, in the 1st Half of 2020 the European Commission published a series of legislative and non-legislative initiatives aimed at implementing the principles set out in the communication, which we discuss below.\n\n## European Climate Law\n\nThe proposal for a European Regulation, presented by the Commission on March 4, 2020 and currently under discussion in the Trilogue between the Commission, the European Parliament and the Council, would make the objective set in the European Green Deal to make the European economy and society climate neutral by 2050 legally binding. This means achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions (balance between emissions and absorption) for EU countries as a whole, mainly by cu/t\\_t.ligaing emissions, investing in green technologies and protecting the natural environment. Once approved, this would incorporate the objective of climate neutrality for 2050 in Union legislation for the /fi.ligarst time.\n\nThe European Commission proposal also includes the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 50-55% by 2030, suppo/r\\_t.ligaed by the Commission's Communication (and Impact Assessment) of September 2020, a target that was also approved by the European Council in December 2020. A more ambitious reduction target of 60% is currently being proposed in the European Parliament.\n\nTo pursue this objective, the proposal for an EU Regulation also provides that all European policies should be revised to ensure they contribute to achieving climate neutrality and the more ambitious intermediate target in 2030, so that all sectors of the European economy do their pa/r\\_t.liga. By 2021, the European Commission will propose a review of all policy instruments necessary to achieve the additional reductions planned for 2030.\n\n## Industrial Strategy\n\nThe new Industrial Strategy was presented on 10 March 2020. It is intended to maintain the global competitiveness of European industry, make Europe climate neutral by 2050 and shape Europe's digital future. The strategy proposes a series of initiatives (legislative and non-legislative) to suppo/r\\_t.liga all the players in European industry, from large to small businesses, research centers and sta/r\\_t.liga-ups. Actions include comprehensive measures to modernize and decarbonize energy-intensive industries, to suppo/r\\_t.liga sustainable and intelligent mobility industries, to promote energy e/ffi.ligaciency and to ensure a su/ffi.ligacient and secure supply of low-carbon energy at competitive prices. The Industrial Strategy also",

In addition to a complete series of actions, both horizontal and in favor of speci/fi.ligac technologies, the Commission will systematically analyze the risks and needs of the various industrial ecosystems. In pe/r\\_f.ligaorming this analysis, the Commission will work in close collaboration with an open and inclusive industrial forum, which will be set up by September 2020.\n\n## Communication on 'Shaping Europe's digital future'\n\nOn February 19, 2020, the Commission presented strategies for data and a/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacial intelligence (AI). This communication introduces a series of legislative and non-legislative initiatives, with the aim of developing technology at the service of citizens and creating a fair and competitive digital economy. The areas involved in these initiatives are manifold: creation of digital skills, regulation of competition and platforms (through a proposal for a Digital Services Act) and climate neutrality by 2050.\n\nIn more detail, the aim of the data strategy is to ensure that the EU takes on the role of model and guide for companies made more autonomous thanks to data. The strategy essentially aims to create a true European data space and a single market for data, in order to unlock so far unused data to enable their free movement within the European Union in all sectors, thus bene/fi.ligating businesses, researchers and governments. The Commission proposes to establish a regulatory framework for data governance, access to data and reuse of data between businesses, between businesses and government and within government. The Commission intends to suppo/r\\_t.liga the development of technological systems and the next generation of infrastructure, which will allow the EU and all operators to take advantage of the oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities o/ff.ligaered by the data economy.\n\nIn the White Paper on A/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacial Intelligence, the Commission called for a reliable framework based on excellence and trust. In a pa/r\\_t.liganership between the public and private sectors, the goal is to mobilize resources along the entire value chain and create the right incentives to accelerate the adoption of solutions based on AI. The document calls for clear rules to govern high-risk AI systems without imposing excessive burdens on less risky ones. The White Paper also underscores the fact that strict EU rules must continue to\n\napply to protect consumers, to address unfair commercial practices and to protect personal data and privacy.\n\n## Sustainable and Sma/r\\_t.liga Mobility Strategy\n\nOn December 9, 2020, the Sustainable and Sma/r\\_t.liga Mobility Strategy was presented by the European Commission together with an action plan comprising 82 initiatives. The strategy lays the foundation for how the EU transpo/r\\_t.liga system will need to achieve its green and digital transformation and become more resilient to future crises. As indicated in the European Green Deal, the goal is to achieve a 90% reduction in emissions by 2050, thanks to an intelligent, competitive, safe, accessible and a/ff.ligaordable transpo/r\\_t.liga system. All modes of transpo/r\\_t.liga will need to become more sustainable, with green alternatives widely available, which is why the strategy sets speci/fi.ligac milestones.\n\nBy 2030, at least 30 million zero-emission cars will be on European roads, 100 European cities will be climate-neutral and zero-emission marine vessels will be market-ready. By 2035, zero-emission large aircraft will be market-ready. Finally, by 2050, nearly all cars, vans, buses and new heavy-duty vehicles will be zero-emission, rail freight tra/ffi.ligac will double and the multimodal trans-European Transpo/r\\_t.liga Network will be fully operational for sustainable and sma/r\\_t.liga transpo/r\\_t.liga with high-speed connectivity.\n\n## Hydrogen Strategy\n\nThe EU Hydrogen Strategy was presented on July 8, 2020. The strategy seeks to foster an integrated energy system in which hydrogen plays a role in the decarbonization of industry, transpo/r\\_t.liga, construction and power generation across Europe. The priority of the strategy, through investments, the creation of a suitable regulatory framework, the creation of a market and measures to suppo/r\\_t.liga research and innovation, is to develop renewable hydrogen, produced using mainly wind and solar energy. In the sho/r\\_t.liga term, the strategy also includes the use of other low-carbon forms of hydrogen to rapidly reduce emissions and suppo/r\\_t.liga the creation of a market. The strategy aims to suppo/r\\_t.liga the installation of at least 6 GW of renewable hydrogen electrolyzers in the European Union and the production of up to 1 million metric tons of renewable hydrogen between 2020 and 2024, 40 GW of renewable hydrogen electrolyzers and the production of up to 10 million metric tons of renewable hydrogen between 2025 and 2030 and the large-scale deployment of hydrogen-based solutions in all hard-to-decarbonize sectors from 2030.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

        "page_content": "## EU strategy on energy system integration\n\nIn conjunction with the Hydrogen Strategy, the EU strategy for energy system integration was also presented on July 8, 2020. The aim of the strategy is to transform today's energy system, in which each sector (transpo/r\\_t.liga, industry, gas, construction) constitutes a separate silo, by creating new intersectoral connections, exploiting technological advances in order to achieve climate neutrality by 2050 in the most cost e/ff.ligaective way. The strategy lists 38 actions to achieve this more integrated energy system and is based on three pillars: a more circular energy system, centered on energy ef/fi.ligaciency, accelerating direct electri/fi.ligacation of end-user sectors and the promotion of clean fuels, including renewable hydrogen, biofuels and sustainable biogas in sectors that are di/ffi.ligacult to electrify.\n\n## Just Transition Fund\n\nThe Just Transition Fund (JTF) is a funding instrument included within the Just Transition Mechanism (JTM), aimed at suppo/r\\_t.ligaing Member States in reducing the economic and social impacts of the transition to a climate-neutral economy. The total resources (2021-2027) at the Community level allocated to the JTF amount to \u20ac17.5 billion, of which \u20ac7.5 billion from the EU's multiannual /fi.liganancial framework\n\nfor 2021-2027 and \u20ac10 billion from Next Generation EU. The resources are allocated between the Member States by the Commission, and Italy would be eligible for about \u20ac900 million, with just under \u20ac800 million going to Spain and Greece and about \u20ac2 billion to Romania (at 2018 prices). The JTF will suppo/r\\_t.liga workers, businesses and regional authorities in the green transition and will /fi.liganance a large number of initiatives, including the remediation and decontamination of brown/fi.ligaeld sites, investments in renewables and energy e/ffi.ligaciency, upskilling and reskilling, and sustainable mobility. The Member States are called upon to present national transition plans that cover one or more territories within the country that are most strongly impacted by the transition to a green economy.\n\n## Sustainable Finance\n\nIn March 2020, the Taxonomy Expe/r\\_t.liga Group presented its /fi.liganal taxonomy repo/r\\_t.liga and a guide on recommendations for a European Green Bond standard. With regard to the taxonomy, in June the European Parliament approved the EU taxonomy regulation. The European Parliament's approval followed the adoption of the text by the Council on June 10, 2020. The Commission must now adopt delegated acts on the European taxonomy that establish the technical screening criteria for determining whether a speci/fi.ligac economic activity substantially contributes to achievement of one or more of the EU's environmental goals. The adoption of the delegated\n\nacts, initially scheduled for the end of 2020, was postponed to the early months of 2021. As regards the Green Bonds, after the issue of the guidelines, a public consultation was held in June-October to suppo/r\\_t.liga the Commission in assessing ce/r\\_t.ligaain key aspects relating to the Green Bond Standard. In the conclusions of the European Council meeting on December 10 and 11, the leaders of the Member States called on the EU to promote the development of common global rules for green /fi.liganance. In this context, the Council invited the Commission to present the legislative proposal on the EU Green Bond Standard by June 2021 at the latest.\n\n## State aid decisions\n\nOn March 19, 2020 and as subsequently amended on April 3, May 8 and June 29, 2020, the European Commission adopted a temporary framework for addressing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in order to suppo/r\\_t.liga Member States with regard to the use of State aid to provide the necessary liquidity to the economic system, including SMEs, to facilitate its application to all sectors and types of business a/ff.ligaected by the crisis (with the exception of the /fi.liganancial sector and for companies already in di/ffi.ligaculty at the end of 2019) and to help stabilize the European economy while preserving the single market.\n\nOn May 28, 2020, the European Commission approved a suppo/r\\_t.liga scheme for the generation of electricity in the Canary Islands, Balearic Islands, Ceuta and Melilla within the State aid framework for the provision of services of general economic interest (SGEI).\n\nThe Commission approved the scheme until the end of 2029 for the Canary Islands, Ceuta and Melilla and 2025 for the Balearic Islands. In order to ensure the long-term security of supply, Spain has unde/r\\_t.ligaaken to build a second subsea connection between the mainland and Majorca by 2025. The mechanism will compensate electricity generators ful/fi.ligalling a public service obligation for the additional cost of providing these services and ensure the establishment of competitive procedures for the development of new generation plants and/or decarbonized solutions.\n\nOn  September  22,  the  Vice  President  of  the  European Commission and Commissioner for Competition Margaret Vestager announced a 'Call for Contributions' on the role of competition policy in suppo/r\\_t.ligaing the objectives of the European Green Deal. The document, which was sent to the European Commission on November 20, 2020, concerns the control of the State aid, antitrust and merger regulations and the possible introduction of a 'Green Bonus' for measures suppo/r\\_t.ligaing decarbonization.\n\nOn November 12, 2020, the European Commission published the Impact Assessment on the revision of the guide-",

Admission to the cost reimbursement scheme guarantees coverage of the operating costs of the plants, including a po/r\\_t.ligaion of return on invested capital.\n\nFor 2020 and 2021, the remainder of essential capacity was contracted under alternative contracts which provide for the obligation, on the Ancillary Services Market (ASM), to o/ff.ligaer to go up/down to prices no higher/lower than the values identi/fi.ligaed using methods established by the Regulatory Authority for Energy, Networks and the Environment (ARERA) for a /fi.ligaxed premium.\n\nOn June 28, 2019, the Minister for Economic Development issued a decree approving the de/fi.liganitive rules governing the capacity remuneration mechanism (the capacity market). On November 6 and November 28, 2019 two auctions were held with delivery in 2022 and 2023 respectively: Enel was awarded capacity for both years. A number of operators and a sectoral trade association contested the decree and the results of the two auctions before the Milan Regional Administrative Cou/r\\_t.liga. Two operators also challenged the European Commission decision approving the Italian mechanism before the EU Cou/r\\_t.liga. Both proceedings are under way.\n\nARERA has con/fi.ligarmed the transitional capacity payment mechanism for 2020 and 2021 in order to ensure continuity with the new capacity market, which will produce a /fi.liganancial impact sta/r\\_t.ligaing from 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

Contracts for delivery in 2023-2027 were awarded through a tender. Enel was awarded contracts to supply this service.\n\nIn  February  2020,  Law  8/2020  (ratifying  Decree  Law 162/2019,  the  'Milleproroghe'  omnibus  extension  act) was published. It contains provisions to activate the implementation of experimental con/fi.ligagurations of collective self-consumption from renewable sources or renewable energy communities, pending the transposition of Directive (EU) 2018/2001.\n\nFollowing this measure, in August 2020 ARERA issued Resolution no. 318/2020/R/eel, containing the provisions on the  regulation  of  economic  items  relating  to  electricity subject to collective self-consumption or sharing in the scope of renewable energy community.\n\nThe Ministry for Economic Development, by means of the Ministerial Decree of September 16, 2020, has therefore identi/fi.ligaed the incentive rate for the remuneration of renewable source plants included in these experimental con/fi.ligagurations.\n\n## Iberia\n\n## Spain\n\n## Remuneration parameters for generation from renewable sources, cogeneration and waste\n\nThe measure TED/171/2020 of February 24, 2020 updated the remuneration parameters applicable to standard plants and to ce/r\\_t.ligaain plants for the generation of electricity from renewable sources, cogeneration and waste for the second regulatory period, with e/ff.ligaect for both from January 1, 2020.\n\n## European Commission Decision C (2020) 3401 on electricity production in Spanish non-peninsular territories (NPT)\n\nOn May 28, 2020, the European Commission approved the regulatory scheme established with Royal Decree 738/2015 of July 31, 2015 regulating the production of electricity in the non-peninsular territories (NPT), concluding that it meets the criteria for services of general economic interest and is compatible with the internal market.

On August 7, 2020, Decree TED/776/2020 of 4 August was published in Spain's O/ffi.ligacial Journal, revising these prices.\n\n## Law 5 of April 29, 2020 of the Autonomous Community of Catalonia\n\nOn June 2, 2020, Law 5 of April 29, 2020 of the Autonomous Community  of  Catalonia  concerning  /fi.ligascal,  /fi.liganancial  and administrative measures in the public sector and the introduction of a tax on generation plants with impacts on the environment was published in Spain's O/ffi.ligacial Journal. Among other aspects, this law includes the creation and regulation of a tax on structures a/ff.ligaecting the environment within the Autonomous Community of Catalonia. In pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, this new tax is levied on the production, storage, transformation and transpo/r\\_t.liga of electricity. Electricity generation is taxed at a general rate of \u20ac5/MWh, and a dedicated rate of \u20ac1/MWh for combined-cycle plants, while excluding hydroelectric plants and generation from renewable sources, as well as from biomass, biogas, high-e/ffi.ligaciency cogeneration or sewage. With regard to the transpo/r\\_t.liga of electricity, a quota is established based on the voltage level, while transpo/r\\_t.liga structures with a voltage of less than 30 kV and transpo/r\\_t.liga infrastructures for renewable power evacuation are exempted.\n\n## Europe\n\n## Romania\n\n## Electricity generation\n\nFollowing the entry into force of Regulation no. 943/2019/EU and the expected transposition of Directive 2019/944/EU, the prohibition on long-term bilateral negotiated contracts (PPAs) under Romanian law since 2012 was weakened following the adoption of Government Emergency Ordinance 74/2020, which allows new power generation facilities to sign long-term PPAs (more than one year) in order to secure /fi.liganancing for construction.\n\n## Electricity management\n\nDuring 2020, following Balancing Market reforms, the price caps that link the closing market price of the Balancing Market to the closing prices on the Day-Ahead Market were eliminated. Fu/r\\_t.ligahermore, the dual pricing system will be replaced by a single price, and the period relevant for se/t\\_t.ligalement purposes will be changed from hourly to an interval of 15 minutes.",

For Enel Russia, the rate for the Nevinnomysskaya GRES plant is lower than that envisaged in the 2020 budget.\n\nIn  March  2020,  Enel  Russia  signed  compromise  agreements with the No/r\\_t.ligah Caucasus guarantee suppliers to reschedule the time limits for ful/fi.ligallment of the electricity and capacity payment obligations under the wholesale market contracts accumulated before January 1, 2020, subject to the payment of interest at the reference interest rate set by the central bank.\n\n## Latin America\n\n## Chile\n\n## Rate revision - Introduction of a transitional electricity price stabilization mechanism\n\nOn November 2, 2019, Law 21.185 of the Ministry of Energy was published. It introduced a transitional electricity price stabilization mechanism for customers on the regulated market. Consequently, the prices to be charged to regulated customers in the 2nd Half of 2019 were set at the level of those applied in the 1st Half of 2019 (Decree 20T/2018) and were de/fi.liganed as 'Stabilized Prices for Regulated Customers' (PEC).\n\nBetween January 1, 2021 and the termination of this mechanism, the prices charged will be those set every six months on the basis of A/r\\_t.ligaicle 158 of the Electricity Act and cannot exceed the PEC adjusted for consumer price in/fl.ligaation.\n\nAny di/ff.ligaerences between the amount billed in application of the stabilization mechanism and the theoretical bill determined on the basis of considering the price that would have been applied under the terms of contracts with the various electricity distribution companies will be recognized by generators as receivables for invoices to be issued, up to a maximum of $1,350 million until 2023. These di/ff.ligaerences will be recognized in US dollars and will not accrue interest until the end of 2025. Any imbalances in favor of the generation companies will have to be recovered no later than December 31, 2027.\n\n4\n\n## Enel Green Power\n\n## Italy\n\nThe Ministerial Decree of July 4, 2019 provided for competitive procedures based on Dutch auctions and registers, depending  on  the  installed  capacity  and  by  technology groups, including photovoltaic systems. In pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, up to September 2021, seven procedures will be held with:\n\n- \u203a Dutch auctions for plants with a capacity of more than 1 MW;\n\n\u203a registers for plants with a capacity of less than 1 MW. Unlike previous decrees, the Ministerial Decree of July 4, 2019 provides for a new method for suppo/r\\_t.ligaing renewable sources through two-way contracts for di/ff.ligaerences under which the successful tenderer returns any positive di/ff.ligaerences between the zonal price and the auction price. At October 31, 2020 the indicative annual cumulative cost was around \u20ac5.3 billion, compared with a ceiling of \u20ac5.8 bil-\n\nlion for termination of the incentive mechanism.\n\n## Iberia\n\n## Spain\n\nRoyal Decree Law 23/2020 provided an impo/r\\_t.ligaant impetus to accelerate the development of renewable energy in Spain. It established the legal basis for auctioning power generated from renewable sources based on the long-term price of electricity. It also regulated various aspects to improve management and reduce speculation in managing the access and connection of renewable energy projects to grids. In particular, it established that at sites where coal or thermonuclear power plants have been closed, account can be taken of environmental and social criteria, as well as technical criteria, in allocating grid access capacity. Finally, the royal decree proposes  various  improvements  for  faster  administrative processing of renewable energy projects.\n\nIn 2020, the Spanish government worked to de/fi.ligane a roadmap for hydrogen and a storage strategy.\n\nIn the closing months of the year, various regulations governing auctions were also approved, including a royal decree for  renewable  energy  auctions  (Royal  Decree  960/2020) and a ministerial decree governing auction procedures and establishing an indicative calendar (Ministerial Decree TED 1161/2020), while, /fi.liganally, a 3,000 MW auction was announced for January 2021.\n\nDuring the year, proposals were submi/t\\_t.ligaed for regulations governing grid access and connection for the generation of\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

This regulation will be completed in January 2021 with the approval of a circular by the National Commission on Markets and Competition. The entire access and connection regulatory package will be completed in the 1st Qua/r\\_t.ligaer of 2021 with the approval of the Detailed Speci/fi.ligacations of technical criteria. It will grant greater access capacity to grids for renewable generation and establish rules improving management of the system.\n\n## Europe\n\n## Greece\n\nFollowing approval by the European Commission, the Minister of Energy extended the remuneration regime for interruptibility services until September 30, 2021. Interruptibility is a demand response service willing industrial consumers interrupt their consumption when required, in exchange for a fee /fi.ligaxed by auction. The scheme is /fi.ligananced by all generators operating on the mainland, including EGPH, through the transfer of a percentage of their revenue. The percentage applied di/ff.ligaers depending on the generation technology used: wind = 1.8% (previously 2%), small hydro = 0.8% (previously 1%), PV = 3.6% (no change).\n\nLaw 4759/2020 published in December 2020 introduced measures to reduce the de/fi.ligacit of the renewable energy remuneration fund, which /fi.liganances incentives for producers. These measures include a retroactive contribution of 6% of the 2020 annual turnover of renewable energy generators, which will only apply to renewables plants that entered service 2015. Electricity sellers are required to pay a levy of \u20ac2/ MWh for power purchased in 2021.\n\nThe decision of the Regulatory Authority for Energy (RAE) no. 1538/2020 published in December 2020 set the UOCC contribution for 2021 at \u20ac0.325/MWh, slightly lower than the previous year (in 2020 it was \u20ac0.326/MWh). This rate applies to monthly revenue from the electricity generation of all renewable and cogeneration units in operation and serves to cover the operating and investment costs of DAPEEP, the Greek operator responsible for the management of incentives for renewable generation and the issue of guarantees of origin.\n\n## No/r\\_t.ligah America\n\n## United States\n\nIn May 2020, the United States Treasury Depa/r\\_t.ligament amended  the  administrative  guidelines  for  section  45  of  the Production Tax Credit (PTC) for investments in wind plants, granting eligible projects two more years to enter service and maintain eligibility under the 'continuity requirement'.\n\nThe guide was published to take account of construction and supply chain delays caused by the COVID-19 emergency. Eligible wind projects that began construction in 2016 can now be put into service until 2021, receiving 100% of the PTC (for example, $25/MW, adjusted annually for in/fl.ligaation) for the /fi.ligarst 10 years of operation. Projects that sta/r\\_t.ligaed construction in 2017 can now be put into service until 2022, receiving 80% of the PTC (for example, $20/MW, adjusted annually for in/fl.ligaation) for the /fi.ligarst 10 years of operation.\n\nIn December 2020, the US Congress approved and President Trump signed a two-year extension of the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) for investments in Section 48 solar systems and a one-year extension of Section 45 of the PTC for investments in wind farms.\n\nEligible solar projects can now receive an Investment Tax Credit of 26% of the project capital costs if they sta/r\\_t.liga construction before January 1, 2023 and enter service before January 1, 2026. Eligible projects that begin construction before January 1, 2024 and enter service before January 1, 2026 can receive an ITC of 22% of the capital costs of the project. Eligible wind projects can now receive 60% (i.e. $15/MWh) of the PTC (adjusted annually for in/fl.ligaation) for the /fi.ligarst 10 years of operation if construction begins before January 1, 2022. Wind farms have no statutory deadline for entering service but, as discussed above, US Treasury Depa/r\\_t.ligament guidelines generally dictate that projects must sta/r\\_t.liga operation within four years of sta/r\\_t.ligaing construction. A project that sta/r\\_t.ligaed construction in 2020 is therefore expected to enter service before January 1, 2025, and a project that begins construction in 2021 is expected to enter service before January 1, 2026.\n\n## Africa, Asia and Oceania\n\n## South Africa\n\nIn August 2020, the Risk Mitigation Independent Power Producer Procurement Program (RMIPPPP) was launched, an auction for the development of 2,000 MW of capacity, which should enter service by June 2022. In the event of an award to Enel Green Power, the payments for the electricity generated, for capacity and for ancillary services will have a positive impact on Enel Green Power's results.\n\nA fu/r\\_t.ligaher procurement auction for 11,813 MW (of which 6,800 from renewable sources) under the long-term energy development plan (Integrated Resource Plan - IRP 2019) was approved by the regulator NERSA in September 2020 and is expected to take place in 2021.\n\nFrom October 2020, municipalities (which together with Eskom are South Africa's electricity distributors) have been",

This change in the rules improves Enel Green Power's earnings outlook.\n\n## India\n\nThe government took a number measures in 2020 to protect the renewable energy sector from the adverse e/ff.ligaects of COVID-19. The pandemic was declared a cause of force majeure, which allowed operators to suspend their obligations without incurring penalties. To safeguard renewable generation projects, a 5-month extension of the deadline for entering service was granted, which is also applicable to EGP India's 285 MW Coral project.\n\nIn addition, the government issued strict instructions to protect private generators from any arbitrary cu/r\\_t.ligaailment decisions by discoms at a time of very weak electricity demand, as well as to ensure timely payment of power purchases by discoms.\n\nIn 2019, the Ministry of Energy had ordered discoms to issue le/t\\_t.ligaers of credit to private generators under the terms of their respective power purchase agreements (PPAs). The Gurajat State Distribution Company was forced to open and maintain a le/t\\_t.ligaer of credit in March 2020. This reduced the risk faced by Enel Green Power projects.\n\n## Australia\n\nIn September 2020, the regulator AER agreed a change in approach by the AEMO system operator with regard to new connections, moving from the parallel evaluation of new connections to a sequential approach (where generators are placed in a progressive queue). Each connection request is evaluated on the basis of the impact it has individually on the grid. AEMO will be able to begin the evaluation of an application only if the previous application has received a no-impact assessment on grid security (or - if not - if actions have been taken to remove the impact). This change added signi/fi.ligacant delays in the connection of Enel Green Power plants in Cohuna and Girgarre (whose connection was expected in 2020), with a signi/fi.ligacant impact on Enel Green Power's /fi.liganancial pe/r\\_f.ligaormance.\n\n## Infrastructure and Networks\n\n## Italy\n\nThe rate for the /fi.ligafth regulatory period (2016-2023) is governed by ARERA Resolution no. 654/2015/R/eel. This period lasts eight years and is divided into two sub-periods of four years each (NPR1 for 2016-2019 and NPR2 for 20202023).\n\nWith regard to the NPR2 period, ARERA published Resolution no. 568/2019/R/eel, with which it updated rates for distribution and metering services in force in the 2020-2023 period, publishing the new integrated texts (TIT 2020-2023 and TIME 2020-2023).\n\nWith Resolution no. 639/2018/R/com, ARERA set the value of the WACC for distribution and metering activities, valid for the 2019-2021 period, at 5.9%.\n\nAs for distribution and metering rates, ARERA approved both the de/fi.liganitive reference rates for 2019, calculated by taking into account the actual balance sheet data for 2018 (Resolution no. 144/2020/R/eel), and the provisional reference rates for 2020 on the basis of the preliminary balance sheet data for 2019 (Resolution no. 162/2020/R/eel). The de/fi.liganitive reference rates for 2020 are expected to be published in the early months of 2021.\n\nWith Resolution no. 449/2020/R/eel, ARERA adjusted the grid  loss  regulations  for  the  2019-2021  period,  revising the conventional percentage loss factors to be applied to low-voltage withdrawals and making a number of changes to the methods for calculating the annual equalization amount.\n\nAs  regards  service  quality,  ARERA,  with  Resolution  no. 646/2015/R/eel  as  amended,  established  output-based regulation for electricity distribution and metering services, including the principles for regulation for 2016-2023 (TIQE 2016-2023). With Resolution no. 566/2019/R/eel, ARERA completed the update of the TIQE for the 2020-2023 semi-period, proposing tools to bridge gaps in quality of service still existing between the various areas of the country, taking account of the time needed to implement interventions on the grid as well as the e/ff.ligaects of climate change. With  Resolution  no.  534/2019/R/eel,  ARERA  published the list of interventions in the 2019-2021 Resilience Plan of e-distribuzione eligible for the bonus-penalty mechanism  envisaged  under  the  provisions  of  Resolution  no. 668/2019/R/eel, which introduced an incentive mechani-\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

These decrees must be approved by the National Commission for Markets and Competition. At the end of 2020 only the decree relating to the gas system had been approved, while the decree for the electricity system is still awaiting approval.\n\n## Bill establishing a National Fund for the Sustainability of the Electricity System\n\nOn  December  16,  2020,  the  Ministry  for  the  Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge has launched a public consultation for a bill to create a National Fund for the Sustainability of the Electricity System, which would /fi.liganance, in whole or in pa/r\\_t.liga, the costs connected with speci/fi.ligac remuneration scheme for generation from renewables, cogeneration and waste, currently included in electricity grid access rates.

The preliminary bill envisages a mechanism to redistribute the cost associated with achieving renewables objectives at the national level among all energy sectors and provides for a gradual introduction of /fi.ligave years.\n\n## Europe\n\n## Romania\n\nThe regulated rate of return (RAB) was reviewed by the energy regulator ANRE. After an order that set the value at 5.66% in 2019, it was set at 6.39% in 2020, with a 1% bonus for new investments.\n\nWith Law 155/2020, Parliament introduced an obligation for  distribution  system  operators  (DSOs)  to  /fi.liganance  the connection to the network of new non-residential customers located less than 2,500 meters from the electricity distribution grid.\n\nWith Law 290/2020, the Parliament introduced an obligation for DSOs to /fi.liganance all new connections of new residential customers.\n\n## Latin America\n\n## Chile\n\n## Law 21.194\n\nOn December 21, 2019, the Ministry of Energy published Law 21.194 which lowered the remuneration of distribution companies and enhanced the process for se/t\\_t.ligaing electricity distribution rates. The law changes the discount rate for the calculation of annual investment costs, which went from 10% to a rate that must be between 6% and 8% post tax. The post-tax remuneration rate for electricity distribution companies must not be more than two points above or three points below the remuneration rate set by the CNE (National Energy Commission).

The rate review took account of the advances received by Enel Distribui\u00e7\u00e3o S\u00e3o Paulo on account for COVID-19, thus reducing the impact of this increase on end users. In the absence of these advances, the average rate increase would have been 12.22%.\n\n## ANEEL Resolution no. 878/2020\n\nANEEL took measures valid for 90 days from March 24, 2020, to ensure the distribution of electricity during the COVID-19 emergency, including: banning the interruption of service to residential customers in urban and rural areas; granting permission for the suspension of delivery of invoices issued to consumers, replacing them with the issue of electronic invoices or barcodes; and giving priority to emergency and essential services in order to facilitate social distancing measures and ensure the continuous and reliable supply of electricity.\n\n## Provisional measure no. 950/2020 of the Federal government\n\nThe provisional measure no. 950/2020 introduced by the Federal government granted a full discount for needy customers billed up to 220 kWh/month, allocating pa/r\\_t.liga of the CDE's resources to fund the measure and allowing the CDE to draw /fi.liganancial resources to address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the electricity sector.\n\n## Reduction of ancillary charges and taxes for electricity transmission\n\nIn order to provide liquidity to the electricity industry in response to COVID-19, on April 20, 2020 ANEEL approved measures to facilitate the payment of transmission rates by distributors and end users.\n\nThe main measure involved moving forward the /fi.liganancial e/ff.ligaects of the adjustment scheme for April, May and June 2020.

The measure is valid for 120 days. It is expected that a law with the same provisions will be enacted at that time.\n\n## ANEEL Directives nos. 2177/2020, 2353/2020 and 2640/2020\n\nThese directive establish the value of the COVID-19 account resources transferred to the distribution concession holders in July, August and September.\n\n## Colombia\n\nThe Energy and Gas Regulation Commission (CREG) determines the remuneration methodology for the distribution network. Distribution rates are set every /fi.ligave years and updated monthly based on the producer price index.\n\nIn response to the national and global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, in March 2020 the Colombian government declared a state of economic, social and ecological emergency for the entire country and ordered mandatory preventive isolation for all inhabitants. These measures led to the issue of a range of transitional rules and regulations by Colombian authorities that govern public services, including electricity supply, in order to ensure the continuity of the delivery of public domestic services and to mitigate /fi.liganancial and social e/ff.ligaects in the electricity and natural gas sector. The measures were extended until May 31, 2021.\n\nOn June 24, 2020, the Commission issued CREG Resolution 122, which approved the distribution rates of Enel Codensa. Brie/fl.ligay, CREG, in its /fi.liganal approval, corrected the Asset Base and incorporated some additional events in the calculation\n\nof quality indicators and established the retroactive application of incentives for service quality.\n\n## Peru\n\nIn Peru, the process for determining distribution rates takes place every four years and is referred to as the 'Se/t\\_t.ligaing the  Aggregate  Distribution  Value'  ('VAD').  Exceptionally, the last rate cycle set a duration of /fi.ligave years, considering that an extra year was necessary to implement the reform approved in 2015 with Peruvian Legislative Decree 1221. Therefore, in 2018 the process of determining the VAD was completed for the years 2018-2022. At the end of this rate process, in general, the rates set for the previous regulatory period (years 2013-2017) were unchanged.\n\nWith Decreto Supremo 044-2020-PCM, published on March 15, 2020, a state of national emergency was declared for 15 days. This period has since been repeatedly extended and is now in place until at least March 31, 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. During this period, some social distancing measures were taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

By  promoting  decarbonization,  electri/fi.ligacation  and  platform migration processes, the Group also plans to create shared and sustainable value for all stakeholders, for example:\n\n- \u203a pursuing an 80% reduction in direct CO 2 emissions compared with 2017 in a strategy that will reduce extraction by about 200 million barrels of oil equivalent;\n- \u203a saving consumers about 25% on their total energy bills while simultaneously reducing their emissions;\n- \u203a investing in digitalization and the creation of platforms to o/ff.ligaer a level of service three times higher than the current level, with a system average duration interruption index (SAIDI) falling to about 100 minutes in 2030; \u203a generating over \u20ac240 billion of gross domestic product\n- in the countries in which the Group operates, through local investments in generation and electri/fi.ligacation.\n\nIn 2021-2023, the Group expects to invest around \u20ac40 billion directly, of which \u20ac38 billion through the Ownership business model and around \u20ac2 billion through the Stewardship business model, while mobilizing \u20ac8 billion in investment from third pa/r\\_t.ligaies.\n\nWith regard to the investments planned within the framework of the Ownership business model:\n\n- \u203a more than half will be dedicated to Global Power Generation, with approximately \u20ac17 billion allocated to increasing renewable generation capacity, which will rise to 60 GW on a consolidated basis in 2023;\n- \u203a about  43%  will  be  dedicated  to  Infrastructure  and Networks. The acceleration of investments is expected to lead to an increase in the Group's RAB, which will reach \u20ac48 billion in 2023;\n- \u203a the remainder will be dedicated to the Customers business: the customer value of the business-to-consumer segment is expected to increase by about 30%, compared with an increase of some 45% in the business-to-business segment, thanks to the elimination of regulated rates, mainly in Italy, and the trend of electri/fi.ligacation of energy consumption, which will promote 'beyond commodity' services.\n\nInvestments under the Stewardship business model will mainly be dedicated to renewable energy, as well as to /fi.ligaber optics, e-transpo/r\\_t.liga and /fl.ligaexibility services.\n\nOver 90% of Enel's investments on a consolidated basis will be in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Fu/r\\_t.ligahermore, according to Enel's initial calculations, between 80% and 90% of its investments on a consolidated basis will be aligned with the European taxonomy criteria thanks to its substantial contribution to climate change mitigation.\n\nFu/r\\_t.ligahermore, over the period covered by the Plan, Enel will implement a simple, predictable and a/t\\_t.ligaractive dividend policy: shareholders will receive a /fi.ligaxed, guaranteed and increasing dividend per share (DPS) over the next three years, with the aim of reaching \u20ac0.43 per share by 2023.\n\nIn 2021, the following are expected:\n\n- \u203a an  acceleration  of  investments  in  renewable  energy, especially in Latin America and No/r\\_t.ligah America, to suppo/r\\_t.liga industrial growth and as pa/r\\_t.liga of the decarbonization policies followed by the Group;\n- \u203a an increase in investments to improve the quality and resilience of distribution networks, especially in Italy and Latin America, as well as their fu/r\\_t.ligaher digitalization;\n- \u203a an increase in investments dedicated to the electri/fi.ligacation of energy consumption, especially in Italy, with the\n\n<!-- image -->",

Form and content of the consolidated /fi.liganancial statements\n\nEnel SpA has its registered o/ffi.ligace in Viale Regina Margherita 137, Rome, Italy, and since 1999 has been listed on the Milan stock exchange.\n\nThere were no changes in the company name in 2020.\n\nEnel is an energy multinational and is one of the world's leading integrated operators in the electricity and gas industries, with a special focus on Europe and Latin America. The consolidated /fi.liganancial statements as at and for the year ended December 31, 2020 comprise the /fi.liganancial statements of Enel SpA, its subsidiaries and Group holdings in associates and joint ventures, as well as the Group's share of the assets, liabilities, costs and revenue of joint operations ('the\n\nGroup').\n\nA list of the subsidiaries, associates, joint operations and joint\n\nventures included in the consolidation scope is a/t\\_t.ligaached. These  consolidated  /fi.liganancial  statements  were  approved and authorized for publication by the Board of Directors on March 18, 2021.\n\nThese consolidated /fi.liganancial statements have been audited by KPMG SpA.\n\n## Basis of presentation\n\nThe consolidated /fi.liganancial statements as at and for the year ended December 31, 2020 have been prepared in accordance with international accounting standards ( International Accounting Standards - IAS and International Financial Repo/r\\_t.ligaing Standards - IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), the interpretations of the IFRS Interpretations Commi/t\\_t.ligaee (IFRSIC) and the Standing Interpretations Commi/t\\_t.ligaee (SIC), recognized in the European Union pursuant to Regulation (EC) no. 1606/2002 and in e/ff.ligaect as of the close of the year. All of these standards and interpretations are hereinafter referred to as the 'IFRS-EU'. The consolidated /fi.liganancial statements have also been pre-\n\npared in conformity with measures issued in implementation of A/r\\_t.ligaicle 9, paragraph 3, of Legislative Decree 38 of February 28, 2005.\n\nThe consolidated /fi.liganancial statements consist of the income statement, the statement of comprehensive income, the statement of /fi.liganancial position, the statement of changes in equity and the statement of cash /fl.ligaows and the related notes.\n\nThe assets and liabilities recognized in the statement of /fi.liganancial position are classi/fi.ligaed on a 'current/non-current basis', with separate repo/r\\_t.ligaing of assets held for sale and liabilities included in disposal groups held for sale. Current assets, which include cash and cash equivalents, are assets that are intended to be realized, sold or consumed during the normal operating cycle of the Group; current liabilities are liabilities that are expected to be se/t\\_t.ligaled during the normal operating cycle of the Group.\n\nThe  income  statement  classi/fi.ligaes  costs  on  the  basis  of their nature, with separate repo/r\\_t.ligaing of pro/fi.ligat/(loss) from continuing operations and pro/fi.ligat/(loss) from discontinued operations  a/t\\_t.ligaributable  to  owners  of  the  Parent  and  to non-controlling interests.\n\nThe consolidated cash /fl.ligaow statement is prepared using the indirect method, with separate repo/r\\_t.ligaing of any cash /fl.ligaows by operating, investing and /fi.liganancing activities associated with discontinued operations.\n\nIn pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, although the Group does not diverge from the provisions of IAS 7 in the classi/fi.ligacation of items:\n\n- \u203a cash /fl.ligaows from operating activities repo/r\\_t.liga cash /fl.ligaows from core operations, interest on loans granted and obtained and dividends received from associates or joint ventures;\n- \u203a investing activities comprise investments in prope/r\\_t.ligay, plant and equipment and intangible assets and disposals of such assets and contract assets related to service concession arrangements. They include, also, the e/ff.ligaects of business combinations in which the Group acquires or loses control of companies, as well as other minor investments;\n- \u203a cash /fl.ligaows from /fi.liganancing activities include cash /fl.ligaows generated by liability management transactions and leases, dividends and interim dividends paid to owners of the Parent and non-controlling interests and the e/ff.ligaects of transactions in non-controlling interests that do not change the status of control of the companies involved;\n- \u203a a separate item is used to repo/r\\_t.liga the impact of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents and their impact on pro/fi.ligat or loss is eliminated in full in order to neutralize the e/ff.ligaect on cash /fl.ligaows from operating activities.\n\nFor more information on cash /fl.ligaows as repo/r\\_t.ligaed in the statement of cash /fl.ligaows, please see the note on 'Cash /fl.ligaows' in the Repo/r\\_t.liga on Operations.\n\nThe consolidated /fi.liganancial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis using the cost method, with the",

Accounting policies\n\n## 2.1 Use of estimates and management judgment\n\nPreparing  the  consolidated  /fi.liganancial  statements  under IFRS-EU requires management to take decisions and make estimates and assumptions that may impact the carrying amount of revenue, costs, assets and liabilities and the related disclosures concerning the items involved as well as contingent assets and liabilities at the repo/r\\_t.ligaing date. The estimates and management's judgments are based on previous experience and other factors considered reasonable in the circumstances. They are formulated when the carrying amount of assets and liabilities is not easily determined from other sources. The actual results may therefore di/ff.ligaer from these estimates. The estimates and assumptions are periodically revised and the e/ff.ligaects of any changes are re/fl.ligaected through pro/fi.ligat or loss if they only involve that period. If the revision involves both the current and future periods, the change is recognized in the period in which the revision is made and in the related future periods. In order to enhance understanding of the consolidated /fi.liganancial statements, the following sections examine the main items a/ff.ligaected by the use of estimates and the cases that re/fl.ligaect management judgments to a signi/fi.ligacant degree, underscoring the main assumptions used by management in measuring these items in compliance with the IFRS-EU. The critical element of such valuations is the use of assumptions and professional judgments concerning issues that are by their very nature unce/r\\_t.ligaain.\n\nChanges in the conditions underlying the assumptions and\n\njudgments could have a substantial impact on future results. In addition, as regards the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the forecasts for future developments in the macroeconomic, /fi.liganancial and business environment in which the Group operates are characterized by a high degree of unce/r\\_t.ligaainty, which is re/fl.ligaected in the assessments and the estimates produced by management regarding the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities a/ff.ligaected by greater volatility. In this regard, the following sections provide speci/fi.ligac information on the estimates and judgments used in the areas of the /fi.liganancial statements most a/ff.ligaected by the COVID-19 pandemic, drawing on the information available at December 31, 2020 and considering the constantly evolving scenario. Please see note 9.a 'Revenue from sales and services', note 17 'Prope/r\\_t.ligay, plant and equipment', note 22 'Goodwill', note 37 'Employee bene/fi.ligats' and note 44 'Financial instruments by category' for the main impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWith regard to the e/ff.ligaects of climate change issues, the Group believes that climate change represents an implicit element in the application of the methodologies and models used to pe/r\\_f.ligaorm estimates in the valuation and/ or measurement of ce/r\\_t.ligaain accounting items. Fu/r\\_t.ligahermore, the Group has taken account of the impact of climate change in the signi/fi.ligacant judgments made by management. In this regard, the main items included in the consolidated /fi.liganancial statements at December 31, 2020 a/ff.ligaected by management's use of estimates and judgments refer to the impairment of non-/fi.liganancial assets and obligations connected with generation plants, including those for decommissioning and site restoration. For fu/r\\_t.ligaher details on these items, see note 17 'Prope/r\\_t.ligay, plant and equipment', note 22 'Goodwill' and note 38 'Provisions for risks and charges'.\n\n## Use of estimates\n\n## Revenue from contracts with customers\n\nRevenue from supply of electricity and gas to end users is recognized at the time the electricity or gas is delivered and includes, in addition to amounts invoiced on the basis of periodic (and pe/r\\_t.ligaaining to the year) meter readings or on the volumes noti/fi.ligaed by distributors and transpo/r\\_t.ligaers, an estimate of the electricity and gas delivered during the period but not yet invoiced that is equal to the di/ff.ligaerence between the amount of electricity and gas delivered to the distribution network and that invoiced in the period, taking account of any network losses. Revenue between the date of the last meter reading and the year-end is based\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

Value in use is based on the estimated future cash /fl.ligaows generated by the asset, discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that re/fl.ligaects the current market assessment of the time value of money and of the speci/fi.ligac risks of the asset.\n\nFuture cash /fl.ligaows used to determine value in use are based on the most recent business plan, approved by the management, containing forecasts for volumes, revenue, operating costs and investments. These projections cover the next three years. For subsequent years, account is taken of:\n\n- \u203a assumptions  concerning  the  long-term  evolution  of the main variables considered in the calculation of cash /fl.ligaows, as well as the average residual useful life of the assets or the duration of the concessions, based on the speci/fi.ligac characteristics of the businesses;\n- \u203a a long-term growth rate equal to the long-term growth of electricity demand and/or in/fl.ligaation (depending on the country and business) that does not in any case exceed the average long-term growth rate of the market involved.\n\nThe recoverable amount is sensitive to the estimates and assumptions used in the calculation of cash /fl.ligaows and the discount rates applied. Neve/r\\_t.ligaheless, possible changes in the underlying assumptions on which the calculation of such amounts is based could generate di/ff.ligaerent recoverable amounts. The analysis of each group of non-/fi.liganancial assets is unique and requires management to use estimates and assumptions considered prudent and reasonable in the speci/fi.ligac circumstances.\n\nIn the current scenario, the analysis of impairment indicators has become even more impo/r\\_t.ligaant as an a/t\\_t.ligaempt was also made to assess whether the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic  could  reduce  the  carrying  amount  of  ce/r\\_t.ligaain\n\nnon-/fi.liganancial assets as at December 31, 2020. For this reason, the Group has carefully considered the e/ff.ligaects of the COVID-19 pandemic in determining the existence of impairment indicators for non-/fi.liganancial assets.\n\nFu/r\\_t.ligahermore, in line with its business model and in the context of the acceleration of the decarbonization of the generation mix and driving the energy transition process, the Group has also carefully assessed whether climate change issues have a/ff.ligaected the reasonable and suppo/r\\_t.ligaable assumption used to estimate expected cash /fl.ligaows. In this regard, where necessary, the Group has also taken account of the long-term impact of climate change, in pa/r\\_t.ligaicular by considering in the estimation of the terminal value a longterm growth rate in line with the change in electricity demand in 2030-2050 based on the speci/fi.ligac characteristics of the businesses involved.\n\nInformation on the main assumptions used to estimate the recoverable amount of assets with reference to the impacts relating to the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change, as well as information on changes in these assumptions, is provided in note 22 'Goodwill'.\n\n## Expected credit losses on /fi.liganancial assets\n\nAt the end of each repo/r\\_t.ligaing period, the Group recognizes a loss allowance for expected credit losses on trade receivables and other /fi.liganancial assets measured at amo/r\\_t.ligaized cost, debt instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, contract assets and all other assets in scope.\n\nLoss allowances for /fi.liganancial assets are based on assumptions about risk of default and on the measurement of expected credit losses. Management uses judgment in making these assumptions and selecting the inputs for the impairment calculation, based on the Group's past experience, current market conditions as well as forward-looking estimates at the end of each repo/r\\_t.ligaing period.\n\nThe expected credit loss (i.e. ECL) - determined considering probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD), and exposure at default (EAD) - is the di/ff.ligaerence between all contractual cash /fl.ligaows that are due in accordance with the contract and all cash /fl.ligaows that are expected to be received (including all sho/r\\_t.ligafalls) discounted at the original e/ff.ligaective interest rate (EIR).\n\nIn pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, for trade receivables, contract assets and lease receivables, including those with a signi/fi.ligacant /fi.liganancial component,  the  Group  applies  the  simpli/fi.ligaed  approach, determining expected credit losses over a period corresponding to the residual life of the asset, generally equal to 12 months.\n\nBased on the speci/fi.ligac reference market and the regulatory context of the sector, as well as expectations of recovery after 90 days, for such assets, the Group mainly applies",

        "page_content": "- a  default  de/fi.liganition  of  180  days  past  due  to  determine expected credit losses, as this is considered an e/ff.ligaective indication of a signi/fi.ligacant increase in credit risk. Accordingly, /fi.liganancial assets that are more than 90 days past due are generally not considered to be in default, except for some speci/fi.ligac regulated markets.\n\nFor trade receivables and contract assets the Group mainly applies a collective approach based on grouping trade receivables/contract assets into speci/fi.ligac clusters, taking into account the speci/fi.ligac regulatory and business context. Only if the trade receivables are deemed to be individually signi/fi.ligacant by management and there is speci/fi.ligac information about any signi/fi.ligacant increase in credit risk, does the Group apply an analytical approach.\n\nIn case of individual assessment, PD is mainly obtained from an external provider.\n\nConversely, for collective assessment, trade receivables are grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and past due information, considering a speci/fi.ligac de/fi.liganition of default.\n\nBased on each business and local regulatory framework as well as di/ff.ligaerences in customer po/r\\_t.ligafolios also in terms of risk, default rates and recovery expectations, speci/fi.ligac clusters are de/fi.liganed.\n\nThe contract assets are considered to have substantially the same risk characteristics as the trade receivables for the same types of contracts.\n\nIn order to measure the ECL for trade receivables on a collective basis, as well as for contract assets, the Group considers the following assumptions related to ECL parameters:\n\n- \u203a PD, assumed as to be the average default rate, is calculated on a cluster basis and taking into consideration minimum 24 month historical data;\n- \u203a LGD is function of the default bucket's recovery rates, discounted at the EIR; and\n- \u203a EAD is estimated as the carrying exposure at the reporting date net of cash deposits, including invoices issued but not expired and invoices to be issued.\n\nBased on speci/fi.ligac management evaluations, the forward-looking adjustment can be applied considering qualitative and quantitative information in order to re/fl.ligaect possible future events and macroeconomic scenarios, which may a/ff.ligaect the risk of the po/r\\_t.ligafolio or the /fi.liganancial instrument. In order to take account of the e/ff.ligaects of the COVID-19\n\npandemic on the impairment of trade receivables, speci/fi.ligac\n\nadjustments were made to the results of the impairment model adopted by the Group based on IFRS 9 (so-called 'post-model adjustments'), determined mainly on the basis of an expe/r\\_t.liga credit judgment based on the deterioration in the collection status of ce/r\\_t.ligaain customer segments. For additional details on the key assumptions and inputs used\n\nplease refer to note 44 'Financial instruments by category'.\n\n## Depreciable amount of ce/r\\_t.ligaain elements of Italian hydroelectric plants subsequent to enactment of Law 134/2012\n\nLaw 134 of August 7, 2012 containing 'urgent measures for growth' (published in the Gazze/t\\_t.ligaa U/ffi.ligaciale of August 11, 2012), introduced a sweeping overhaul of the rules governing hydroelectric concessions. Among its various provisions, the law establishes that /fi.ligave years before the expiration of a major hydroelectric water diversion concession and in cases of lapse, relinquishment or revocation, where there is no prevailing public interest for a di/ff.ligaerent use of the water, incompatible with its use for hydroelectric generation, the competent public entity shall organize a public call for tenders for the award for consideration of the concession for a period ranging from 20 to a maximum of 30 years.\n\nIn order to ensure operational continuity, the law also governs the methods of transferring ownership of the business unit necessary to operate the concession, including all legal relationships relating to the concession, from the outgoing concession holder to the new concession holder, in exchange for payment of a price to be determined in negotiations between the depa/r\\_t.ligaing concession holder and the grantor agency, taking due account of the following elements:\n\n- \u203a for intake and governing works, penstocks and out/fl.ligaow channels, which under the consolidated law governing waters and electrical plants are to be relinquished free of charge (A/r\\_t.ligaicle 25 of Royal Decree 1775 of December 11, 1933), the revalued cost less government capital grants, also revalued, received by the concession holder for the construction of such works, depreciated for ordinary wear and tear;\n- \u203a for other prope/r\\_t.ligay, plant and equipment, the market value, meaning replacement value, reduced by estimated depreciation for ordinary wear and tear.\n\nWhile acknowledging that the new regulations introduce impo/r\\_t.ligaant changes as to the transfer of ownership of the business unit with regard to the operation of the hydroelectric concession, the practical application of these principles faces di/ffi.ligaculties, given the unce/r\\_t.ligaainties that do not\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

        "page_content": "permit the formulation of a reliable estimate of the value that can be recovered at the end of existing concessions (residual value).\n\nAccordingly, management has decided it could not produce a reasonable and reliable estimate of residual value.\n\nThe fact that the legislation requires the new concession holder to make a payment to the depa/r\\_t.ligaing concession holder prompted management to review the depreciation schedules for assets classi/fi.ligaed as to be relinquished free of charge prior to Law 134/2012 (until the year ended on December 31, 2011, given that the assets were to be relinquished free of charge, the depreciation period was equal to the closest date between the term of the concession and the end of the useful life of the individual asset), calculating depreciation no longer over the term of the concession but, if longer, over the useful life of the individual assets. If additional information becomes available to enable the calculation of residual value, the carrying amounts of the assets involved will be adjusted prospectively.\n\n## Determining the fair value of /fi.liganancial instruments\n\nThe fair value of /fi.liganancial instruments is determined on the basis of prices directly observable in the market, where available, or, for unlisted /fi.liganancial instruments, using speci/fi.ligac valuation techniques (mainly based on present value) that maximize the use of observable market inputs. In rare circumstances where this is not possible, the inputs are estimated by management taking due account of the characteristics of the instruments being measured.\n\nFor more information on /fi.liganancial instruments measured at fair value, please see note 48 'Assets and liabilities measured at fair value'.\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 13, the Group includes a mea-\n\nsurement of credit risk, both of the counterpa/r\\_t.ligay (Credit Valuation Adjustment or CVA) and its own (Debit Valuation Adjustment or DVA), in order to adjust the fair value of /fi.liganancial instruments for the corresponding amount of counterpa/r\\_t.ligay risk, using the method discussed in note 48. Changes in the assumptions made in estimating the input data could have an impact on the fair value recognized for those instruments, especially in current conditions where markets are volatile and the economic outlook is highly unce/r\\_t.ligaain and subject to rapid change.\n\n## Development expenditure\n\nIn order to determine the recoverability of development expenditure, the recoverable amount is estimated making assumptions  regarding  any  fu/r\\_t.ligaher  cash  out/fl.ligaow  that  is expected to be incurred before the asset is ready for use or sale, the discount rates to be applied and the expected period of bene/fi.ligats.\n\n## Pensions and other post-employment bene/fi.ligats\n\nSome  of  the  Group's  employees  pa/r\\_t.ligaicipate  in  pension plans o/ff.ligaering bene/fi.ligats based on their wage history and years of service. Ce/r\\_t.ligaain employees are also eligible for other post-employment bene/fi.ligat schemes.\n\nThe expenses and liabilities of such plans are calculated on the basis of estimates carried out by consulting actuaries, who use a combination of statistical and actuarial elements in their calculations, including statistical data on past years and forecasts of future costs. Other components of the estimation that are considered include mo/r\\_t.ligaality and retirement rates as well as assumptions concerning future developments in discount rates, the rate of wage increases, the in/fl.ligaation rate and trends in healthcare cost.\n\nThese estimates can di/ff.ligaer signi/fi.ligacantly from actual developments owing to changes in economic and market conditions, increases or decreases in retirement rates and the lifespan of pa/r\\_t.ligaicipants, as well as changes in the e/ff.ligaective cost of healthcare.\n\nSuch  di/ff.ligaerences  can  have  a  substantial  impact  on  the\n\nquanti/fi.ligacation of pension costs and other related expenses. With regard to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Group has carefully analyzed the possible impacts of the economic crisis generated by the emergency on the actuarial assumptions used in the measurement of the actuarial liabilities and assets serving the plans.\n\nFor more details on the main actuarial assumptions adopted, please see note 37.\n\n## Provisions for risks and charges\n\nFor more details on provisions for risks and charges, please see note 38 'Provisions for risks and charges'.\n\nNote 53 'Contingent assets and liabilities' also provides information regarding the most signi/fi.ligacant contingent liabilities for the Group.\n\n## Litigation\n\nThe Group is involved in various civil, administrative and tax disputes connected with the normal pursuit of its activities that could give rise to signi/fi.ligacant liabilities. It is not always objectively possible to predict the outcome of these disputes. The assessment of the risks associated with this litigation is based on complex factors whose very nature requires recourse to management judgments, even when taking account of the contribution of external advisors assisting the Group, about whether to classify them as contingent liabilities or liabilities.\n\nProvisions have been recognized to cover all signi/fi.ligacant liabilities for cases in which legal counsel feels an adverse outcome is likely and a reasonable estimate of the amount of the expense can be made.",

The nature of such obligations may also have a major impact on the accounting treatment used for them.\n\nIn the case of nuclear power plants, where the costs regard both decommissioning and the storage of waste fuel and other radioactive materials, the estimation of the future cost is a critical process, given that the costs will be incurred over a very long span of time, estimated at up to 100 years.\n\nThe obligation, based on /fi.liganancial and engineering assumptions, is calculated by discounting the expected future cash /fl.ligaows that the Group considers it will have to pay to meet the obligations it has assumed.\n\nThe discount rate used to determine the present value of the liability is the pre-tax risk-free rate and is based on the economic parameters of the country in which the plant is located.\n\nThat liability is quanti/fi.ligaed by management on the basis of the technology existing at the measurement date and is reviewed each year, taking account of developments in storage, decommissioning and site restoration technology, as well as the ongoing evolution of the legislative framework governing health and environmental protection.\n\nSubsequently, the value of the obligation is adjusted to re/fl.ligaect the passage of time and any changes in estimates.\n\n## Onerous contracts\n\nIn order to identify an onerous contract, the Group estimates the non-discretionary costs necessary to ful/fi.ligal the obligations assumed (including any penalties) under the contract and the economic bene/fi.ligats that are presumed to be obtained from the contract.\n\n## Leases\n\nWhen the interest rate implicit in the lease cannot be readily determined, the Group uses the incremental borrowing rate (IBR) at the lease commencement date to calculate the present value of the lease payments. This is the interest rate that the lessee would have to pay to borrow over a similar term, and with a similar security, the funds necessary to obtain an\n\nasset of a similar value to the right of use asset in a similar economic environment. When no observable inputs are available, the Group estimates the IBR making assumptions to re/fl.ligaect the terms and conditions of the lease and ce/r\\_t.ligaain lessee-speci/fi.ligac estimates.\n\nOne of the most signi/fi.ligacant judgments for the Group in adopting IFRS 16 is determining this IBR necessary to calculate the present value of the lease payments required to be paid to the lessor. The Group approach to determine an IBR is based on the assessment of the following three key components:\n\n- \u203a the risk free rate, that consider the currency /fl.ligaows of the lease payments, the economic environment where the lease contract has been negotiated and also the lease term;\n- \u203a the credit spread adjustment, in order to calculate an IBR that is speci/fi.ligac for the lessee considering any underlying Parent or other guarantee;\n- \u203a the lease related adjustments, in order to re/fl.ligaect into the IBR calculation the fact that the discount rate is directly linked to the type of the underlying asset, rather than being a general incremental borrowing rate. In pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, the risk of default is mitigated for the lessors as they have the right to reclaim the underlying asset itself.\n\nFor more information on lease liabilities, please see note 44 'Financial instruments by category'.\n\n## Income tax\n\n## Recovery of deferred tax assets\n\nAt December 31, 2020, the consolidated /fi.liganancial statements repo/r\\_t.liga deferred tax assets in respect of tax losses or tax credits usable in subsequent years and income components whose deductibility is deferred in an amount whose future recovery is considered by management to be highly probable.\n\nThe recoverability of such assets is subject to the achievement of future pro/fi.ligats su/ffi.ligacient to absorb such tax losses and to use the bene/fi.ligats of the other deferred tax assets. Signi/fi.ligacant management judgment is required to assess the probability of recovering deferred tax assets, considering all negative and positive evidence, and to determine the amount that can be recognized, based upon the likely timing and the level of future taxable pro/fi.ligats together with future tax planning strategies and the tax rates applicable at the date of reversal. However, where the Group should become aware that it is unable to recover all or pa/r\\_t.liga of recognized tax assets in future years, the consequent adjust-\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

Deferred tax assets not recognized are reassessed at each repo/r\\_t.ligaing date in order to verify the conditions for their recognition.\n\nWhere required, the Group monitored the recovery times of deferred tax assets as well as those relating to the reversal of deductible temporary di/ff.ligaerences, if any, as a result of the greater unce/r\\_t.ligaainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nFor more detail in deferred tax assets recognized or not recognized, please see note 23.\n\n## Management judgment\n\n## Identi/fi.ligacation of cash generating units (CGUs)\n\nFor impairment testing, if the recoverable amount cannot be determined for an individual asset, the Group identi/fi.ligaes the smallest group of assets that generate largely independent cash in/fl.ligaows. The smallest group of assets that generates cash in/fl.ligaows that are largely independent of the cash in/fl.ligaows from other assets or group of assets is a CGU.\n\nIdentifying such CGUs involves management judgments regarding the speci/fi.ligac nature of the assets and the business involved (geographical segment, business segment, regulatory framework, etc.) and the evidence that the cash in/fl.ligaows of the group of assets are closely interdependent and largely independent of those associated with other assets (or groups of assets).\n\nThe assets of each CGU are also identi/fi.ligaed on the basis of the manner in which management manages and monitors those assets within the business model adopted.\n\nThe number and scope of the CGUs are updated systematically to re/fl.ligaect the impact of new business combinations and reorganizations carried out by the Group, and to take account of external factors that could in/fl.ligauence the ability of assets to generate independent cash in/fl.ligaows.\n\nIn pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, if ce/r\\_t.ligaain speci/fi.ligac identi/fi.ligaed assets owned by the Group are impacted by adverse economic or operating conditions that undermine their capacity to contribute to the generation of cash /fl.ligaows, they can be isolated from the rest of the assets of the CGU, undergo separate analysis of their recoverability and be impaired where necessary.\n\nThe CGUs identi/fi.ligaed by management to which the goodwill recognized in these consolidated /fi.liganancial statements has been allocated and the criteria used to identify the CGUs are indicated in note 22 'Goodwill'.\n\n## Determination of the existence of control\n\nUnder the provisions of IFRS 10, control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to a/ff.ligaect\n\nthose returns through its power over the investee. Power is de/fi.liganed as the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee based on existing substantive rights.\n\nThe existence of control does not depend solely on ownership of a majority investment, but rather it arises from substantive rights that each investor holds over the investee. Consequently, management must use its judgment in assessing whether speci/fi.ligac situations determine substantive rights that give the Group the power to direct the relevant activities of the investee in order to a/ff.ligaect its returns.\n\nFor the purpose of assessing control, management analyzes all facts and circumstances including any agreements with other investors, rights arising from other contractual arrangements and potential voting rights (call options, warrants, put options granted to non-controlling shareholders, etc.).\n\nThese other facts and circumstances could be especially signi/fi.ligacant in such assessment when the Group holds less than a majority of voting rights, or similar rights, in the investee.\n\nFollowing such analysis of the existence of control, in application of IFRS 10 the Group consolidated ce/r\\_t.ligaain companies (Emgesa and Codensa) on a line-by-line basis even though it did not hold more than half of the voting rights, determining that the requirements for de facto control existed.\n\nFu/r\\_t.ligahermore, even if it holds more than half of the voting rights in another entity, the Group considers all the relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it controls the investee.\n\nThe Group reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the elements considered in verifying the existence of control.\n\n## Determination of the existence of joint control and of the type of joint arrangement\n\nUnder the provisions of IFRS 11, a joint arrangement is an agreement where two or more pa/r\\_t.ligaies have joint control. Joint control exists only when the decisions over the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of all the pa/r\\_t.ligaies that share joint control.\n\nA joint arrangement can be con/fi.ligagured as a joint venture or a joint operation. Joint ventures are joint arrangements whereby the pa/r\\_t.ligaies that have joint control have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. Conversely, joint operations are joint arrangements whereby the pa/r\\_t.ligaies that have joint control have rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities relating to the arrangement.\n\nIn order to determine the existence of the joint control and the type of joint arrangement, management must apply judgment and assess its rights and obligations arising from the arrangement. For this purpose, the management considers the structure and legal form of the arrangement, the terms agreed by the pa/r\\_t.ligaies in the contractual arrangement and, when relevant, other facts and circumstances.",

In general, it is presumed that the Group has a signi/fi.ligacant in/fl.ligauence when it has an ownership interest of 20% or more.\n\nIn order to determine the existence of signi/fi.ligacant in/fl.ligauence, management must apply judgment and consider all facts and circumstances.\n\nThe Group re-assesses whether or not it has signi/fi.ligacant in/fl.ligauence if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the elements considered in verifying the existence of signi/fi.ligacant in/fl.ligauence.\n\nFor more information on the Group's equity investments in associates, please see note 24 'Equity-accounted investments'.\n\n## Application of 'IFRIC 12 - Service concession arrangements' to concessions\n\nIFRIC 12 applies to 'public-to-private' service concession arrangements, which can be de/fi.liganed as contracts under which the operator is obligated to provide public services, i.e. give access to major economic and social services for a ce/r\\_t.ligaain period of time, on behalf of a public entity (the grantor). In these contracts, the grantor conveys to an operator the right to manage the infrastructure used to provide services.\n\nMore speci/fi.ligacally, IFRIC 12 gives guidance on the accounting by operators for 'public-to-private' service concession arrangements in the event that:\n\n- \u203a the grantor controls or regulates what services the operator must provide with the infrastructure, to whom it must provide them, and at what price; and\n- \u203a the grantor controls - through ownership, bene/fi.ligacial entitlement or otherwise - any signi/fi.ligacant residual interest\n\nin the infrastructure at the end of the term of the arrangement.\n\nIn assessing the applicability of these requirements for the Group, as operator, management carefully analyzed existing concessions.\n\nOn the basis of that analysis, the provisions of IFRIC 12 are applicable to some of the infrastructure of a number of companies that operate in Brazil.\n\nFu/r\\_t.ligaher details about the infrastructure used in the service concession arrangements in the scope of IFRIC 12 are provided in note 18.\n\n## Revenue from contracts with customers\n\nIn the process of applying IFRS 15, the Group has made the following judgments (fu/r\\_t.ligaher details about the most signi/fi.ligacant e/ff.ligaect on the Group's revenue are provided in note 9.a 'Revenue from sales and services').\n\nFu/r\\_t.ligahermore, during the year, the Group carefully monitored the e/ff.ligaects of the unce/r\\_t.ligaainties linked to the COVID-19 pandemic on the recognition of its revenue, in pa/r\\_t.ligaicular as regards the main areas a/ff.ligaected by signi/fi.ligacant judgments.\n\n## Identi/fi.ligacation of the contract\n\nThe Group carefully analyzes the contractual terms and conditions on a jurisdictional level in order to determine when a contract exists and the terms of that contract's enforceability so as to apply IFRS 15 only to such contracts.\n\nIdenti/fi.ligacation and satisfaction of pe/r\\_f.ligaormance obligations When a contract includes multiple promised goods or services, in order to assess if they should be accounted for separately or as a group, the Group considers both the individual characteristics of goods/services and the nature of the promise within the context of the contract, also evaluating all the facts and circumstances relating to the speci/fi.ligac contract under the relevant legal and regulatory framework.\n\nTo evaluate when a pe/r\\_f.ligaormance obligation is satis/fi.ligaed, the Group evaluates when the control of the goods or services is transferred to the customer, assessed primarily from the perspective of the customer.\n\n## Determination of the transaction price\n\nThe Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances in determining whether a contract includes variable consideration  (i.e.,  consideration  that  may  vary  or  depends upon the occurrence or non-occurrence of a future event). In estimating variable consideration, the Group uses the method that be/t\\_t.ligaer predicts the consideration to which\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

The Group includes the estimated variable consideration in the transaction price only to the extent that it is highly probable that a signi/fi.ligacant reversal in the cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the unce/r\\_t.ligaainty is resolved.\n\n## Principal versus agent assessment\n\nThe Group considers that it is an agent in some contracts in which it is not primarily responsible for ful/fi.ligalling the contract and therefore it does not control goods or services before they are being transferred to customers. For example, the Group acts as an agent in some contracts for electricity/ gas network connection services and other related activities depending on local legal and regulatory framework.\n\n## Allocation of transaction price\n\nFor contracts that have more than one pe/r\\_f.ligaormance obligation (e.g., 'bundled' sale contracts), the Group generally allocates the transaction price to each pe/r\\_f.ligaormance obligation in propo/r\\_t.ligaion to its stand-alone selling price. The Group determines stand-alone selling prices considering all  information  and  using  observable  prices  when  they are available in the market or, if not, using an estimation method that maximizes the use of observable inputs and applying it consistently to similar arrangements.\n\nIf the Group evaluates that a contract includes an option for additional goods or services (e.g., customer loyalty programs or renewal options) that represents a material right, it allocates the transaction price to this option since the option gives rise to an additional pe/r\\_f.ligaormance obligation.\n\n## Contract costs\n\nThe Group assesses recoverability of the incremental costs of obtaining a contract either on a contract-by-contract basis, or for a group of contracts if those costs are associated with the group of contracts.\n\nThe Group suppo/r\\_t.ligas the recoverability of such costs on the basis of its experience with other similar transactions and evaluating  various  factors,  including  potential  renewals, amendments and follow-on contracts with the same customer.\n\nThe Group amo/r\\_t.ligaizes such costs over the average customer term. In order to determine this expected period of bene/fi.ligat from the contract, the Group considers its past experience (e.g., 'churn rate'), the predictive evidence from similar contracts and available information about the market.\n\n## Classi/fi.ligacation and measurement of /fi.liganancial assets\n\nAt initial recognition, in order to classify /fi.liganancial assets as /fi.liganancial assets at amo/r\\_t.ligaized cost, at fair value through other comprehensive income and at fair value through pro/fi.ligat or loss, management assesses both the contractual cash-/fl.ligaow characteristics of the instrument and the business model for managing /fi.liganancial assets in order to generate cash /fl.ligaows.\n\nFor the purpose of evaluating the contractual cash-/fl.ligaow characteristics of the instrument, management pe/r\\_f.ligaorms the SPPI test at an instrument level, in order to determine if it gives rise to cash /fl.ligaows that are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding, pe/r\\_f.ligaorming speci/fi.ligac assessment on the contractual clauses of the /fi.liganancial instruments, as well as quantitative analysis, if required.\n\nThe business model determines whether cash /fl.ligaows will result from collecting contractual cash /fl.ligaows, selling the /fi.liganancial assets, or both.\n\nFor more details, please see note 44 'Financial instruments by category'.\n\n## Hedge accounting\n\nHedge  accounting  is  applied  to  derivatives  in  order  to re/fl.ligaect into the /fi.liganancial statements the e/ff.ligaect of risk management strategies.\n\nAccordingly, at the inception of the transaction the Group documents the hedge relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategy. The Group also assesses, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, whether hedging instruments are highly e/ff.ligaective in o/ff.ligase/t\\_t.ligaing changes in the fair values or cash /fl.ligaows of hedged items.\n\nOn the basis of management's judgment, the e/ff.ligaectiveness assessment based on the existence of an economic relationship between the hedging instruments and the hedged items, the dominance of credit risk in the changes in fair value and the hedge ratio, as well as the measurement of the ine/ff.ligaectiveness, is evaluated through a qualitative assessment or a quantitative computation, depending on the speci/fi.ligac facts and circumstances and on the characteristics of the hedged items and the hedging instruments.\n\nFor cash /fl.ligaow hedges of forecast transactions designated as hedged items, management assesses and documents that they are highly probable and present an exposure to changes in cash /fl.ligaows that a/ff.ligaect pro/fi.ligat or loss.\n\nFu/r\\_t.ligahermore, during the year, the Group carefully monitored the possible e/ff.ligaects of the unce/r\\_t.ligaainties linked to the COVID-19 pandemic on its hedging relationships.\n\nFor additional details on the key assumptions about e/ff.ligaectiveness assessment and ine/ff.ligaectiveness measurement, please refer to note 47.1 'Derivatives and hedge accounting'.",

Joint control is the sharing of control of an arrangement, whereby decisions about the relevant activities require unanimous consent of the pa/r\\_t.ligaies sharing control.\n\nThe Group's investments in associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.\n\nUnder the equity method, these investments are initially recognized at cost and any goodwill arising from the di/ff.ligaerence between the cost of the investment and the Group's share of the net fair value of the investee's identi/fi.ligaable assets and liabilities at the acquisition date is included in the carrying amount of the investment. Goodwill is not individually tested for impairment.\n\nAfter the acquisition date, their carrying amount is adjusted to recognize changes in the Group's share of pro/fi.ligat or loss of the associate or joint venture in Group pro/fi.ligat or loss. Adjustments to the carrying amount may also be necessary following changes in the Group's share in the associate or joint venture as a result of changes in the other comprehensive income of the investee. The Group's share\n\nof these changes is recognized in the Group's other comprehensive income.\n\nDistributions received from joint venture and associates reduce the carrying amount of the investments.\n\nGains and losses resulting from transactions between the Group and the associates or joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the interest in the associate or joint venture. The /fi.liganancial statements of the associates or joint ventures are prepared for the same repo/r\\_t.ligaing period as the Group. When necessary, adjustments are made to bring the accounting policies in line with those of the Group.\n\nAfter application of the equity method, the Group determines whether it is necessary to recognize an impairment loss on its investment in an associate or joint venture. If there is objective evidence of a loss of value, the assets undergo impairment testing pursuant to IAS 36. For more information on impairment, please see the section 'Impairment of non-/fi.liganancial assets' in note 2.1 'Use of estimates and management judgment'.\n\nIf the investment ceases to be an associate or a joint venture, the Group recognizes any retained investment at its fair value, through pro/fi.ligat or loss. Any amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income in respect of the former associate or joint venture are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities.\n\nIf the ownership interest in an associate or a joint venture is reduced, but the Group continues to exercise a signi/fi.ligacant in/fl.ligauence or joint control, the Group continues to apply the equity method and the share of the gain or loss that had previously  been  recognized  in  other  comprehensive  income relating to that reduction is accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities.\n\nWhen a po/r\\_t.ligaion of an investment in an associate or joint venture meets the criteria to be classi/fi.ligaed as held for sale, any retained po/r\\_t.ligaion of an investment in the associate or joint venture that has not been classi/fi.ligaed as held for sale is accounted for using the equity method until disposal of the po/r\\_t.ligaion classi/fi.ligaed as held for sale takes place.\n\nJoint operations are joint arrangements whereby the Group, which holds joint control, has rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities relating to the arrangement. For each joint operation, the Group recognized assets, liabilities, costs and revenue on the basis of the provisions of the arrangement rather than the interest held.\n\nWhere there is an increase in the interest in a joint arrangement that meets the de/fi.liganition of a business:\n\n- \u203a if the Group acquires control, and had rights over the assets and obligations for the liabilities of the joint arrangement immediately before the acquisition date, then the transaction represents a business combination achieved",

Consequently, the Group applies the requirements for a business combination achieved in stages, including the remeasurement of the interest it held previously in the joint operation at its fair value at the acquisition date;\n\n- \u203a if the Group obtains joint control (i.e., it already had an interest in a joint operation without holding joint control), the interest previously held in the joint operation shall not be remeasured.\n\nFor more information on the Group's investments in associates and joint ventures, please see note 24 'Equity-accounted investments'.\n\n## Translation of foreign currency items\n\nTransactions in currencies other than the functional currency are initially recognized at the spot exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction.\n\nMonetary assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency other than the functional currency are subsequently translated using the closing exchange rate (i.e. the spot exchange rate prevailing at the repo/r\\_t.ligaing date).\n\nNon-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency that are recognized at historical cost are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currency measured at fair value are translated using the exchange rate at the date the fair value was determined.\n\nAny exchange di/ff.ligaerences are recognized through pro/fi.ligat or loss.\n\nIn determining the spot exchange rate to use on initial recognition of the related asset, expense or income (or pa/r\\_t.liga of it) on the derecognition of a non-monetary asset or non-monetary liability relating to advance consideration in foreign currency paid or received, the date of the transaction is the date on which the Group initially recognizes the non-monetary asset or non-monetary liability associated with the advance consideration.\n\nIf there are multiple advance payments or receipts, the Group determines the transaction date for each payment or receipt of advance consideration.\n\n## Translation of /fi.liganancial statements denominated in a foreign currency\n\nFor the purposes of the consolidated /fi.liganancial statements, all revenue, expenses, assets and liabilities are stated in euro, which is the presentation currency of the Parent, Enel SpA.\n\nIn order to prepare the consolidated /fi.liganancial statements,\n\nthe /fi.liganancial statements of consolidated companies with functional currencies other than the presentation currency used in the consolidated /fi.liganancial statements are translated into euros by applying the closing exchange rate to the assets and liabilities, including goodwill and consolidation adjustments, and the average exchange rate for the period to the income statement items on the condition it approximates the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the respective transactions.\n\nAny resulting exchange gains or losses are recognized as a separate component of equity in a special reserve. The gains and losses are recognized propo/r\\_t.ligaionately in the income statement on the disposal (pa/r\\_t.ligaial or total) of the subsidiary.\n\nWhen the functional currency of a consolidated company is the currency of a hyperin/fl.ligaationary economy, the Group restates the /fi.liganancial statements in accordance with IAS 29 before applying the speci/fi.ligac conversion method set out below. In order to consider the impact of hyperin/fl.ligaation on the local currency exchange rate, the /fi.liganancial position and performance (i.e. assets, liabilities, equity items, revenue and expenses) of a company whose functional currency is the currency  of  a  hyperin/fl.ligaationary  economy  are  translated into  the  Group's  presentation  currency  (the  euro)  using the exchange rate prevailing at the repo/r\\_t.ligaing date, except for comparative amounts presented in the previous year's /fi.liganancial  statements  which  are  not  adjusted  for  subsequent changes in the price level or subsequent changes in exchange rates.\n\n## Business combinations\n\nBusiness combinations initiated before January 1, 2010 and completed within that /fi.liganancial year are recognized on the basis of IFRS 3 (2004).\n\nSuch business combinations were recognized using the purchase method, where the purchase cost is equal to the fair value at the date of the exchange of the assets acquired and the liabilities incurred or assumed, plus costs directly a/t\\_t.ligaributable to the acquisition. This cost was allocated by recognizing the assets, liabilities and identi/fi.ligaable contingent liabilities of the acquired company at their fair values. Any positive di/ff.ligaerence between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the net assets acquired a/t\\_t.ligaributable to the owners of the Parent was recognized as goodwill. If the di/ff.ligaerence is negative, it is recognized through pro/fi.ligat or loss.\n\nThe carrying amount of non-controlling interests was determined in propo/r\\_t.ligaion to the interest held by non-controlling shareholders in the net assets.

        "page_content": "combinations achieved in stages, at the date of acquisition any adjustment to the fair value of the net assets acquired previously was recognized in equity; the amount of goodwill was determined for each transaction separately based on the fair values of the acquiree's net assets at the date of each exchange transaction.\n\nBusiness combinations carried out as from January 1, 2010 are recognized on the basis of IFRS 3 (2008), which is referred to as IFRS 3 (Revised) hereafter.\n\nMore speci/fi.ligacally, business combinations are recognized using the acquisition method, where the purchase cost (the consideration transferred) is equal to the fair value at the purchase date of the assets acquired and the liabilities incurred or assumed, as well as any equity instruments issued by the purchaser. The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement.\n\nCosts directly a/t\\_t.ligaributable to the acquisition are recognized through pro/fi.ligat or loss.\n\nThe consideration transferred is allocated by recognizing the assets, liabilities and identi/fi.ligaable contingent liabilities of the acquired company at their fair values as at the acquisition date. The excess of the consideration transferred, measured at fair value as at the acquisition date, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree plus the fair value of any equity interest in the acquiree previously held by the Group (in a business combination achieved in stages) over the net amount of the identi/fi.ligaable assets acquired and the liabilities incurred or assumed measured at fair value is recognized as goodwill. If the di/ff.ligaerence is negative, the Group veri/fi.ligaes whether it has correctly identi/fi.ligaed all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and reviews the procedures used to determine the amounts to recognize at the acquisition date. If after this assessment the fair value of the net assets acquired still exceeds the total consideration transferred, this excess represents the pro/fi.ligat on a bargain purchase and is recognized through pro/fi.ligat or loss. The carrying amount of non-controlling interests is determined either in propo/r\\_t.ligaion to the interest held by non-controlling shareholders in the net identi/fi.ligaable assets of the acquiree or at their fair value as at the acquisition date. In the case of business combinations achieved in stages, at the date of acquisition of control the previously held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value and any positive or negative di/ff.ligaerence is recognized in pro/fi.ligat\n\nor loss.\n\nAny contingent consideration is recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration classi/fi.ligaed as an asset or a liability, or as a /fi.liganancial instrument within the scope of IFRS 9, are recognized in pro/fi.ligat or loss. If the contingent consi-\n\nderation is not within the scope of IFRS 9, it is measured in accordance with the appropriate IFRS-EU. Contingent consideration that is classi/fi.ligaed as equity is not re-measured, and its subsequent se/t\\_t.ligalement is accounted for within equity.\n\nIf the fair values of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities can only be calculated on a provisional basis, the business combination is recognized using such provisional values. Any adjustments resulting from the completion of the measurement process are recognized within 12 months of the date of acquisition, restating comparative /fi.ligagures.\n\n## Fair value measurement\n\nFor all fair value measurements and disclosures of fair value, that are either required or permi/t\\_t.ligaed by IFRS, the Group applies IFRS 13.\n\nFair value is de/fi.liganed as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction, between market pa/r\\_t.ligaicipants, at the measurement date (i.e. an exit price).\n\nThe fair value measurement assumes that the transaction to sell an asset or transfer a liability takes place in the principal market, i.e. the market with the greatest volume and level of activity for the asset or liability. In the absence of a principal market, it is assumed that the transaction takes place in the most advantageous market to which the Group has access, i.e. the market that maximizes the amount that would be received to sell the asset or minimizes the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability.\n\nThe fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market pa/r\\_t.ligaicipants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market pa/r\\_t.ligaicipants act in their economic best interest. Market pa/r\\_t.ligaicipants are independent, knowledgeable sellers and buyers who are able to enter into a transaction for the asset or the liability and who are motivated but not forced or otherwise compelled to do so.\n\nWhen measuring fair value, the Group takes into account the characteristics of the asset or liability, in pa/r\\_t.ligaicular:\n\n- \u203a for a non-/fi.liganancial asset, a fair value measurement takes into account a market pa/r\\_t.ligaicipant's ability to generate economic bene/fi.ligats by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market pa/r\\_t.ligaicipant that would use the asset in its highest and best use;\n- \u203a for liabilities and own equity instruments, the fair value re/fl.ligaects the e/ff.ligaect of non-pe/r\\_f.ligaormance risk, i.e. the risk that an entity will not ful/fi.ligall an obligation, including among others the credit risk of the Group itself;\n- \u203a in the case of groups of /fi.liganancial assets and /fi.liganancial liabilities with o/ff.ligase/t\\_t.ligaing positions in market risk or credit risk, managed on the basis of an entity's net exposure to such risks, it is permi/t\\_t.ligaed to measure fair value on a net basis.",

Such cost includes expenses directly a/t\\_t.ligaributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for its intended use.\n\nThe cost is also increased by the present value of the estimate of the costs of decommissioning and restoring the site on which the asset is located where there is a legal or constructive obligation to do so. The corresponding liability is recognized under provisions for risks and charges. The accounting treatment of changes in the estimate of these costs, the passage of time and the discount rate is discussed under 'Provisions for risks and charges'.\n\nPrope/r\\_t.ligay, plant and equipment transferred from customers to\n\nconnect them to the electricity distribution network and/or to provide them with other related services is initially recognized at its fair value at the date on which control is obtained. Borrowing costs that are directly a/t\\_t.ligaributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset, i.e. an asset that takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale, are capitalized as pa/r\\_t.liga of the cost of the assets themselves. Borrowing costs associated with the purchase/construction of assets that do not meet such requirement are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. Ce/r\\_t.ligaain assets that were revalued at the IFRS-EU transition date or in previous periods are recognized at their fair value, which is considered to be their deemed cost at the revaluation date. Where individual items of major components of prope/r\\_t.ligay, plant and equipment have di/ff.ligaerent useful lives, the components are recognized and depreciated separately. Subsequent costs are recognized as an increase in the carrying amount of the asset when it is probable that future economic bene/fi.ligats associated with the cost incurred to replace a pa/r\\_t.liga of the asset will /fl.ligaow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other costs are\n\nrecognized in pro/fi.ligat or loss as incurred.\n\nThe cost of replacing pa/r\\_t.liga or all of an asset is recognized as an increase in the carrying amount of the asset and is depreciated over its useful life; the carrying amount of the replaced unit is derecognized through pro/fi.ligat or loss.\n\nPrope/r\\_t.ligay, plant and equipment, net of its residual value, is depreciated on a straight-line basis over its estimated use-\n\nful life, which is reviewed annually. Any changes in depreciation criteria shall be applied prospectively.

Any gain or loss, recognized through pro/fi.ligat or loss, is calculated as the di/ff.ligaerence between the net disposal proceeds, determined in accordance with the transaction price requirements of IFRS 15, and the carrying amount of the derecognized assets.\n\n## Assets to be relinquished free of charge\n\nThe Group's plants include assets to be relinquished free of charge at the end of the concessions. These mainly regard major water diversion works and the public lands used for the operation of the thermal power plants.\n\nWithin the Italian regulatory framework in force until 2011, if the concessions are not renewed, at those dates all intake and governing works, penstocks, out/fl.ligaow channels and other assets on public lands were to be relinquished free of charge to the State in good operating condition. Accordingly, depreciation on assets to be relinquished was calculated over the sho/r\\_t.ligaer of the term of the concession and the remaining useful life of the assets.\n\nIn the wake of the legislative changes introduced with Law 134 of August 7, 2012, the assets previously classi/fi.ligaed as assets 'to be relinquished free of charge' connected with the  hydroelectric  water  diversion  concessions  are  now considered in the same manner as other categories of 'prope/r\\_t.ligay, plant and equipment' and are therefore depreciated over the useful life of the asset (where this exceeds the term of the concession), as discussed in the section above on the 'Depreciable amount of ce/r\\_t.ligaain elements of Italian hydroelectric plants subsequent to enactment of Law 134/2012', which you are invited to consult for more details.\n\nIn accordance with Spanish laws 29/1985 and 46/1999, hydroelectric power stations in Spanish territory operate under administrative concessions at the end of which the plants will be returned to the government in good operating condition. The terms of the concessions extend up to 2067.\n\nA number of generation companies that operate in Argentina, Brazil and Mexico hold administrative concessions with similar conditions to those applied under the Spanish concession system. These concessions will expire in 2088.\n\n## Infrastructure serving a concession not within the scope of 'IFRIC 12 - Service concession arrangements'\n\nAs regards the distribution of electricity, the Group is a concession holder in Italy for this service. The concession, granted by the Ministry for Economic Development, was issued free of charge and terminates on December 31, 2030. If the concession is not renewed upon expiry, the grantor is\n\nrequired to pay an indemnity. The amount of the indemnity will be determined by agreement of the pa/r\\_t.ligaies using appropriate valuation methods, based on both the carrying amount of the assets themselves and their pro/fi.ligatability.\n\nIn determining the indemnity, such pro/fi.ligatability will be represented by the present value of future cash /fl.ligaows. The infrastructure serving the concession is owned and available to the concession holder. It is recognized under 'Prope/r\\_t.ligay, plant and equipment' and is depreciated over the useful lives of the assets.\n\nEnel also operates under administrative concessions for the distribution of electricity in other countries (including Spain and Romania). These concessions give the right to build and operate distribution networks for an inde/fi.liganite period of time.\n\n## Infrastructure within the scope of 'IFRIC 12 Service concession arrangements'\n\nUnder a 'public-to-private' service concession arrangement within the scope of 'IFRIC 12 - Service concession arrangements' the operator acts as a service provider and, in accordance with the terms speci/fi.ligaed in the contract, it constructs/upgrades infrastructure used to provide a public service and/or operates and maintains that infrastructure for the years of the concession.\n\nThe Group, as operator, does not account for the infrastructure within the scope of IFRIC 12 as prope/r\\_t.ligay, plant and equipment and it recognizes and measures revenue in accordance with IFRS 15 for the services it pe/r\\_f.ligaorms. In pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, when the Group provides construction or upgrade services, depending on the characteristics of the service concession arrangement, it recognizes:\n\n- \u203a a /fi.liganancial asset, if the Group has an unconditional contractual right to receive cash or another /fi.liganancial asset from the grantor (or from a third pa/r\\_t.ligay at the direction of the grantor), that is the grantor has li/t\\_t.ligale discretion to avoid payment. In this case, the grantor contractually guarantees to pay to the operator speci/fi.ligaed or determinable amounts or the sho/r\\_t.ligafall between the amounts received from the users of the public service and speci/fi.ligaed or determinable amounts (de/fi.liganed by the contract), and such payments are not dependent on the usage of the infrastructure; and/or\n- \u203a an intangible asset, if the Group receives the right (a license) to charge users of the public service provided. In such a case, the operator does not have an unconditional right to receive cash because the amounts are contingent on the extent that the public uses the service.\n\nIf the Group (as operator) has a contractual right to receive an intangible asset (a right to charge users of public service), borrowing costs are capitalized using the criteria speci/fi.ligaed in the paragraph 'Prope/r\\_t.ligay, plant and equipment'.",

At inception of a contract, the Group assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease.\n\nFor contracts entered into or changed on or after January 1, 2019, the Group has applied the de/fi.liganition of a lease under IFRS 16, that is met if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identi/fi.ligaed asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.\n\nConversely, for contracts entered into before January 1, 2019, the Group determined whether the arrangement was or contained a lease under IFRIC 4.\n\n## Group as a lessee\n\nAt commencement or on modi/fi.ligacation of a contract that contains a lease component and one or more additional lease or non-lease components, the Group allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of its relative stand-alone price.\n\nThe Group recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date the underlying asset is available for use).\n\nThe right-of-use asset represents a lessee's right to use an underlying asset for the lease term; it is initially measured at cost, which includes the initial amount of lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset and to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located. Right-of-use  assets  are  subsequently  depreciated  on  a straight-line basis over the sho/r\\_t.ligaer of the lease term and the estimated useful lives of the right-of-use assets, as follows:\n\n|                                           | Average residual life (years)   |\n|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Buildings                                 | 7                               |\n| Ground rights of renewable energy  plants |                                 |\n|                                           | 30                              |\n| Vehicles and other means of               |                                 |\n| transpo/r\\_t.liga                          | 5                               |\n\nIf the lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the Group at the end of the lease term or if the cost of the right-of-use asset re/fl.ligaects the fact that the Group will exercise a purchase option, depreciation is calculated using the estimated useful life of the underlying asset.\n\nIn addition, the right-of-use assets are subject to impairment and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities.\n\nThe lease liability is initially measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses the lessee's incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date when the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable.\n\nVariable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognized as expenses in the period in which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs.\n\nAfter the commencement date, the lease liability is measu-\n\nred at amo/r\\_t.ligaized cost using the e/ff.ligaective interest method and is remeasured upon the occurrence of ce/r\\_t.ligaain events. The  Group  applies  the  sho/r\\_t.liga-term  lease  recognition exemption to its lease contracts that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the commencement date. It also applies the low-value assets recognition exemption to lease contracts for which the underlying asset is of low-value whose amount is estimated not material. For example, the Group has leases of ce/r\\_t.ligaain o/ffi.ligace equipment (i.e., personal computers, printing and photocopying machines) that are considered of low-value. Lease payments on sho/r\\_t.liga-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nThe Group presents right-of-use assets that do not meet the de/fi.liganition of investment prope/r\\_t.ligay in 'Prope/r\\_t.ligay, plant and equipment' and lease liabilities in 'Borrowings'.\n\nConsistent with the requirement of the standard, the Group presents separately the interest expense on lease liabilities under 'Other /fi.liganancial expense' and the depreciation charge on the right-of-use assets under 'Depreciation, amo/r\\_t.ligaization and impairment losses'.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

        "page_content": "## Group as a lessor\n\nWhen the Group acts as a lessor, it determines at the lease inception date whether each lease is a /fi.liganance lease or an operating lease.\n\nLeases in which the Group essentially transfers all the risks and rewards associated with ownership of the underlying asset are classi/fi.ligaed as /fi.liganance leases; otherwise, they are classi/fi.ligaed as operating leases. To make this assessment, the Group considers the indicators provided by IFRS 16. If a contract contains lease and non-lease components, the Group allocates the consideration in the contract applying IFRS 15.\n\nThe Group accounts for rental income arising from operating leases on a straight-line basis over the lease terms and it recognizes it as other revenue.\n\n## Investment prope/r\\_t.ligay\n\nInvestment prope/r\\_t.ligay consists of the Group's real estate held\n\nto earn rentals and/or for capital appreciation rather than for use in the production or supply of goods and services. Investment prope/r\\_t.ligay is measured at acquisition cost less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.\n\nInvestment prope/r\\_t.ligay, excluding land, is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the useful lives of the related assets. Impairment losses are determined on the basis of the criteria following described.\n\nThe breakdown of the fair value of investment prope/r\\_t.ligay is detailed in note 48 'Assets and liabilities measured at fair value'.\n\nInvestment prope/r\\_t.ligay is derecognized either when it has been transferred (i.e., at the date the recipient obtains control) or when it is permanently withdrawn from use and no future economic bene/fi.ligat is expected from its disposal. Any gain or loss, recognized through pro/fi.ligat or loss, is calculated as the di/ff.ligaerence between the net disposal proceeds, determined in accordance with the transaction price requirements of IFRS 15, and the carrying amount of the derecognized assets.\n\nTransfers are made to (or from) investment prope/r\\_t.ligay only when there is a change in use.\n\n## Intangible assets\n\nIntangible  assets  are  identi/fi.ligaable  assets  without  physical substance controlled by the Group and capable of generating future economic bene/fi.ligats. They are measured at purchase or internal development cost when it is probable that the use of such assets will generate future economic bene/fi.ligats and the related cost can be reliably determined.\n\nThe cost includes any directly a/t\\_t.ligaributable expenses necessary to make the assets ready for their intended use. Development  expenditure  is  recognized  as  an  intangible\n\nasset only when Group can demonstrate the technical feasibility of completing the asset, its intention and ability to complete development and to use or sell the asset and the availability of resources to complete the asset.\n\nResearch costs are recognized as expenses.\n\nIntangible assets with a /fi.liganite useful life are recognized net of accumulated amo/r\\_t.ligaization and any impairment losses.\n\nAmo/r\\_t.ligaization is calculated on a straight-line basis over the item's estimated useful life, which is reassessed at least annually; any changes in amo/r\\_t.ligaization policies are re/fl.ligaected on a prospective basis. Amo/r\\_t.ligaization commences when the asset is ready for use. Consequently, intangible assets not yet available for use are not amo/r\\_t.ligaized, but are tested for impairment at least annually.\n\nThe Group's intangible assets have a /fi.liganite useful life, with the exception of a number of concessions and goodwill.\n\nIntangible assets with inde/fi.liganite useful lives are not amo/r\\_t.ligaized, but are tested for impairment annually.\n\nThe assessment of inde/fi.liganite useful life is reviewed annually to determine whether the inde/fi.liganite useful life continues to be suppo/r\\_t.ligaable. If not, the change in useful life from inde/fi.liganite to /fi.liganite is accounted for as a change in accounting estimate. Intangible assets are derecognized either at the time of their disposal (at the date when the recipient obtains control) or when no future economic bene/fi.ligat is expected from their use or disposal. Any gain or loss, recognized through pro/fi.ligat or loss, is calculated as the di/ff.ligaerence between the net consideration received in the disposal, determined in accordance with the provisions of IFRS 15 concerning the transaction price, and the carrying amount of the derecognized assets. The estimated useful life of the main intangible assets, distinguishing between internally generated and acquired as-\n\nsets, is as follows:\n\n| - internally generated                                      | 2-26 years   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|\n| - acquired                                                  | 3-26 years   |\n| Industrial patents and intellectual prope/r\\_t.ligay rights: |              |\n| - internally generated                                      | 3-10 years   |\n| - acquired                                                  | 2-50 years   |\n| Concessions, licenses, trademarks and similar rights:       |              |\n| - internally generated                                      | 20 years     |\n| - acquired                                                  | 1-40 years   |\n| Intangible assets from service concession arrangements:     |              |\n| - internally generated                                      | -            |\n| - acquired                                                  | 5 years      |\n| Other:                                                      |              |\n| - internally generated                                      | 2-28 years   |\n| - acquired                                                  | 1-28 years   |",

        "page_content": "The Group also presents costs to obtain a contract with a customer capitalized in accordance with IFRS 15 as intangible assets.\n\nThe Group recognized such costs as an asset only if:\n\n- \u203a the costs are incremental, that is they are directly a/t\\_t.ligaributable to an identi/fi.ligaed contract and the Group would not have incurred them if the contract had not been obtained;\n- \u203a the Group expects to recover them, through reimbursements (direct recoverability) or the margin (indirect recoverability).\n\nIn pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, the Group generally capitalizes trade fees and commissions paid to agents for such contracts if the capitalization criteria are met.\n\nCapitalized customer contract costs are amo/r\\_t.ligaized on a systematic basis, consistent with the pa/t\\_t.ligaern of the transfer of the goods or services to which they relate, and undergo impairment testing to identify any impairment losses to the extent that the carrying amount of the asset recognized exceeds the recoverable amount.\n\nThe Group amo/r\\_t.ligaizes the capitalized customer contract costs on a straight-line basis over the expected period of bene/fi.ligat from the contract (i.e., the average term of the customer relationship); any changes in amo/r\\_t.ligaization policies are re/fl.ligaected on a prospective basis.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill represents the future economic bene/fi.ligats arising from other assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identi/fi.ligaed and separately recognized. For fu/r\\_t.ligaher details, please see the section of the accounting policies 'Business combinations'.\n\nGoodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries is recognized separately. After initial recognition, goodwill is not amo/r\\_t.ligaized, but is tested for impairment at least annually as pa/r\\_t.liga of the CGU to which it pe/r\\_t.ligaains.\n\nFor the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated, from the acquisition date, to each CGU that is expected to bene/fi.ligat from the synergies of the combination.\n\nGoodwill relating to equity investments in associates and joint venture is included in their carrying amount.\n\n## Impairment of non-/fi.liganancial assets\n\nAt each repo/r\\_t.ligaing date, prope/r\\_t.ligay, plant and equipment, investment prope/r\\_t.ligay, intangible assets, right-of-use assets, goodwill and equity investments in associates/joint ventures are reviewed to determine whether there is evidence of impairment.\n\nCGUs to which goodwill, intangible assets with an inde/fi.liganite useful life and intangible assets not yet available for use are allocated are tested for recoverability annually or more frequently if there is evidence suggesting that the assets can be impaired.\n\nIf such evidence exists, the recoverable amount of any involved asset is estimated on the basis of the use of the asset and its future disposal, in accordance with the Group's most recent Business Plan. For the estimate of the recoverable amount, please see note 2.1 'Use of estimates and management judgment'.\n\nThe recoverable amount is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset do not generate cash in/fl.ligaows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets and therefore it is determined for the CGU to which the asset belongs.\n\nIf the carrying amount of an asset or of a CGU to which it is allocated is greater than its recoverable amount, an impairment loss is recognized in pro/fi.ligat or loss and presented under 'Depreciation, amo/r\\_t.ligaization and other impairment losses'.\n\nImpairment losses of CGUs are /fi.ligarstly charged against the carrying amount of any goodwill a/t\\_t.ligaributed to it and then against the other assets, in propo/r\\_t.ligaion to their carrying amount.\n\nIf the reasons for a previously recognized impairment loss no longer apply, the carrying amount of the asset is restored through pro/fi.ligat or loss, under 'Depreciation, amo/r\\_t.ligaization and other impairment losses', in an amount that shall not exceed the carrying amount that the asset would have had if the impairment loss had not been recognized. The original amount of goodwill is not restored even if in subsequent years the reasons for the impairment no longer apply.\n\nIf ce/r\\_t.ligaain speci/fi.ligac identi/fi.ligaed assets owned by the Group are impacted by adverse economic or operating conditions that undermine their capacity to contribute to the generation of cash /fl.ligaows, they can be isolated from the rest of the assets of the CGU, undergo separate analysis of their recoverability and be impaired where necessary.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realizable  value  except  for  inventories  involved  in  trading activities, which are measured at fair value with recognition through pro/fi.ligat or loss. Cost is determined on the basis of average weighted cost, which includes related ancillary charges. Net estimated realizable value is the estimated normal selling price net of estimated costs to sell or, where applicable, replacement cost.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

Within the la/t\\_t.ligaer, CO 2 emissions allowances are allocated to sub-po/r\\_t.ligafolios on the basis of the compliance year to which they have been assigned.\n\nInventories also include nuclear fuel stocks, use of which is determined on the basis of the electricity generated.\n\nMaterials and other consumables (including energy commodities) held for use in production are not wri/t\\_t.ligaen down if it is expected that the /fi.liganal product in which they will be incorporated will be sold at a price su/ffi.ligacient to enable recovery of the cost incurred.\n\n## Financial instruments\n\nFinancial instruments are any contract that gives rise to a /fi.liganancial asset of one entity and a /fi.liganancial liability or equity instrument of another entity; they are recognized and measured in accordance with IAS 32 and IFRS 9.\n\nA /fi.liganancial asset or liability is recognized in the consolidated /fi.liganancial statements when, and only when, the Group becomes pa/r\\_t.ligay to the contractual provision of the instrument (i.e. the trade date).\n\nTrade receivables arising from contracts with customers, in the scope of IFRS 15, are initially measured at their transaction price (as de/fi.liganed in IFRS 15) if such receivables do not contain a signi/fi.ligacant /fi.liganancing component or when the Group applies the practical expedient allowed by IFRS 15.\n\nConversely, the Group initially measures /fi.liganancial assets other than the above-mentioned receivables at their fair value plus, in the case of a /fi.liganancial asset not measured at fair value through pro/fi.ligat or loss, transaction costs.\n\nFinancial assets are classi/fi.ligaed, at initial recognition, as /fi.liganancial assets at amo/r\\_t.ligaized cost, at fair value through other comprehensive income and at fair value through pro/fi.ligat or loss, on the basis of both the Group's business model and the  contractual  cash-/fl.ligaow  characteristics  of  the  instrument.\n\nFor this purpose, the assessment to determine whether the instrument gives rise to cash /fl.ligaows that are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding is referred to as the SPPI test and is pe/r\\_f.ligaormed at an instrument level.\n\nThe Group's business model for managing /fi.liganancial assets\n\nrefers to how it manages its /fi.liganancial assets in order to generate cash /fl.ligaows. The business model determines whether cash /fl.ligaows will result from collecting contractual cash /fl.ligaows, selling the /fi.liganancial assets, or both.\n\nFor purposes of subsequent measurement, /fi.liganancial assets are classi/fi.ligaed in four categories:\n\n- \u203a /fi.liganancial assets measured at amo/r\\_t.ligaized cost (debt instruments);\n- \u203a /fi.liganancial assets at fair value through OCI with reclassi/fi.ligacation  of cumulative gains and losses (debt instruments);\n- \u203a /fi.liganancial assets designated at fair value through OCI with no reclassi/fi.ligacation of cumulative gains and losses upon derecognition (equity instruments); and\n- \u203a /fi.liganancial assets at fair value through pro/fi.ligat or loss.\n\n## Financial assets measured at amo/r\\_t.ligaized cost\n\nThis category mainly includes trade receivables, other /fi.liganancial assets and loan assets.\n\nFinancial assets at amo/r\\_t.ligaized cost are held within a business model whose objective is to hold /fi.liganancial assets in order to collect contractual cash /fl.ligaows and whose contractual terms give rise, on speci/fi.ligaed dates, to cash /fl.ligaows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n\nSuch assets are initially recognized at fair value, adjusted for any transaction costs, and subsequently measured at amo/r\\_t.ligaized cost using the e/ff.ligaective interest method and are subject to impairment.\n\nGains and losses are recognized in pro/fi.ligat or loss when the asset is derecognized, modi/fi.ligaed or impaired.\n\n## Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) - Debt instruments\n\nThis category mainly includes listed debt securities held by the Group reinsurance company and not classi/fi.ligaed as held for trading.\n\nFinancial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income are assets held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash /fl.ligaows and selling /fi.liganancial assets and whose contractual cash /fl.ligaows give rise, on speci/fi.ligaed dates, to cash /fl.ligaows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n\nChanges in fair value for these /fi.liganancial assets are recognized in other comprehensive income as well as loss allowances that do not reduce the carrying amount of the /fi.liganancial assets.\n\nWhen a /fi.liganancial asset is derecognized (e.g. at the time of sale), the cumulative gains and losses previously recognized in equity (except impairment and foreign exchange gains and losses to be recognized in pro/fi.ligat or loss) are reversed to pro/fi.ligat or loss.",

The Group may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity.\n\nEquity instruments designated at fair value through OCI are not subject to impairment testing.\n\nDividends on such investments are recognized in pro/fi.ligat or loss unless they clearly represents a recovery of a pa/r\\_t.liga of the cost of the investment.\n\n## Financial assets at fair value through pro/fi.ligat or loss\n\nThis category mainly includes: securities, equity investments in other companies, /fi.liganancial investments in fund held for trading and /fi.liganancial assets designated as at fair value through pro/fi.ligat or loss at initial recognition.\n\nFinancial assets at fair value through pro/fi.ligat or loss are:\n\n- \u203a /fi.liganancial assets with cash /fl.ligaows that are not solely payments of principal and interest, irrespective of the business model;\n- \u203a /fi.liganancial assets held for trading because acquired or incurred principally for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in sho/r\\_t.liga term;\n- \u203a debt  instruments  designated  upon  initial  recognition, under the option allowed by IFRS 9 (fair value option), if doing so eliminates, or signi/fi.ligacantly reduces, an accounting mismatch;\n- \u203a derivatives, including separated embedded derivatives, held for trading or not designated as e/ff.ligaective hedging instruments.\n\nSuch /fi.liganancial assets are initially recognized at fair value with subsequent gains and losses from changes in their fair value recognized through pro/fi.ligat or loss.\n\nThis category also includes listed equity investments which the Group had not irrevocably elected to classify at fair value through OCI. Dividends on listed equity investments are also recognized as other income in the income statement when the right of payment has been established.\n\nFinancial assets that qualify as contingent consideration are also measured at fair value through pro/fi.ligat or loss.\n\n## Impairment of /fi.liganancial assets\n\nAt each repo/r\\_t.ligaing date, the Group recognizes a loss allowance for expected credit losses on trade receivables and  other  /fi.liganancial  assets  measured  at  amo/r\\_t.ligaized  cost,\n\ndebt  instruments  measured  at  fair  value  through  other comprehensive income, contract assets and all other assets in scope.\n\nIn compliance with IFRS 9, as from January 1, 2018, the Group adopted a new impairment model based on the determination  of  expected  credit  losses  (ECL)  using  a forward-looking approach. In essence, the model provides for:\n\n- \u203a the application of a single framework for all /fi.liganancial assets;\n- \u203a the recognition of expected credit losses on an ongoing basis and the updating of the amount of such losses at the end of each repo/r\\_t.ligaing period, re/fl.ligaecting changes in the credit risk of the /fi.liganancial instrument;\n- \u203a the measurement of expected losses on the basis of reasonable information, obtainable without undue cost, about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future conditions.\n\nFor trade receivables, contract assets and lease receivables, including  those  with  a  signi/fi.ligacant  /fi.liganancial  component, the  Group  adopts  the  simpli/fi.ligaed  approach,  determining expected credit losses over a period corresponding to the entire life of the receivable, generally equal to 12 months.\n\nFor all /fi.liganancial assets other than trade receivables, contract assets and lease receivables, the Group applies the general approach under IFRS 9, based on the assessment of a signi/fi.ligacant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. Under such approach, a loss allowance on /fi.liganancial assets is recognized at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit losses, if the credit risk on those /fi.liganancial assets has increased signi/fi.ligacantly, since initial recognition, considering all reasonable and suppo/r\\_t.ligaable information, including also forward-looking inputs.\n\nIf at the repo/r\\_t.ligaing date the credit risk on /fi.liganancial assets has not increased signi/fi.ligacantly since initial recognition, the Group measures the loss allowance for those /fi.liganancial assets at an amount equal to 12-month expected credit losses.\n\nFor /fi.liganancial assets on which a loss allowance equal to lifetime expected credit losses has been recognized in the previous repo/r\\_t.ligaing period, the Group measures the loss allowance at an amount equal to 12-month expected credit losses when the condition regarding a signi/fi.ligacant increase in credit risk is no longer met.\n\nThe Group recognizes in pro/fi.ligat or loss, as an impairment gain or loss, the amount of expected credit losses (or reversal) that is required to adjust the loss allowance at the repo/r\\_t.ligaing date to the amount that is required to be recognized in accordance with IFRS 9.\n\nThe Group applies the low credit risk exemption, avoiding\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

Financial liabilities that qualify as contingent consideration are also measured at fair value through pro/fi.ligat or loss.\n\n## Derecognition of /fi.liganancial assets and liabilities\n\nFinancial assets are derecognized whenever one of the following conditions is met:\n\n- \u203a the contractual right to receive the cash /fl.ligaows associated with the asset expires;\n- \u203a the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards associated with the asset, transferring its rights to receive the cash /fl.ligaows of the asset or assuming a contractual obligation to pay such cash /fl.ligaows to one or more bene/fi.ligaciaries under a contract that meets the requirements provided by IFRS 9 (the 'pass through test');\n- \u203a the Group has not transferred or retained substantially all the risks and rewards associated with the asset but has transferred control over the asset.\n\nFinancial liabilities are derecognized when they are extinguished, i.e. when the contractual obligation has been discharged, cancelled or expired.\n\nWhen an existing /fi.liganancial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially di/ff.ligaerent terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modi/fi.ligaed, such an exchange or modi/fi.ligacation is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The di/ff.ligaerence in the respective carrying amounts is recognized in pro/fi.ligat or loss.\n\n## Derivative /fi.liganancial instruments\n\nA derivative is a /fi.liganancial instrument or another contract:\n\n- \u203a whose value changes in response to the changes in an underlying variable such as an interest rate, commodity or security price, foreign exchange rate, a price or rate index, a credit rating or other variable;\n- \u203a that  requires  no  initial  net  investment,  or  one  that  is smaller than would be required for a contract with similar response to changes in market factors;\n- \u203a that is se/t\\_t.ligaled at a future date.\n\nDerivative instruments are classi/fi.ligaed as /fi.liganancial assets or liabilities depending on the positive or negative fair value and they are classi/fi.ligaed as 'held for trading' within 'Other business models' and measured at fair value through pro/fi.ligat or loss, except for those designated as e/ff.ligaective hedging instruments.\n\nFor more details about hedge accounting, please refer to the note 47 'Derivatives and hedge accounting'.\n\nAll derivatives held for trading are classi/fi.ligaed as current assets or liabilities.\n\nDerivatives not held for trading purposes, but measured at fair value through pro/fi.ligat or loss since they do not qualify for hedge accounting, and derivatives designated as e/ff.ligaective hedging instruments are classi/fi.ligaed as current or not cur-",

This analysis is pe/r\\_f.ligaormed when the Group becomes pa/r\\_t.ligay to the contract or when the contract is renegotiated in a manner that signi/fi.ligacantly changes the original associated cash /fl.ligaows.\n\nEmbedded derivatives are separated from the host contract and accounted for as derivatives when:\n\n- \u203a the host contract is not a /fi.liganancial instrument measured at fair value through pro/fi.ligat or loss;\n- \u203a the economic risks and characteristics of the embedded derivative are not closely related to those of the host contract;\n- \u203a a separate contract with the same terms as the embedded derivative would meet the de/fi.liganition of a derivative.\n\nEmbedded derivatives that are separated from the host contract are recognized in the consolidated /fi.liganancial statements at fair value with changes recognized in pro/fi.ligat or loss (except when the embedded derivative is pa/r\\_t.liga of a designated hedging relationship).\n\n## Contracts to buy or sell non-/fi.liganancial items\n\nIn general, contracts to buy or sell non-/fi.liganancial items that are entered into and continue to be held for receipt or delivery in accordance with the Group's normal expected purchase, sale or usage requirements are out of the scope of IFRS 9 and then recognized as executory contracts, according to the 'own use exemption'.\n\nA contract to buy or sell non-/fi.liganancial items is classi/fi.ligaed as\n\n'normal purchase or sale' if it is entered into:\n\n- \u203a for the purpose of the physical se/t\\_t.ligalement;\n- \u203a in accordance with the entity's expected purchase, sale or usage requirements.\n\nMoreover, contracts to buy or sell non-/fi.liganancial items with physical se/t\\_t.ligalement (for example, /fi.ligaxed-price forward contracts on energy commodities) do not qualify for the own use exemption and are recognized as derivatives measured at fair value through pro/fi.ligat or loss only if:\n\n- \u203a they can be se/t\\_t.ligaled net in cash; and\n- \u203a they are not entered into in accordance with the Group's expected purchase, sale or usage requirements.\n\nConsequently, sta/r\\_t.ligaing from the trade date, these contracts are recognized at FVTPL or as 'Other revenue' in the case of contracts for the sale of non-/fi.liganancial items (see the note 'Revenue') or as 'Electricity, gas and fuel' or 'Services and other materials' in the case of contracts for the purchase of non-/fi.liganancial items (please see, respectively, note 10.a 'Electricity, gas and fuel' and note 10.b 'Services and other materials').\n\nThe Group analyzes all contracts to buy or sell non-/fi.liganancial assets on an ongoing basis, with a speci/fi.ligac focus on forward purchases and sales of electricity and energy commodities, in order to determine if they shall be classi/fi.ligaed and treated in accordance with  IFRS 9 or if they have been entered into for 'own use'.\n\n## O/ff.ligase/t\\_t.ligaing /fi.liganancial assets and liabilities\n\nThe Group o/ff.ligasets /fi.liganancial assets and liabilities when:\n\n- \u203a there is a legally enforceable right to set o/ff.liga the recognized amounts; and\n- \u203a there is the intention of se/t\\_t.ligaling on a net basis or realizing the asset and se/t\\_t.ligaling the liability simultaneously.\n\n## Hyperin/fl.ligaation\n\nIn a hyperin/fl.ligaationary economy, the Group adjusts non-monetary items, equity and items deriving from index-linked contracts up to the limit of recoverable amount, using a price index that re/fl.ligaects changes in general purchasing power. The e/ff.ligaects of initial application are recognized in equity net  of  tax  e/ff.ligaects.  Conversely,  during  the  hyperin/fl.ligaationary period (until it ceases), the gain or loss resulting from adjustments is recognized in pro/fi.ligat or loss and disclosed separately in /fi.liganancial income and expense.\n\nSta/r\\_t.ligaing from 2018, this standard applies to the Group's transactions in Argentina, whose economy has been declared hyperin/fl.ligaationary from July 1, 2018.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

        "page_content": "## Non-current assets (or disposal groups) classi/fi.ligaed as held for sale and discontinued operations\n\nNon-current assets (or disposal groups) are classi/fi.ligaed as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction, rather than through continuing use.\n\nThis classi/fi.ligacation criterion is applicable only when non-current assets (or disposal groups) are available in their present condition for immediate sale and the sale is highly probable. If the Group is commi/t\\_t.ligaed to a sale plan involving loss of control of a subsidiary and the requirements provided for under IFRS 5 are met, all the assets and liabilities of that subsidiary are classi/fi.ligaed as held for sale when the classi/fi.ligacation criteria are met, regardless of whether the Group will retain a non-controlling interest in its former subsidiary after the sale.\n\nThe Group applies these classi/fi.ligacation criteria as envisaged in IFRS 5 to an investment, or a po/r\\_t.ligaion of an investment, in an associate or a joint venture. Any retained po/r\\_t.ligaion of an investment in an associate or a joint venture that has not been classi/fi.ligaed as held for sale is accounted for using the equity method until disposal of the po/r\\_t.ligaion that is classi/fi.ligaed as held for sale takes place.\n\nNon-current assets (or disposal groups) and liabilities of disposal groups classi/fi.ligaed as held for sale are presented separately from other assets and liabilities in the statement of /fi.liganancial position.\n\nThe amounts presented for non-current assets or for the assets and liabilities of disposal groups classi/fi.ligaed as held for sale are not reclassi/fi.ligaed or re-presented for prior periods presented.\n\nImmediately before the initial classi/fi.ligacation of non-current assets (or disposal groups) as held for sale, the carrying amounts of such assets (or disposal groups) are measured in accordance with the accounting standard applicable to those assets or liabilities. Non-current assets (or disposal groups) classi/fi.ligaed as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Impairment losses for any initial or subsequent write-down of the assets (or disposal groups) to fair value less costs to sell and gains for their reversals are recognized in pro/fi.ligat or loss from continuing operations.\n\nNon-current assets are not depreciated (or amo/r\\_t.ligaized) while they are classi/fi.ligaed as held for sale or while they are pa/r\\_t.liga of a disposal group classi/fi.ligaed as held for sale.\n\nIf the classi/fi.ligacation criteria are no longer met, the Group ceases  to  classify  the  non-current  assets  (or  disposal group) as held for sale. In this case they are measured at the lower of:\n\n- \u203a the carrying amount before the asset (or disposal group) was classi/fi.ligaed as held for sale, adjusted for any depre-\n- ation, amo/r\\_t.ligaization or reversals of impairment losses that would have been recognized if the asset (or disposal group) had not been classi/fi.ligaed as held for sale; and\n- \u203a the recoverable amount, which is equal to the greater of its fair value net of costs to sell and its value in use, as calculated at the date of the subsequent decision not to sell.\n\nAny adjustment to the carrying amount of a non-current asset that ceases to be classi/fi.ligaed as held for sale is included in pro/fi.ligat or loss from continuing operations.\n\nA discontinued operation is a component of the Group that either has been disposed of, or is classi/fi.ligaed as held for sale, and:\n\n- \u203a represents a separate major business line or geographical segment;\n- \u203a is pa/r\\_t.liga of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major business line or geographical segment; or\n- \u203a is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale.\n- The Group presents, in a separate line item of the income statement, a single amount comprising the total of:\n- \u203a the post-tax pro/fi.ligat or loss of discontinued operations; and\n- \u203a the post-tax gain or loss recognized on the measurement at fair value less costs to sell or on the disposal of the assets or disposal groups constituting the discontinued operation.\n\nThe corresponding amount is restated in the income statement for prior periods presented in the /fi.liganancial statements, so that the disclosures relate to all operations that are discontinued by the end of the current repo/r\\_t.ligaing period. If the Group ceases to classify a component as held for sale, the results of the component previously presented in discontinued operations are reclassi/fi.ligaed and included in pro/fi.ligat or loss from continuing operations for all periods presented.\n\n## Environmental ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacates\n\nSome Group companies are a/ff.ligaected by national regulations governing green ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacates and energy e/ffi.ligaciency ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacates (so-called white ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacates), as well as the European 'Emissions Trading System'.\n\nGreen ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacates accrued in propo/r\\_t.ligaion to electricity generated by renewable energy plants and energy e/ffi.ligaciency ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacates accrued in propo/r\\_t.ligaion to energy savings achieved that have been ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligaed by the competent authority are treated as non-monetary government operating grants and are recognized at fair value, under other operating pro/fi.ligat, with recognition of an asset under other non-/fi.liganancial assets, if the ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacates are not yet credited to the ownership account, or under inventories, if the ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacates have already been credited to that account.\n\nAt the time the ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacates are credited to the ownership",

In addition, charges incurred for obtaining (in the market or in some other transaction for consideration) any missing ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacates to ful/fi.ligal compliance requirements for the repo/r\\_t.ligaing period are recognized through pro/fi.ligat or loss on an accruals basis under other operating costs, as they represent 'system charges' consequent to compliance with a regulatory requirement.\n\n## Employee bene/fi.ligats\n\nLiabilities related to employee bene/fi.ligats paid upon or after ceasing employment in connection with de/fi.liganed bene/fi.ligat plans or other long-term bene/fi.ligats accrued during the employment period are determined separately for each plan, using actuarial assumptions to estimate the amount of the future bene/fi.ligats that employees have accrued at the reporting date (using the projected unit credit method). More speci/fi.ligacally, the present value of the de/fi.liganed bene/fi.ligat obligation is calculated by using a discount rate determined on the basis of market yields at the end of the repo/r\\_t.ligaing period on high-quality corporate bonds. If there is no deep market for high-quality corporate bonds in the currency in which the bond is denominated, the corresponding yield of government securities is used.\n\nThe liability, net of any plan assets, is recognized on an accruals basis over the vesting period of the related rights. These appraisals are pe/r\\_f.ligaormed by independent actuaries. If the plan assets exceed the present value of the related de/fi.liganed bene/fi.ligat obligation, the surplus (up to the limit of any cap) is recognized as an asset.\n\nAs regards the liabilities/(assets) of de/fi.liganed bene/fi.ligat plans, the cumulative actuarial gains and losses from the actuarial measurement of the liabilities, the return on the plan assets (net of the associated interest income) and the e/ff.ligaect of the asset ceiling (net of the associated interest) are recognized in other comprehensive income when they occur. For other\n\nlong-term bene/fi.ligats, the related actuarial gains and losses are recognized through pro/fi.ligat or loss.\n\nIn the event of a change being made to an existing de/fi.liganed bene/fi.ligat plan or the introduction of a new plan, any past service cost is recognized immediately in pro/fi.ligat or loss.\n\nIn addition, the Group is involved in de/fi.liganed contribution plans under which it pays /fi.ligaxed contributions to a separate entity (a fund) and has no legal or constructive obligation to pay fu/r\\_t.ligaher contributions if the fund does not hold suf/fi.ligacient assets to pay all employee bene/fi.ligats relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. Such plans are usually aimed to supplement pension bene/fi.ligats due to employees post-employment. The related costs are recognized through pro/fi.ligat or loss on the basis of the amount of contributions paid in the period.\n\n## Termination bene/fi.ligats\n\nLiabilities for bene/fi.ligats due to employees for the early termination of employee service arise out of the Group's decision to terminate an employee's employment before the normal retirement date or an employee's decision to accept an o/ff.ligaer of bene/fi.ligats in exchange for the termination of employment. The event that gives rise to an obligation is the termination of employment rather than employee service. Termination bene/fi.ligats are recognized at the earlier of the following dates:\n\n- \u203a when the entity can no longer withdraw its o/ff.ligaer of bene/fi.ligats; and\n- \u203a when the entity recognizes a cost for a restructuring that is within the scope of IAS 37 and involves the payment of termination bene/fi.ligats.\n\nThe liabilities are measured on the basis of the nature of the employee bene/fi.ligats. More speci/fi.ligacally, when the bene/fi.ligats represent an enhancement of other post-employment bene/fi.ligats, the associated liability is measured in accordance with the rules governing that type of bene/fi.ligats. Otherwise, if the termination bene/fi.ligats due to employees are expected to be se/t\\_t.ligaled wholly before 12 months after the end of the repo/r\\_t.ligaing period, the entity measures the liability in accordance with the requirements for sho/r\\_t.liga-term employee bene/fi.ligats; if they are not expected to be se/t\\_t.ligaled wholly before 12 months after the end of the repo/r\\_t.ligaing period, the entity measures the liability in accordance with the requirements for other long-term employee bene/fi.ligats.\n\n## Share-based payments\n\nThe Group unde/r\\_t.ligaakes share-based payment transactions se/t\\_t.ligaled with equity instruments as pa/r\\_t.liga of the remuneration\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

        "page_content": "policy adopted for the Chief Executive O/ffi.ligacer and General Manager and for key management personnel.\n\nThe most recent long-term incentive plans provide for the grant to recipients of an incentive represented by an equity component and a monetary component.\n\nIn order to se/t\\_t.ligale the equity component through the bonus award of Enel shares, a program for the purchase of treasury shares to suppo/r\\_t.liga these plans was approved. For more details on share-based incentive plans, please see note 49 'Share-based payments'.\n\nThe Group recognizes the services rendered by employees as personnel expenses and indirectly estimates their value, and the corresponding increase in equity, on the basis of the fair value of the equity instruments (i.e., Enel shares) at the grant date.\n\nThis fair value is based on the observable market price of Enel shares (on the Milan stock exchange), taking account of the terms and conditions under which the shares were granted (with the exception of vesting conditions excluded from the measurement of fair value).\n\nThe cost of these share-based payment transactions is recognized through pro/fi.ligat or loss, with a corresponding entry in a speci/fi.ligac equity item, over the period in which the service and return pe/r\\_f.ligaormance conditions are met (vesting period).\n\nThe overall expense recognized is adjusted at each reporting date until the vesting date to re/fl.ligaect the best estimate available to the Group of the number of equity instruments for which the service and pe/r\\_f.ligaormance conditions other than market conditions will be satis/fi.ligaed, so that the amount recognized at the end is based on the e/ff.ligaective number of equity instruments that satisfy the service and pe/r\\_f.ligaormance conditions other than market conditions at the vesting date.\n\nNo expense is recognized for awards which ultimately do not vest because the pe/r\\_f.ligaormance conditions other than market conditions and/or the service conditions have not been satis/fi.ligaed. Conversely, the transactions are considered to have vested irrespective of whether the market or non-vesting conditions are satis/fi.ligaed, provided that all the other pe/r\\_f.ligaormance and/or service conditions are satis/fi.ligaed.\n\n## Provisions for risks and charges\n\nProvisions are recognized where there is a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event at the end of the repo/r\\_t.ligaing period, the se/t\\_t.ligalement of which is expected to result in an out/fl.ligaow of resources whose amount can be reliably estimated. Where the impact is signi/fi.ligacant, the accruals are determined by discounting expected future cash /fl.ligaows using a pre-tax discount rate that re/fl.ligaects the current market assessment of the time value of money and, if applicable, the risks speci/fi.ligac to the liability.\n\nIf the provision is discounted, the periodic adjustment of the present value for the time factor is recognized as a /fi.liganancial expense.\n\nWhen the Group expects some or all charges to be reim-\n\nbursed, the reimbursement is recognized as a separate asset, but only when the reimbursement is vi/r\\_t.ligaually ce/r\\_t.ligaain. Where the liability relates to decommissioning and/or site restoration in respect of prope/r\\_t.ligay, plant and equipment, the initial recognition of the provision is made against the related asset and the expense is then recognized in pro/fi.ligat or\n\nloss through the depreciation of the asset involved.\n\nWhere the liability regards the treatment and storage of nuclear waste and other radioactive materials, the provision is recognized against the related operating costs.\n\nA liability for restructuring refers to a program planned and  controlled  by  management  that  materially  changes the scope of a business unde/r\\_t.ligaaken by the Group or the manner in which the business is conducted. Such a liability is recognized when a constructive obligation is established, i.e. when the Group has approved a detailed formal restructuring plan and has sta/r\\_t.ligaed to implement the plan or has announced its main features to those a/ff.ligaected by it. Provisions do not include liabilities in respect of unce/r\\_t.ligaain income tax treatments that are recognized as tax liabilities. The Group could provide a warranty in connection with the sale of a product (whether a good or service) from contracts with customers in the scope of IFRS 15, in accordance with the contract, the law or its customary business practices. In this case, the Group assesses whether the warranty provides the customer with assurance that the related product will function as the pa/r\\_t.ligaies intended because it complies with agreed-upon speci/fi.ligacations or whether the warranty provides the customer with a service in addition to the assurance that the product complies with agreed-upon speci/fi.ligacations.\n\nAfter  the  assessment,  if  the  Group  establishes  that  an assurance warranty is provided, it recognizes a separate warranty liability and corresponding expense when transferring the product to the customer, as additional costs of providing goods or services, without a/t\\_t.ligaributing any of the transaction price (and therefore revenue) to the warranty. The liability is measured and presented as a provision.\n\nOtherwise, if the Group determines that a service warranty is provided, it accounts for the promised warranty as a pe/r\\_f.ligaormance obligation in accordance with IFRS 15, recognizing the contract liability as revenue over the period the warranty service is provided and the costs associated as they are incurred.\n\nFinally, if the warranty includes both an assurance element and a service element and the Group cannot reasonably account for them separately, then it accounts for both of the warranties together as a single pe/r\\_f.ligaormance obligation.",

        "page_content": "In the case of contracts in which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic bene/fi.ligats expected to be received under it (onerous contracts), the Group recognizes a provision as the lower of the excess of unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract over the economic bene/fi.ligats expected to be received under it and any compensation or penalty arising from failure to ful/fi.ligal it.\n\nChanges in estimates of accruals to the provisions addressed here are recognized through pro/fi.ligat or loss in the period in which the changes occur, with the exception of those in the costs of decommissioning, dismantling and/or restoration resulting from changes in the timetable and costs necessary to extinguish the obligation or from a change in the discount rate. These changes increase or decrease the carrying amount of the related assets and are taken to pro/fi.ligat or loss through depreciation. Where they increase the carrying amount of the assets, it is also determined whether the new carrying amount of the assets is fully recoverable. If this is not the case, a loss equal to the unrecoverable amount is recognized through pro/fi.ligat or loss.\n\nDecreases in estimates are recognized up to the carrying amount of the assets. Any excess is recognized immediately in pro/fi.ligat or loss.\n\nFor more information on the estimation criteria adopted in determining provisions for dismantling and/or restoration of prope/r\\_t.ligay, plant and equipment, especially those associated with decommissioning nuclear power plants and storage of waste fuel and other radioactive materials, please see note 2.1 'Use of estimates and management judgment'.\n\n## Revenue from contracts with customers\n\nThe Group recognizes revenue from contracts with customers in order to represent the transfer of promised goods or services to the customers at an amount that re/fl.ligaects the consideration at which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.\n\nThe Group applies this core principle using a /fi.ligave-step model:\n\n- \u203a identify the contract with the customer (step 1). The Group applies IFRS 15 to contracts with customers in the scope of the standard when the contract is legally enforceable and all the criteria envisaged for step 1 are met. If the criteria are not met, any consideration received\n- from the customer is generally recognized as an advance;\n- \u203a identify the pe/r\\_f.ligaormance obligations in the contract (step 2). The Group identi/fi.ligaes all goods or services promised in the contract, separating them into pe/r\\_f.ligaormance obligations to\n\naccount for separately if they are both: capable of being di-\n\nstinct and distinct charges within the context of the contract. As an exception, the Group accounts for as a single performance obligation a series of distinct goods or services that are substantially the same and that have the same pa/t\\_t.ligaern of transfer to the customer over time. In assessing the existence and the nature of the pe/r\\_f.ligaormance obligations, the Group considers all of the contract's features as mentioned in step 1.\n\nFor each distinct good or service identi/fi.ligaed, the Group determines whether it acts as a principal or agent, respectively if it controls or not the speci/fi.ligaed good or service that is promised to the customer before its control is transferred to the customer. When the Group acts as agent, it recognizes revenue on a net basis, corresponding to any fee or commission to which it expects to be entitled;\n\n- \u203a determine the transaction price (step 3).\n\nThe transaction price represents the amount of consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties (e.g., some sale taxes and value-added taxes).\n\nThe Group determines the transaction price at inception of the contract and updates it each repo/r\\_t.ligaing period for any changes in circumstances.\n\nWhen  the  Group  determines  the  transaction  price,  it considers  whether  the  transaction  price  includes  variable  consideration,  non-cash  consideration  received from a customer, consideration payable to a customer and a signi/fi.ligacant /fi.liganancing component;\n\n- \u203a allocate the transaction price (step 4).\n\nThe Group allocates the transaction price at contract inception to each separate pe/r\\_f.ligaormance obligation to depict the amount of consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised goods or services.\n\nWhen the contract includes a customer option to acquire additional goods or services that represents a material right, the Group allocates the transaction price to this pe/r\\_f.ligaormance obligation (i.e. the option) and defers the relative revenue until those future goods or services are transferred or the option expires.\n\nThe Group generally allocates the transaction price on the basis of the relative stand-alone selling price of each distinct good or service promised in the contract (that is, the price at which the Group would sell that good or service separately to the customer);\n\n- \u203a recognize revenue (step 5).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

The cost incurred method (costto-cost method) is considered appropriate for measuring progress, except when speci/fi.ligac contract analyses suggest the use of an alternative method, which be/t\\_t.ligaer depicts the Group's pe/r\\_f.ligaormance obligation ful/fi.ligalled at the repo/r\\_t.ligaing date.\n\nThe Group does not disclose the information about the remaining pe/r\\_f.ligaormance obligations in existing contracts if the pe/r\\_f.ligaormance obligation is pa/r\\_t.liga of a contract that has an original expected duration of one year or less and if the Group recognizes revenue in the amount to which it has a right to invoice the customer.\n\nMore information on the application of this revenue recognition model is provided in note 2.1 'Use of estimates and management judgment' and in note 9.a 'Revenue from sales and services'.\n\nIf the Group pe/r\\_f.ligaorms by transferring goods or services to a customer before the customer pays consideration or before payment is due, it recognizes a contract asset relating\n\nto the right to consideration in exchange for goods or services transferred to the customer.\n\nIf a customer pays consideration before the Group transfers goods or services to the customer, the Group recognizes a contract liability when the payment is made (or the payment is due) that is recognized as revenue when the Group pe/r\\_f.ligaorms under the contract.\n\n## Other revenue\n\nThe Group recognizes revenue other than that deriving from contracts with customers mainly referring to:\n\n- \u203a revenue from the sale of energy commodities based on contracts with physical se/t\\_t.ligalement, which do not qualify for the own use exemption and therefore is recognized at FVTPL in accordance with IFRS 9;\n- \u203a changes in the fair value of contracts to sell energy commodities with physical se/t\\_t.ligalement, which do not qualify for the own use exemption and therefore are recognized at FVTPL in accordance with IFRS 9;\n- \u203a operating lease revenue accounted for on an accrual basis in accordance with the substance of the relevant lease agreement.\n\n## Other operating pro/fi.ligat\n\nOther operating pro/fi.ligat primarily includes gains on disposal of assets that are not an output of the Group's ordinary activities and government grants.\n\nGovernment grants, including non-monetary grants at fair value, are recognized where there is reasonable assurance that they will be received and that the Group will comply with all conditions a/t\\_t.ligaaching to them as set by the government, government agencies and similar bodies whether local, national or international.\n\nWhen loans are provided by governments at a below-market rate of interest, the bene/fi.ligat is regarded as a government grant. The loan is initially recognized and measured at fair value and the government grant is measured as the di/ff.ligaerence between the initial carrying amount of the loan and the funds received. The loan is subsequently measured in accordance with the requirements for /fi.liganancial liabilities.\n\nGovernment grants are recognized in pro/fi.ligat or loss on a systematic basis over the periods in which the Group recognizes as expenses the costs that the grants are intended to compensate.\n\nWhere the Group receives government grants in the form of a transfer of a non-monetary asset for the use of the Group, it accounts for both the grant and the asset at the fair value of the non-monetary asset received at the date of the transfer.\n\nCapital grants, including non-monetary grants at fair value, i.e. those received to purchase, build or otherwise acquire non-current assets (for example, an item of prope/r\\_t.ligay, plant",

The e/ff.ligaective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash payments or receipts over the expected life of the /fi.liganancial instrument or  a  sho/r\\_t.ligaer  period,  where  appropriate,  to  the  carrying amount of the /fi.liganancial asset or liability.\n\nInterest income is recognized to the extent that it is probable that the economic bene/fi.ligats will /fl.ligaow to the Group and the amount can be reliably measured.\n\nOther /fi.liganancial income and expense include also changes in the fair value of /fi.liganancial instruments other than derivatives.\n\n## Dividends\n\nDividends are recognized when the unconditional right to receive payment is established.\n\nDividends and interim dividends payable to the Parent's shareholders are recognized as changes in equity in the period in which they are approved by the Shareholders' Meeting and the Board of Directors, respectively.\n\n## Income taxes\n\n## Current income taxes\n\nCurrent income year for the period, which are recognized under 'income tax liabilities' net of payments on account, or under 'tax assets' where there is a credit balance, are determined using an estimate of taxable income and in conformity with the applicable regulations.\n\nIn pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, such liabilities and assets are determined using\n\nthe tax rates and tax laws that are enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the repo/r\\_t.ligaing period in the countries where taxable income has been generated.\n\nCurrent income taxes are recognized in pro/fi.ligat or loss with the exception of current income taxes related to items recognized outside pro/fi.ligat or loss that are recognized in equity.\n\n## Deferred tax\n\nDeferred tax liabilities and assets are calculated on the temporary di/ff.ligaerences between the carrying amounts of liabilities and assets in the /fi.liganancial statements and their corresponding amounts recognized for tax purposes on the basis of tax rates in e/ff.ligaect on the date the temporary di/ff.ligaerence will reverse, which is determined on the basis of tax rates that are enacted or substantively enacted as at the end of the repo/r\\_t.ligaing period.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary di/ff.ligaerences, except when such liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or in respect of taxable temporary di/ff.ligaerences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, when the Group can control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the temporary di/ff.ligaerences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognized for all deductible temporary di/ff.ligaerences, the carry forward of tax losses and any unused tax credits. For more information concerning the recoverability of such assets, please see the appropriate section of the discussion of estimates.\n\nDeferred taxes and liabilities are recognized in pro/fi.ligat or loss, with the exception of those in respect of items recognized outside pro/fi.ligat or loss that are recognized in equity.\n\nDeferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are o/ff.ligaset only if there is a legally enforceable right to o/ff.ligaset current tax assets with current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or di/ff.ligaerent taxable entities which intend either to se/t\\_t.ligale current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis, or to realize the assets and se/t\\_t.ligale the liabilities simultaneously, in each future period in which signi/fi.ligacant amounts of deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected to be se/t\\_t.ligaled or recovered.\n\n## Unce/r\\_t.ligaainty over income tax treatments\n\nIn de/fi.liganing 'unce/r\\_t.ligaainty', it shall be considered whether a pa/r\\_t.ligaicular tax treatment will be accepted by the relevant taxation authority.

The Group determines whether to consider each unce/r\\_t.ligaain tax treatment separately or together with one or more other unce/r\\_t.ligaain tax treatments based on which approach provides be/t\\_t.ligaer predictions of the resolution of the unce/r\\_t.ligaainty. In assessing whether and how the unce/r\\_t.ligaainty a/ff.ligaects the tax treatment, the Group assumes that a taxation authority will accept or not an unce/r\\_t.ligaain tax treatment supposing that the taxation authority will examine amounts it has a right to examine and have full knowledge of all related information when making those examinations. The Group re/fl.ligaects the e/ff.ligaect of unce/r\\_t.ligaainty in accounting for current and deferred tax using the expected value or the most likely amount, whichever method be/t\\_t.ligaer predicts the resolution of the unce/r\\_t.ligaainty.\n\nSince unce/r\\_t.ligaain income tax positions meet the de/fi.liganition of income taxes, the Group presents unce/r\\_t.ligaain tax liabilities/ assets as current tax liabilities/assets or deferred tax liabilities/assets.\n\n## 3. New and amended standards and interpretations\n\nThe Group has applied the following standards, interpretations and amendments that took e/ff.ligaect as from January 1, 2020.\n\n- \u203a ' Amendments to IFRS 3 - De/fi.liganition of a Business ', issued in October 2018, is intended to assist companies in determining whether an integrated set of activities and assets is a business. More speci/fi.ligacally, the amendments clarify that a business, considered as an integrated set of activities and assets, must include, at a minimum, an input and a substantive process that together signi/fi.ligacantly contribute to the ability to create outputs. Accordingly, the amendments clarify that a business cannot exist without including the inputs and substantive processes necessary to produce outputs. The de/fi.liganition of 'output', as modi/fi.ligaed by these amendments, focuses on the goods and services delivered to customers, on investment income and other revenue and excludes returns in the form of lower costs or other economic bene/fi.ligats.\n- \u203a ' Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8 - De/fi.liganition of Material ', issued in October 2018, to align the de/fi.liganition of\n\n'material' between the accounting standards and the Conceptual Framework for Financial Repo/r\\_t.ligaing and clarify a number of aspects. The de/fi.liganition of material is as follows: 'information is material if omi/t\\_t.ligaing, misstating or obscuring it could reasonably be expected to in/fl.ligauence decisions that the primary users of general purpose /fi.liganancial statements make on the basis of those /fi.liganancial statements, which provide /fi.liganancial information about a speci/fi.ligac repo/r\\_t.ligaing entity.' More speci/fi.ligacally, the amendments clarify that:\n\n- -'obscuring information' regards situations for which the e/ff.ligaect for users of /fi.liganancial statements is similar to the omission or misstatement of information whose materiality is assessed in the context of the /fi.liganancial statements taken as a whole;\n- -'primary users of /fi.liganancial statements', to whom general purpose /fi.liganancial statements are directed, are 'existing  and  potential  investors,  lenders  and  other creditors' who must rely on general purpose /fi.liganancial statements for much of the /fi.liganancial information they need; and\n- -'materiality' depends on the nature or magnitude of information, or both. An entity assesses whether information, either individually or in combination with other information, is material in the context of its /fi.liganancial statements taken as a whole. A misstatement of information is material if it could reasonably be expected to in/fl.ligauence decisions of made by the primary users of the /fi.liganancial statements.\n- \u203a ' Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7 - Interest Rate  Benchmark  Reform ',  issued  in  September  2019. The amendments: (i) provide for temporary exceptions that  enable  hedging  relationships  to  continue  during the period of unce/r\\_t.ligaainty until alterative risk-free rates are established with the interbank o/ff.ligaered rates (IBORs) reform; and (ii) require additional disclosures on hedging relationships directly a/ff.ligaected by the unce/r\\_t.ligaainty. In this regard, note that the reform will impact fair value measurement, the e/ff.ligaects of hedge accounting and net /fi.liganancial income and expense when the alternative rates are de/fi.liganed.\n- \u203a ' Amendments  to  References  to  the  Conceptual  Framework in IFRS Standards ', issued in March 2018. The document sets out the amendments to a/ff.ligaected standards in order to update references to the revised Conceptual Framework. These amendments accompany the latest version of the Revised Conceptual Framework for Financial Repo/r\\_t.ligaing, issued in March 2018 and in e/ff.ligaect as from January 1, 2020, which includes some new concepts, provides updated de/fi.liganitions and recognition criteria and clari/fi.ligaes some impo/r\\_t.ligaant concepts.

Argentina - Hyperin/fl.ligaationary economy: impact of the application of IAS 29\n\nAs from July 1, 2018, the Argentine economy has been considered hyperin/fl.ligaationary based on the criteria established by 'IAS 29 - Financial repo/r\\_t.ligaing in hyperin/fl.ligaationary economies'. This designation is determined following an assessment of a series of qualitative and quantitative circumstances, including the presence of a cumulative in/fl.ligaation rate of more than 100% over the previous three years. For the purposes of preparing the consolidated /fi.liganancial statements at December 31, 2020 and in accordance with IAS 29, ce/r\\_t.ligaain items of the statements of /fi.liganancial position of the investees in Argentina have been remeasured by applying the general consumer price index to historical data in order to re/fl.ligaect changes in the purchasing power of the Argentine peso at the repo/r\\_t.ligaing date for those companies. Bearing in mind that the Enel Group acquired control of the\n\nArgentine companies on June 25, 2009, the remeasure-\n\nment of the non-monetary /fi.liganancial statement /fi.ligagures was conducted by applying the in/fl.ligaation indices sta/r\\_t.ligaing from that date. In addition to being already re/fl.ligaected in the opening statement of /fi.liganancial position, the accounting e/ff.ligaects of that remeasurement also include changes during the period. More speci/fi.ligacally, the e/ff.ligaect of the remeasurement of non-monetary items, the equity items and the income statement items recognized in 2020 was recognized in a speci/fi.ligac line of the income statement under /fi.liganancial income and expense. The associated tax e/ff.ligaect was recognized in taxes for the year.\n\nIn order to also take account of the impact of hyperin/fl.ligaation on the exchange rate of the local currency, the income statement balances expressed in the hyperin/fl.ligaationary currency have been translated into the Group's presentation currency (euro) applying, in accordance with IAS 21, the closing exchange rate rather than the average rate for the year in order to adjust these amounts to present values.\n\nThe cumulative changes in the general price indices at December 31, 2018, December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020 are shown in the following table.\n\n| Periods                                    | Cumulative change in general  consumer price index   |\n|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| From July 1, 2009                          |                                                      |\n| to December 31, 2018                       | 346.30%                                              |\n| From January 1, 2019  to December 31, 2019 | 54.46%                                               |\n| From January 1, 2020  to December 31, 2020 | 35.41%                                               |\n\nIn 2020, the application of IAS 29 generated net /fi.liganancial income (gross of tax) of \u20ac57 million.\n\nThe following tables repo/r\\_t.liga the e/ff.ligaects of IAS 29 on the balance at December 31, 2020 and the impact of hyperin/fl.ligaation on the main income statement items for 2020, di/ff.ligaerentiating between that concerning the revaluation on the basis of the general consumer price index and that due to the application of the closing exchange rate rather than the average exchange rate for the period, in accordance with the provisions of IAS 21 for hyperin/fl.ligaationary economies.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

Disclosures on non-/fi.liganancial issues\n\n## Disclosures concerning the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nIn view of the complexity of the current situation, the Group has carefully monitored the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic with regard to the main areas and countries in which we operate, in line with the recommendations of ESMA in the public statements (1) published in March, May, July and October 2020, and of CONSOB in its warning notices nos. 6/2020 of April 9, 2020, 8/2020 of July 16, 2020 and 1/2021 of February 16, 2021.\n\nThe Group has analyzed the impacts of COVID-19 on business operations, the /fi.liganancial position and pe/r\\_f.ligaormance, which are also re/fl.ligaected in the assumptions underlying the Group's Business Plan, also identifying the main risks and unce/r\\_t.ligaainties to which it is exposed, as repo/r\\_t.ligaed in the 'Risk management' section of the Repo/r\\_t.liga on Operations. For more on the e/ff.ligaects generated by the COVID-19 pandemic at December 31, 2020, please see the speci/fi.ligac section 'Financial impact of COVID-19' in the Repo/r\\_t.liga on Operations. Consistent  with  the  disclosures  provided  in  the  earlier sections of the Repo/r\\_t.liga on Operations, the consolidated\n\n/fi.liganancial statements at December 31, 2020 o/ff.ligaer additional speci/fi.ligac information regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, based on speci/fi.ligac company circumstances and on the availability of reliable information, in order to highlight its impact on the /fi.liganancial position and pe/r\\_f.ligaormance of the Group at that date.\n\nIn this regard, additional information on the /fi.liganancial implications of the COVID-19 pandemic is available in note 2.1 'Use of estimates and management judgment' and in the notes to speci/fi.ligac items.\n\n## Disclosures on climate change\n\nThe Group is moving forward in its commitment to lead the energy transition, in line with the objectives of the Paris Agreement (COP21) and the Sustainable Development Goals set by the United Nations.\n\nIn pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, the Group is fully commi/t\\_t.ligaed to the development of a long-term sustainable business model, consistent with the objectives of the Paris Agreement to achieve a reduction in CO 2 emissions and to limit the average increase in global temperature to below 2 \u00b0C compared with pre-industrial levels. Since 2019, the Group has o/ffi.ligacially rea/ffi.ligarmed this commitment, responding to the United Na-",

        "page_content": "tions call for action and is the only Italian company to have\n\nsigned the commitment to limit the increase in global temperatures to 1.5 \u00b0C and to achieve zero emissions by 2050. These objectives form the basis for the 2021-2030 Strategic Plan presented in November 2020. It is founded on the Group's leadership in the energy transition process through the decarbonization of its generation mix, the electri/fi.ligacation of energy consumption and the creation of digital platforms for the development of new business and operational models.\n\nThe  Group  has  considered  the  risks  related  to  climate change and the objectives of the Paris Agreement in the preparation of the consolidated /fi.liganancial statements at December 31, 2020, which appropriately re/fl.ligaect the e/ff.ligaect of achieving net zero emissions by 2050 on assets, liabilities, pro/fi.ligats and losses, incorporating the material and foreseeable impacts as required under the Framework of the IFRS. Fu/r\\_t.ligahermore, in compliance with the document published by the IFRS Foundation on November 20, 2020 (2) , the Group provides explicit information in the notes to these consolidated /fi.liganancial statements regarding how the implications of climate change are re/fl.ligaected in the /fi.liganancial statements. For fu/r\\_t.ligaher details on the /fi.liganancial implications of issues related to climate change, please see note 2.1 'Use of estimates and management judgment' and in the notes to speci/fi.ligac items.\n\nThe accounting assumptions used for the preparation of the 2020 consolidated /fi.liganancial statements are consistent with the information on the risks deriving from climate change repo/r\\_t.ligaed in the 'Risk management' section of the Repo/r\\_t.liga on Operations, which readers are invited to consult for fu/r\\_t.ligaher information.\n\n## 6. Restatement of comparative disclosures\n\nThe data presented in the comments and in the tables of the notes to these consolidated /fi.liganancial statements are uniform and comparable. In this regard, note that with regard to contracts entered into for the purchase or sale of non-/fi.liganancial items with physical se/t\\_t.ligalement that do not\n\nqualify for the own use exemption and are therefore measured at fair value through pro/fi.ligat or loss (within the scope of IFRS 9), the Group slightly modi/fi.ligaed the recognition of those items in 2020 with a simple reclassi/fi.ligacation of costs between two lines of the income statement, thus enabling a closer correlation between costs and revenue together with more relevant information. This reclassi/fi.ligacation had no impact on either pro/fi.ligat for the year or equity.\n\nMore speci/fi.ligacally, in 2019 the previous accounting treatment of these transactions in non-/fi.liganancial items provided for recognition in:\n\n- \u203a 'Other revenue' of changes in the fair value of sales contracts as well as, at the se/t\\_t.ligalement date, the related revenue together with the e/ff.ligaects in pro/fi.ligat or loss of the derecognition of derivative assets or liabilities;\n- \u203a 'Other operating costs' of changes in the fair value of purchase contracts as well as, at the se/t\\_t.ligalement date, of the related costs together with the e/ff.ligaects, in pro/fi.ligat or loss, of the derecognition of derivative assets or liabilities in 'Electricity, gas and fuel' or 'Services and other materials'.\n\nThe current accounting treatment of these transactions in non-/fi.liganancial items (see the section 'Contracts to buy or sell non-/fi.liganancial items' in note 2.2 'Signi/fi.ligacant accounting policies') instead provides for recognition in:\n\n- \u203a 'Other revenue' of changes in the fair value of sales contracts as well as, at the se/t\\_t.ligalement date, the related revenue together with the e/ff.ligaects in pro/fi.ligat or loss of the derecognition of derivative assets or liabilities;\n- \u203a 'Electricity, gas and fuel' of the changes in the fair value of purchase contracts;\n- \u203a 'Electricity, gas and fuel' or 'Services and other materials' of the related costs at the se/t\\_t.ligalement date together with the e/ff.ligaects in pro/fi.ligat or loss of the derecognition of derivative assets or liabilities.\n\nConsequently, the only di/ff.ligaerence between the two years under comparison concerned the reclassi/fi.ligacation of the 2019 amounts for changes in the fair value of contracts to buy non-/fi.liganancial items from 'Other operating costs' to 'Electricity, gas and fuel' and 'Services and other materials'.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

Main acquisitions and disposals during the year\n\nIn the two periods under review, the consolidation scope changed as a result of a number of transactions.\n\n## 2019\n\n- \u203a The disposal, on March 1, 2019, of 100% of Mercure Srl, a company to which the business unit consisting of the Mercure biomass plant and the related legal relationships had been previously transferred. The price for the transaction was \u20ac168 million;\n- \u203a the acquisition, on March 14, 2019, by Enel Green Power SpA, acting through its US renewables subsidiary Enel Green Power No/r\\_t.ligah America (EGPNA, now renamed Enel No/r\\_t.ligah America), of 100% of 13 companies that own operating  renewable  generation  plants  from  Enel  Green Power No/r\\_t.ligah America Renewable Energy Pa/r\\_t.liganers (EGPNA REP), a joint venture 50% owned by EGPNA and 50% by General Electric Capital's Energy Financial Services;\n- \u203a the acquisition, on March 27, 2019, by Enel Green Power SpA (EGP), acting through its US renewables subsidiary EGPNA  (now  ENA),  of  Tradewind  Energy,  a  renewable energy project development company based in Lenexa, Kansas. EGP has incorporated the entire Tradewind development platform, which includes 13 GW of wind, solar and storage projects located in the United States. The agreement also provided for the sale, which took place in June, of Savion, a wholly owned subsidiary of Tradewind; \u203a on April 30, 2019, Enel X Italia acquired 100% di YouSave SpA, an Italian company operating in the energy services sector, providing assistance to large electricity consumers;\n- \u203a on  May  31,  2019,  the  /fi.liganalization,  acting  through  the renewables subsidiary Enel Green Power Brasil Pa/r\\_t.ligaicipa\u00e7\u00f5es Ltda, of the disposal of 100% of three renewables plants in Brazil. The total price of the transaction was about R$2.7 billion, the equivalent of about \u20ac603 million; \u203a the acquisition, on November 14, 2019, by Enel X Srl of 55% di Paytipper, an authorized payment institution that o/ff.ligaers its customers /fi.liganancial services to facilitate their daily lives. The contract is accompanied by a put option for the remaining 45%.\n\n## 2020\n\n- \u203a In January 2020, the Wild Plains project company, 100% owned by Tradewind, was sold. The sale did not have an impact on pro/fi.ligat or loss;\n- \u203a on May 11, 2020 Endesa Energ\u00eda sold 80% of Endesa Soluciones for \u20ac21 million. The interest, which had previously been consolidated on a line-by-line basis, is now accounted for using the equity method;\n- \u203a on July 7, 2020, Enel Green Power Espa\u00f1a acquired 100% of Parque E\u00f3lico Tico SLU, Tico Solar 1 SLU and Tico Solar 2 SLU for a total of \u20ac40 million;\n- \u203a on September 14, Endesa Generaci\u00f3n Po/r\\_t.ligaugal acquired 100% of Suggestion Power (Unipessoal) Lda for a total of \u20ac6 million;\n- \u203a on  September  17,  2020,  Enel  X  International  acquired 60% of Viva Labs AS for a total of \u20ac3 million;\n- \u203a Enel Green Power Panama acquired 100% of Jaguito Solar and Progreso Solar in 2020 for a total of \u20ac2 million.\n\n## Other changes\n\nIn addition to the above changes in the consolidation scope, the following transactions, which although they do not represent transactions involving the acquisition or loss of control, gave rise to a change in the interest held by the Group in the investees:\n\n- \u203a the disposal, in 2020, of a number of 50% owned joint ventures in Enel No/r\\_t.ligah America's hydroelectric po/r\\_t.ligafolio. In December 2019, the entire po/r\\_t.ligafolio had been classi/fi.ligaed as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5. The gain recognized in pro/fi.ligat or loss was \u20ac2 million;\n- \u203a in 2020, Enel SpA increased its interest in Enel Am\u00e9ricas by 5.03% under the provisions of share swaps entered into with a /fi.liganancial institution. The Group's total stake is therefore now 65%;\n- \u203a Enel SpA increased its interest in Enel Chile by 2.89% under the provisions of two share swaps entered into with a /fi.liganancial institution. The Group's total stake is therefore now 64.93%.\n\n## Minor acquisitions\n\nThe Group will determine, for the other minor acquisitions, the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed within 12 months of the acquisition date.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

Segment repo/r\\_t.ligaing\n\nThe representation of /fi.liganancial position and pe/r\\_f.ligaormance by business segment presented here is based on the approach used by management in monitoring Group pe/r\\_f.ligaormance for the two years being compared.\n\nAs already discussed in note 6 to the consolidated /fi.liganancial statements, segment repo/r\\_t.ligaing has been reformulated because in March 2020 a number of large generation custo-\n\nmers were reallocated to the End-user Market segment in South America and Mexico.\n\nIn order to ensure full comparability of the /fi.ligagures commented here in the light of the new breakdown of the primary and secondary repo/r\\_t.ligaing segments for IFRS 8 disclosure purposes, the comparative /fi.ligagures for 2019 have been restated appropriately.\n\nFor more information on pe/r\\_f.ligaormance and /fi.liganancial developments during the year, please see the dedicated section in the Repo/r\\_t.liga on Operations.",

In order to determine the nature of the  promise included in such contracts, the Group  carefully analyzes the facts and circumstances  applicable to each contract and commodity.

Where applicable, this  revenue is based on the rates and related restrictions  established by law or by the Regulatory Authority for  Energy, Networks and the Environment (ARERA) and  analogous foreign authorities during the applicable  period. |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5",

In return for payment of a tax in lieu, this mechanism allows the remeasurement of ce/r\\_t.ligaain assets for tax purposes, resulting in the recognition of deferred tax assets and the greater deductibility of future depreciation;\n\n- \u203a the reversal of deferred tax liabilities by EGPNA as an ancillary e/ff.ligaect of the acquisition of a number of companies from EGPNA REP;\n- \u203a the deductibility of goodwill resulting from the merger of GasAtacama into Enel Generaci\u00f3n Chile.\n\nFor more information on changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities, see note 23.\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the theoretical tax rate and the e/ff.ligaective tax rate.\n\n- \u203a a decrease in taxes (in the amount of \u20ac35 million) reco-\n\n|                                                                                                                                                | Millions of euro   | Millions of euro   | Millions of euro   | Millions of euro   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n|                                                                                                                                                | 2020               |                    | 2019               |                    |\n| Pre-tax pro/fi.ligat                                                                                                                           | 5,463              |                    | 4,312              |                    |\n| Theoretical taxes                                                                                                                              | 1,311              | 24.0%              | 1,035              | 24.0%              |\n| Change in tax e/ff.ligaect on impairment losses, capital  gains and negative goodwill                                                          | 202                |                    | 93                 |                    |\n| Reversal of deferred taxes in Brazil                                                                                                           | -                  |                    | (494)              |                    |\n| Net e/ff.ligaect on deferred taxation recognized with  timing mismatch                                                                         | 16                 |                    | -                  |                    |\n| Impact on deferred taxation of changes in tax rates                                                                                            | -                  |                    | (33)               |                    |\n| Patent box mechanism in Italy                                                                                                                  | -                  |                    | (53)               |                    |\n| Remeasurement for tax purposes of ce/r\\_t.ligaain assets  in Argentina                                                                          | -                  |                    | (35)               |                    |\n| IRAP                                                                                                                                           | 249                |                    | 235                |                    |\n| Other di/ff.ligaerences, e/ff.ligaect of di/ff.ligaerent tax rates  abroad compared with the theoretical rate in Italy,  and other minor items | 63                 |                    | 88                 |                    |\n| Total                                                                                                                                          | 1,841              |                    | 836                |                    |",

Capital expenditure on generation plants mainly regard solar plants in Chile and wind farms in the United States, Russia, South Africa, India and Italy.\n\nIn order to respond to ever more variable climate developments and, therefore, enhance the resilience of grids, the Group continued to invest in the Distribution Business Line (\u20ac3,288 million). The \u20ac75 million increase is mainly a/t\\_t.ligaributable to higher investments in Italy and Romania for maintenance activities on grids and an increase in connection requests, pa/r\\_t.ligaially o/ff.ligaset by the contraction in investments in development and service quality, especially in South America. Expenditure on digital meters decline as a result of the slowdown in the mass replacement of meters due to the COVID-19 emergency.\n\nIn the transition towards the sustainability of urban centers, Enel X, convinced of the key role of electric mobility, has invested above all in the e-city business, pa/r\\_t.ligaicularly in Colombia, with the E-Bus project. In Italy, following the introduction of measures to revive the economy and to encourage energy upgrading and seismic resilience, Enel X has unde/r\\_t.ligaaken greater investments in the development of the e-Home business associated with the Vivi Meglio initiative.\n\nThe exchange loss of \u20ac3,810 million primarily re/fl.ligaects the general depreciation of South American currencies against the euro.\n\nThe 'change in the consolidation scope' in 2020 mainly refers to the sale of a stake held in the Spanish company Endesa Soluciones SLU, in which the interest is now 14%, as well as the acquisition of control by Enel Green Power Italia of a number of renewable energy companies.\n\n'Impairment  losses'  amounted  to  \u20ac1,543  million  and  are mainly a/t\\_t.ligaributable to the decarbonization process initiated by the Group, which in 2020 led to the impairment loss of the Bocamina II plant and ce/r\\_t.ligaain assets of a number of Italian thermal generation plants, as well as Unit 2 of the Brindisi Sud power plant. In addition, the Group took account of climate change impacts in pe/r\\_f.ligaorming the impairment tests.\n\nFollowing impairment testing, this item was also a/ff.ligaected by the impairment loss of assets in Australia as a result of the deterioration of market conditions and in Mexico due to:\n\n- \u203a the increase in regulatory charges as a result of recently approved laws (' Po/r\\_t.ligaeo ');\n- \u203a a decrease in generation due to regulatory and plant constraints, with pa/r\\_t.ligaicular regard to the Dolores facility;\n- \u203a the deconsolidation of the hydroelectric plant.",

Cash /fl.ligaows were determined on the basis of the best information available at the time of the estimate, taking account of the speci/fi.ligac risks of each CGU, and drawn:\n\n- \u203a for the explicit period, from the Business Plan approved by the Board of Directors of the Parent on November 23, 2020, containing forecasts for volumes, revenue, operating costs, capital expenditure, industrial and commercial organization and developments in the main macroeconomic variables (in/fl.ligaation, nominal interest rates and exchange rates) and commodity prices. The explicit period of cash /fl.ligaows considered in impairment testing was three years;\n- \u203a for  subsequent  years,  from  assumptions  concerning long-term developments in the main variables that determine cash /fl.ligaows, the average residual useful life of assets or the duration of the concessions.\n\nMore speci/fi.ligacally, the terminal value is calculated based on the speci/fi.ligac characteristics of the businesses related to the various CGUs subject to impairment testing:\n\n- \u203a perpetuity, for the businesses of large-hydro (LH) power generation and of distribution, in which the licenses and public concessions are of a long-term nature and are easily renewable; as well as for the Enel X businesses, as they feature the development of speci/fi.ligac know-how that is sustainable over the long term;\n- \u203a annuity, for CGUs that are predominantly characterized by retail business, for which the residual life is, therefore, essentially correlated with the average duration of the customer relationships; as well as for businesses of conventional thermal power generation (G&T). An annuity was also used for the renewable energy (Enel Green Power) businesses to take account of: (i) the value resulting from the remaining useful lives of the plants; and (ii) the residual value, in the event of plant decommissioning, associated with licensing rights, the competitiveness of the production facilities (in terms of natural resources), and network interconnectivity.\n\nThe nominal growth rate (g-rate) is equal to the long-term rate of growth in electricity and/or in/fl.ligaation (depending on the country and business involved) and in any case no higher than the average long-term growth rate of the reference market.\n\nThe Group has also taken account of the long-term impact of climate change, in pa/r\\_t.ligaicular by considering in the estimation of the terminal value a long-term growth rate\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

These e/ff.ligaects were pa/r\\_t.ligaially o/ff.ligaset by the deferred tax assets recognized on the increase in provisions for early retirement incentives in Italy and Spain.\n\nIt should also be noted that deferred tax assets (in the amount of \u20ac205 million) were not recorded in relation to\n\nprior tax losses in the amount of \u20ac769 million because, on the basis of current estimates of future taxable income, it is not highly likely that such assets will be recovered.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities amounted to \u20ac7,797 million at December 31, 2020 (\u20ac8,314 million at December 31, 2019). They essentially include the determination of the tax e/ff.ligaects of the adjustments to assets acquired as pa/r\\_t.liga of the /fi.liganal allocation of the cost of acquisitions made in the various years and the deferred taxation in respect of the di/ff.ligaerences between depreciation charged for tax purposes, including accelerated depreciation, and depreciation based on the estimated useful lives of assets.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities decreased by a total of \u20ac517 million due, in pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, to adverse exchange rate developments in Latin America and reversals associated with write-downs of a number of coal-/fi.ligared plants in Italy, Spain and Chile.",

This adjustment, calculated on the basis of the price formula, takes account of the di/ff.ligaerent scenarios that could occur depending on the di/ff.ligaerent oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities of the pa/r\\_t.ligaies by vi/r\\_t.ligaue of the provisions of the general term agreement. The value associated with each of the di/ff.ligaerent scenarios was weighted on the basis of the probability of occurrence assigned to each. Based on these assessments, at December 31, 2020 the consideration is estimated at \u20ac208 million. Accordingly, a write-down of 433 million on the residual investment was recognized and the /fi.liganancial receivable resulting from the sale of the /fi.ligarst stake, equal to \u20ac354 million, was derecognized, with the simultaneous recognition of a provision for\n\nrisks and charges of \u20ac47 million.\n\nCompanies making the largest positive contribution include Rusenergosbyt (\u20ac45 million) under the contract for the supply of electricity to a leading railway transpo/r\\_t.liga company in Russia and Nuclenor (\u20ac25 million), a Spanish company,\n\nfor the income recognized in September 2020 following the successful resolution of a dispute.\n\nThe decrease associated with changes in the consolidation scope mainly refer to the sale of a number No/r\\_t.ligah American companies, o/ff.ligaset in pa/r\\_t.liga by the increase recorded in Spain due to the reduction in the stake held by Endesa Energ\u00eda SA in Endesa Soluciones SLU, which had previously been consolidated on a line-by-line basis.\n\nReclassi/fi.ligacation to assets held for sale refers exclusively to the investment in OpEn Fiber following receipt of a binding acquisition o/ff.ligaer and the occurrence of additional conditions in accordance with the provisions of IFRS 5.\n\n'Other changes' mainly include the pro-rated changes in the OCI reserves or other changes recognized directly in equity. In pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, the \u20ac103 million in respect of OpEn Fiber comprise \u20ac113 million for capital increases, pa/r\\_t.ligaially o/ff.ligaset by fair value gains/(losses) on cash /fl.ligaow hedge derivatives. The Australian Bungala companies also re/fl.ligaect the fair value gain (\u20ac32 million) on the PPA contracts signed with customers following the decline in the prices on the Australian forward market.\n\nThe following tables provide a summary of /fi.liganancial information for each joint venture and associate of the Group not classi/fi.ligaed as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5.",

Employee bene/fi.ligats \u20ac2,964 million\n\nThe Group provides its employees with a variety of bene/fi.ligats, including deferred compensation bene/fi.ligats, additional months' pay for having reached age limits or eligibility for old-age pension, loyalty bonuses for achievement of seniority milestones, supplemental retirement and healthcare plans, residential electricity discounts and similar bene/fi.ligats. More speci/fi.ligacally:\n\n- \u203a for Italy, the item 'pension bene/fi.ligats' regards estimated accruals made to cover bene/fi.ligats due under the supplemental retirement schemes of retired executives and the bene/fi.ligats due to personnel under law or contract at the time the employment relationship is terminated. For the foreign companies, the item refers to post-employment bene/fi.ligats, of which the most material regard the pension bene/fi.ligat schemes of Endesa in Spain, which break down into three types that di/ff.ligaer on the basis of employee seniority and company. In general, under the framework agreement of October 25, 2000, employees pa/r\\_t.ligaicipate in a speci/fi.ligac de/fi.liganed contribution pension plan and, in cases of disability or death of employees in service, a de/fi.liganed bene/fi.ligat plan which is covered\n\nby appropriate insurance policies. In addition, the group has two other limited-enrollment plans (i) for current and retired Endesa employees covered by the electricity industry collective bargaining agreement prior to the changes introduced with the framework agreement noted earlier and (ii) for employees of the Catalan companies merged in the past (Fecsa/Enher/HidroEmpord\u00e0). Both are de/fi.liganed bene/fi.ligat plans and bene/fi.ligats are fully ensured, with the exception of the former plan for bene/fi.ligats in the event of the death of a retired employee. Finally, the Brazilian companies have also established de/fi.liganed bene/fi.ligat plans;\n\n- \u203a the item 'electricity discount' comprises bene/fi.ligats regar-\n- ding electricity supply associated with foreign companies. For Italy, that bene/fi.ligat, which was granted until the end of 2015 to retired employees only, was unilaterally cancelled; \u203a the item 'health insurance' refers to bene/fi.ligats for current or retired employees covering medical expenses;\n- \u203a 'other bene/fi.ligats' mainly regard the loyalty bonus, which is adopted in various countries and for Italy is represented by the estimated liability for the bene/fi.ligat entitling employees covered by the electricity workers national collective bargaining agreement to a bonus for achievement of seniority milestones (25th and 35th year of service).",

        "page_content": "## Nuclear decommissioning provision\n\nAt December 31, 2020, the provision re/fl.ligaected solely the costs that will be incurred at the time of decommissioning of nuclear plants by ENRESA, a Spanish public entity responsible for such activities in accordance with Royal Decree 1349/2003 and Law 24/2005. Quanti/fi.ligacation of the costs is based on the standard contract between ENRESA and the electricity companies approved by the Ministry for the Economy in September 2001, which regulates the retirement and closing of nuclear power plants. The time horizon envisaged, three years, corresponds to the period from the termination of power generation to the transfer of plant management to ENRESA (so-called post-operational costs) and takes account, among the various assumptions used to estimate the amount, of the quantity of unused nuclear fuel expected at the date of closure of each of the Spanish nuclear plants on the basis of the provisions of the concession agreement.\n\n## Site retirement, removal and restoration provision\n\nThis provision represents the present value of the estimated cost for the retirement and removal of non-nuclear plants where there is a legal or constructive obligation to do so. The provision mainly regards the Endesa Group, Enel Produzione and the companies in Latin America. The change in the provisions during 2020 is mainly linked to the redetermination of the future retirement costs of ce/r\\_t.ligaain plants in Iberia and an increase in provisions for retirement costs resulting from the Group's decision to promote the termination of generation from coal-/fi.ligared power plants in Iberia, Italy and Chile in order to achieve the Group's strategic objective of decarbonizing generation in order to mitigate the impacts of climate change.\n\n## Litigation provision\n\nThe litigation provision covers contingent liabilities in respect of pending litigation and other disputes. It includes an estimate of the potential liability relating to disputes that arose during the year, as well as revised estimates of the potential costs associated with disputes initiated in prior years. The balance for litigation mainly regards the companies in Spain (\u20ac178 million), Italy (\u20ac107 million) and Latin America (\u20ac522 million).\n\nThe decrease compared with the previous year, equal to \u20ac250 million, mainly re/fl.ligaects the change in the provision in Latin America and No/r\\_t.ligah America, a/t\\_t.ligaributable in pa/r\\_t.ligaicular to adverse exchange rate developments in Brazil and Argentina, as well as the resolution of a number of disputes in the United States.\n\n## Provision for environmental ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacates\n\nThe provision for environmental ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacates covers costs in respect of sho/r\\_t.ligafalls in the environmental ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacates\n\nneed for compliance with national or supranational environmental protection requirements and mainly regards Enel Energia, Endesa Energ\u00eda and Unelco.\n\n## Provision for taxes and duties\n\nThe provision for taxes and duties covers the estimated liability deriving from tax disputes concerning direct and indirect taxes. The balance of the provision also includes the provision for current and potential disputes concerning local prope/r\\_t.ligay tax (whether the Imposta Comunale sugli Immobili ('ICI') or the new Imposta Municipale Unica ('IMU')) in Italy. The Group has taken due account of the criteria introduced with circular no. 6/2012 of the Public Land Agency (which resolved interpretive issues concerning  the  valuation  methods  for  movable  assets  considered relevant for prope/r\\_t.ligay registry purposes, including ce/r\\_t.ligaain assets typical to generation plants, such as turbines) in estimating the liability for such taxes, both for the purposes of quantifying the probable risk associated with pending litigation and generating a reasonable valuation of probable future charges on positions that have not yet been assessed by Land Agency o/ffi.ligaces and municipalities. The provision was vi/r\\_t.ligaually unchanged on December 31, 2019.\n\n## Other provisions\n\nOther provisions cover various risks and charges, mainly in connection with regulatory disputes and disputes with local authorities regarding various duties and fees or other charges.\n\nThe decrease of \u20ac166 million in other provisions is mainly a/t\\_t.ligaributable to Enel Energia and the adverse exchange rate e/ff.ligaects in Latin America.\n\nNote also the recognition of a provision for risks (equal to \u20ac47 million) as a result of the write-down of the sale of 50% of the investment in Slovak Power Holding.\n\n## Provision for early retirement incentives and other restructuring plans\n\nThe provision for early retirement incentives and other restructuring plans includes the estimated charges related to binding agreements for the voluntary termination of employment contracts in response to organizational needs. The reduction of \u20ac166 million for the year mainly re/fl.ligaects uses of provisions for incentives established in Spain and Italy in previous years.\n\nIn Italy, the la/t\\_t.ligaer is largely associated with the union-company agreements signed in September 2013 and December 2015, implementing, for a number of companies in Italy, the mechanism provided for under A/r\\_t.ligaicle 4, paragraphs 1-7 ter , of Law 92/2012 (the Fornero Act). The la/t\\_t.ligaer agreement envisaged the voluntary termination, in Italy, of about 6,100 employees in 2016-2020.",

        "page_content": "6\n\nIn Spain, the provisions regard the Acuerdo de Salida Voluntaria .\n\n## Provision for restructuring programs connected with the energy transition\n\nEnel, in its role as a leader of the energy transition, has placed decarbonization and growth of renewables around the world at the center of its strategy.\n\nIn this context, Enel has begun restructuring the activities associated with the energy transition process, which involves thermal generation plants in all the geographical areas in which the Group operates. The consequent revision of processes and operating models will require changes in the roles and skills of employees, which the Group intends to implement with highly sustainable plans based on  redeployment  programs,  with  major  upskilling  and\n\nreskilling plans and voluntary individual early retirement agreements that will involve around 1,300 people worldwide. The energy transition is also based on the progressive and expansive development of digital tools, as digitization is essential to responding to multiple external forces and making informed and well-considered decisions at every level within the Group.\n\nA provision was therefore established for restructuring programs,  which  at  December  31,  2020  amounted  to \u20ac759 million, which is mainly a/t\\_t.ligaributable to Spain and Italy, and represents the estimated costs that the Group has provisioned to accelerate the energy transition process, for all direct and indirect activities related to the review of processes and operating models and the roles and skills of employees.\n\n## 39.

Other mainly regards the liabilities of some Brazilian companies to the national electricity agency ANEEL (Regulatory Resolution no. 885/2020 of June 23) in respect of loans granted to distribution companies in order to provide liqui-\n\ndity to them and minimize the e/ff.ligaects of the pandemic. The decline in other is mainly a/t\\_t.ligaributable to the e/ff.ligaect of\n\nthe recognition in 2019 of the debt of \u20ac358 million associated with the purchase through /fi.liganancial intermediaries (with share swaps) of additional shares in Enel Am\u00e9ricas and Enel Chile, compounded by the impact of the reduction in 2020 of liabilities for expired commodity derivatives, which were registered mainly in Italy and Spain.

This approach, based on an assessment of any signi/fi.ligacant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, is performed comparing the PD at origination with PD at the repo/r\\_t.ligaing date, at each repo/r\\_t.ligaing date.\n\nThen, based on the results of the assessment, a loss allowance is recognized based on 12-month ECL or lifetime ECL (i.e. staging):\n\n- -12-month ECL, for /fi.liganancial assets for which there has not been a signi/fi.ligacant increase in credit risk since initial recognition;\n- -lifetime ECL, for /fi.liganancial assets for which there has been a signi/fi.ligacant increase in credit risk or which are credit impaired (i.e. defaulted based on past due information);\n- \u203a the simpli/fi.ligaed approach, for trade receivables, contract assets and lease receivables with or without a signi/fi.ligacant /fi.liganancing  component,  based  on  lifetime  ECL  without tracking changes in credit risk.\n\nFor more information on assets deriving from contracts with customers, please see note 26 'Current/Non-current contract assets/(liabilities).\n\nA forward-looking adjustment can be applied considering qualitative and quantitative information in order to re/fl.ligaect future  events  and  macroeconomic  developments  that could impact the risk associated with the po/r\\_t.ligafolio or /fi.liganancial instrument.\n\nDepending on the nature of the /fi.liganancial assets and the credit risk information available, the assessment of the increase in credit risk can be pe/r\\_f.ligaormed on:\n\n- \u203a an individual basis, if the receivables are individually signi/fi.ligacant and for all receivables which have been individually identi/fi.ligaed for impairment based on reasonable and suppo/r\\_t.ligaable information;\n- \u203a a collective basis, if no reasonable and suppo/r\\_t.ligaable information is available without undue cost or e/ff.ligao/r\\_t.liga to measure expected credit losses on an individual instrument basis.\n\nWhen there is no reasonable expectation of recovering a /fi.liganancial asset in its entirety or a po/r\\_t.ligaion thereof, the gross carrying amount of the /fi.liganancial asset shall be reduced.\n\nA write-o/ff.liga represents a derecognition event (e.g. the right to cash /fl.ligaows is legally or contractually extinguished, transferred or expired).\n\nThe following table repo/r\\_t.ligas expected credit losses on /fi.liganancial assets measured at amo/r\\_t.ligaized cost on the basis of the general simpli/fi.ligaed approach.\n\n| Millions of euro                                      | at Dec. 31, 2020   | at Dec. 31, 2020                       | at Dec. 31, 2020   | at Dec. 31, 2019   | at Dec. 31, 2019                       | at Dec. 31, 2019   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------|\n|                                                       | Gross amount       | Allowance  for expected  credit losses | Total              | Gross amount       | Allowance  for expected  credit losses | Total              |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                             | 5,702              | -

The increase in debt deriving from new issues of \u20ac3,924 million was easily o/ff.ligaset by reductions associated with repayments in the amount of \u20ac3,747 million, exchange gains of \u20ac3,031 million, the deconsolidation of the debt of a number of South African companies in the amount of \u20ac389 million (that amount is net of new issues in 2020 by the deconsolidated companies) and other changes in debt totaling \u20ac1,845 million. This value includes \u20ac1,797 million re/fl.ligaecting the accounting e/ff.ligaects of the consent solicitation directed at the holders of three non-conve/r\\_t.ligaible subordinated hybrid bonds denominated in euros in order to align their features with those of new issues. More speci/fi.ligacally, the main change to those\n\ninstruments regarded their maturity, which was transformed from /fi.ligaxed to perpetual, which means that they will be redeemed only in the event of liquidation. As a result, those bonds are no longer recognized as debt instruments but as equity instruments.\n\nRepayments in 2020 concerned bonds in the amount of \u20ac2,109 million and borrowings totaling \u20ac1,638 million.\n\nMore speci/fi.ligacally, the main bonds maturing in 2020 included:\n\n- \u203a \u20ac410 million in respect of a /fi.ligaxed-rate hybrid bond issued by Enel SpA, maturing in January 2020;\n- \u203a \u20ac100 million in respect of a /fi.ligaxed-rate bond issued by Enel Finance International, maturing in January 2020;\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

These liabilities primarily regard the bond issues carried out within the framework of the Global/Euro Medium-Term Notes program, issues of subordinated unconve/r\\_t.ligaible hybrid bonds (so-called 'hybrid bonds') and loans granted by banks and other /fi.liganancial institutions (including the European Investment Bank and Cassa Depositi e Prestiti SpA).\n\nThe main covenants regarding bond issues carried out within the framework of the Global/Euro Medium-Term Notes program of (i) Enel and Enel Finance International NV (including the green bonds of Enel Finance International NV guaranteed by Enel SpA, which are used to /fi.liganance the Group's so-called eligible green projects) and those regarding bonds issued by Enel Finance International NV on the US market guaranteed by Enel SpA can be summarized as follows:\n\n- \u203a negative pledge clauses under which the issuer and the guarantor may not establish or maintain mo/r\\_t.ligagages, liens or other encumbrances on all or pa/r\\_t.liga of its assets or revenue to secure ce/r\\_t.ligaain /fi.liganancial liabilities, unless the same encumbrances are extended equally or pro rata to the bonds in question;\n- \u203a pari passu clauses, under which the bonds and the associated security constitute a direct, unconditional and unsecured obligation of the issuer and the guarantor and are issued without preferential rights among them and have at least the same seniority as other present and future unsubordinated and unsecured bonds of the issuer and the guarantor;\n- \u203a cross-default clauses, under which the occurrence of a default event in respect of a speci/fi.ligaed /fi.liganancial liability (above a threshold level) of the issuer, the guarantor or, in some cases, 'signi/fi.ligacant' subsidiaries, constitutes a default in respect of the liabilities in question, which become immediately repayable.\n\nSince  2019,  Enel  Finance  International  NV  has  issued  a number of 'sustainable' bonds on the European market (as pa/r\\_t.liga of the Euro Medium Term Notes - EMTN bond issue program) and on the American market, both guaranteed by Enel SpA, linked to the achievement of a number of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations that contain the same covenants as other bonds of the same type.\n\nThe main covenants covering Enel's hybrid bonds, including the perpetual hybrid bond issues in September, which will\n\nbe repaid in the event of the dissolution or liquidation of the Company, can be summarized as follows:\n\n- \u203a subordination clauses, under which each hybrid bond is subordinate to all other bonds issued by the company and has the same seniority with all other hybrid /fi.liganancial instruments issued, being senior only to equity instruments;\n- \u203a prohibition on mergers with other companies, the sale or leasing of all or a substantial pa/r\\_t.liga of the company's assets to another company, unless the la/t\\_t.ligaer succeeds in all obligations of the issuer.\n\nThe main covenants envisaged in the loan contracts of Enel and Enel Finance International NV and the other Group companies, including the sustainability-linked loan facility agreements obtained by Enel in 2019 and 2020, can be summarized as follows:\n\n- \u203a negative pledge clauses, under which the borrower and, in some cases, the guarantor are subject to limitations on the establishment of mo/r\\_t.ligagages, liens or other encumbrances on all or pa/r\\_t.liga of their respective assets, with the exception of expressly permi/t\\_t.ligaed encumbrances;\n- \u203a disposals  clauses,  under  which  the  borrower  and,  in some cases, the guarantor may not dispose of their assets or operations, with the exception of expressly permi/t\\_t.ligaed disposals;\n- \u203a pari passu clauses, under which the payment unde/r\\_t.ligaakings of the borrower have the same seniority as its other unsecured and unsubordinated payment obligations;\n- \u203a change of control clauses, under which the borrower and, in some cases, the guarantor could be required to renegotiate the terms and conditions of the /fi.liganancing or make compulsory early repayment of the loans granted;\n- \u203a rating clauses, which provide for the borrower or the guarantor to maintain their rating above a ce/r\\_t.ligaain speci/fi.ligaed level;\n- \u203a cross-default clauses, under which the occurrence of a default event in respect of a speci/fi.ligaed /fi.liganancial liability (above a threshold level) of the issuer or, in some cases, the guarantor constitutes a default in respect of the liabilities in question, which become immediately repayable.\n\nIn some cases the covenants are also binding for the signi/fi.ligacant companies or subsidiaries of the obligated pa/r\\_t.ligaies. All the borrowings considered specify 'events of default' typical of international business practice, such as, for example, insolvency, bankruptcy proceedings or the entity ceases trading.\n\nIn addition, the guarantees issued by Enel in the interest\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

Risk management\n\n## Financial risk management governance and objectives\n\nAs pa/r\\_t.liga of its operations, the Enel Group is exposed to a variety of /fi.liganancial risks, notably interest rate risk, commodity risk, currency risk, credit and counterpa/r\\_t.ligay risk and liquidity risk.\n\nAs noted in the section 'Risk management' in the Repo/r\\_t.liga on Operations, the Group's governance arrangements for /fi.liganancial risks include internal commi/t\\_t.ligaees and the establishment of speci/fi.ligac policies and operational limits. Enel's primary objective is to mitigate /fi.liganancial risks appropriately so that they do not give rise to unexpected changes in results.\n\nThe Group's policies for managing /fi.liganancial risks provide for the mitigation of the e/ff.ligaects on pe/r\\_f.ligaormance of changes in interest rates and exchange rates with the exclusion of translation risk (connected with consolidation of the accounts). This objective is achieved at the source of the risk, through the diversi/fi.ligacation of both the nature of the /fi.liganancial instruments and the sources of revenue, and by modifying the risk pro/fi.ligale of speci/fi.ligac exposures with derivatives entered into on over-the-counter markets or with speci/fi.ligac commercial agreements.\n\nAs pa/r\\_t.liga of its governance of /fi.liganancial risks, Enel regularly monitors the size of the OTC derivatives po/r\\_t.ligafolio in relation to the threshold values set by regulators for the activation  of  clearing  obligations  (EMIR  -  European  Market Infrastructure Regulation no. 648/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council). During 2020, no overshoot of those threshold values was detected.\n\nThere were no changes in the sources of exposure to such risks compared with the previous year.\n\nFinally, the impact of COVID-19 on risk management issues was limited and in any case not such as to directly and materially in/fl.ligauence the valuation of derivative instruments and the outcome of the assessment of the e/ff.ligaectiveness of hedges of exchange rates, interest rates and commodities. The /fi.liganancial underlyings were not a/ff.ligaected by the adverse impact of COVID-19 either, and no changes were recorded\n\nin the exposures.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nInterest rate risk derives primarily from the use of /fi.liganancial instruments and manifests itself as unexpected changes in charges on /fi.liganancial liabilities, if indexed to /fl.ligaoating rates and/or exposed to the unce/r\\_t.ligaainty of /fi.liganancial terms and conditions in negotiating new debt instruments, or as an unexpected change in the value of /fi.liganancial instruments measured at fair value (such as /fi.ligaxed-rate debt).\n\nThe  main  /fi.liganancial  liabilities  held  by  the  Group  include bonds, bank borrowings, borrowings from other lenders, commercial paper, derivatives, cash deposits received to secure  commercial  or  derivative  contracts  (guarantees, cash collateral).\n\nThe Enel Group mainly manages interest rate risk through the de/fi.liganition of an optimal /fi.liganancial structure, with the dual goal of stabilizing borrowing costs and containing the cost of funds.\n\nThis goal is pursued through the diversi/fi.ligacation of the portfolio of /fi.liganancial liabilities by contract type, maturity and interest  rate,  and  modifying  the  risk  pro/fi.ligale  of  speci/fi.ligac exposures using OTC derivatives, mainly interest rate swaps and interest rate options. The term of such derivatives does not exceed the maturity of the underlying /fi.liganancial liability, so that any change in the fair value and/or expected cash /fl.ligaows of such contracts is o/ff.ligaset by a corresponding change in the fair value and/or cash /fl.ligaows of the hedged position.\n\nProxy hedging techniques can be used in a number of residual circumstances, when the hedging instruments for the risk factors are not available on the market or are not su/ffi.ligaciently liquid.\n\nFor the purpose of EMIR compliance, in order to test the actual e/ff.ligaectiveness of the hedging techniques adopted, the Group subjects its hedge po/r\\_t.ligafolios to periodic statistical assessment.\n\nUsing interest rate swaps, the Enel Group agrees with the counterpa/r\\_t.ligay to periodically exchange /fl.ligaoating-rate interest /fl.ligaows with /fi.ligaxed-rate /fl.ligaows, both calculated on the same notional principal amount.\n\nFloating-to-/fi.ligaxed interest rate swaps transform /fl.ligaoating-rate /fi.liganancial liabilities into /fi.ligaxed rate liabilities, thereby neutralizing the exposure of cash /fl.ligaows to changes in interest rates.\n\nFixed-to-/fl.ligaoating interest rate swaps transform /fi.ligaxed rate /fi.liganancial liabilities into /fl.ligaoating-rate liabilities, thereby neutralizing the exposure of their fair value to changes in interest rates.\n\nFloating-to-/fl.ligaoating interest rate swaps transform the indexing criteria for /fl.ligaoating-rate /fi.liganancial liabilities.\n\nSome structured borrowings have multi-stage cash /fl.ligaows hedged by interest rate swaps that at the repo/r\\_t.ligaing date, and for a limited time, provide for the exchange of /fi.ligaxed-rate interest /fl.ligaows.\n\nInterest rate options involve the exchange of interest di/ff.ligaerences calculated on a notional principal amount once certain thresholds (strike prices) are reached. These thresholds specify the e/ff.ligaective maximum rate (cap) or the minimum rate (/fl.ligaoor) to which the synthetic /fi.liganancial instrument will be indexed as a result of the hedge. Ce/r\\_t.ligaain hedging strategies provide for the use of combinations of options (collars) that establish the minimum and maximum rates at the",

Taking account of e/ff.ligaective cash /fl.ligaow hedges of interest rate risk (in accordance with the provisions of the IFRS-EU), 86.3% of gross long-term /fi.liganancial debt was hedged at December 31, 2020 (85.9% at December 31, 2019).\n\n## Currency risk\n\nCurrency risk mainly manifests itself as unexpected changes in the /fi.liganancial statement items associated with transactions denominated in a currency other than the presentation  currency.  The  Group's  consolidated  /fi.liganancial statements are also exposed to translation risk as a result of the conversion of the /fi.liganancial statements of foreign subsidiaries, which are denominated in local currencies, into euros as the Group's presentation currency.\n\nThe Group's exposure to currency risk is connected with the purchase or sale of fuels and power, investments (cash /fl.ligaows for capitalized costs), dividends and the purchase or sale of equity investments, commercial transactions and /fi.liganancial assets and liabilities.\n\nThe Group policies for managing currency risk provide for the mitigation of the e/ff.ligaects on pro/fi.ligat or loss of changes in the level of exchange rates, with the exception of the translation e/ff.ligaects connected with consolidation.\n\nIn order to minimize the exposure to currency risk, Enel implements diversi/fi.ligaed revenue and cost sources geographically, and uses indexing mechanisms in commercial contracts. Enel also uses various types of derivative, typically on the OTC market.\n\nThe derivatives in the Group's po/r\\_t.ligafolio of /fi.liganancial instru-\n\nments include cross currency interest rate swaps, currency forwards and currency swaps. The term of such contracts does not exceed the maturity of the underlying instrument, so that any change in the fair value and/or expected cash /fl.ligaows of such instruments o/ff.ligasets the corresponding change in the fair value and/or cash /fl.ligaows of the hedged position.\n\nCross currency interest rate swaps are used to transform a long-term /fi.liganancial liability denominated in currency other than the presentation currency into an equivalent liability in the presentation currency.\n\nCurrency  forwards  are  contracts  in  which  the  counterpa/r\\_t.ligaies agree to exchange principal amounts denominated in di/ff.ligaerent currencies at a speci/fi.ligaed future date and exchange rate (the strike). Such contracts may call for the actual exchange of the two principal amounts (deliverable forwards) or payment of the di/ff.ligaerence generated by di/ff.ligaerences between the strike exchange rate and the prevailing exchange rate at maturity (non-deliverable forwards). In the la/t\\_t.ligaer case, the strike rate and/or the spot rate can be determined as averages of the rates observed in a given period.\n\nCurrency swaps are contracts in which the counterpa/r\\_t.ligaies enter into two transactions of the opposite sign at di/ff.ligaerent future dates (normally one spot, the other forward) that provide for the exchange of principal denominated in different currencies.\n\nThe following table repo/r\\_t.ligas the notional amount of transactions outstanding at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, broken down by type of hedged item.\n\n| Millions of euro                                                                                        | Notional amount   | Notional amount   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n|                                                                                                         | 2020              | 2019              |\n| Cross currency interest rate swaps (CCIRSs) hedging debt denominated in  currencies other than the euro | 20,636            | 22,756            |\n| Currency forwards hedging currency risk on commodities                                                  | 5,469             | 4,291             |\n| Currency forwards/swaps hedging future cash /fl.ligaows in currencies other than  the euro              | 3,971             | 4,760             |\n| Other currency forwards                                                                                 | 990               | 1,488             |\n| Total                                                                                                   | 31,066            | 33,295            |\n\nMore speci/fi.ligacally, these include:\n\n- \u203a CCIRSs with a notional amount of \u20ac20,636 million to hedge the currency risk on debt denominated in currencies other than the euro (\u20ac22,756 million at December 31, 2019);\n- \u203a currency forwards with a total notional amount of \u20ac9,440 million used to hedge the currency risk associated with purchases of natural gas and fuel and expected cash /fl.ligaows in currencies other than the euro (\u20ac9,051 million at December 31, 2019);\n- \u203a other currency forwards include OTC derivatives transactions carried out to mitigate currency risk on expected cash /fl.ligaows in currencies other than the presentation currency connected with the purchase of investment goods in the renewables and infrastructure and networks sectors (new generation digital meters), on operating costs for the supply of cloud services and on revenue from the sale of renewable energy.\n\nAt December 31, 2020, 51% (52% at December 31, 2019)",

The residual exposure in respect of the sale of energy on the spot market not hedged with such contracts is aggregated by uniform risk factors that can be managed with hedging transactions on the market. Proxy hedging techniques can be used for the industrial po/r\\_t.ligafolios when the hedging instruments for the speci/fi.ligac risk factors generating the exposure are not available on the market or are not su/ffi.ligaciently liquid. In addition, Enel uses po/r\\_t.ligafolio hedging techniques to assess oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities for ne/t\\_t.ligaing intercompany exposures.\n\nThe Group mainly uses plain vanilla derivatives for hedging (more speci/fi.ligacally, forwards, swaps, options on commodities, futures, contracts for di/ff.ligaerences).\n\nSome of these products can be indexed to a variety of underlyings (coal, gas, oil, CO 2 , di/ff.ligaerent geographical areas, etc.) and the approaches can be assessed and adapted to speci/fi.ligac needs.\n\nEnel also engages in proprietary trading in order to maintain a presence in the Group's reference energy commodity markets. These operations consist in taking on exposures in energy commodities (oil products, gas, coal, CO 2 ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacates and electricity) using /fi.liganancial derivatives and physical contracts traded on regulated and over-the-counter markets, optimizing pro/fi.ligats through transactions carried\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

Monitoring the\n\nconsolidated exposure is carried out by Enel SpA. In addition, at the Group level the policy provides for the use of uniform criteria - in all the main Regions/Countries/ Global Business Lines and at the consolidated level - in measuring commercial credit exposures in order to promptly identify any deterioration in the quality of outstanding receivables and any mitigation actions to be taken.\n\nThe policy for managing credit risk associated with commercial activities provides for a preliminary assessment of the creditwo/r\\_t.ligahiness of counterpa/r\\_t.ligaies and the adoption of mitigation instruments, such as obtaining collateral or unsecured guarantees.\n\nIn addition, the Group unde/r\\_t.ligaakes transactions to factor receivables without recourse, which results in the complete derecognition of the corresponding assets involved in the factoring, as the risks and rewards associated with them have been transferred.\n\nFinally, with regard to /fi.liganancial and commodity transactions, risk mitigation is pursued with a uniform system for assessing counterpa/r\\_t.ligaies at the Group level, including implementation at the level of Regions/Countries/Global Business Li-",

Amounts denominated in currencies other than the euro are translated at the o/ffi.ligacial closing exchange rates provided by the World Markets Re/fi.liganitiv (WMR) Company.\n\n| Millions of euro                    | Non-current       | Non-current       | Non-current       | Non-current       | Current           | Current           | Current           | Current           |\n|-------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n|                                     | Notional          | Notional          | Fair value        | Fair value        | Notional          | Notional          | Fair value        | Fair value        |\n|                                     | at Dec. 31,  2020 | at Dec. 31,  2019 | at Dec. 31,  2020 | at Dec. 31,  2019 | at Dec. 31,  2020 | at Dec. 31,  2019 | at Dec. 31,  2020 | at Dec. 31,  2019 |\n| DERIVATIVE ASSETS                   |                   |                   |                   |                   |                   |                   |                   |                   |\n| Fair value hedge  derivatives:      |                   |                   |                   |                   |                   |                   |                   |                   |\n| - on interest rates                 | 138               | 12                | 22                | 7                 | -                 | -                 | -                 | -                 |\n| - on exchange rates                 | 639               | 166               | 28                | 25                | 79                | -                 | 28                | -                 |\n| Total                               | 777               | 178               | 50                | 32                | 79                | -                 | 28                | -                 |\n| Cash /fl.ligaow hedge  derivatives: |                   |                   |                   |                   |                   |                   |                   |                   |\n| - on interest rates                 | 161               | 335               | 21                | 26                | -                 | 133               | -                 | -                 |\n| - on exchange rates                 | 5,061             | 11,705            | 685               | 1,081             | 698               | 2,717             | 51                | 132               |\n| - on commodities                    | 2,541             | 1,628             | 428               | 215               | 2,165             | 3,081             | 627               | 847               |\n| Total                               | 7,763             | 13,668            | 1,134             | 1,322             | 2,863             | 5,931             | 678               | 979               |\n| Trading derivatives:                |                   |                   |                   |                   |                   |                   |                   |                   |\n| - on interest rates                 | 50                | 50                | 2                 | 2                 | -                 | -                 | -                 | -                 |\n| - on exchange rates                 | 71                | -                 | 4                 | -                 | 3,430             | 3,399             | 79                | 34                |\n| - on commodities                    | 379               | 322               | 46                | 27                | 21,424            | 17, 2 0 3         | 2,686             | 3,052             |\n| Total                               | 500               | 372               | 52                | 29                | 24,854            | 20,602            | 2,765             | 3,086             |\n| TOTAL DERIVATIVE  ASSETS            | 9,040             | 14,218            | 1,236             | 1,383             | 27,796            | 26,533            | 3,471             | 4,065             |",

The method of recognizing the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged.\n\nHedge accounting is applied to derivatives entered into in\n\norder to reduce risks such as interest rate risk, currency risk, commodity price risk and net investments in foreign operations when all the criteria provided by IFRS 9 are met. At the inception of the transaction, the Group documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategy. The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether hedging instruments are highly e/ff.ligaective in o/ff.ligase/t\\_t.ligaing changes in fair values or cash /fl.ligaows of hedged items.\n\nFor cash /fl.ligaow hedges of forecast transactions designated as hedged items, the Group assesses and documents that they are highly probable and present an exposure to changes in cash /fl.ligaows that a/ff.ligaect pro/fi.ligat or loss.\n\nDepending on the nature of the risk exposure, the Group designates derivatives as either:\n\n- \u203a fair value hedges;\n- \u203a cash /fl.ligaow hedges.\n\nFor more details about the nature and the extent of risks\n\narising from /fi.liganancial instruments to which the Group is exposed, please see note 45 'Risk management'.\n\nTo be e/ff.ligaective a hedging relationship shall meet all of the following criteria:\n\n- \u203a existence of an economic relationship between hedging instrument and hedged item;\n- \u203a the e/ff.ligaect of credit risk does not dominate the value changes resulting from the economic relationship;\n- \u203a the hedge ratio de/fi.liganed at initial designation shall be equal to the one used for risk management purposes (i.e. same quantity of the hedged item that the entity actually hedges and the quantity of the hedging instrument that the entity actually uses to hedge the quantity of the hedged item).\n\nBased on the IFRS 9 requirements, the existence of an economic relationship is evaluated by the Group through a qualitative assessment or a quantitative computation, depending on the following circumstances:\n\n- \u203a if the underlying risk of the hedging instrument and the hedged item is the same, the existence of an economic relationship will be provided through a qualitative analysis;\n- \u203a on the other hand, if the underling risk of the hedging instrument and the hedged item is not the same, the existence of the economic relationship will be demonstrated through a quantitative method in addition to a qualitative analysis of the nature of the economic relationship (i.e. linear regression).\n\n<!-- image -->",

In order to evaluate the credit risk e/ff.ligaects, the Group considers the existence of risk mitigating measures (collateral, mutual break-up clauses, ne/t\\_t.ligaing agreements, etc.).\n\nThe Group has established a hedge ratio of 1:1 for all the hedging relationships (including commodity price risk hedging) as the underlying risk of the hedging derivative is identical to the hedged risk, in order to minimize hedging ine/ff.ligaectiveness.\n\nThe hedge ine/ff.ligaectiveness will be evaluated through a qualitative assessment or a quantitative computation, depending on the following circumstances:\n\n- \u203a if the critical terms of the hedged item and hedging instrument match and there are no other sources of ineffectiveness included the credit risk adjustment on the hedging derivative, the hedge relationship will be considered fully e/ff.ligaective on the basis of a qualitative assessment;\n- \u203a if the critical terms of the hedged item and hedging instrument do not match or there is at least one source of ine/ff.ligaectiveness, the hedge ine/ff.ligaectiveness will be quanti/fi.ligaed applying the dollar o/ff.ligaset cumulative method with hypothetical derivative. This method compares changes in fair value of the hedging instrument and the hypothetical derivative between the repo/r\\_t.ligaing date and the inception date.\n\nThe main causes of hedge ine/ff.ligaectiveness can be the following:\n\n- \u203a basis di/ff.ligaerences (i.e. the fair value or cash /fl.ligaows of the hedged item depend on a variable that is di/ff.ligaerent from the variable that causes the fair value or cash /fl.ligaows of the hedging instrument to change);\n- \u203a timing di/ff.ligaerences (i.e. the hedged item and hedging instrument occur or are se/t\\_t.ligaled at di/ff.ligaerent dates);\n- \u203a quantity  or  notional  amount  di/ff.ligaerences  (i.e.  the  hedged item and hedging instrument are based on di/ff.ligaerent quantities or notional amounts);\n- \u203a other risks (i.e. changes in the fair value or cash /fl.ligaows of a derivative hedging instrument or hedged item relate to risks other than the speci/fi.ligac risk being hedged);\n- \u203a credit risk (i.e. the counterpa/r\\_t.ligay credit risk di/ff.ligaerently impact the changes in the fair value of the hedging instruments and hedged items).\n\n## Fair value hedges\n\nFair value hedges are used to protect the Group against exposures to changes in the fair value of assets, liabilities or /fi.ligarm commitment a/t\\_t.ligaributable to a pa/r\\_t.ligaicular risk that could a/ff.ligaect pro/fi.ligat or loss.\n\nChanges in fair value of derivatives that qualify and are designated as hedging instruments are recognized in the income statement, together with changes in the fair value of the hedged item that are a/t\\_t.ligaributable to the hedged risk. If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the adjustment to the carrying amount of a hedged item for which the e/ff.ligaective interest rate method is used is amo/r\\_t.ligaized to pro/fi.ligat or loss over the period to maturity.\n\n## Cash /fl.ligaow hedges\n\nCash /fl.ligaow hedges are applied in order to hedge the Group exposure to changes in future cash /fl.ligaows that are a/t\\_t.ligaributable to a pa/r\\_t.ligaicular risk associated with a recognized asset or liability or a highly probable transaction that could a/ff.ligaect pro/fi.ligat or loss.\n\nThe e/ff.ligaective po/r\\_t.ligaion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash /fl.ligaow hedges is recognized in other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the ine/ff.ligaective po/r\\_t.ligaion is recognized immediately in the income statement.\n\nAmounts accumulated in equity are reclassi/fi.ligaed to pro/fi.ligat or loss in the periods when the hedged item a/ff.ligaects pro/fi.ligat or loss (for example, when the hedged forecast sale takes place).\n\nIf the hedged item results in the recognition of a non-/fi.liganancial asset (i.e. prope/r\\_t.ligay, plant and equipment or inventories, etc.) or a non-/fi.liganancial liability, or a hedged forecast transaction  for  a  non-/fi.liganancial  asset  or  a  non-/fi.liganancial liability becomes a /fi.ligarm commitment for which fair value hedge accounting is applied, the amount accumulated in equity (i.e. hedging reserve) shall be removed and included in the initial amount (cost or other carrying amount) of the asset or the liability hedged (i.e. 'basis adjustment').\n\nWhen a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains  in  equity  and  is  recognized  when  the  forecast transaction is ultimately recognized in the income statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was repo/r\\_t.ligaed in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement. For hedging relationships using forwards as a hedging instrument, where only the change in the value of the spot element is designated as the hedging instrument, accounting for the forward element (pro/fi.ligat or loss vs OCI) is de/fi.liganed case by case. This approach is actually applied by the Group for hedging of currency risk on renewables assets.",

        "page_content": "Conversely, hedging relationships using cross currency interest rate swaps as hedging instruments, the Group separates foreign currency basis spread, in designating the hedging derivative, and present them in other comprehensive income (OCI) as hedging costs.\n\nWith speci/fi.ligac regard to cash /fl.ligaow hedges of commodity risk, in order to improve their consistency with the risk management strategy, the Enel Group applies a dynamic hedge accounting approach based on speci/fi.ligac liquidity requirements (the so-called liquidity-based approach).\n\nThis approach requires the designation of hedges through the use of the most liquid derivatives available on the market and replacing them with others that are more e/ff.ligaective in covering the risk in question.\n\nConsistent with the risk management strategy, the liquidity-based approach allows the roll-over of a derivative by replacing it with a new derivative, not only in the event of expiry but also during the hedging relationship, if and only if the new derivative meets both of the following requirements:\n\n- \u203a it represents a best proxy of the old derivative in terms of ranking;\n- \u203a it meets speci/fi.ligac liquidity requirements.\n\nSatisfaction of these requirements is veri/fi.ligaed qua/r\\_t.ligaerly. At the roll-over date, the hedging relationship is not discontinued. Accordingly, sta/r\\_t.ligaing from that date, changes in the e/ff.ligaective fair value of the new derivative will be recognized in equity (the hedging reserve), while changes in the fair value of the old derivative are recognized through pro/fi.ligat or loss.\n\n## Reform of benchmarks for the determination of interest rates and the associated risk\n\n## Overview\n\nInterbank O/ff.ligaered Rates ('IBORs') are benchmark rates at which banks can borrow funds on the interbank market on an unsecured basis for a given period ranging from overnight to 12 months, in a speci/fi.ligac currency.\n\nIn recent years there have been a number of cases of manipulation of these rates by the banks contributing to their calculation. For this reason, regulators around the world have begun a sweeping reform of the benchmarks for the determination of interest rates that includes the replacement of some benchmark indices with alternative risk-free reference rates (the IBOR reform).\n\nIn  a  context  of  signi/fi.ligacant  unce/r\\_t.ligaainty  regarding  the  timing and transition procedures in the various countries,\n\nthe Group is /fi.liganalizing an assessment of the impact of the reform on contracts after having delineated their global scope in terms of their number and nominal value through a census based on data collection from Countries and Business Lines. In addition, contractual amendments are beginning to be implemented gradually in a process that will continue in 2021, although this may vary depending on developments in the reform of benchmarks for determining interest rates and alternative risk-free reference rates associated with market liquidity.\n\n## Derivatives\n\nFor risk management purposes, the Group holds interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps that are mostly designated as cash /fl.ligaow hedging relationships, with only a minority po/r\\_t.ligaion designated as fair value hedges.\n\nInterest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps are essentially indexed to either Euribor or LIBOR in dollars or pounds. The Group's derivative instruments are managed through contracts that are mainly based on framework agreements de/fi.liganed by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA).\n\nThe ISDA has revised its standardized contracts in light of the benchmark reform and plans to amend the 2006 ISDA de/fi.liganitions relating to /fl.ligaoating rates to include replacement clauses (fallbacks) that would apply upon the permanent discontinuation of ce/r\\_t.ligaain key IBORs. The ISDA has published a supplement to amend the ISDA 2006 de/fi.liganitions (the ISDA Fallback Supplement) and a protocol to facilitate multilateral amendments to include the amended /fl.ligaoating-rate options in derivative transactions entered into prior to the entry into force of the supplement (ISDA Fallback Protocol). The Group is evaluating whether or not to adopt to this protocol, monitoring whether other counterpa/r\\_t.ligaies are doing so. In the event of a change in the plan or if ce/r\\_t.ligaain counterpa/r\\_t.ligaies do not adopt the protocol, the Group would negotiate bilaterally with them about the inclusion of new fallback clauses.\n\n## Hedging relationships\n\nThe Group has assessed the impact of unce/r\\_t.ligaainty engendered by the IBOR reform on hedging relationships at December 31, 2020 with reference to both hedging instruments and hedged items. Both the hedged items and the Group's hedging instruments will change their parameterization from interbank market-based benchmarks (IBORs) to alternative risk-free rates (RFRs) as a result of the contractual amendments that will take e/ff.ligaect in 2021.

        "page_content": "speci/fi.ligacally, for hedging instruments indexed to Euribor, the replacement rate will be based on the Euro STR (Euro Sho/r\\_t.liga-Term Rate), while those indexed to LIBOR in dollars and pounds will be indexed to SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate) and SONIA (Sterling Overnight Index Average), respectively.\n\nThe most signi/fi.ligacant exposure of the Group is to Euribor, together with signi/fi.ligacant exposures to LIBOR in pounds and dollars as well. However, it is ce/r\\_t.ligaainly on the euro side that the unce/r\\_t.ligaainty surrounding the replacement process is greatest.\n\nHowever, even if the Group expects the benchmark rates based on interbank markets to be discontinued after the end of 2021, there is unce/r\\_t.ligaainty about the timing and procedures for replacing these indices for both hedged items and hedging instruments. The Group is therefore applying the amendments to IFRS 9 issued in September 2019 to hedging relationships directly impacted by the IBOR reform.\n\nThe  hedging  relationships  a/ff.ligaected  by  the  IBOR  reform could  become  ine/ff.ligaective  owing  to  the  expectations  of market players regarding the moment in which the transition from the benchmarks for determining interest rates based on interbank markets to alternative rates will take place. This transition could occur at di/ff.ligaerent times for hedged items and hedging instruments and lead to ine/ff.ligaectiveness. In any case, the Group will work to implement the replacements at the same time.\n\nThe exposure of the Enel Group to hedging relationships impacted by the IBOR reform, for which the exceptions provided for in the amendments to IFRS 9 issued in September 2019 were applied, amounts to \u20ac9,434 million in terms of the notional amount of the hedging instruments at December 31, 2020.

        "page_content": "At December 31, 2020 the notional amount of trading derivatives on interest rates came to \u20ac200 million. The net negative fair value of \u20ac90 million increased by \u20ac7 million on the previous year, mainly due to developments in the yield curve.\n\nAt December 31, 2020, the notional amount of derivatives on exchange rates was \u20ac4,513 million. The overall decrease in their notional value and the increase in the associated net positive fair value of \u20ac43 million mainly re/fl.ligaected normal operations and developments in exchange rates.\n\nAt December 31, 2020, the notional amount of derivatives on commodities came to \u20ac42,802 million. The fair value of trading derivatives on commodities classi/fi.ligaed as assets mainly re/fl.ligaects the market valuation of hedges of gas and oil amounting to \u20ac2,354 million and derivatives on power amounting to \u20ac113 million.\n\nThe fair value of trading derivatives on commodities classi/fi.ligaed as liabilities mainly regards hedges of gas and oil amounting  to  \u20ac2,206  million  and  derivatives  on  power amounting to \u20ac458 million.\n\nThe 'other' category includes hedges using weather derivatives. In addition to commodity risk, the Group companies are also exposed to changes in volumes associated with weather conditions (for example, temperature impacts the consumption of gas and power).\n\nEmbedded derivatives, which are held by Enel Green Power No/r\\_t.ligah America, mainly regard supplementary /fi.liganancial clauses in more complex tax equity pa/r\\_t.liganership agreements, which are used to /fi.liganance investment in new renewables capacity.\n\nDerivatives at fair value through pro/fi.ligat or loss include transactions managed within the trading po/r\\_t.ligafolios and transactions that, although established for hedging purposes, did not meet the requirements for hedge accounting.\n\n## Measurement at fair value\n\n## 48. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value\n\nThe Group determines fair value in accordance with IFRS 13 whenever such measurement is required by the IFRS as a recognition or measurement criterion.\n\nFair value is de/fi.liganed as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction, between market pa/r\\_t.ligaicipants, at the measurement date (i.e. an exit price).\n\nThe best proxy of fair value is market price, i.e. the current publically available price actually used on a liquid and active market.\n\nThe fair value of assets and liabilities is classi/fi.ligaed in accordance with the three-level hierarchy described below,\n\ndepending on the inputs and valuation techniques used in determining their fair value:\n\n- \u203a Level 1, where the fair value is determined on basis of quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date;\n- \u203a Level 2, where the fair value is determined on basis of inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (such as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices);\n- \u203a Level 3, where the fair value is determined on the basis of unobservable inputs.\n\nThis  note  also  provides  detailed  disclosures  concerning the valuation techniques and inputs used to pe/r\\_f.ligaorm these measurements.\n\nTo that end:\n\n- \u203a recurring fair value measurements of assets or liabilities are those required or permi/t\\_t.ligaed by the IFRS in the statement of /fi.liganancial position at the close of each period;\n- \u203a non-recurring fair value measurements are those required or permi/t\\_t.ligaed by the IFRS in the statement of /fi.liganancial position in pa/r\\_t.ligaicular circumstances.\n\nFor general information or speci/fi.ligac disclosures on the accounting  treatment  of  these  circumstances,  please  see note 2 'Accounting policies'.\n\n## 48.1 Assets measured at fair value in the statement of /fi.liganancial position\n\nThe following table shows, for each class of assets measured at fair value on a recurring or non-recurring basis in the statement of /fi.liganancial position, the fair value measurement at the end of the repo/r\\_t.ligaing period and the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurements of those assets are classi/fi.ligaed.",

Fair value was estimated as the net replacement cost based on the most recent rate information available and on the general price index for the Brazilian market.\n\n'Loan assets and other /fi.liganancial assets measured at fair value' essentially regard investments of liquidity. Their fair value is determined using Level 1 or Level 2 market inputs. The fair value of derivative contracts is determined using\n\nthe o/ffi.ligacial prices for instruments traded on regulated markets. The fair value of instruments not listed on a regulated market is determined using valuation methods appropriate for each type of /fi.liganancial instrument and market data as of the end of the repo/r\\_t.ligaing period (such as interest rates, exchange  rates,  volatility),  discounting  expected  future cash /fl.ligaows on the basis of the market yield curve and translating amounts in currencies other than the euro using exchange rates provided by the World Markets Re/fi.liganitiv (WMR) Company.\n\nDerivatives on interest rates and exchange rates are all measured using Level 2 inputs.\n\nThe  fair  value  of  derivatives  on  commodities  is  almost always measured using Level 1 or Level 2 inputs, as the determination is based on market inputs as these contracts are  entered  into  with  exchange  counterpa/r\\_t.ligaies,  leading sector operators or /fi.liganancial institutions.\n\nMarginal exceptions for both cash /fl.ligaow hedges and trading transactions include ce/r\\_t.ligaain derivatives relating to weather derivatives, which are measured on the basis of ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligaed hi-\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

Share-based payments\n\nLong-term incentive plans, described below, are pa/r\\_t.liga of the Remuneration Policy adopted by the Group and described in the section 'Incentive system' in the Repo/r\\_t.liga on Operations.\n\nPlan bene/fi.ligaciaries are the Chief Executive O/ffi.ligacer/General Manager of Enel and Group managers in the positions most directly responsible for company pe/r\\_f.ligaormance or conside-\n\nred to be of strategic interest. The plans provide for the award to the bene/fi.ligaciaries of a non-transferrable incentive consisting of an equity component (share-based payment transaction) and a monetary component (classi/fi.ligaed as another long-term employee bene/fi.ligat).\n\nFor more details on the accounting treatment of these plans, please see note 2.2 'Signi/fi.ligacant accounting policies'. The following information describes the main characteristics of the share-based incentive plans adopted by Enel outstanding during 2020:\n\n|               | Date of approval   | Grant date   | Pe/r\\_f.ligaormance  period Veri/fi.ligacation of  achievement of   | Pe/r\\_f.ligaormance  period Veri/fi.ligacation of  achievement of   |   targets | targets   | Payout    |\n|---------------|--------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| 2019 LTI Plan | 16.05.2019  (3)    | 12.11.2019   | (4)                                                                | 2019-2021                                                          |      2021 | (5)       | 2022-2023 |\n| 2020 LTI Plan | 14.05.2020  (6)    | 17.09.2020   | (7)                                                                | 2020-2022                                                          |      2022 | (8)       | 2023-2024 |\n\nThe vesting of the incentive envisaged under these plans is subject to the condition that the bene/fi.ligaciaries remain employed with the Group during the vesting period (i.e. the service condition), with a small number of exceptions speci/fi.ligacally governed by the Rules, and that they achieve speci/fi.ligac pe/r\\_f.ligaormance conditions connected with the following three-year pe/r\\_f.ligaormance variables:\n\n- \u203a Enel's average TSR (Total Shareholder Return) (9) compared with the average TSR for the EURO STOXX Utilities - EMU for the three-year reference period (with a weight\n- of 50%);\n- \u203a cumulative  consolidated  ROACE  (Return  on  Average Capital Employed) over the three-year reference period (with a weight of 25% in the 2020 LTI Plan and 40% in the 2019 LTI Plan);\n- \u203a emissions of CO 2 in grams per kWh equivalent produced by the Group in the last year of the three-year reference period (10) (with a weight of 10%);\n- \u203a consolidated net installed renewables capacity as a percentage of total consolidated net installed capacity at the end of the last year of the three-year reference period (only in the 2020 LTI Plan; with a weight of 15%).\n\nThis incentive - determined, at the time of the award, as a base value calculated in relation to the /fi.ligaxed remuneration of the individual bene/fi.ligaciary - may vary depending on\n\nthe degree of achievement of each of the three-year performance targets by the plans, ranging from zero up to a maximum of 280% or 180% of the base value in the case, respectively, of the Chief Executive O/ffi.ligacer/General Manager or the other bene/fi.ligaciaries.\n\nThe plans establish that any bonus vested shall be represented by an equity component, which can be supplemented - depending on the level of achievement of the various targets - by a cash component. More speci/fi.ligacally, the plans envisage that 100% of the base value for the Chief Executive O/ffi.ligacer and General Manager and 50% of the base value for key management personnel will be paid in Enel shares previously acquired by the Company for the amount of the award that has e/ff.ligaectively vested. This equity component represents a share-based payment transaction se/t\\_t.ligaled with equity instruments.\n\nIf the targets have been achieved, the disbursement of a signi/fi.ligacant po/r\\_t.ligaion of the equity and cash components of the vested incentive (70% of the total) is deferred to the second year following the three-year pe/r\\_f.ligaormance period covered by the plans, without prejudice to the bene/fi.ligaciaries' right to request deferred payment of the entire incentive.",

Contingent assets and liabilities\n\nThe following repo/r\\_t.ligas the main contingent assets and liabilities at December 31, 2020, which are not recognized in the consolidated /fi.liganancial statements as they do not meet the requirements provided for in IAS 37.\n\n## Brindisi Sud thermal generation plant - Criminal proceedings against Enel employees\n\nA criminal proceeding was held before the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Brindisi concerning the Brindisi Sud thermal plant in which a number of employees of Enel Produzione - cited as a liable party in civil litigation - have been accused of causing criminal damage and dumping hazardous substances with regard to the alleged contamination of land adjacent to the plant with coal dust as a result of actions between 1999 and 2011. At the end of 2013, the accusations were extended to cover 2012 and 2013. As pa/r\\_t.liga of the proceeding, injured pa/r\\_t.ligaies, including the Province and City of Brindisi, have submi/t\\_t.ligaed claims for total damages of about \u20ac1.4 billion. In its decision of October 26, 2016, the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Brindisi: (i) acqui/t\\_t.ligaed nine of the thi/r\\_t.ligaeen defendants (all employees of Enel Produzione) for not having commi/t\\_t.ligaed the o/ff.ligaense; (ii) ruled that it did not have to proceed as the o/ff.ligaense was time-barred for two of the defendants; and (iii) convicted the remaining two defendants, sentencing them with all the allowances provided for by law to nine months' imprisonment. With regard to payment of damages, the Cou/r\\_t.liga's ruling also: (i) denied all claims of public pa/r\\_t.ligaies and associations acting in the criminal proceeding to recover damages; and (ii) granted most of the claims /fi.ligaled by the private pa/r\\_t.ligaies acting to recover damages, referring the la/t\\_t.ligaer to the civil cou/r\\_t.ligas for quanti/fi.ligacation without granting a provisional award. The convicted defendants and the civil defendant, Enel Produzione, as well as by one of the two employees for whom the expiry of the period of limitations had been declared, appealed the conviction. In a ruling issued on February 8, 2019, the Lecce Cou/r\\_t.liga of Appeal: (i) con/fi.ligarmed the trial cou/r\\_t.liga ruling regarding the criminal convictions of two Enel Produzione executives; (ii) denied the claims for damages of some private appellants; (iii) granted some claims for damages, which had been denied in the trial cou/r\\_t.liga, referring the pa/r\\_t.ligaies, like the others - whose claims had been granted by the trial cou/r\\_t.liga - to the civil cou/r\\_t.ligas for quanti/fi.ligacation, without granting a provisional award; (iv) con/fi.ligarmed for the rest the ruling of the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Brindisi except for extending litigation costs to the Province of Brindisi, which had not been awarded damages at either the trial cou/r\\_t.liga or on appeal.\n\nWith a subsequent ruling, the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Appeal of Lecce granted the appeal lodged by the Province of Brindisi against the ruling, acknowledging that a material error had been made and therefore recognizing the generic entitlement of the Province to damages. The defendants /fi.ligaled an appeal against ruling with the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Cassation on June 22, 2019. The hearing initially scheduled for April 24, 2020 was postponed until October 1, 2020 owing to the COVID-19 health emergency. On that date, the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Cassation voided the ruling of the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Appeal of Lecce, with referral to another section of the same cou/r\\_t.liga for a new proceeding.\n\nCriminal proceedings are also under way before the Courts of Reggio Calabria and Vibo Valentia against a number of employees of Enel Produzione for the o/ff.ligaense of illegal waste disposal in connection with alleged violations concerning the disposal of waste from the Brindisi plant. Enel Produzione has not been cited as a liable pa/r\\_t.ligay for civil damages.\n\nThe criminal proceedings before the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Reggio Calabria ended with the hearing of June 23, 2016. The cou/r\\_t.liga acqui/t\\_t.ligaed nearly all of the Enel defendants of the main charges because no crime was commi/t\\_t.ligaed. Just one case was dismissed under the statute of limitations. Similarly, all of the remaining charges involving minor o/ff.ligaenses were dismissed under the statute of limitations. The proceedings before the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Vibo Valentia are still pending and are currently in the testimony phase, as the cou/r\\_t.liga ruled that the o/ff.ligaenses could not be dismissed under the statute of limitations. At a hearing on February 24, 2020, the Prosecution's expe/r\\_t.liga witness testi/fi.ligaed. Following the postponement of hearings in all criminal and civil proceedings as pa/r\\_t.liga of the measures to counter COVID-19, the hearings in this case resumed on September 7, 2020, when a number of the witnesses of the co-defendants testi/fi.ligaed. On October 22, 2020, an additional hearing was held to hear witness testimony. Arguments were initially scheduled to continue on November 19, 2020. However, due to the persistence of the health emergency, the hearing was then postponed to January 14, 2021, the date on which the legal counsel of the defendants were heard. The arguments of the public prosecutor and the civil pa/r\\_t.ligaies were heard on February 4, 2021, while the discussion of the defense being scheduled for March 18 and 25, 2021.\n\n## Enel Energia and Servizio Ele/t\\_t.ligarico Nazionale antitrust proceeding\n\nOn May 11, 2017, the Competition Authority announced the beginning proceedings for alleged abuse of a dominant position against Enel SpA (Enel), Enel Energia SpA (EE) and Servizio Ele/t\\_t.ligarico Nazionale SpA (SEN), with the concomitant pe/r\\_f.ligaormance of inspections.

        "page_content": "initiated on the basis of complaints /fi.ligaled by the Italian Association of Energy Wholesalers and Traders (AIGET) and the company Green Network SpA (GN), as well as a number of complaints from individual consumers. According to the charges /fi.ligaled by the Competition Authority, the Enel Group, as an integrated pa/r\\_t.ligaicipant in the distribution and sale of power on the regulated market and at a crucial phase of the liberalization of retail markets for residential and nonresidential low-voltage customers, engaged in an exclusionary strategy, using a series of non-replicable commercial stratagems capable of hindering its non-integrated competitors to the bene/fi.ligat of the Group company operating on the free market (EE).\n\nOn December 20, 2018 the Competition Authority issued its /fi.liganal ruling, subsequently noti/fi.ligaed to the pa/r\\_t.ligaies on January 8, 2019, with which it levied a /fi.ligane on Enel SpA, SEN and EE of \u20ac93,084,790.50, for abuse of a dominant position in violation of A/r\\_t.ligaicle 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).\n\nThe disputed conduct consisted in the adoption of a strategy to exclude competitors from the free market for retail power supply on the pa/r\\_t.liga of the Group's operating companies, in pa/r\\_t.ligaicular EE, who used the privacy consent given by consumers to channel their o/ff.ligaers within the Group in order to contact SEN customers who were still being served on the regulated market.\n\nWith regard to other allegations made with the measure to initiate the proceeding, concerning the organization and pe/r\\_f.ligaormance of sales activities at physical locations (Enel Points and Enel Point Pa/r\\_t.liganer Shops) and winback policies repo/r\\_t.ligaed by GN, the Competition Authority reached the conclusion that the preliminary /fi.ligandings did not provide su/ffi.ligacient evidence of any abusive conduct on the pa/r\\_t.liga of Enel Group companies.\n\nThe companies involved /fi.ligaled an appeal to void the ruling before the Lazio Regional Administrative Cou/r\\_t.liga. The decision of that cou/r\\_t.liga, /fi.ligaled on October 17, 2019, pa/r\\_t.ligaially upheld the appeals /fi.ligaled by SEN and EE, declaring that the abusive conduct had been engaged in for a period of 1 year and 9 months, rather than the original period of 5 years and 5 months referred to in the penalty ruling of the Competition Authority and requiring that authority to recalculate the penalty in accordance with the criteria speci/fi.ligaed in the ruling. At the same time, the Regional Administrative Cou/r\\_t.liga denied Enel's appeal concerning solely the reasons for the alleged joint and several liability of the Parent with SEN and EE, therefore without an autonomous /fi.liganancial impact on the recalculation of the penalty. With a measure November\n\n27, 2019, the Competition Authority set the recalculated penalty at \u20ac27,529,786.46.\n\nThe rulings of the Regional Administrative Cou/r\\_t.liga were challenged on appeal before the Council of State by the three Enel Group companies and a precautionary request was presented to the Council of State asking for the suspension of the measure for recalculating the penalty levied by the Competition Authority. At the pre-trial hearing, held on February 20, 2020, this petition was not discussed in consideration of the supervening action of the Council of State to set a date for the hearing of the arguments in the dispute for May 21, 2020.\n\nWith an order of July 20, 2020, the Council of State (accepting a subordinate petition from the counsel defending the three companies), after the joinder of the three judgments, suspended the ruling and ordered that the issue be submi/t\\_t.ligaed for a preliminary ruling before the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) pursuant to A/r\\_t.ligaicle 267 of the TFEU, formulating a number of questions aimed at clarifying the interpretation of the concept of 'abuse of a dominant position' to be applied to the present case. On September 11 and 18, 2020, the CJEU noti/fi.ligaed EE and SEN and Enel, respectively, of the initiation of a proceeding pursuant to A/r\\_t.ligaicle 267 of the TFEU. The companies then /fi.ligaled briefs and are now waiting for the proceeding to continue. Pending the opening of the proceedings before the CJEU, Enel, EE and SEN /fi.ligaled an additional precautionary petition to the Council of State asking for the suspension of the enforceability of the contested ruling of the Regional Administrative Cou/r\\_t.liga and the measure recalculating the penalty. Following the precautionary hearing on November 11, 2020, with three separate orders with identical content - published on November 16 - the Council of State granted the request for suspension /fi.ligaled by the Enel companies and, as a guarantee of payment of the penalty in the event of an unfavorable /fi.liganal ruling for Enel, required the issue of a /fi.ligarst demand surety in favor of the Competition Authority in an amount equal to that of the penalty suspended with the precautionary orders.\n\nSubsequently, with a separate ruling, the Council of State also set the date of the /fi.liganal trial session of the appeal for November 11, 2021, believing that the suspended proceeding could be resumed by that date. The Company is therefore still awaiting the /fi.liganal decision.\n\n## BEG litigation\n\nFollowing an arbitration proceeding initiated by BEG SpA in Italy, Enelpower SpA obtained a ruling in its favor in 2002,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

Subsequently, BEG, acting through its subsidiary Albania BEG Ambient Shpk (ABA), an Albanian company, /fi.ligaled suit against Enelpower and Enel SpA concerning the ma/t\\_t.ligaer, obtaining a ruling from the District Cou/r\\_t.liga of Tirana, upheld by the Albanian Cou/r\\_t.liga of Cassation, ordering Enelpower and Enel to pay to/r\\_t.ligaious damages of about \u20ac25 million for 2004 as well as an unspeci/fi.ligaed amount of to/r\\_t.ligaious damages for subsequent years. Following the ruling, ABA demanded payment of more than \u20ac430 million from Enel.\n\nWith a ruling of June 16, 2015, the /fi.ligarst level of adjudication was completed in the additional suit lodged by Enelpower and Enel with the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Rome asking the Cou/r\\_t.liga to ascertain the liability of BEG for having evaded compliance with the arbitration ruling issued in Italy in favor of Enelpower through the legal action taken by ABA. With this action, Enelpower and Enel asked the Cou/r\\_t.liga to /fi.ligand BEG liable and order it to pay damages in the amount that they could be required to pay to ABA in the event of the enforcement of the ruling issued by the Albanian cou/r\\_t.ligas. With the ruling, the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Rome found that BEG did not have standing to be sued, or alternatively, that the request was not admissible for lack of an interest for Enel and Enelpower to sue, as the Albanian ruling had not yet been declared enforceable in any cou/r\\_t.liga. The Cou/r\\_t.liga ordered the se/t\\_t.ligaing o/ff.liga of cou/r\\_t.liga costs. Enel and Enelpower appealed the ruling before the Rome Cou/r\\_t.liga of Appeal, asking that it be ove/r\\_t.ligaurned in full. The hearing scheduled for February 18, 2021 was postponed until November 11, 2021.\n\nOn November 5, 2016, Enel and Enelpower /fi.ligaled a petition with the Albanian Cou/r\\_t.liga of Cassation, asking for the ruling issued by the District Cou/r\\_t.liga of Tirana on March 24, 2009 to be voided. The proceeding is still pending.\n\n## Proceedings unde/r\\_t.ligaaken by Albania BEG Ambient Shpk (ABA) to obtain enforcement of the ruling of the District Cou/r\\_t.liga of Tirana of March 24, 2009\n\nABA had initiated two proceedings requesting recognition and enforcement of the Albanian ruling before the cou/r\\_t.ligas of the State of New York and Ireland, which both ruled in favor of Enel and Enelpower, respectively, on February 23 and February 26, 2018. Accordingly, there are no lawsuits pending in Ireland or New York State.\n\n## France\n\nIn February 2012, ABA /fi.ligaled suit against Enel and Enelpower with the Tribunal de Grande Instance in Paris (TGI) in order to render the ruling of the Albanian cou/r\\_t.liga enforceable in France. Enel SpA and Enelpower SpA challenged the suit.\n\nFollowing the beginning of the case before the TGI, again\n\nat the initiative of ABA, between 2012 and 2013 Enel France was served with two ' Saise Conservatoire de Cr\u00e9ances ' (orders for the precautionary a/t\\_t.ligaachment of receivables) to conserve any receivables of Enel in respect of Enel France. On January 29, 2018, the TGI issued a ruling in favor of Enel and Enelpower, denying ABA the recognition and enforcement of the Tirana cou/r\\_t.liga's ruling in France for lack of the requirements under French law for the purposes of granting exequatur . Among other issues, the TGI ruled that: (i) the Albanian ruling con/fl.ligaicted with an existing decision, in this case the arbitration ruling of 2002 and that (ii) the fact that BEG sought to obtain in Albania what it was not able to obtain in the Italian arbitration proceeding, resubmi/t\\_t.ligaing the same claim through ABA, represented fraud. ABA appealed the ruling. The hearing before the Paris Cou/r\\_t.liga of Appeal was held on February 2, 2021 and a ruling is pending.\n\n## The Netherlands\n\nAt the end of July 2014, ABA /fi.ligaled suit with the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Amsterdam to render the ruling of the Albanian cou/r\\_t.liga enforceable in the Netherlands. On June 29, 2016, the cou/r\\_t.liga /fi.ligaled its judgment, which: (i) ruled that the Albanian ruling meet the requirements for recognition and enforcement in the Netherlands; (ii) ordered Enel and Enelpower to pay \u20ac433,091,870.00 to ABA, in addition to costs and ancillary charges of \u20ac60,673.78; and (iii) denied ABA's request to declare the ruling provisionally enforceable.\n\nOn June 29, 2016, Enel and Enelpower /fi.ligaled appeals against the /fi.ligarst-level ruling of the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Amsterdam issued on the same date. On September 27, 2016, ABA also appealed the cou/r\\_t.liga's ruling of June 29, 2016, to request the reversal of its pa/r\\_t.ligaial loss on the merits. On April 11, 2017, the Amsterdam Cou/r\\_t.liga of Appeal granted the request of Enel and Enelpower to join to two pending appeals.\n\nIn a ruling of July 17, 2018, the Amsterdam Cou/r\\_t.liga of Appeal upheld the appeal advanced by Enel and Enelpower, ruling that the Albanian judgment cannot be recognized and enforced in the Netherlands. The Cou/r\\_t.liga of Appeal found that the Albanian decision was arbitrary and manifestly unreasonable and therefore contrary to Dutch public order. For these reasons, the cou/r\\_t.liga did not consider it necessary to analyze the additional arguments of Enel and Enelpower.\n\nThe proceeding before the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Appeal continued with regard to the subordinate question raised by ABA in the appeal proceedings, with which it is asking the cou/r\\_t.liga to rule on the merits of the dispute in Albania and in pa/r\\_t.ligaicular the alleged non-contractual liability of Enel and Enelpower in the failure to build the plant in Albania. On December 3, 2019, the Amsterdam Cou/r\\_t.liga of Appeal issued a ruling in which it quashed the trial cou/r\\_t.liga judgment of June 29, 2016, rejecting any claim made by ABA.

Enel and Enelpower are therefore not liable to pay any amount to ABA, which was in fact ordered by the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Appeal to reimburse the appellant companies for the losses incurred in illegitimate conservative seizures, to be quanti/fi.ligaed as pa/r\\_t.liga of a speci/fi.ligac procedure, and the costs of the trial and appeal proceedings. On March 3, 2020, ABA /fi.ligaled an appeal with the Supreme Cou/r\\_t.liga of the Netherlands against the ruling of the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Appeal. On April 3, 2020, Enel and Enelpower appeared before the Supreme Cou/r\\_t.liga. Following the exchange of briefs between the pa/r\\_t.ligaies, on July 17, 2020 the Supreme Cou/r\\_t.liga ordered the Advocate General to issue an opinion on the case. On February 5, 2021, the Advocate General issued an opinion favorable to Enel and Enelpower, calling for the denial the appeal /fi.ligaled by ABA. On February 19, 2021, ABA submi/t\\_t.ligaed a response to the opinion of the Advocate General. The issuance of the decision is pending.\n\n## Luxembourg\n\nIn Luxembourg, again at the initiative of ABA, J.P. Morgan Bank Luxembourg SA was also served with an order for the precautionary a/t\\_t.ligaachment of any receivables of Enel SpA. In parallel ABA /fi.ligaled a claim to obtain enforcement of the ruling of the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Tirana in that country. The proceeding is still under way and briefs are being exchanged between the pa/r\\_t.ligaies. No ruling has been issued.\n\n## Environmental incentives - Spain\n\nFollowing the Decision of the European Commission of November 27, 2017 on the issue of environmental incentives for thermal power plants, the European Commission's Directorate-General for Competition opened an investigation pursuant to A/r\\_t.ligaicle 108, paragraph 2, of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) in order to assess whether the environmental incentive for coal power plants  provided  for  in  Order  ITC/3860/2007  represents State aid compatible with the internal market. According to a literal interpretation of that Decision, the Commission reached the preliminary conclusion that the incentive in question would constitute State aid pursuant to A/r\\_t.ligaicle 107, paragraph 1, of the TFEU, expressing doubts about the compatibility of the incentive with the internal market while recognizing that the incentives are in line with the European Union's environmental policy. On April 13, 2018, Endesa Generaci\u00f3n SA, acting as an interested third pa/r\\_t.ligay, submitted comments contesting this interpretation, while on July\n\n30, 2018, it was learned that Gas Natural had appealed the decision of the Commission.\n\n## Bono Social - Spain\n\nWith the rulings of October 24 and 25, 2016 and November 2, 2016, the Spanish Supreme Cou/r\\_t.liga declared A/r\\_t.ligaicle 45.4 of the Electricity Industry Law no. 24 of December 26, 2013 void for incompatibility with Directive 2009/72/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of July 13, 2009, granting the appeals /fi.ligaled by Endesa against the obligation to /fi.liganance the ' Bono Social ' (Social Bonus) mechanism. The Supreme Cou/r\\_t.liga recognized Endesa's right to receive all amounts that had been paid to users, in addition to legal interest (equal to about \u20ac214 million), under the ' Bono Social ' system, provided for in the law declared void by the Supreme Cou/r\\_t.liga. The government challenged these rulings of the Supreme Cou/r\\_t.liga, requesting that they be ove/r\\_t.ligaurned, but the related appeals were denied. Subsequently, the government initiated two proceedings before the Constitutional Cou/r\\_t.liga requesting the reopening of the Supreme Cou/r\\_t.liga proceedings so that the la/t\\_t.ligaer may ask for a preliminary ruling from the European Cou/r\\_t.liga of Justice (CJEU). The Constitutional Cou/r\\_t.liga granted the appeals and a preliminary ruling on the petition before the CJEU is pending. The government has not requested the repayment of any sum so far.\n\nThe CJEU had initially set the date for oral arguments of the preliminary question as October 8, 2020. Following the adoption of COVID-19 containment measures, the CJEU canceled this hearing, replacing it with the submission of wri/t\\_t.ligaen arguments. All pa/r\\_t.ligaies, including Endesa, presented their respective wri/t\\_t.ligaen arguments by the deadline of November 13, 2020.\n\n## 'Endesa I' industrial relations dispute - Spain\n\nAfter a series of meetings of the Comisi\u00f3n Negociadora of the 5th Endesa Collective Bargaining Agreement ( Comisi\u00f3n Negociadora ) which began in October 2017 and continued throughout 2018, in view of the impossibility of reaching an agreement between the social pa/r\\_t.liganers, Endesa noti/fi.ligaed the workers and their union representatives that, with e/ff.ligaect from January 1, 2019, the 4th Collective Bargaining Agreement must be considered terminated under the terms of the 'framework guarantee contract' and the 'agreement on the voluntary suspension or resolution of employment contracts in the period 2013-2018', applying from that date the provisions of general labor law, as well as the applicable legal criteria established in the ma/t\\_t.ligaer.\n\nDespite the resumption of negotiations within the Comi-\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

On March 13, 2019 a hearing was held before the cou/r\\_t.liga of /fi.ligarst instance, which on March 26, 2019, issued a ruling in favor of Endesa, upholding the company's position concerning the legitimacy of abolishing ce/r\\_t.ligaain social bene/fi.ligats for retired personnel as a consequence of the termination of the 4th Endesa Collective Bargaining Agreement. The unions appealed this decision before the Supreme Cou/r\\_t.liga, while the initial ruling remains provisionally enforceable. On June 19, 2019, Endesa submi/t\\_t.ligaed its defense. In order to submit the dispute to arbitration, in December 2019, Endesa's largest union agreed to waive its appeal before the Supreme Cou/r\\_t.liga against the ruling of the cou/r\\_t.liga of /fi.ligarst instance of March 26, 2019. The other trade unions involved refused to join the arbitration proceeding, electing to go ahead with the proceedings before the Supreme Cou/r\\_t.liga.\n\nOn January 21, 2020, the arbitration award was issued, with the amendment of the corresponding pa/r\\_t.ligas of the 5th Endesa Collective Bargaining Agreement, which was subsequently signed by the social pa/r\\_t.liganers. It entered force on January 23, 2020. On the same date, Endesa also signed two  fu/r\\_t.ligaher collective  bargaining  agreements  (a  'framework guarantee contract' and an 'agreement on voluntary measures to suspend or terminate employment contracts') with all the unions present in the company. On June 17, 2020, 5th Endesa Collective Bargaining Agreement was published in the Spanish O/ffi.ligacial Journal ( Bolet\u00edn O/fi.ligacial del Estado ), taking full e/ff.ligaect.\n\nIn view of the foregoing, the proceedings before the Supreme Cou/r\\_t.liga continue at the request of the three minority unions that had initially initiated the action together with the most representative union.\n\nIn parallel, numerous individual actions have been /fi.ligaled by retired  sta/ff.liga  and  former  employees  who  had  agreed  to pa/r\\_t.ligaicipate in termination incentive agreements in order to obtain judicial con/fi.ligarmation that the termination of the 4th Endesa Collective Bargaining Agreement did not a/ff.ligaect them. Currently, the majority of these proceedings have been suspended or are being suspended, pending the de/fi.liganition of the collective action pending before the Supreme Cou/r\\_t.liga, on whose outcome these proceedings depend.\n\n## 'Endesa II' industrial relations dispute - Spain\n\nOn December 30, 2020, the Audiencia Nacional noti/fi.ligaed Endesa  a  petition  for  a  'collective  dispute'  initiated  by three trade unions with minority representation /fi.ligaled on December 16, 2020 concerning the cancellation of some 'derogatory provisions' of the 5th Endesa Collective Bargaining Agreement. The plainti/ff.ligas claim that the contested 'derogatory provisions' would imply the illegitimate abolition of social bene/fi.ligats and economic rights of workers. Endesa considers these provisions to be fully legitimate, in line with the arguments made during proceeding concerning the reduction of social bene/fi.ligats for retired personnel (ruling of the cou/r\\_t.liga of /fi.ligarst instance of March 26, 2019, now under appeal before the Supreme Cou/r\\_t.liga). The conciliation hearing is scheduled for June 23, 2021.\n\n## Furnas-Tractebel litigation - Brazil\n\nIn 1998 the Brazilian company CIEN (now Enel CIEN) signed an agreement with Tractebel for the delivery of electricity from Argentina through its Argentina-Brazil interconnection line. As a result of Argentine regulatory changes introduced as a consequence of the economic crisis in 2002, CIEN was unable to make the electricity available to Tractebel.\n\nIn October 2009, Tractebel sued CIEN, which submi/t\\_t.ligaed its defense. CIEN cited force majeure as a result of the Argentine crisis as the main argument in its defense. Out of cou/r\\_t.liga, the Tractebel has indicated that it plans to acquire 30% of the interconnection line involved in the dispute. On February 14, 2019, CIEN received notice of an order beginning expe/r\\_t.liga witness operation, which is still pending. The amount involved in the dispute is estimated at about R$118 million (about \u20ac28 million), plus unspeci/fi.ligaed damages.\n\nFor analogous reasons, in May 2010 Furnas had also /fi.ligaled suit against CIEN for failure to deliver electricity, requesting payment of about R$520 million (about \u20ac124 million), in addition to unspeci/fi.ligaed damages, seeking to acquire ownership (in this case 70%) of the interconnection line. The proceeding was decided in CIEN's favor with a ruling of the Tribunal de Justi\u00e7a with a de/fi.liganitive ruling of October 18, 2019, which denied all of the claims of Furnas.\n\n## Cibran litigation - Brazil\n\nCompanhia Brasileira de Antibi\u00f3ticos (Cibran) has /fi.ligaled six suits against the Enel Group company Ampla Energia e Servi\u00e7os SA (Ampla) (16) to obtain damages for alleged losses incurred as a result of the interruption of electricity service by the Brazilian distribution company between 1987 and",

The Cou/r\\_t.liga ordered a uni/fi.ligaed technical appraisal for those cases, the /fi.ligandings of which were pa/r\\_t.ligaly unfavorable to Ampla. The latter challenged the /fi.ligandings, asking for a new study, which led to the denial of pa/r\\_t.liga of Cibran's petitions. Cibran subsequently appealed the decision and the ruling was in favor of Ampla.\n\nThe /fi.ligarst suit, /fi.ligaled in 1999 and regarding the years from 1995 to 1999, was adjudicated in September 2014 when the cou/r\\_t.liga of /fi.ligarst instance issued a ruling against Ampla, levying a /fi.ligane of about R$200,000 (about \u20ac46,000) as well as other damages to be quanti/fi.ligaed at a later stage. Ampla appealed the ruling and the appeal was upheld by the Tribunal de Justi\u00e7a . In response, on December 16, 2016, Cibran /fi.ligaled an appeal (recurso especial) before the Superior Tribunal de Justi\u00e7a , which was denied on June 19, 2020. The ruling became de/fi.liganitive on August 24, 2020.\n\nWith regard to the second case, /fi.ligaled in 2006 and regarding the years from 1987 to 1994, on June 1, 2015, the cou/r\\_t.ligas issued  a  ruling  ordering  Ampla  to  pay  R$80,000  Brazilian (about \u20ac19,000) in non-pecuniary damages as well as R$96,465,103 (about \u20ac23 million) in pecuniary damages, plus interest. On July 8, 2015 Ampla appealed the decision with the Tribunal de Justi\u00e7a of Rio de Janeiro, which on November 6, 2019 issued a ruling granting Ampla's petition and denying all of Cibran's claims. On November 25, 2019, Cibran /fi.ligaled an appeal against the ruling of the Tribunal de Justi\u00e7a of Rio de Janeiro, which was preliminarily denied on September 10, 2020. On January 29, 2021 Cibran appealed the decisions before the Superior Tribunal de Justi\u00e7 a. Decisions at /fi.ligarst instance are still pending with regard to the remaining four suits for the years 2001 and 2002. The value of all the disputes is estimated at about R$605 million (about \u20ac103 million).\n\n## Coperva litigation - Brazil\n\nAs pa/r\\_t.liga of the project to expand the grid in rural areas of Brazil, in 1982 Companhia Energ\u00e9tica do Cear\u00e1 SA (Coelce), then owned by the Brazilian government and now an Enel Group company, had entered into contracts for the use of the grids of a number of cooperatives established speci/fi.ligacally to pursue the expansion project. The contracts provided for the payment of a monthly fee by Coelce, which was also required to maintain the networks.\n\nThose contracts, between cooperatives established in special circumstances and the then public-sector company,\n\ndo not speci/fi.ligacally identify the grids governed by the agreements, which has prompted a number of the cooperatives to sue Coelce asking for, among other things, a revision of the fees agreed in the contracts.\n\nThese actions include the suit /fi.ligaled by Cooperativa de Eletri/fi.ligaca\u00e7\u00e3o Rural do Vale do Acarau Ltda (Coperva) with a value of about R$310 million (about \u20ac53 million). Coelce was granted rulings in its favor from the trial cou/r\\_t.liga and the cou/r\\_t.liga of appeal, but Coperva /fi.ligaled a fu/r\\_t.ligaher appeal ( Embargo de Declara\u00e7\u00e3o ) based on procedural issues, which was also denied by the appeal cou/r\\_t.liga in a ruling of January 11, 2016. On February 3, 2016, Coperva lodged an extraordinary appeal before the Superior Tribunal de Justi\u00e7a (the cou/r\\_t.liga of third instance) against the appeal cou/r\\_t.liga ruling on the merits, which was granted on November 5, 2018 for the ruling issued in the previous appeal ( Embargo de Declara\u00e7\u00e3o ). On December 3, 2018, Enel /fi.ligaled an appeal ( Agravo Interno ) against this ruling of the Superior Tribunal de Justi\u00e7a . The proceedings are currently pending.\n\n## AGM litigation - Brazil\n\nIn  1993,  Celg-D, (17) the  Association  of  Municipalities  of Goi\u00e1s (AGM), the State of Goi\u00e1s and the Banca di Goi\u00e1s reached an agreement ( convenio ) for the payment of municipal debts to Celg-D through the transfer of the po/r\\_t.ligaion of ICMS Imposto sobre Circula\u00e7\u00e3o de Mercadorias e Servi\u00e7os (VAT) that the State would have transferred to those governments. In 2001 the pa/r\\_t.ligaies to the agreement were sued by the individual municipal governments to obtain a ruling that the agreement was invalid, a position then upheld by the Supreme Federal Cou/r\\_t.liga on the grounds of the non-pa/r\\_t.ligaicipation of the local governments themselves in the agreement process. In September 2004, Celg-D reached a se/t\\_t.ligalement with 23 municipalities. Between 2007 and 2008, Celg-D was again sued on numerous occasions (there are currently 90 pending suits) seeking the restitution of amounts paid under the agreement. Despite the ruling that the agreement was void, Celg-D argues that the payment of the debts on the pa/r\\_t.liga of the local governments is legitimate, as electricity was supplied in accordance with the supply contracts and, accordingly, the claims for restitution of amounts paid should be denied.\n\nThe proceedings pending before the Goi\u00e1s State Cou/r\\_t.liga include: (i) a suit /fi.ligaled by the Municipio de Aparecida de Goi\u00e2nia, which is pending at the preliminary stage at /fi.ligarst instance, for an amount of approximately R$624 million\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

With this provision, the Authority ordered the restitution of the value of some components of the network previously included in rates because they were considered non-existent and denied Eletropaulo's request to include additional components in rates. On September 9, 2014, the administrative measure of ANEEL was suspended on a precautionary basis. The /fi.ligarst-instance proceeding is in its preliminary stages and the value of the suit is R$1,093 million (about \u20ac186 million).\n\n## El Quimbo - Colombia\n\nA number of legal actions (' acciones de grupo ' and ' acciones populares ') brought by residents and /fi.ligashermen in the a/ff.ligaected area are pending with regard to the El Quimbo project for the construction of a 400 MW hydroelectric plant in the region of Huila (Colombia). More speci/fi.ligacally, the /fi.ligarst collective action, currently in the preliminary stage, was brought by around 1,140 residents of the municipality of Garz\u00f3n, who claim that the construction of the plant would reduce their business revenue by 30%. A second action was brought, between August 2011 and December 2012, by residents and businesses/associations of /fi.ligave municipalities of Huila claiming damages related to the closing of a bridge (Paso El Colegio). With regard to acciones populares , or class action lawsuits, in 2008 a suit was /fi.ligaled by a number of residents of the area demanding, among other things, that the environmental permit be suspended. As pa/r\\_t.liga of this action, on September 11, 2020, the Huila Cou/r\\_t.liga issued an unfavorable ruling against Emgesa, sentencing it to ful/fi.ligall the obligations already provided for in the environmental li-\n\nense. ANLA has submi/t\\_t.ligaed a request for clari/fi.ligacation of the ruling. Another acci\u00f3n popular was brought by a number of /fi.ligash farming companies over the alleged impact that /fi.ligalling the Quimbo basin would have on /fi.ligashing in the Betania basin downstream from Quimbo. After a number of precautionary rulings, on February 22, 2016, the Huila cou/r\\_t.liga issued a ruling allowing generation to continue for six months. The cou/r\\_t.liga ordered Emgesa to prepare a technical design that would ensure compliance with oxygen level requirements and to provide collateral of about 20,000,000,000 Colombian pesos (about \u20ac5.5 million).\n\nThe Huila cou/r\\_t.liga subsequently extended the six-month time limit, and therefore, in the absence of contrary cou/r\\_t.liga rulings the Quimbo plant is continuing to generate electricity as the oxygenation system installed by Emgesa has so far demonstrated that it can maintain the oxygen levels required by the cou/r\\_t.liga.\n\nOn March 22, 2018, ANLA and CAM jointly presented the /fi.liganal repo/r\\_t.liga on the monitoring of water quality downstream of the dam of the El Quimbo hydroelectric plant. Both authorities con/fi.ligarmed the compliance of Emgesa with the oxygen level requirements. On June 15, 2018, Emgesa /fi.ligaled its /fi.liganal pleadings. On January 12, 2021, it was learned that the ruling of /fi.ligarst instance of the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Huila had been issued (it was subsequently noti/fi.ligaed to the company on February 1, 2021). The ruling, while acknowledging that the oxygenation system implemented by Emgesa has mitigated the risks associated with the protection of fauna in the Bethany basin, imposed a series of obligations on the environmental authorities involved, as well as on Emgesa itself. In pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, the la/t\\_t.ligaer is required to implement a decontamination project to ensure that the water in the basin does not generate risks for the /fl.ligaora and fauna of the river, which will be subject to veri/fi.ligacation by ANLA, and to make permanent the operation of the oxygenation system, adapting it to comply with the parameters established by ANLA. Emgesa will take all necessary actions to safeguard its rights.\n\n## Nivel de Tensi\u00f3n Uno proceedings - Colombia\n\nThis dispute involves an ' acci\u00f3n de grupo ' brought by Centro M\u00e9dico de la Sabana hospital and other pa/r\\_t.ligaies against Codensa seeking restitution of allegedly excess rates. The action is based upon the alleged failure of Codensa to apply a subsidized rate that they claim the users should have paid as Tensi\u00f3n Uno category users (voltage of less than 1 kV) and owners of infrastructure, as established in Resolution no. 82/2002, as amended by Resolution no. 97/2008. The suit is at a preliminary stage. The estimated value of the proceeding is about 337 billion Colombian pesos (about \u20ac96 million).",

        "page_content": "## Arbitration proceedings in Colombia\n\nOn October 8, 2018 the Grupo Energ\u00eda de Bogot\u00e1 (GEB) (which holds about 51.5% of Emgesa and Codensa) announced that it had sta/r\\_t.ligaed arbitration proceedings before the Centro de Arbitraje y Conciliaci\u00f3n de la C\u00e1mara de Comercio de Bogot\u00e1 against Enel Am\u00e9ricas SA for an alleged breach of contract in relation to the non-distribution of dividends in the 2016, 2017 and 2018 /fi.liganancial years for the companies Emgesa and Codensa and for the failure to comply with ce/r\\_t.ligaain provisions of the shareholders' agreement. The GEB is claiming damages of about \u20ac514 million plus interest. The preliminary phase has been completed and the procedure is currently suspended.\n\nIn parallel, GEB also initiated, respectively, 17 arbitration proceedings against Codensa and 20 against Emgesa, for a total of 37 pending disputes (now joined into two separate proceedings for each company), in an a/t\\_t.ligaempt to void the decisions of the Junta Directiva and shareholders' meetings of the defendant companies for alleged violation of mandatory rules, defect of absolute nullity for illegality of motive and subject ma/t\\_t.ligaer and alleged violation of shareholders' agreements. On February 24, 2020, GEB /fi.ligaled a revision of the arbitration petition /fi.ligaled against Emgesa, including, among other things, claims concerning the failure to pursue the corporate purpose and abuse of the exercise of voting rights by Enel Am\u00e9ricas and its directors. Emgesa /fi.ligaled a defense brief challenging GEB's new claims. Both of the two suits launched against Emgesa and Codensa are currently suspended due to negotiations by agreement of the pa/r\\_t.ligaies. The value of the disputes is undetermined and the proceedings are both in the preliminary phase.\n\n## Gab\u010d\u00edkovo dispute - Slovakia\n\nSlovensk\u00e9 elektr\u00e1rne (SE) is involved in a number of cases before the national cou/r\\_t.ligas concerning the 720 MW Gab\u010d\u00edkovo hydroelectric plant, which is administered by Vodohospod\u00e1rska V\u00fdsatavba \u0160t\u00e1tny Podnik (VV) and whose operation and maintenance, as pa/r\\_t.liga of the privatization of SE in 2006, had been entrusted to SE for a period of 30 years under an operating agreement (the VEG Operating Agreement).\n\nImmediately after the closing of the privatization, the Public Procurement O/ffi.ligace (PPO) /fi.ligaled suit with the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Bratislava seeking to void the VEG Operating Agreement on the basis of alleged violations of the regulations governing public tenders, qualifying the contract as a service contract and as such governed by those regulations. In November 2011 the trial cou/r\\_t.liga ruled in favor of SE, whereu-\n\npon the PPO immediately appealed the decision. In parallel with the PPO action, VV also /fi.ligaled a number of suits, asking in pa/r\\_t.ligaicular for the voidance of the VEG Operating Agreement.\n\nOn December 12, 2014, VV withdrew unilaterally from the VEG  Operating  Agreement,  notifying  its  termination  on March 9, 2015, for breach of contract. On March 9, 2015, the decision of the appeals cou/r\\_t.liga ove/r\\_t.ligaurned the ruling of the trial cou/r\\_t.liga and voided the contract as pa/r\\_t.liga of the action pursued by the PPO. SE lodged an extraordinary appeal against that decision before the Supreme Cou/r\\_t.liga. At a hearing of June 29, 2016, the Supreme Cou/r\\_t.liga denied the appeal. SE then appealed the ruling to the Constitutional Cou/r\\_t.liga, which denied the appeal on January 18, 2017.\n\nIn addition, SE lodged a request for arbitration with the\n\nVienna International Arbitral Centre (VIAC) under the VEG Indemnity Agreement. Under that accord, which had been signed as pa/r\\_t.liga of the privatization between the National Prope/r\\_t.ligay Fund (now MH Manazment) of the Slovak Republic and SE, the la/t\\_t.ligaer is entitled to an indemnity in the event of the early termination of the VEG Operating Agreement for reasons not a/t\\_t.ligaributable to SE. The arbitration cou/r\\_t.liga rejected the objection that it did not have jurisdiction and the arbitration proceeding continued to examine the merits of the case, with a ruling on the amount involved being deferred to any subsequent proceeding. Following the hearing held on February 2, 2017, the arbitration cou/r\\_t.liga issued its ruling denying the request of SE on June 30, 2017. In parallel with the arbitration proceeding launched by SE, both VV and MH Manazment /fi.ligaled two suits in the Slovakian cou/r\\_t.ligas to void the VEG Indemnity Agreement owing to the alleged connection of the la/t\\_t.ligaer with the VEG Operating Agreement.  These  proceedings  were  joindered  and,  on September 27, 2017, a hearing was held before the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Bratislava in which the judge denied the request of the plainti/ff.ligas for procedural reasons. Both VV and MH Manazment appealed that decision. The appeal /fi.ligaled by MH Manazment was denied by the Bratislava Cou/r\\_t.liga of Appeal on June 8, 2019, upholding the decision of the cou/r\\_t.liga of /fi.ligarst instance in favor of SE. Similarly, the appeal /fi.ligaled by VV was denied, upholding the trial cou/r\\_t.liga decision in favor of SE. VV /fi.ligaled a fu/r\\_t.ligaher appeal ( dovolanie ) against that decision on March 9, 2020, to which SE replied with a brief submi/t\\_t.ligaed on June 8, 2020. At the local level, SE was sued by VV for alleged unjusti/fi.ligaed enrichment (estimated at about \u20ac360 million plus interest) for the period from 2006 to 2015. SE /fi.ligaled counter-claims for all of the proceedings under way and, in pa/r\\_t.ligaicular: (i) for 2006, 2007 and 2008, at the he-\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

        "page_content": "aring of June 26, 2019, the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Bratislava denied the claims of both pa/r\\_t.ligaies for procedural reasons. The ruling in /fi.ligarst instance was appealed by both VV and SE and the appeals for the years 2006-2008 are pending. As for the appeal proceedings relating to 2007, in November 2019, SE had raised a preliminary question which was rejected by the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Appeal on January 15, 2020. On August 18, 2020, SE /fi.ligaled an appeal with the Constitutional Cou/r\\_t.liga; (ii) for the proceedings relating to 2009, the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Bratislava had initially scheduled the /fi.ligarst hearing for October 13, 2020, which  was  then  postponed  to  November  24,  2020  and again postponed to March 23, 2021; (iii) for the proceeding relating to 2011, the Cou/r\\_t.liga set the /fi.ligarst hearing for November 19, 2020, again postponed to a date to be decided due to the COVID-19 situation; (iv) with regard to the proceeding involving 2012, at the hearing of April 24, 2019, the Cou/r\\_t.liga denied the petition of VV, which /fi.ligaled an appeal on June 21, 2019 and the appeal is under way; (v) for the proceedings relating to the years 2010 and 2013, the exchange of /fi.liganal pleadings between the pa/r\\_t.ligaies was concluded and the hearing at /fi.ligarst instance, initially set for May 12, 2020, was postponed to October 6, 2020. On this date, VV has asked for the hearing to be postponed to November 6, 2020, and subsequently to February 23, 2021. The hearing was subsequently postponed to a date to be determined as a result of the epidemiological emergency; (vi) for the proceeding relating to 2014, the hearing at /fi.ligarst instance initially scheduled for October 6, 2020 was /fi.ligarst postponed to November 6, 2020, and then to February 23, 2021. The hearing was subsequently postponed to a date to be determined due to the health emergency.\n\nFinally, in another proceeding before the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Bratislava, VV asked for SE to return the fee for the transfer from SE to VV of the technology assets of the Gab\u010d\u00edkovo plant as pa/r\\_t.liga of the privatization, with a value of about \u20ac43 million plus interest. The pa/r\\_t.ligaies exchanged briefs. At the hearing on November 19, 2019, the cou/r\\_t.liga issued a preliminary decision on the case in which it noted the lack of standing of VV. At the hearing of October 1, 2020, the pa/r\\_t.ligaies /fi.ligaled their /fi.liganal briefs and on December 18, 2020, the cou/r\\_t.liga issued a decision in favor of SE, rejecting VV's claims. On January 7, 2021, VV /fi.ligaled an appeal against the decision, and the proceeding is pending.\n\n## Precautionary administrative proceeding and Chucas arbitration\n\nPH Chucas SA (Chucas) is a special purpose entity established by Enel Green Power Costa Rica SA after it won a tender organized in 2007 by the Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad (ICE) for the construction of a 50 MW hydroelectric plant and the sale of the power generated by the plant to ICE under a build, operate and transfer contract (BOT).\n\nOn May 27, 2015, under the provisions of the BOT contract, Chucas initiated an arbitration proceeding before the C\u00e1mara Costarricense-No/r\\_t.ligaeamericana de Comercio (AMCHAM CICA) seeking reimbursement of the additional costs incurred to build the plant and as a result of the delays in completing the project as well as voidance of the /fi.ligane levied by ICE for alleged delays in /fi.liganalizing the works. In a decision issued in December 2017, the arbitration board ruled in Chucas' favor, granting recognition of the additional costs in the amount of about $113 million (about \u20ac91 million) and legal costs and ruling that the /fi.liganes should not be paid. ICE appealed the arbitration ruling before the Supreme Cou/r\\_t.liga and on September 5, 2019 Chucas was noti/fi.ligaed of the ruling upholding the ICE's appeal to void the arbitration ruling for a number of formal procedural reasons. On September 11, 2019, Chucas /fi.ligaled a ' recurso de aclaraci\u00f3n y adici\u00f3n ' with the same cou/r\\_t.liga and it was pa/r\\_t.ligaially upheld on June 8, 2020. The Cou/r\\_t.liga's decision expanded on the ruling of September 5, 2019 with information concerning the admission of evidence deposited by Chucas without, however, modifying the decision concerning the voidance of the arbitration award. On July 15, 2020, Chucas /fi.ligaled a request for arbitration with the AMCHAM CICA for an estimated amount of about $240 million. On August 14, 2020, ICE /fi.ligaled a response to Chucas's arbitration petition, requesting the dismissal of the proceeding for lack of jurisdiction on the pa/r\\_t.liga of the arbitration tribunal. The request was denied by AMCHAM CICA. In parallel, ICE /fi.ligaled precautionary appeals to the Tribunal Contencioso Administrativo against Chucas and the AMCHAM CICA in order to suspend the arbitration proceedings. These appeals were preliminarily upheld and subsequently revoked. Arbitration is therefore in the initial stages.\n\n## GasAtacama Chile - Chile\n\nOn August 4, 2016, the Superintendencia de Electricidad y Combustibles (SEC) /fi.liganed GasAtacama Chile $8.3 million (about 5.8 billion Chilean pesos) for information provided by the la/t\\_t.ligaer to the CDEC-SING ( Centro de Despacho Econ\u00f3mico de Carga ) between January 1, 2011 and October 29, 2015,  relating  to  the  Minimum  Technical  and  Minimum Operating Time variables at the Atacama plant.\n\nGasAtacama Chile appealed this measure with the SEC, which denied the appeal on November 2, 2016. GasAtacama Chile appealed this decision before the Santiago Cou/r\\_t.liga of Appeal, which on April 9, 2019, issued a ruling reducing the /fi.ligane to $432,000 (about 290 million Chilean pesos). Both GasAtacama Chile and the SEC have appealed this decision before the Supreme Cou/r\\_t.liga of Chile. On June 28, 2019, a hearing was held for both pa/r\\_t.ligaies to submit arguments and on January 15, 2020 the Supreme Cou/r\\_t.liga upheld the ruling of the Santiago Cou/r\\_t.liga of Appeal, leaving unchan-",

In parallel, GasAtacama Chile also /fi.ligaled an appeal before the Constitutional Cou/r\\_t.liga, claiming that the legal provisions under which the SEC imposed the /fi.ligane had been repealed at the time the penalty was issued. On July 17, 2018, the Constitutional Cou/r\\_t.liga rejected GasAtacama Chile's appeal. In relation to this issue, some operators of the Sistema In-\n\nterconectado del No/r\\_t.ligae Grande (SING), including Aes Gener SA, El\u00e9ctrica Angamos SA and Engie Energ\u00eda Chile SA, have initiated actions in order to obtain damages in an amount of about \u20ac58 million (the former) and about \u20ac141 million (the la/t\\_t.ligaer two). The disputes were joindered in pa/r\\_t.liga in a single proceeding and the preliminary phase is currently suspended under the state of national emergency declared in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n## Kino arbitration - Mexico\n\nOn September 16, 2020, Kino Contractor SA de Cv, Kino Facilities Manager SA de Cv and Enel SpA were noti/fi.ligaed of a request for arbitration /fi.ligaled by Parque Solar Don Jos\u00e9 SA de Cv, Villanueva Solar SA de Cv and Parque Solar Villanueva Tres SA de Cv (together, 'Project Companies') in which the Project Companies alleged the violation (i) by Kino Contractor of ce/r\\_t.ligaain provisions of the EPC Contract and (ii) by Kino Facilities of ce/r\\_t.ligaain provisions of the Asset Management Agreement, both contracts concerning solar projects owned by the three companies /fi.ligaling for arbitration.\n\nEnel SpA - which is the guarantor of the obligations of Kino Contractor and Kino Facilities deriving from the above contracts - has also been called into the arbitration proceeding, but without speci/fi.ligac claims being /fi.ligaled against it.\n\nThe Project Companies, in which Enel Green Power SpA is a non-controlling shareholder, are controlled by Caisse de D\u00e9p\u00f4t et Placement du Qu\u00e9bec and CKD Infraestructura M\u00e9xico SA de Cv. The proceeding is in the preliminary phase and the formation of the arbitration panel is in progress. The claim is provisionally quanti/fi.ligaed at about $140 million, while the Project Companies provisionally quanti/fi.ligaed their claim at about $15.4 million.\n\n## Tax litigation in Brazil\n\n## Withholding tax - Ampla\n\nIn 1998, Ampla Energia e Servi\u00e7os SA (Ampla) /fi.ligananced the acquisition of Coelce with the issue of bonds in the amount of $350 million ('Fixed Rate Notes' - FRN) subscribed by its Panamanian subsidiary, which had been established to\n\nraise funds abroad. Under the special rules then in force, subject to maintaining the bond until 2008, the interest paid by Ampla to its subsidiary was not subject to withholding tax in Brazil.\n\nHowever, the /fi.liganancial crisis of 1998 forced the Panamanian company to re/fi.liganance itself with its Brazilian parent, which for that purpose obtained loans from local banks. The tax authorities considered this /fi.liganancing to be the equivalent of the early extinguishment of the bond, with the consequent loss of entitlement to the exemption from withholding tax. In December 2005, Ampla carried out a spin-o/ff.liga that involved the transfer of the residual FRN debt and the associated rights and obligations to Ampla Investimentos e Servi\u00e7os SA.\n\nOn November 6, 2012, the C\u00e2mara Superior de Recursos Fiscais (the highest level of administrative cou/r\\_t.ligas) issued a ruling against Ampla, for which the company promptly asked that body for clari/fi.ligacations. On October 15, 2013, Ampla was noti/fi.ligaed of the denial of the request for clari/fi.ligacation ( Embargo de Declara\u00e7\u00e3o ), thereby upholding the previous adverse decision. The company provided security for the debt and on June 27, 2014 continued litigation before the ordinary cou/r\\_t.ligas ( Tribunal de Justi\u00e7a ).\n\nIn December 2017, the cou/r\\_t.liga appointed an expe/r\\_t.liga to examine the issue in greater detail in suppo/r\\_t.liga of the future ruling. In September 2018, the expe/r\\_t.liga submi/t\\_t.ligaed a repo/r\\_t.liga, requesting additional documentation.\n\nIn December 2018, the company provided the additional documentation and is awaiting the cou/r\\_t.liga's assessment of the arguments and documents presented.\n\nThe amount involved in the dispute at December 31, 2020 was about \u20ac206 million.\n\n## PIS - Eletropaulo\n\nIn July 2000, Eletropaulo /fi.ligaled suit seeking a tax credit for PIS ( Programa Integra\u00e7\u00e3o Social ) paid in application of regulations (Decree Laws 2.445/1988 and 2.449/1988) that were subsequently declared unconstitutional by the Supremo Tribunal Federal (STF). In May 2012, the Superior Tribunal de Justi\u00e7a (STJ) issued a /fi.liganal ruling in favor of the company that recognized the right to the credit.\n\nIn 2002, before the issue of that favorable /fi.liganal ruling, the\n\ncompany had o/ff.ligaset its credit against other federal taxes. This behavior was contested by the federal tax authorities but the company, claiming it had acted correctly, challenged in cou/r\\_t.liga the assessments issued by the federal tax authorities. Following defeat at the initial level of adjudication, the company appealed.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

The companies challenged the assessments, arguing that they correctly deducted the tax and asse/r\\_t.ligaing that the assets, the purchase of which generated the ICMS, are intended for use in their electricity distribution activities.\n\nThe companies are continuing to defend their actions at the various levels of adjudication.\n\nThe amount involved in the disputes totaled approximately \u20ac75 million at December 31, 2020.\n\n## Withholding tax - Endesa Brasil\n\nOn November 4, 2014, the Brazilian tax authorities issued an assessment against Endesa Brasil SA (now Enel Brasil SA) alleging the failure to apply withholding tax to payments of allegedly higher dividends to non-resident recipients.\n\nMore speci/fi.ligacally, in 2009, Endesa Brasil, as a result of the /fi.ligarst-time application of the IFRS, had derecognized goodwill, recognizing the e/ff.ligaects in equity, on the basis of the correct  application  of  the  accounting  standards  it  had adopted. The Brazilian tax authorities, however, asse/r\\_t.ligaed during an audit - that the accounting treatment was incorrect and that the e/ff.ligaects of the derecognition should have been recognized through pro/fi.ligat or loss. As a result, the corresponding amount (about \u20ac202 million) was reclassi/fi.ligaed as a payment of income to non-residents and, therefore, subject to withholding tax of 15%.\n\nIt should be noted that the accounting treatment adopted by the company was agreed with the external auditor and also con/fi.ligarmed by a speci/fi.ligac legal opinion issued by a local /fi.ligarm.\n\nFollowing unfavorable rulings from the administrative courts, the company is continuing to defend its actions in cou/r\\_t.liga and the appropriateness of the accounting treatment.\n\nThe overall amount involved in the dispute at December 31, 2020 was about \u20ac56 million.\n\n## PIS - Eletropaulo\n\nIn  December  1995,  the  Brazilian  government  increased the rate of the federal PIS ( Programa Integra\u00e7\u00e3o Social ) tax\n\nfrom 0.50% to 0.65% with the issue of a provisional measure (Executive Provisional Order).\n\nSubsequently, the provisional measure was re-issued /fi.ligave times before its de/fi.liganitive rati/fi.ligacation into law in 1998. Under Brazilian legislation, an increase in the tax rate (or the establishment of a new tax) can only be ordered by law and take e/ff.ligaect 90 days after its publication.\n\nEletropaulo therefore /fi.ligaled suit arguing that an increase in\n\nthe tax rate would only have been e/ff.ligaective 90 days after the last Provisional Order, claiming that the e/ff.ligaects of the /fi.ligarst four provisional measures should be considered void (since they were never rati/fi.ligaed into law). This dispute ended in April 2008 with recognition of the validity of the increase in the PIS rate sta/r\\_t.ligaing from the /fi.ligarst provisional measure. In May 2008, the Brazilian tax authorities /fi.ligaled a suit against Eletropaulo to request payment of taxes corresponding to the rate increase from March 1996 to December 1998. Eletropaulo has fought the request at the various levels of adjudication, arguing that the time limit for the issue of the notice of assessment had lapsed. In pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, since more than /fi.ligave years have passed since the taxable event (December 1995, the date of the /fi.ligarst provisional measure) without issuing any formal instrument, the right of the tax authorities to request the payment of additional taxes and the authority to unde/r\\_t.ligaake legal action to obtain payment have been challenged.\n\nIn 2017, following the unfavorable decisions issued in previous rulings, Eletropaulo /fi.ligaled an appeal in defense of its rights and its actions with the Superior Tribunal de Justi\u00e7a (STJ) and the Supremo Tribunal Federal (STF). The proceedings are still pending while the amounts subject to dispute have been covered by a bank guarantee.\n\nWith regard to the request of the O/ffi.ligace of the A/t\\_t.ligaorney General of the Brazilian National Treasury Depa/r\\_t.ligament to replace the bank guarantee with a deposit in cou/r\\_t.liga, the cou/r\\_t.liga of  second  instance  granted  the  petition.  The  company therefore replaced the bank guarantee with a cash deposit and /fi.ligaled a clari/fi.ligacation motion against the related decision, which is currently awaiting a decision.\n\nThe overall amount involved in the dispute at December 31, 2020 was about \u20ac38 million.\n\n## ICMS - Coelce\n\nThe State of Cear\u00e1 has /fi.ligaled various tax assessments against Companhia Energ\u00e9tica do Cear\u00e1 SA over the years (for tax periods from 2005 to 2014), contesting the determination of the deductible po/r\\_t.ligaion of the ICMS ( Imposto sobre Circula\u00e7\u00e3o de Mercadorias e Servi\u00e7os ) and in pa/r\\_t.ligaicular the method of calculation of the pro-rata deduction with reference to the revenue deriving from the application of a",

This audit, which began in 2016, involved corporate income tax, value added tax and withholding taxes (mainly for the years 2012 to 2014).\n\nWith reference to the main claims, the companies involved have challenged the related assessments at the /fi.ligarst administrative level ( Tribunal Econ\u00f3mico-Administrativo Central - TEAC), defending the correctness of their actions.\n\nWith regard to the disputes concerning corporate income tax, the issues for which an unfavorable outcome is considered possible amounted to about \u20ac151 million at December 31, 2020: (i) Enel Iberia is defending the appropriateness of the criterion adopted for determining the deductibility of capital losses deriving from stock sales (around \u20ac103 million) and ce/r\\_t.ligaain /fi.liganancial expense (around \u20ac18 million); (ii) Endesa and its subsidiaries are mainly defending the ap-\n\nateness of the criteria adopted for the deductibility of ce/r\\_t.ligaain /fi.liganancial expense (about \u20ac24 million) and costs for decommissioning nuclear power plants (about \u20ac6 million).\n\n## Income taxes - Enel Green Power Espa\u00f1a SL\n\nOn June 7, 2017, the Spanish tax authorities issued a notice of assessment to Enel Green Power Espa\u00f1a SL, contesting the treatment of the merger of Enel Uni\u00f3n Fenosa Renovables SA ('EUFER') into Enel Green Power Espa\u00f1a SL in 2011 as a tax neutral transaction, asse/r\\_t.ligaing that the transaction had no valid economic reason.\n\nOn July 6, 2017, the company appealed the assessment at the /fi.ligarst administrative level ( Tribunal Econ\u00f3mico-Administrativo Central - TEAC), defending the appropriateness of the tax treatment applied to the merger. The company has provided  the  suppo/r\\_t.ligaing  documentation  demonstrating the synergies achieved as a result of the merger in order to prove the existence of a valid economic reason for the transaction. On December 10, 2019, the TEAC denied the appeal and the company is continuing to defend its actions in cou/r\\_t.liga ( Audiencia Nacional ).\n\nThe overall amount involved in the dispute at December 31, 2020 was about \u20ac95 million.\n\n## Tax litigation in Italy\n\n## Withholding tax - Enel Servizio Ele/t\\_t.ligarico Nazionale\n\nAs a result of a tax audit initiated in March 2018 and following a subsequent investigation conducted with questionnaires submi/t\\_t.ligaed to the banks involved as assignees in ce/r\\_t.ligaain transfers of receivables from Servizio Ele/t\\_t.ligarico Nazionale SpA (SEN) in respect of mass market customers under a framework agreement, on December 19, 2018, the Revenue Agency   Regional Directorate of Lazio   Large Taxpayers O/ffi.ligace, noti/fi.ligaed the company of an assessment in respect of the alleged violation of withholding tax obligations relating to the amounts paid to the banks as pa/r\\_t.liga of the aforementioned transfers in 2013.\n\nIn pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, the dispute arises from an assessment by the O/ffi.ligace that: (i) reclassi/fi.ligaed, for tax purposes only, the assignment of receivables as a /fi.liganancing transaction; (ii) asse/r\\_t.ligaed an alleged withholding obligation for the company commensurate with the cost of the transaction (as the di/ff.ligaerence between the nominal value of the assigned receivables and  the  transfer  price),  reconstructing  the  subsequent transactions involving the assigned receivables (fu/r\\_t.ligaher sales and/or securitizations with non-residents carried out by\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

The overall amount involved in the dispute at December 31,\n\n2020 is about \u20ac81 million.\n\n## 54. Future accounting standards\n\nThe  following  provides  a  list  of  accounting  standards, amendments and interpretations that will take e/ff.ligaect for the Group after December 31, 2020.\n\n- \u203a ' IFRS 17 - Insurance contracts ', issued in May 2017. The standard will take e/ff.ligaect, subject to endorsement, for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2021, with earlier application permi/t\\_t.ligaed.\n- \u203a ' Amendment to IFRS 16: COVID 19-related rent concessions ', issued on May 28, 2020 in order to permit lessees to not account for rent concessions (rent payment holidays, deferral of lease payments, reductions in rent for a period of time, possibly followed by rent increases in future periods) as lease modi/fi.ligacations if they are a direct consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic and meet ce/r\\_t.ligaain conditions. According to IFRS 16, a lease modi/fi.ligacation is a change in the scope of a lease, or the consideration for a lease, that was not pa/r\\_t.liga of the original terms and conditions of the lease. Accordingly, rent concessions would represent lease modi/fi.ligacations unless they were provided for in the original lease agreement. The amendment applies only to lessees, while lessors are required to apply the current provisions of IFRS 16. The amendment, which applies retrospectively for annual repo/r\\_t.ligaing periods beginning on or after June 1, 2020, was not applied early by the Group.\n- \u203a ' Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 - Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture ', issued in September 2014. The amendments clarify the accounting treatment for sales or contribution of assets between an investor and its associates or joint ventures. They con/fi.ligarm that the accounting treatment depends on whether the assets sold or contributed to an associate or joint venture constitute a 'business' (as de/fi.liganed in IFRS 3). The IASB has deferred the e/ff.ligaective date of\n- these amendments inde/fi.liganitely, but if the amendments are applied early, they must be applied prospectively.\n- \u203a ' Amendments to IAS 1 - Classi/fi.ligacation of Liabilities as Current  or  Non-current ',  issued  in  January  2020.  The amendments regard the provisions of IAS 1 concerning the presentation of liabilities. More speci/fi.ligacally, the changes clarify:\n- -the criteria to adopt in classifying a liability as current or non-current, specifying the meaning of right of an entity to defer se/t\\_t.ligalement and that that right must exist at the end of the repo/r\\_t.ligaing period;\n- -the  classi/fi.ligacation  is  una/ff.ligaected  by  the  intentions  or expectations of management about when the entity will exercise its right to defer se/t\\_t.ligalement of a liability;\n- -that the right to defer exists if and only if the entity satis/fi.ligaes the terms of the loan at the end of the repo/r\\_t.ligaing period, even if the creditor does not verify compliance until later; and\n- -that se/t\\_t.ligalement regards the transfer to the counterparty of cash, equity instruments, other assets or services. The amendments will take e/ff.ligaect, subject to endorsement, for annual periods beginning on or after January 1,\n\n2023, with earlier application permi/t\\_t.ligaed.\n\n- \u203a ' Amendments to IFRS 3 - Reference to the Conceptual Framework ' issued in May 2020. The amendments are intended to replace a reference to the de/fi.liganitions of assets and liabilities provided by the Revised Conceptual Framework for Financial Repo/r\\_t.ligaing issued in March 2018 (Conceptual Framework) without signi/fi.ligacantly changing its provisions.\n\nThe amendments also add to IFRS 3 a requirement that, for transactions and other events within the scope of 'IAS 37 - Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets' or 'IFRIC 21 - Levies', an acquirer applies IAS 37 or IFRIC 21 (instead of the Conceptual Framework) to identify the liabilities it has assumed in a business combination. Finally, the amendments clarify the existing guidelines in IFRS 3 for contingent assets acquired in a business combination, specifying that, if it is not sure that an asset exists at the acquisition date, the contingent asset shall not be recognized.\n\nThe amendments will take e/ff.ligaect, subject to endorsement, for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2022.\n\n- \u203a ' Amendments to IAS 16 - Prope/r\\_t.ligay, Plant and Equipment: Proceeds before Intended Use ', issued in May 2020. The amendments prohibit a company from deducting from the cost of prope/r\\_t.ligay, plant and equipment amounts received from selling items produced while the company is preparing the asset for its intended use. Instead, a company will recognize such sales proceeds and related cost in pro/fi.ligat or loss. The amendments will take e/ff.ligaect, subject",

Early application is permi/t\\_t.ligaed.\n\n- \u203a ' Amendments to IAS 37 - Onerous Contracts - Costs of Ful/fi.ligalling a Contract ', issued in May 2020. The amendments specify which costs an entity includes in determining the cost of ful/fi.ligalling a contract for the purpose of assessing whether the contract is onerous. To this end, the cost of ful/fi.ligalling a contract comprises the costs that relate directly to the contract. These consist of the incremental costs of ful/fi.ligalling that contract or an allocation of other costs that relate directly to ful/fi.ligalling contracts. The amendments will take e/ff.ligaect, subject to endorsement, for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2022. Early application is permi/t\\_t.ligaed.\n- \u203a ' Annual  improvements  to  IFRS  Standards  2018-2020 ', issued  in  May  2020.  The  document  mainly  comprises amendments to the following standards:\n- -' IFRS 1 - First-Time Adoption of International Financial Repo/r\\_t.ligaing Standards '; the amendment simpli/fi.ligaes the application of IFRS 1 by an investee (subsidiary, associate or joint venture) that becomes a /fi.ligarst-time adopter of IFRS Standards after its parent has already adopted them. More speci/fi.ligacally, if the investee adopts the IFRSs after its parent and applies IFRS 1.D16 (a), then the investee can elect to measure the cumulative translation di/ff.ligaerences for all foreign operations at the amounts that would be included in the parent's consolidated /fi.liganancial statements, based on parent's date of transition to the IFRSs;\n- -' IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments '; with regard to fees included in the '10 per cent' test for derecognition of /fi.liganancial liabilities, the amendment clari/fi.ligaes the fees that an entity includes when assessing whether the terms of a new or modi/fi.ligaed /fi.liganancial liability are substantially di/ff.ligaerent from the terms of the original /fi.liganancial liability. In pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, these include only fees paid or received between the borrower and the lender, including fees paid or received by either the borrower or lender on the other's behalf;\n- -' IFRS 16 - Leases '; the International Accounting Standards Board amended Illustrative Example 13 accompanying 'IFRS 16 - Leases'. Speci/fi.ligacally, the amendment eliminates the potential for confusion in the application of IFRS 16 created by the way in which Illustrative Example 13 had illustrated the requirements for lease incentives. The example had included a reimbursement relating to leasehold improvements without explaining whether the reimbursement quali/fi.ligaed as a lease incentive. The amendment removes the illustration of a reimbursement\n\nrelating to leasehold improvements from the example;\n\n- -' IAS 41 - Agriculture '; the amendment removes the requirement for entities to exclude cash /fl.ligaows for taxation when measuring fair value. Accordingly, entities shall use pre-tax cash /fl.ligaows and a pre-tax rate to discount those cash /fl.ligaows.\n\nThe amendments shall be applied prospectively, subject to endorsement, for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2022. Early application is permi/t\\_t.ligaed.\n\n- \u203a ' Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, and IFRS 16 - Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase 2 ', issued in August 2020. The amendments supplement those issued in 2019 (Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase 1) and address issues that could a/ff.ligaect /fi.liganancial repo/r\\_t.ligaing after a benchmark has been reformed or replaced with an alternative benchmark rate. The objectives of the Phase 2 amendments are to assist companies: (i) in applying the IFRSs when changes occur in contractual cash /fl.ligaows or hedging relationships due to the reform of the benchmarks for determining interest rates; and (ii) in providing information to users of /fi.liganancial statements.\n\nIn addition, when the Phase 1 exemptions cease to apply, companies are required to amend the documentation of hedging relationship to re/fl.ligaect the changes required under the IBOR reform by the end of the year in which the changes are made (such changes do not constitute the discontinuation of the hedging relationship). When the description of a hedged element in the documentation of the hedging relationship is changed, the amounts accumulated in the hedging reserve shall be considered to be based on the alternative benchmark rate on the basis of which the future hedged cash /fl.ligaows will be determined.\n\nThe amendments will require providing additional disclosures about the entity's exposure to the risks arising from the interest rate benchmark reform and related risk management activities.\n\nThe amendments will take e/ff.ligaect for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2021. Early application is permi/t\\_t.ligaed.\n\n- \u203a ' Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2 - Disclosure of Accounting Policies ', issued in February 2021. The amendments are intended to suppo/r\\_t.liga entities in deciding which accounting policies to disclose in the /fi.liganancial statements. The amendments to IAS 1 require companies to disclose their material accounting policy information rather than their signi/fi.ligacant accounting policies.

The amendments clarify how companies should distinguish changes in accounting  policies  from  changes  in  accounting  estimates. The de/fi.liganition of changes in accounting estimates has been replaced with a de/fi.liganition of accounting estimates as 'monetary amounts in /fi.liganancial statements that are subject to measurement unce/r\\_t.ligaainty'.

Events after the repo/r\\_t.ligaing period\n\n## Enel closes Unit I of Bocamina coal-/fi.ligared plant three years ahead of date set in Chile's National Decarbonization Plan\n\nOn January 4, 2021 the Enel Group disconnected and ceased operations at Unit I of the Bocamina coal-/fi.ligared power plant, which is located in the Chilean municipality of Coronel. The 128 MW Unit I was disconnected three years before the date set in Chile's National Decarbonization Plan. With this milestone, coupled with the closure of Tarapac\u00e1 coal plant on December 31, 2019 and the expected closure of Enel's last coal facility in the country, Bocamina's Unit II, by May 2022, steadily progress is being made towards the decarbonization of Enel's Chilean generation mix.\n\n## Moody's upgrades Enel's long-term rating to 'Baa1'\n\nOn January 15, 2021, Moody's Investors Service (Moody's) announced that it had upgraded its long-term rating of Enel SpA to 'Baa1' from the previous level of 'Baa2'. Among the rating drivers prompting the upgrade, Moody's cited:\n\n- \u203a low  earnings  volatility  driven  by  large  scale  and  geographical diversi/fi.ligacation;\n- \u203a stable earnings stemming from regulated networks and contracted generation, which account for 80% of the Group's EBITDA;\n- \u203a solid  /fi.liganancial  pro/fi.ligale,  with  funds  from  operations/net debt in excess of 20%.\n\n## Enel's Board of Directors approves the issue of hybrid bonds up to a maximum of \u20ac3 billion\n\nOn February 25, 2021, the Board of Directors of Enel SpA authorized the issue, by December 31, 2021, of one or more non-conve/r\\_t.ligaible subordinated hybrid bonds, inclu-\n\nding perpetual bonds, for up to a maximum of \u20ac3 billion. The bonds are to be placed exclusively with European and non-European  institutional  investors,  including  through private placements.\n\n## Enel issues new hybrid bonds for an aggregate principal amount of \u20ac2.25 billion\n\nIn execution of the February 25, 2021 resolution, on March 4, 2021 Enel announced the issue of a new perpetual hybrid bond of \u20ac2.25 billion. The new issue strengthens and optimizes the Group's capital structure with an incremental hybrid bond component, thus contributing to suppo/r\\_t.liga the Group's growth set out in the 2021-2023 Strategic Plan, which envisages direct investments of around \u20ac40 billion over the period.\n\n## Enel signs the largest ever sustainability-linked revolving credit facility\n\nOn March 5, 2021, Enel and its Dutch subsidiary Enel Finance International NV (EFI) signed the largest ever sustainability-linked revolving credit facility in the amount of \u20ac10 billion, with a term of /fi.ligave years.\n\nThe facility, which will be used to meet the Group's /fi.liganancial requirements, is linked to a key pe/r\\_f.ligaormance indicator consisting of direct greenhouse gas emissions (i.e., Group Scope 1 CO 2 equivalent emissions from the production of electricity and heat), contributing to the achievement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 13 'Climate Action' and in line with the Group's 'Sustainability-Linked Financing Framework', for which Vigeo Eiris provided a second-pa/r\\_t.ligay opinion.\n\nThe facility replaces the previous \u20ac10 billion revolving credit line signed by Enel and EFI in December 2017 and has a lower all-in cost than the earlier facility.\n\n## Voluntary pa/r\\_t.ligaial public tender o/ff.ligaer for the shares and American Depositary Shares of Enel Am\u00e9ricas SA\n\nAs pa/r\\_t.liga of the process of corporate reorganization aimed at integrating the non-conventional renewable energy business of the Enel Group in Central and South America (excluding Chile) into the listed Chilean subsidiary Enel Am\u00e9ricas SA, on March 15, 2021, Enel SpA, as previously announced to investors, launched a voluntary pa/r\\_t.ligaial public tender o/ff.ligaer for Enel Am\u00e9ricas common stock and American Depositary Shares (ADSs) up to a maximum overall amount of 7,608,631,104 shares (including the shares represented by ADSs), equal to 10% of the company's outstanding share capital at that date.\n\nThe tender was organized as a voluntary public tender o/ff.ligaer in the United States and a voluntary public tender o/ff.ligaer in Chile. The O/ff.ligaer period ran from March 15 to April 13, 2021.\n\nThe O/ff.ligaer was conditional upon the e/ff.ligaectiveness of the merger of EGP Am\u00e9ricas SpA into Enel Am\u00e9ricas SA, which occurred on April 1, 2021.",

As from the second half of 2014, the organizational structure of the Enel Group is based on a matrix of global business lines and geographical areas.

The Global Business Lines are: Global Power Generation, Global Energy and Commodity Management, Global Infrastructure and Networks and Enel  X ; (ii) Regions  and  Countries,  which  are  responsible  for  managing relationships with local institutional bodies, regulatory authorities, the media and other local stakeholders, as well as the development of the customer base with regard to the sale of electricity and gas, in each of the countries in which the Group is present, while also providing staff and other service support to the Global Business Lines and adopting appropriate security, safety and environmental standards.

In this regard, we also monitored - as provided for under Article 19, paragraph 1(e), of Legislative Decree 39/2010 - the nature and the scale of non-audit services provided to the Company and other Enel Group companies by EY SpA and then KPMG SpA and the entities belonging to their respective networks. The fees due to KPMG SpA and the entities belonging to its network are reported in the notes to the separate financial statements of the Company.

The statement  also  affirmed  that  the  appropriateness  of  the  administrative  and accounting  procedures  used  in  the  preparation  of  the  separate  financial statements of the Company had been verified in an assessment of the internal control  system  for  financial  reporting  (supported  by  the  findings  of  the independent testing performed by a qualified external advisor and - only for the Information Technology General Controls - the Company's Audit department) and that the assessment of the internal control system did not identify any material issues.

In  the  light  of  our examination and in the absence of significant issues, the internal control and risk management system can be considered adequate and effective. In February 2021, the Board of Directors of the Company expressed an analogous assessment of the situation and also noted, in November 2020, that the main risks associated with the strategic targets set out in the 2021-2023 Business Plan were compatible with the management of the Company in a manner consistent with those targets;\n\n7",

Detailed information on the Company's corporate governance system can be found in the Report on Corporate Governance and Ownership Structure for 2020.\n\nIn February and June 2020, the Board of Statutory Auditors verified that the Board of Directors, in evaluating the independence of non-executive directors, correctly applied the assessment criteria specified in the Corporate Governance Code and the principle of the priority of substance over form set out in that Code, adopting a transparent procedure, the details of which are discussed in the Report on Corporate Governance and Ownership Structure for 2020.\n\nWith  regard  to  the  so-called  'self-assessment'  of  the  independence  of  its members, the Board of Statutory Auditors - in February 2020 - ascertained that all standing statutory auditors met the relevant requirements set out in the Consolidated Law on Financial Intermediation and in the Corporate Governance Code.\n\nIn the final part of 2020 and during the first two months of 2021, the Board of Statutory Auditors, with the support of an independent advisory firm, conducted a board review assessing the size, composition and functioning of the Board of Statutory  Auditors,  as  was  done  for  2018  and  2019,  similar  to  the  review conducted for the Board of Directors since 2004. This is a best practice that the Board of Statutory Auditors intended to adopt even in the absence of a specific recommendation of the Corporate Governance Code, a 'peer-to-peer review' approach, i.e. the assessment not only of the functioning of the body as a whole, but also of the style and content of the contribution provided by each of the auditors.  The  findings  of  the  board  review  for  2020  reveal  the  unanimous agreement of the members of the Board of Statutory Auditors concerning the complete adequacy of its size, membership and functioning. Compared with the previous year, it was confirmed that the oversight body has adopted effective and efficient operating methods that comply with the reference regulatory framework. Note that during the assessment phase that preceded the adoption by the Board of Directors of Enel of the measures intended to ensure the implementation of the changes contained in the Italian Corporate Governance Code published in January 2020, the Board of Statutory Auditors, in December 2020, invited the Board of Directors to take account of a number of recommendations intended to ensure the optimal functioning of the Board committees.

The proposals to the  Board  of  Directors  concerning  such  forms  of  compensation  and  the determination of the associated parameters were prepared by the Nomination and Compensation Committee, which is made up entirely of independent directors, drawing on the findings of benchmark analyses, including at the international level, conducted by an independent consulting firm. In addition, the second section of the Remuneration Report contains, in compliance with the applicable CONSOB regulations, specific disclosures on the remuneration earned in 2020 by the  members  of  the  oversight  body  and  by  key  management  personnel  (in aggregate form for the latter).\n\nThe Board of Statutory Auditors also supervised the process of preparing the remuneration  policy  for  2021  -  described  in  full  in  the  first  section  of  the Remuneration Report - without finding any critical issues. In particular, oversight activity examined the consistency of the various measures envisaged by that policy with (i) the provisions of Directive (EU) no. 2017/828 as transposed into Italian law, with (ii) the  recommendations of the Italian Corporate Governance\n\n11",

This analysis was performed on the basis of  the data reported in the documentation published on the occasion of 2020 Shareholders' Meetings by issuers belonging to a peer group composed - unlike that  used  for  the  analogous  analysis  concerning  the  Board  of  Directors  exclusively of Italian companies belonging the FTSE-MIB index( 3 ). The functions that  the  Italian  legal  system  assigns  to  the  Board  of  Statutory  Auditors differentiate the latter from the bodies with oversight functions provided for in the one-tier and two-tier governance systems commonly adopted in other countries. For the purpose of identifying the peer group, the consultant, in agreement with the Board of Statutory Auditors, agreed to exclude certain industrial companies belonging to the FTSE-MIB index that have concentrated ownership structures, while evaluating some companies in the FTSE-MIB index operating in the financial services industry.\n\nThe analysis showed that, on the basis of the data as at December 31, 2019, Enel exceeds the peer group in terms of capitalization, is above the ninth decile in terms of revenue  and slightly below the ninth decile in terms of number of employees.\n\nThe  same  analysis  also  found  that  -  against  Enel's  very  high  positioning compared  with  the companies included in the panel in terms of capitalization, revenue and number of employees - the remuneration of the Chairman of the Board of Statutory Auditors and of the other Statutory Auditors is just above the peer group median. The analysis also found that in 2019, on average, the boards of statutory auditors of the companies belonging to the panel were composed of four standing auditors compared with the three standing members of Enel's Board of Statutory Auditors, and held 26 meetings compared with the 17 meetings held by Enel's Board of Statutory Auditors.

        "page_content": "should be noted that in 2020 the Enel  Board of Statutory Auditors held 27 meetings, a significant increase compared with the previous year.\n\nOn the basis of the analysis, it therefore emerged that the competitiveness of the remuneration envisaged for the Chairman and the standing  members of Enel's Board of Statutory Auditors is substantially similar to that envisaged for nonexecutive directors with regard to the remuneration paid to them in their capacity as directors. However, the consultant noted  that there is a weaker  correlation compared with non-executive  directors  between  the remuneration paid to the members of the Board of Statutory Auditors and the volume of work requested of them. In this regard, it should borne in mind that the overall remuneration paid to non-executive directors also takes into account their possible participation on the Board committees, while the members of the Board of Statutory Auditors regularly take part in the meetings of these committees as a necessary part of the  performance of the oversight  tasks assigned to them by law without being remunerated for this activity.\n\nFinally, it should be noted that the benchmark analysis found a clear correlation between the competitiveness of the remuneration offered by the peer group companies to their respective boards of statutory auditors and the different work load required of them, as indicated by the number of meetings held in 2019. At the same time, the analysis noted that the amount of remuneration paid to the Chairman and the standing  members of Enel's Board of Statutory Auditors is substantially in line with that currently paid by most of the peer group companies in which the Ministry for the Economy and Finance holds a significant direct and/or indirect investment.\n\nThe Board of Statutory Auditors'  oversight activity in 2020 was carried out in 27 meetings (12 of which held jointly with the Control and Risk Committee) and with participation in the 16 meetings of the Board of Directors, and, through the chairman or  one  or  more  of  its  members,  in  the  12  meetings  of  the  Nomination  and Compensation Committee, in the 4 meetings of the Related Parties Committee and in the 11 meetings of the Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee. The delegated magistrate of the State Audit Court participated in the meetings of the Board of Statutory Auditors and those of the Board of Directors.\n\nDuring the course of this activity and on the basis of information obtained from KPMG SpA, no omissions, censurable facts, irregularities or other significant developments were found that would require reporting to the regulatory authorities or mention in this report.\n\nFinally, the Board of Statutory Auditors notes that, as at the date of this report, the major global health emergency associated with the COVID-19 pandemic has not\n\n13",

The use of this basis of accounting is appropriate unless the directors believe that the conditions for liquidating the parent or ceasing operations exist, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThe Collegio Sindacale is responsible for overseeing, within the terms established by the Italian law, the group's financial reporting process.",

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISA Italia will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with ISA Italia, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- -  identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- -  obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the group's internal control;\n- -  evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the directors;\n- -  conclude on the appropriateness of the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors' report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors' report. However, future events or conditions may cause the group to cease to continue as a going concern;\n- -  evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation;\n- -  obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance, identified at the appropriate level required by ISA Italia, regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\n<!-- image -->",
