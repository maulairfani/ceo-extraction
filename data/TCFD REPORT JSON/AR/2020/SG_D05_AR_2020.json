        "page_content": "## Letter from the Chairman and CEO\n\nThe early downpayment we made in digital transformation, our broad-based franchise and focus on being a purposedriven bank, position us well to ride these challenging times. With the grit and gumption of our people, and the support of you - our shareholders - and customers, we are confident of emerging from this storm as one of the winners.\n\n## A resilient performance in the face of crisis\n\nHumanity faced the crisis of a generation in 2020, with the Covid-19 pandemic roiling lives and livelihoods. At the time of writing, the virus has infected over 100 million people and claimed over two million lives. It has also wreaked carnage on the global economy. Despite governments rolling out trillions of dollars in stimulus packages, almost every country - bar China - fell into recession. Singapore, DBS' home market, shrank 5.8%, while Hong Kong - already hit by protests in 2019 - suffered a deepening recession. The geopolitical rivalry between China and the United States also intensified, adding to the uncertainty.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, DBS' franchise demonstrated remarkable resilience. With central banks slashing interest rates to bolster economies, DBS' net interest margin fell 27 basis points to 1.62%. Despite this, total income remained stable at SGD 14.6 billion, as the quality of our broad-based franchise, a well-constructed balance sheet and our nimble execution cushioned the impact of interest rate headwinds. In particular, loans grew 4%, fee income was stable and Treasury Markets (TM) had a record year. Like the rest of the bank, TM has been on a digital transformation journey in recent years, improving pricing capabilities and competitiveness, enhancing processes and\n\n<!-- image -->\n\napplication resiliency, helping the business deliver outsized results.\n\nOur record operating performance of SGD 8.43 billion in one of the most challenging periods on record attests to the quality of our franchise and nimble execution.\n\nWhile DBS' top-line held steady, net profit fell 26% to SGD 4.72 billion as we conservatively frontloaded general allowances in anticipation of rising defaults in 2021. Specific allowances increased with a general deterioration in credit quality that was to be expected in such an environment. We estimate that credit costs could\n\nrise to between SGD 3 billion-5 billion in 20202021. Having prudently addressed the better part of this in 2020 by conservatively setting aside total allowances of SGD 3.07 billion, we expect total allowances to decline in 2021, back to what we would set aside in a normalised year.\n\nIn a turbulent time, DBS continued to be recognised for being a safe and trusted bank. This was exemplified by the record SGD 99 billion in current and savings account inflows into the bank. Our capital and liquidity positions remain strong, and Global Finance named us 'Safest Bank in Asia' for the 12 th consecutive year.\n\n## Lending Covid-19 support\n\nWe believe that as constructive members of society, banks have an integral role in supporting real people, real lives, real economies, and sharing the pain in a downturn. Amid the trying times, DBS was quick to provide cashflow support, lower the cost of lending, provide new kinds of lending to marginal borrowers, and help customers do their banking digitally.\n\nThrough the year, we approved SGD 11 billion in loan moratoriums for companies in Singapore and Hong Kong, and another\n\n## SGD 14.6 billion\n\n## Total income\n\nTotal income remained stable despite the economic disruption caused by the pandemic.\n\n## SGD 8.43 billion\n\nProfit before allowances Profit before allowances rose 2% to a record high of SGD 8.43 billion.\n\n## SGD 4.72 billion\n\n## Net profit\n\nNet profit declined 26% due to higher total allowances set aside to buffer against potential risks arising from the pandemic.\n\n## SGD 0.87\n\n## Dividend\n\nWe proposed a final dividend of SGD 18 cents per share, bringing the full-year ordinary dividend to SGD 87 cents per share. This is in line with MAS' call for local banks to moderate their dividends for 2020.\n\nSGD 5 billion in moratoriums for residential mortgages in Singapore. We also disbursed SGD 5 billion in government risk-sharing loans for SMEs in Singapore as well. We are pleased that this forbearance helped several customers tide through difficult times, so that only small percentages of them are still on moratorium at this time. We also offered free Covid-19 insurance to all five million DBS/ POSB customers and their families, which was widely appreciated in the early days of the crisis.\n\nDuring the lockdown, our extensive digital offerings enabled customers to bank with us\n\nin an uninterrupted manner from the safety of their homes. In some cases, we expedited the rollout of services ahead of schedule. The launch of a comprehensive suite of digital 'contact-free' trade financing capabilities is an example. We also fast-tracked our multi-year digital roadmap to bridge gaps in a couple of last-mile processes.\n\nThese efforts were well-recognised. In 2020, DBS won the 'Best Bank in the World' accolade from Global Finance, making it the third year in a row we have been recognised on the world stage. In its citation, Global Finance said:",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n'This year, a worldwide pandemic has upended commerce and made forecasting even more difficult, yet business must continue. DBS Bank is exemplary of a bank that was ready for the sharp rise in demand for digital banking services during the pandemic. Over the past decade, it invested heavily in all things digital and created a culture for banking that is inclusive and efficient. Those investments are paying off at a time of economic uncertainty. They have strengthened the bank's resilience and helped it to serve its customers in their time of need.'\n\nOn the employee front, DBS' leadership in digitalisation enabled the bank to pivot quickly to a work-from-home model for the vast majority of employees, while still maintaining business continuity. To ensure employee morale remained strong, we launched a series of programmes under the TOGETHER movement aimed at addressing the physical, emotional and mental well-being of our people. In a difficult year, employee engagement scores remained strong. In addition, not only did we pledge not to cut jobs during the course of the year, we also hired 2,000 people in Singapore, including many fresh graduates.\n\nTo support the community, DBS launched the SGD 10.5 million Stronger Together Fund, providing 4.5 million meals and care packs, in addition to medical supplies, across the region. The bank and DBS Foundation also disbursed a record SGD 9 million, including SGD 2 million in grants, to help social enterprises tide through the pandemic.\n\n## Becoming a technology company\n\nOver the past five years, DBS' transformation strategy has been focused on three pillars: being digital to the core, embedding ourselves in the customer journey and thinking and acting like a startup. While we have seen rising digital adoption over the years, Covid-19 accelerated these trends. In 2020, almost three in four customers applied for a mortgage online, compared to over one in three the previous year. DBS PayLah! usage also saw exponential growth.\n\n## Being digital to the core\n\nIn recent years, we have invested in cloud infrastructure and rearchitected our applications to be cloud ready. In 2020, we continued to push ahead of this front, with more than 99% of our applications now cloud-enabled, giving us greater efficiency and nimbleness. Through a focus on Site Reliability Engineering practice, we also improved system and application resiliency, enabling us to handle surges in digital traffic volumes without incident during the pandemic.\n\nWe made headway in becoming more datadriven. To optimise value from data to improve the customer experience and create new products and services, it is important that we\n\nIn India, where DBS operates as a wholly-owned subsidiary, we did a bolt-on transaction, giving us enlarged scale. This arose after the Reserve Bank of India approved the amalgamation of Lakshmi Vilas Bank (LVB) with DBS Bank India Limited (DBIL). The amalgamation which took effect from 27 November, complements DBS' digibank strategy with an expanded network of 600 branches and 1,000 ATMs, an additional two million retail and 125,000 non-retail customers, as well as a strengthened deposit franchise. Overlaying DBS' digital capabilities on LVB's customer base and network will accelerate our business in India. We expect to be profitable within one to two years.\n\nIn China, we are preparing to launch DBS Securities (China) Limited, a joint venture securities company. The Chinese capital markets are nascent, so as China integrates with global capital markets, there will be opportunity to build out our business in this area.\n\nIn spite of the US-China trade war, we made good progress on our Greater Bay Area strategy, inking a number of innovative, ground-breaking digital partnerships with platform companies. These include being the first foreign bank to partner Haier to provide digital financing to its distributors within 24 hours. We are also the first bank to partner JD Logistics on a digital platform to finance SMEs in the cross-border e-commerce import business.\n\n## Igniting new growth areas\n\nDBS has been studying and experimenting with emerging technologies over the years. We believe some of these have reached a tipping point, presenting new opportunities for growth.\n\nOne area is asset digitalisation, which has seen burgeoning growth, and has the potential to reshape capital markets. To ensure that DBS is ahead of the curve in welcoming the mainstream adoption of digital assets and currency trading, we commenced operations of a digital exchange in December. The DBS Digital Exchange offers tokenisation, trading and custody services of digital assets to institutional and accredited investors. It is 10% owned by the Singapore Exchange.\n\n## Advancing the sustainability agenda\n\nFor a few years now, DBS has been committed to advancing the sustainability agenda around the three pillars of responsible banking, responsible business practices and creating social impact.\n\nIn 2020, DBS continued to embed sustainability into the fabric of the business. We closed about SGD 9.6 billion in sustainable financing transactions, up 81% from the previous year.\n\nhave a data-driven culture, a centralised data source and clear governance around the use of data. Today, over 18,000 DBS employees have completed data training; 60% of relevant data is accessible from a single source; and a strong governance framework is in place to ensure responsible data usage.\n\nWe are also making progress in tapping emerging technology trends, such as in the areas of 5G, Internet of Things and public cloud.\n\n## Embedding ourselves in the customer journey\n\nAnother longstanding focus has been to embed ourselves in the customer journey, so that banking is simple, seamless and effortless. Work in this area continued unabated, and 2020 delivered some iconic wins. As an example, today, new-to-bank customers in Singapore can open a banking account with us digitally in just 15 clicks, or less than three minutes, which is best-in-class for the industry.\n\nRecognising that financial planning can be seen as complex and tedious, we sought to make the process insightful and actionable, yet simple and accessible. In April 2020, we launched DBS NAV Planner to help customers make more informed decisions about their money. In a short eight months, DBS NAV Planner delivered more than 30 million financial planning insights to customers. These capabilities were further supercharged in December with the launch of SGFinDex, the world's first public-private open banking initiative, allowing us to reach a wider pool of customers in Singapore.\n\n## Thinking and acting like a startup\n\nDBS has been successful in our digital transformation over the years because of a pervasive culture of experimentation, agility and innovation.\n\nIn 2020, we established an innovation framework and process to allow us to innovate at scale. Within the bank, we ran more than 40 experiments which will allow us to take advantage of big megatrends that will shape the future. We also continued to encourage a culture of intrapreneurship among our employees, both to bring innovative ideas to life and drive real change for business.\n\nIn addition, we continued to democratise technology skillsets among our employees, training more than 3,000 of them in the fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence/ Machine Learning through Amazon Web Services (AWS) DeepRacer, a gamified learning platform.\n\n## Scaling our business in large Asian markets\n\nAs an Asia-focused bank, it is important that we build a meaningful presence in the big markets of China, India and Indonesia.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nImportantly, we also published the Sustainable and Transition Finance Framework and Taxonomy - a first in the world by a bank - which serves as a transparent reference to guide clients on adapting and building resilience in the face of global challenges such as climate change and resource scarcity. DBS also became the first Singapore bank to offer transition financing to help companies implement long-term changes to become greener.\n\nDBS is also focused on financial inclusion - bringing the unbanked or underbanked into the formal banking sector. From April to June, we accelerated the opening of almost 60,000 bank accounts for migrant workers, so that they could bank digitally including remit money home from their dormitories amid the pandemic.\n\nAs a testament to the strides we are making in sustainability, DBS was named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (Asia-Pacific) for the third consecutive year, as well as the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index and the FTSE4Good Global Index for the fourth consecutive year.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nWe would like to express our gratitude to Euleen Goh, Andre Sekulic and Ow Foong Pheng, who are stepping down as board members in March 2021, for their invaluable contributions over the years. Euleen served as the Board Risk Management Committee chairperson at DBS for over 10 years, and her extensive knowledge and experience in the risk environment for banks has been instrumental in helping DBS navigate the complex, challenging and a constantly evolving risk landscape. She also served as the chairperson of the Board of the DBS Foundation since its establishment in February 2014. Although she is retiring as a Director of DBS Group Holdings and DBS Bank, she has graciously agreed to carry on serving as the Chairperson of DBS Foundation. Andre\n\nhas made significant contributions to the Board with his expertise and insights in the payments and consumer credit sector since his appointment to the Board in 2012 and served as the chairman of the Compensation and Management Development Committee since November 2018. As a senior Singapore civil servant, Foong Pheng has provided invaluable insights and perspectives from the public sector since her appointment to the Board in 2012.\n\n## Dividends\n\nThe Board has proposed a final dividend of SGD 18 cents per share for approval at the forthcoming annual general meeting. This will bring the dividend for the financial year to SGD 87 cents per share. In August 2020, DBS moderated its dividends in line with the Monetary Authority of Singapore's call for banks to preserve capital in these uncertain times. Given DBS' strong capital position, the bank will revisit dividends paid out if and when permitted.\n\n## Going forward\n\nWe will look back at 2020 as a seminal year and Covid-19 as a major inflection point.\n\nFor one, the pandemic dramatically accelerated digital consumption demand. Given this, we could start finding winners and losers in respect to banks who can cater to the new digital world and banks who can't.\n\nIn addition, it has underlined the importance of the environmental, social and governance agenda. Issues around inequity, the rich-and poor-divide and climate change, will be on the minds of governments and people in the next five to 10 years. All businesses, including financial institutions, will be under pressure to focus more greatly on stakeholder capitalism and not just shareholder capitalism.\n\nAt the same time, we must continue to invest in building digital capabilities, championing\n\nInterim DBS branding at the former LVB branch in Chembur, Mumbai, Maharashtra\n\nthe sustainability agenda, and in finding new avenues of growth.\n\nThe early downpayment we made in digital transformation, our broad-based franchise and focus on being a purpose-driven bank, position us well to ride these challenging times. With the grit and gumption of our people, and the support of you - our shareholders - and customers, we are confident of emerging from this storm as one of the winners.\n\nPeter Seah Chairman\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDBS Group Holdings\n\nPiyush Gupta Chief Executive Officer DBS Group Holdings\n\n<!-- image -->",

DBS provided funding to the liquiditystrapped, extended loan moratoriums to those needing reprieve and expedited the rollout of a number of digital solutions so that businesses and individuals could bank with us seamlessly from the safety of their homes.\n\n## Supporting industries hard-hit by Covid-19\n\nWorked with our technology partners to roll out the DBS F&B Digital Relief Package. This enabled close to 1,000 F&B establishments to build a digital presence and create new income streams online in as little as three days. This package was subsequently enhanced to include digital solutions for e-invoicing, accounting, HR, and payroll.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Supporting SMEs to transform digitally\n\nSupported SMEs such as Unidbox Hardware in their digital transformation journeys amid market lockdowns in the region. Unidbox owner Wong Hing Kong said this would help future-proof his business in case there was a resurgence of Covid-19 cases where he has to close his physical stores again. While online sales helped keep his business going during the circuit breaker period, DBS also provided a temporary bridging loan to provide the business added assurance amid the economic uncertainty.\n\n## Accelerating our digitalisation roadmap to provide support to businesses\n\nFast-tracked our multi-year digital roadmap to bridge gaps in last-mile processes to ensure businesses remain well supported amid disruptions. For instance, to minimise the need for paper-based application at trade counters, DBS was the first Singapore bank to introduce a comprehensive suite of 'contact-free' trade financing digital solutions, eliminating the need for the manual processing of trade financing solutions. This provided our corporate customers continued access to banking lines to keep their businesses chugging along despite lockdowns across markets globally.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Helping customers leverage digital solutions to access much-needed funds in double-quick time\n\nTo support the liquidity needs of SMEs, DBS launched several digital trade financing initiatives with anchor clients such as Haier Group and Infor to provide quicker and more cost-efficient financing to SMEs. DBS was also the first Asian bank on AntChain's blockchain trade platform, Trusple, which aims to democratise access to digital trade services to corporates of all sizes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Helping businesses realise their sustainability ambitions\n\nLaunched the world's first Sustainable and Transition Finance Framework and Taxonomy by a bank, which will form the bedrock for DBS to engage with clients who are furthering their sustainability agenda. The taxonomy will serve as a reference to guide clients to adapt and build resilience in the face of climate change, resource scarcity and address critical global issues such as social inequality.\n\n## Enabling businesses in critical industries to scale their operations during the pandemic\n\nSupported Chinese textile manufacturer Yibin Grace, which was designated as the only state-owned enterprise in China's Sichuan province to produce medical and anti-epidemic materials, to obtain financing to import a raw material which is scarce in China to produce medical masks in just two days. Besides receiving a loan, Yibin Grace was also issued a bank acceptance bill from DBS worth RMB 30 million for mask production purposes, which enabled the company to produce hundreds of thousands of masks within weeks.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Supporting micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) financially\n\nIn Singapore, provided liquidity relief support to MSMEs impacted by Covid-19 by offering Digital Business Loans of up to SGD 200,000 as quickly as the day after approval. We also simplified the credit documentation process to relieve MSMEs of the onerous task of producing audited financial statements typically required for such loans. In 2020, DBS approved more than 10,000 loans totalling more than SGD 5 billion to MSMEs, with the majority of loans being collateral-free.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Providing free Covid-19 insurance across markets\n\nPartnered with Chubb Insurance Singapore Limited (Chubb) to offer all five million DBS and POSB customers in Singapore complimentary insurance coverage in relation to Covid-19. Similar coverage policies were also introduced to our customers across the regional markets we operate in.\n\n## Providing loan moratoriums to help homeowners\n\nEnabled some 7,200 homeowners in Singapore and Hong Kong to successfully defer mortgage repayments, allowing them to focus their finances on other immediate needs.\n\n## Leveraging DBS' APIs to help customers unlock liquidity\n\nEnabled DBS India corporate customer TCIL, which is a leading integrated supply chain and logistics solutions provider in India, to facilitate instant payments to their truck drivers through DBS' APIs amid the pandemic. For TCIL, the DBS API solution also helped to strengthen the business' internal controls and enhance operational efficiencies while giving them real-time visibility to their liquidity position so that they can plan their working capital more optimally.",

For instance, we ran our inaugural 'LearnShareTeach TOGETHER' Virtual Festival and DBS FutureForward Week in April and July respectively, to encourage our employees to pick up new skills and to connect with colleagues through the sharing of knowledge and experiences. More than 120 learning sessions were organised in 2020, providing employees in Singapore and across the region access to a diverse range of courses to enhance their skillsets even as they worked from home during the pandemic.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Hiring talent in good and bad times\n\nDBS hired former system analyst Dawn Lum, who spent 14 years in the telecommunications industry as a trainee as part of the SGUnited Traineeships Programme.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Grit Employees\n\nCognisant that banking is an essential service, our people adapted quickly to the different circuit breaker and lockdown situations, as well as work from home arrangements. This ensured that our customers remained well-served during the pandemic.

In 2020, DBS trained over 3,000 employees in artificial intelligence/ machine learning through gamification. Going forward, more employees will be trained in these areas, as well as in design thinking, data and analytics and agile practices.\n\n## Developing a contact-tracing solution to protect our people\n\nEight departments in DBS Singapore came together in double-quick time to develop a contact-tracing tool to uncover the movements of employees affected by Covid-19. This enabled us to promptly identify employees who were first-, secondor third-degree contacts of potential Covid-19 cases, and to quarantine those at risk, protecting the health of all employees. The solution was also made available to DBS' key overseas offices.",

I did not agree, believing that at heart, we are social creatures. The need to engage with each other in the flesh is critical to creating social capital. It is also critical to create organisational culture and ethos.'\n\n## 2020 was undoubtedly a seminal year. What are some of the enduring shifts borne out of the pandemic? How do they affect the path forward for banking?\n\n2020 was indeed an inflexion point in a few ways, of which three stand out in my mind.\n\n- i) There has been a dramatic acceleration in the digital consumption of goods and services, especially healthcare, education, and financial services. In banking, lockdowns encouraged consumers to adopt digital behaviours for activities ranging from account maintenance to payments. This was also true for customers who had previously been less comfortable making the shift. Customers over 60 years of age saw a 2.4 times increase in new digital take-up! Similarly, from applying for loans to looking for trade finance, SMEs quickly pivoted to electronic instructions and engagement. Larger corporations revisited their supply chain arrangements and raced to put resiliency and transparency into the process.\n- ii)  Perhaps the biggest change has been a dramatic transformation in work habits as white-collar populations took to e-working remotely. This reflects a tremendous increase in capabilities (bandwidth, access equipment, security protocols) as well as corporate risk appetite. Depending on the country and regulatory requirements, 5090% of our people worked from home for large parts of the year.\n- iii)  Covid-19 has brought to fore the sustainability agenda, in particular social and environmental issues. The pandemic has accentuated socio-economic fault lines within countries, compelling governments to direct more fiscal resources to the poor. On the environmental front, the pandemic has sharpened the recognition of tail risks and that it is incumbent to be better prepared for them.\n\nGovernments had to dig deep for unprecedented amounts of fiscal and monetary resources to address the crisis. I believe the realisation that we can and will find resources when a gun is pointed at us, will lead to significantly greater resources being devoted to climate change and biodiversity in the coming years. Governments have already made significant commitments towards green initiatives. In the United States, President Joe Biden has pledged a USD 2 trillion climate\n\nplan. In Europe, a substantial portion of the European Union Recovery Fund will be made available for the green transition. In Singapore, the Emerging Stronger Taskforce is focused on building a more sustainable economy.\n\nThese trends have far-reaching implications on banking.\n\nThe digitalisation of banking will accelerate even more. For example, we have been focused on completing the 'last mile' gaps that came to light in our various customer journeys, and sharpening tools to embed banking services into the customer context. The use of digital authentication, e-signatures and digital documentation in trade finance or property conveyancing will gain steam, reducing the need for paper. Digital payments will continue to erode the use of cheques and cash, and tokenised assets will gain acceptance. Greater digital footprints will lead to an increased use of data and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to improve customer experience. I am pleased that DBS has made enormous progress on this front in recent years. The change in work habits will lead to what I call the 'future of work'. I talk about this more in the next section.\n\nFinally, banks will be pushed to having a sustainability agenda that addresses each of the ESG pillars and is integral to their strategy and operating models. We are already advanced on our journey of responsible banking, responsible business practices and creating social impact. Responsible banking includes being thoughtful about the financing we provide and the capital we help companies raise, focusing on financial inclusion for the unbanked and the underbanked, and creating a high level of trust in our services through transparency and fair dealing.\n\nWe will continue to lower our own carbon footprint (mostly from our data centres and our property occupancy) and work with our corporate clients to facilitate their move to lower carbon intensive business models. Finally, it will be even more incumbent on us to be a force for good in society. One avenue is the DBS Foundation, now in its seventh year, which continues to work with social enterprises to solve the world's sustainability issues.\n\n## What is DBS' take on the future of work? What is DBS doing to address the magnitude of the challenge?\n\nIn the early days of the crisis, many leaders suggested that the day of the 'office' was over, and remote working would be the new norm. I\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## CEO reflections\n\ndid not agree, believing that at heart, we are social creatures. The need to engage with each other in the flesh is critical to creating social capital. It is also critical to creating organisational culture and ethos. However, I also believe that we will not go back to the old ways of working. I believe that there are five critical changes that will drive the 'future of work'.\n\n- i) The workforce will be more distributed by location. In addition to catering for employee convenience, this will also be driven by the need to create greater resilience and the ability to source better talent. The different 'lockdown' requirements in different countries and markets showed us that concentrating large pools of employees in a single location comes with unforeseen risks. The ability to connect people from remote locations to our entire infrastructure created the possibility that we could have smaller teams of people work for us from regions where suitable talent is abundant. Therefore, we are revisiting the locations of our incremental engineering resources.\n- ii) There will be greater flexibility in respect of time and hours of work required. Some months into the crisis, we formed a 'Future of Work' Taskforce to think about our future work arrangements. The Taskforce found that while almost all employees were able to work seamlessly from home, staying engaged and connected with colleagues was challenging. They preferred hybrid work arrangements over a pure 'remote work' or 'work in office' approach. As a result, all employees have been given the flexibility to work from home up to 40% of the time but the actual execution of that is left to individual operating units to suit their own rhythm.\n\nOne interesting opportunity that arises from such flexibility is the idea of job sharing two people jointly taking on one job. Many companies experimented with this idea last year (without explicitly recognising it) when they resorted to Team A and Team B constructs in line with their contingency plans. At DBS, we have formally announced a job-sharing program. This sort of flexibility opens the possibility of leveraging additional sources of talent too, for example, mothers of young children or people with disabilities.\n\n- iii)  Work will be organised more horizontally rather than vertically. Today's organisational structures are largely functional, principally to gain subject matter competencies as well as economies of scale. However, all of us know the challenges this creates - silo thinking, hand-offs and ineffective customer journeys. In recent years, the comprehensive digitalisation of workflows allows us to revisit the vertical, functional paradigm. Several companies - including DBS have been experimenting with this through agile practices in the technology domain. I believe that this will extend to\n\nimpact on our commercial book was almost SGD 1.8 billion, which means there is another billion dollars to take.\n\n- In 2020, we were able to recoup almost all of the interest rate shortfall through an increase in business volumes as both loans and deposits grew strongly. In particular, current and saving accounts grew by almost SGD 100 billion. We also benefitted from record Treasury Markets income and through gains in our investment securities portfolio which had been positioned for a drop in interest rates.\n\nGains from investment securities and Treasury Markets performance are dependent on market conditions, and it is possible that we may not be able to repeat 2020's performance in 2021. However, we have greater visibility on loan growth given that economic activity is expected to rebound in 2021 from a low base. The IMF forecasts Asia to grow 6.9%, with China and India above 8%, Indonesia at 6%, and Singapore and Hong Kong at 3-5%. The business momentum will translate into mid-single-digit loan growth, in line with the average of recent years.\n\nFee income will also benefit. It was flat in 2020 because an 11% decline in the second quarter due to the sharp economic and financial market dislocations offset a record first quarter. Higher economic activity in 2021 should lead to doubledigit fee income growth. In particular, there has been strong momentum in wealth management. While low interest rates have played a role, we have been using our digitalisation capabilities and the advent of open banking to expand our reach to lower market segments with robotassisted portfolios, regular savings plans and budgeting tools.\n\nDigitalisation will bring additional growth prospects. The accelerated adoption of digital behaviours by customers creates opportunities for market share gains. There will also be new business opportunities, such as the Digital Exchange we launched in the fourth quarter.\n\nWe will continue to manage costs. Organic expenses for 2021 will be kept at 2019 levels even as we process higher business volumes.\n\nFinally, the amalgamation of Lakshmi Vilas Bank expands our presence with 600 branches and 1,000 ATMs, increases our consumer and SME customer base and strengthens our deposit franchise in India, accelerating our growth trajectory in a major emerging market.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPiyush Gupta Chief Executive Officer DBS Group Holdings\n\nareas outside technology too. Creating and running 'horizontal' organisations will be a big focus for us in the coming years.\n\n- iv)  Data will become central to managing work, and data-driven operating models (DDOM) will emerge. Take the F1 race: till a decade ago, the race was mostly driver-centric. Today, it is controlled by a data-driven team which uses real-time feeds to help guide the driver every step of the way. Running experiments and AI models will be an integral part of this new model. At DBS, we have embraced DDOM in earnest, and are already seeing visible outcomes.\n- v)  With people coming into office increasingly to 'collaborate and ideate', the physical contours of the office will also change. The need for a degree of social distancing may also drive this. We are advancing well in this direction through our 'Joyspace' programme, which allows each department to configure the workspace to suit their workflows. Going forward, we expect a lot more open and collaborative workspaces. We are also likely to see more usage of satellite offices.\n\nAll these changes will require significantly reskilling our workforce. Employees will be trained in emerging areas such as design thinking, data and analytics, artificial intelligence, machine learning and agile practices. We have identified over 7,200 employees across the bank to be upskilled and/ or reskilled from this year. Managers will have to learn how to manage differently, including how to drive employee engagement and measure performance. To help managers pivot to managing a horizontal workforce, we have launched transformational leadership programmes to help with their transition.\n\n## How will DBS navigate the challenges of low interest rates and asset quality risks?\n\nBetween the two challenges, asset quality risks are perhaps easier to deal with. The sharp rebound in several countries in the later part of 2020, as well as confidence from the vaccine rollout, create optimism that credit risks may not be as dire as originally forecast.\n\nOf the SGD 3 billion-5 billion we estimated as 2020-21 credit costs due to the pandemic, we have conservatively taken over SGD 3 billion in 2020, of which around SGD 1.7 billion was in the form of general allowances. If actual credit costs come in closer to SGD 4 billion, credit costs will be lower and provide a boost to earnings in 2021.\n\nLow interest rates pose a more prolonged challenge as they are expected to remain for the foreseeable future, resulting in an eventual reduction in our interest income by SGD 2.5 billion-SGD 3 billion. In 2020, the interest rate",

        "page_content": "## CFO statement\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'Despite the significant economic impact of the pandemic, business volumes for the year were higher or at least resilient, attesting to the quality of our broad-based franchise and nimble execution.'\n\n## Record operating results attest to the quality of our franchise and nimble execution\n\nWe reported net profit of SGD 4.72 billion for 2020, 26% below the record in the previous year. There were two factors for the decline. Net interest income, which accounted for twothirds of total income, fell 6% due to a lower net interest margin as central banks around the world cut interest rates in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. In addition, we more than quadrupled the amount of total allowances to SGD 3.07 billion as general allowances of SGD 1.71 billion were conservatively set aside for asset quality risks.\n\nDespite the significant economic impact of the pandemic, business volumes for the year were higher or at least resilient, attesting to the quality of our broad-based franchise and nimble execution. Loans grew 4%, fee income was stable and Treasury Markets achieved a record year. We also realised a tripling in gains from investment securities in a government-bond portfolio intended to benefit when interest rates fell. The healthy business momentum together with a well-constructed balance sheet enabled us to offset the impact of lower interest rates, and total income remained stable at SGD 14.6 billion.\n\nAt the same time, expenses were 2% lower at SGD 6.16 billion as we kept costs in check. The cost-income ratio was one percentage point lower at 42%. Profit before allowances rose 2% to a new high of SGD 8.43 billion.\n\n## Strong business momentum despite economic slowdown\n\nNet interest income declined 6% to SGD 9.08 billion due to a lower net interest margin, which fell 27 basis points to 1.62%. Given that the interest rate cuts were made in March, the majority of the net interest margin decline occurred in the second and third quarters. The lower interest rates set back full-year net interest income for the commercial book by SGD 1.78 billion compared to 2019.\n\nLoan growth provided a partial offset to the impact of lower interest rates. Loans grew 4% or SGD 16 billion in constant-currency terms to SGD 371 billion, including SGD 2 billion from Lakshmi Vilas Bank (LVB), which was amalgamated on 27 November 2020.\n\nNon-trade corporate loans grew 9% or SGD 19 billion to SGD 221 billion. The majority of the growth was to customers in Singapore, which included SGD 5 billion of government risk-sharing loans, followed by Hong Kong. By industry, the growth included tenanted commercial real estate at loan-to-value (LTV) ratios of around 65% and short-term facilities for major commodity firms.\n\nDue to the sharp economic contraction between the first and second quarters that coincided with financial market dislocations, non-trade corporate loan growth was skewed to the first half as customers drew down short-term facilities to ensure sufficient liquidity in addition to longer-term borrowing. As the economy rebounded and financial markets stabilised from the third quarter, some of the short-term loans were repaid in the second half. The overall pipeline and underlying loan momentum were healthy over the course of the year.\n\nTrade loans fell 13% or SGD 6 billion to SGD 38 billion. The decline occurred in the first quarter, when lower oil prices reduced transaction values, and the fourth quarter, when tighter pricing made trade loans less attractive to roll over.\n\nHousing loans were little changed at SGD 74 billion. While new bookings were strong over the course of the year (with the exception of the second quarter, when the circuit-breaker was in effect), the impact was offset by higher repayments. Housing loans contracted in the second and third quarters and rose in the fourth quarter following strong bookings in the second half as market transactions picked up. Full-year bookings rose 28% to the highest since 2012, when cooling measures were first introduced.\n\nWe had record deposit inflows, which were sustained over the course of the year. In particular, current and savings accounts (Casa), which were lower cost, expanded 42% or SGD 99 billion to SGD 338 billion, enabling us to let go of more expensive fixed deposits. As a result, the Casa ratio improved from 59% to 73%. Total deposits grew 15% or SGD 61 billion to SGD 465 billion, including SGD 3 billion from LVB. With deposits growing faster than loans, the loan-deposit ratio fell from 89% to 80%.\n\nWhile the fiscal stimulus and monetary easing pervading the year created the conditions, it was the strength of our deposit franchise that enabled the massive Casa inflows. Our digital capabilities entrenched our long-standing dominance in consumer savings deposits\n\nand strengthened a cash management franchise now recognised as among the best in the world. SGD and USD, our two principal currencies, each accounted for around half of the Casa inflows during the year. Our market share of total SGD deposits rose from 24% in 2019 to 27% as our share of current deposits rose from 16% to 21% while our share of savings deposits was maintained at 52%.\n\nExcess deposits were placed with the central bank where they earned a lower spread than loans and resulted in a six-basis-point erosion in net interest margin. However, they added to net interest income and were accretive to return on equity (ROE) since central bank placements did not incur any risk weighting. With easy monetary conditions expected to persist, we aimed to maximise net interest income and ROE rather than net interest margin.\n\nNet fee income was little changed at SGD 3.06 billion. A 14% increase in the first quarter to a quarterly record was offset by an 11% decline in the second quarter as transactions fell with lockdowns in the region. Fee income was stable in the second half compared to the previous year as economic activity rebounded from the second-quarter trough.\n\nWealth management fees grew 11% to a record SGD 1.43 billion, with the first and third quarters being the two highest on record. Demand for investment products increased with healthy risk appetite in the first quarter and improved market sentiment in a low interest rate environment in the second half. Brokerage commissions increased 31% to SGD 149 million with higher stock market volumes and a surge in new digital account openings helped by a streamlining of our stockbroking business. Loan-related fees were 2% higher at SGD 417 million.\n\nThese increases were offset by lower card and investment banking fees. Card fees fell 19% to SGD 641 million as they bottomed in the second quarter with a 34% decline from the year-ago period when economies in the region were locked down. The decline moderated to 21% in the third quarter and 12% in the fourth quarter even as spending on travel remained subdued. Investment banking fees were 31% lower at SGD 148 million with record fixed income fees more than offset by a fall in equity capital market activity. Transaction service fees were stable at SGD 746 million.\n\nOther income rose 32% to a record SGD 2.46 billion. Investment gains tripled to SGD 963 million as bond portfolios performed strongly with falling interest rates. Trading income was at SGD 1.41 billion, the second highest on record, as treasury customer income rose to a new high.\n\nBy business unit, Consumer Banking/ Wealth Management income declined 8% to SGD 5.77 billion. The impact of lower interest rates as well as lower bancassurance and cards fees were moderated by higher income from loan and\n\nindustry to carry out the stress tests. The largest vulnerable exposure was to oil and gas, which was stressed using oil prices at USD 20 per barrel while keeping borrowers' operating costs fixed. Among the segments in this sector, support services were estimated to continue being the most vulnerable. While we had already conservatively recognised three-fifths of our support services exposure as NPA and taken appropriate allowances in 2017, the pandemic had worsened its fragility. As a result, we expected that more allowances were needed for this segment.\n\n## Conservatively front-loaded credit costs by taking SGD 3.07 billion in total allowances in 2020\n\nWe took a conservative approach and frontloaded the two-year estimated credit costs by taking general allowances of SGD 1.71 billion in 2020. As a result, general allowance reserves increased 72% to SGD 4.31 billion, 42% above the MAS minimum requirement. The reserves also exceeded the maximum amount eligible for consideration as Tier 2 capital by SGD 1.5 billion, forming a buffer that can absorb losses without impacting capital adequacy ratios.\n\nSpecific allowances nearly doubled to SGD 1.35 billion or 31 basis point of loans. As was to be expected, new NPA formation increased as the number of defaults rose across the region with the economic slowdown. After recoveries and write-offs, NPA increased 16% to SGD 6.69 billion and the NPL rate rose slightly to 1.6%, which was within the range of recent years.\n\nTotal allowances more than quadrupled to SGD 3.07 billion, exceeding the low-end of the SGD 3 billion-5 billion range. Total allowance reserves increased 46% to SGD 7.33 billion and the allowance coverage was at 110% and at 206% after considering collateral of SGD 3.12 billion.\n\nThe initial round of government loan moratoriums in Singapore, which had involved repayment holidays either for the principal or for both principal and interest, expired at yearend. They were replaced by more restricted relief measures requiring partial repayments. Compared to the initial moratoriums, the take-up rates for the new schemes fell to 10% for housing loan and 25% for SME customers as at January 2021. In Hong Kong, where the moratoriums were extended to mid-2021, loans under moratorium to large-corporate and SME customers were half their peak. Delinquency rates for the portfolios not under moratorium were also low.\n\n## Capital ratios remain strong\n\nOur capital adequacy ratios remained strong. The Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was little changed at 13.9% as loan growth was offset\n\ndeposit growth and wealth management sales. Institutional Banking income declined 5% to SGD 5.75 billion as the impact of lower interest rates more than offset higher income from loans and treasury products. Treasury Markets income increased 54% to SGD 1.44 billion as market volatility created opportunities for trading.\n\nExpenses were 2% lower at SGD 6.16 billion as general expenses such as for travel and advertising declined. Staff costs were little changed with an increase in base salaries due to a higher headcount offset by lower bonus accruals and by government grants. The cost-income ratio improved one percentage point to 42%.\n\n## Rigorous process to estimate credit costs\n\nWe carried out a stress test of the portfolio at the onset of the pandemic, analysing the loan book using two approaches as part of a corroborating process to ensure rigour. The first approach was a top-down view of the impact of macroeconomic variables on various loan portfolios. The second was a bottom-up analysis using various stress assumptions on individual borrowers or portfolios. A base scenario and stress scenario were used for each approach. We identified the unsecured consumer and SME portfolios as being more vulnerable, together with large corporates in several industries including oil and gas. The stress tests derived estimated credit costs of SGD 3 billion-5 billion, or 80-130 basis points of loans, over 2020-21. The estimate was in line with two-year credit costs during past economic crises. The estimate was revalidated in a second exercise later in the year.\n\nUnsecured consumer loans, which have historically been a small part of the portfolio, amounted to SGD 5 billion or 1% of total loans. More than half were in Singapore, where borrowing limits were halved over the past four years, which meant that riskier exposures had been removed. In Hong Kong, the next largest exposure, the portfolio had been under stress in recent years and we had already taken some allowances for it.\n\nHousing loans, which formed the majority of the consumer portfolio, were expected to remain healthy. A combination of conservative lending standards and LTV well below regulatory thresholds conferred significant resilience on the portfolio.\n\nFor SME loans, which amounted to SGD 41 billion or 11% of total loans, borrowers in Singapore and Hong Kong accounted for 90% of a portfolio that was largely secured by property with conservative LTV.\n\nFor large corporate loans, we identified several sectors that were more vulnerable. For each industry, we used conditions specific to the",

The ratio was well above regulatory requirements as well as the management operating range of 12.5-13.5%.\n\nDuring the year we issued USD 1 billion of Additional Tier 1 (AT1) perpetual capital securities with a yield of 3.30%. These were the lowest-yielding USD AT1 instruments ever priced under Basel III and were 30 basispoints lower than the previous global record, which was held by our USD 750 million AT1 issuance in 2016.\n\n## Total shareholder returns\n\nOur share price declined 3% during the year. A sharp fall in February and March was clawed back in the subsequent months, a pattern that mirrored global equity markets. The share price outperformed the Straits Times Index, which ended the year 12% lower.\n\nFor the calendar year, we paid out a dividend of SGD 1.02 per share. We paid out SGD 33 cents per share for fourth-quarter 2019 and firstquarter 2020. In July the Monetary Authority of Singapore called on local banks to limit their dividend to 60% of their previous level, which restricted our dividend for the second and third quarters of 2020 to SGD 18 cents per share.\n\nAs a result we delivered total shareholder returns of 1%, comprising the share price movement and dividend during the calendar year.\n\n## (A) Digitalisation\n\nThe number of digital customers in the Consumer and SME businesses in Singapore and Hong Kong increased by 11% or 0.4 million during the year to 3.7 million, with digital adoption accelerating during Covid-19 lockdowns. As a result, the proportion of digital customers rose to 57% from 52% in 2019, 48% in 2018 and 42% in 2017 due to new customer acquisition and customer migration from the traditional segment.\n\nA typical digital customer continued to generate more than twice as much revenue as a traditional customer. A digital customer's revenue was also more resilient because of greater product diversification and a higher number of transactions. The cost-income ratio of the digital segment was 30 percentage points below the traditional segment, with the differential widening from 20 percentage points in 2019. The ROE differential was maintained at 11 percentage points.\n\nThe reported cost-income ratio of the overall business increased five percentage points to 44% due to a lower net interest margin. On an underlying basis, including normalising for the decline in net interest margin, the cost-income ratio improved one percentage point to 44% due to lower costs.\n\ndirect risk implications for DBS India. We also made suitable provisions for legal liabilities in the normal course of business.\n\n## Outlook\n\nWe closed 2020 on an encouraging note. Business momentum was healthy, with loan growth more broad-based in the fourth quarter than the previous two while fee income remained resilient. The pipeline for loans and the outlook for several fee income streams as we enter 2021 are healthy. At the same time, asset quality trends have not been as severe as expected. If two-year credit costs come in around the middle of the SGD 3 billion-5 billion range, and having taken SGD 3.07 billion already, allowance charges in 2021 would revert to normalised levels. If these assumptions play out, earnings will be higher in the coming year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Chng Sok Hui\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nDBS Group Holdings\n\n## Lakshmi Vilas Bank (LVB)\n\nThe amalgamation of LVB complements DBS' digibank strategy with an expanded network of 600 branches and 1,000 ATMs, an additional two million retail and 125,000 nonretail customers, as well as a strengthened deposit franchise. It also accelerates our growth trajectory in a key emerging market and gives us a more balanced geographical mix between northern and southern Asia outside of Singapore. Once the integration is complete, customers will be able to access our products and services, including the digital banking services that have won global accolades.\n\nThe provisional goodwill from amalgamation of Lakshmi Vilas bank was SGD 153 million, being the difference between the fair value of its assets and liabilities of SGD 3.89 billion and SGD 4.04 billion respectively. Total loans transferred amounted to SGD 2.14 billion, including net non-performing loans of SGD 212 million. Additional general allowances were set aside at group level to pre-emptively build up general allowance reserves to 9.5% of LVB's performing loans.

The impact of lower interest rates as well as lower bancassurance and cards fees were moderated by higher income from loan and deposit growth and wealth management sales. Expenses were stable at SGD 3.29 billion. Total allowances almost doubled to SGD 456 million from higher general and specific allowances.\n\nInstitutional Banking income declined 5% to SGD 5.75 billion as the impact of lower interest rates more than offset higher income from loans and treasury customer flows. Expenses were stable at SGD 1.99 billion. Total allowances increased to SGD 1.49 billion due to higher general and specific allowances.\n\nTreasury Markets income increased 54% to SGD 1.44 billion due to higher contributions from interest rate, equity, foreign exchange and credit activities. Expenses rose 3% to SGD 634 million.\n\nThe Others segment encompasses the results of corporate decisions that are not attributed to business segments as well as the contribution of LVB as its activities have not been aligned with the Group's segment definitions. The segment includes earnings on capital deployed into high quality assets, earnings from non-core asset sales and certain other head office items such as centrally raised allowances. Total income rose 33% to SGD 1.64 billion as higher gains on investment securities more than offset lower net interest income from the deployment of shareholders' funds. Total allowances amounted to SGD 1.11 billion as higher general allowances were conservatively set aside.\n\n## Reported vs underlying cost-income ratio\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| (SGD million)                      | Consumer  Banking/ Wealth  Management   | Institutional  Banking   | Treasury  Markets   | Others   | Total   |\n|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------|----------|---------|\n| Year 2020                          |                                         |                          |                     |          |         |\n| Net interest income                | 3,339                                   | 3,995                    | 840                 | 902      | 9,076   |\n| Net fee and commission      income | 1,869                                   | 1,160                    | -                   | 29       | 3,058   |\n| Other non-interest      income     | 559                                     | 590                      | 596                 | 713      | 2,458   |\n| Total income                       | 5,767                                   | 5,745                    | 1,436               | 1,644    | 14,592  |\n| Expenses                           | 3,288                                   | 1,987                    | 634                 | 249      | 6,158   |\n| Total allowances                   | 456                                     | 1,485                    | 14                  | 1,111    | 3,066   |\n| Profit before tax                  | 2,023                                   | 2,273                    | 788                 | 284      | 5,368   |\n| Year 2019                          |                                         |                          |                     |          |         |\n| Net interest income                | 4,037                                   | 4,309                    | 138                 | 1,141    | 9,625   |\n| Net fee and commission      income | 1,790                                   | 1,225                    | -                   | 37       | 3,052   |\n| Other non-interest      income     | 472                                     | 539                      | 794                 | 62       | 1,867   |\n| Total income                       | 6,299                                   | 6,073                    | 932                 | 1,240    | 14,544  |\n| Expenses                           | 3,280                                   | 2,015                    | 614                 | 349      | 6,258   |\n| Total allowances                   | 242                                     | 327                      | (5)                 | 139      | 703     |\n| Profit before tax                  | 2,777                                   | 3,731                    | 323                 | 752      | 7,583   |",

Benchmark interest rates used for pricing loans declined as central banks aggressively cut them. Most of the margin pressure occurred in the second and third quarters.\n\nIn constant-currency terms, gross loans rose 4% or SGD 16 billion to SGD 378 billion, including SGD 2 billion from LVB. The increase was led by a 9% or SGD 19 billion increase in non-trade corporate loans led by Singapore and Hong Kong customers. Trade loans fell 13% or SGD 6 billion. Consumer loans were little changed as housing loans were stable.\n\nIn constant-currency terms, deposits rose by a record 15% or SGD 61 billion to SGD 465 billion, including SGD 3 billion from LVB. Casa deposits grew SGD 99 billion, enabling more expensive fixed deposits to be let go. As a result, the Casa mix rose from 59% to 73%. Our market share of total SGD deposits increased three percentage points to 27% as our share of current deposits grew five percentage points to 21% while our share of savings deposits was maintained at 52%.\n\n## (D) Non-interest income\n\nNet fee income was little changed at SGD 3.06 billion.\n\nWealth management fees grew 11% to a record SGD 1.43 billion, with the first and third quarters being the two highest on record. Demand for investment products increased with healthy risk appetite in the first quarter and improved market sentiment in a low interest rate environment in the second half. Brokerage commissions increased 31% to SGD 149 million with higher stock market volumes and new digital account openings.

Card fees fell 19% to SGD 641 million as they bottomed in the second quarter with a 34% decline from the year-ago period and progressively recovered in the second half. Investment banking fees were 31% lower at SGD 148 million as record fixed income fees were more than offset by a fall in equity capital market activity. Transaction service fees were stable at SGD 746 million.\n\nOther non-interest income rose 32% to a record SGD 2.46 billion. Investment gains tripled to SGD 963 million as bond portfolios performed strongly with falling rates. Trading income was SGD 1.41 billion, the second highest on record, as treasury customer income rose to a new high.\n\n## (E) Expenses\n\nExpenses were 2% lower at SGD 6.16 billion as spending on general expenses such as for travel and advertising declined. Staff costs were little changed with an increase in base salaries due to a higher headcount offset by lower bonus accruals and by government grants. The cost-income ratio improved one percentage point to 42%.\n\n## (F) Asset quality and allowances\n\nNew non-performing asset formation increased as the number of defaults rose across the region with the economic slowdown. After recoveries and write-offs, NPA increased 16% to SGD 6.69 billion and the NPL rate rose slightly to 1.6%, which was within the range of recent years. Specific allowances nearly doubled to SGD 1.35 billion or 31 basis points of loans.\n\nWe took a conservative approach and frontloaded the two-year estimated credit costs by taking general allowances of SGD 1.71 billion in 2020. As a result, general allowance reserves increased 72% to SGD 4.31 billion, 42% above the MAS minimum requirement. The reserves also exceeded the maximum amount eligible for consideration as Tier 2 capital by SGD 1.5 billion.\n\nTotal allowances more than quadrupled to SGD 3.07 billion, exceeding the low-end of the SGD 3 billion-5 billion range.

We sharpened our focus on cost management and the emerging affluent segment in Indonesia and India.\n\nOur SME strategy delivered mixed results with good expense discipline across all growth markets. While our markets in India and China performed well, with strong overall revenue growth averaging around 25% over 2019, markets in Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong saw a decrease in overall revenue.\n\nWe continued to build a meaningful presence in our large Asian markets. In India, our wholly owned subsidiary (WOS) business became profitable since its launch in 2019, driven by strong business performance in seven WOS branches. Lakshmi Vilas Bank was amalgamated with DBS India in November 2020 as a bolt-on complementing our digibank strategy.\n\nDespite continued geopolitical uncertainties and an escalating trade war, we managed to scale our Greater Bay Area (GBA) business, differentiating ourselves through innovative digital financing programs with platform partners like JD Logistics and Haier. We also made good progress in setting up our Securities Joint Venture (SJV) in China which will create new opportunities to build out our capital markets business.\n\nRead more about this in the Letter from the Chairman and CEO on pages 8 to 11, Head of Institutional Banking Statement on pages 38 and 39, Head of Consumer Banking/ Wealth Management Statement on pages 40 and 41.\n\n## Selected Areas of Focus\n\n|                                    | KPI/ Target                                                                                             | Outcome                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Building a  Sustainable  Franchise | Strengthen our risk  and compliance  framework and  drive efforts  in responsible  banking, responsible | We continued to strengthen our risk monitoring and credit assessment capabilities, with our  compliance team developing a dynamic risk assessment tool powered by AI and machine learning  to improve the efficacy and effectiveness of transaction monitoring.

We continue to leverage technology to tackle financial crime risk and strengthen our cyber security defence.'\n\n## Top and emerging risks\n\nThe Board and senior management drive a robust process to identify and monitor our top and emerging risks. This year, Covid-19 unexpectedly ranked top of the list, and we took steps to manage the credit, liquidity, and operational risks arising from it. In addition to the pandemic, we focused our attention on (i) Environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, (ii) Financial crime risk, (iii) Data governance risk and (iv) Cyber security and data protection.\n\n## Credit risk and portfolio management\n\nIn 2020, we saw economic growth stalling unexpectedly with the outbreak of Covid-19. The resulting lockdowns in multiple countries caused supply chain disruption and global demand contraction.\n\nWe conducted extensive thematic portfolio reviews on the impact of the global pandemic. Our initial portfolio reviews were geographically focused, covering Greater China and Singapore. As the pandemic quickly spread across the world, the subsequent reviews adopted an industry focus, which included highly impacted industries such as oil and gas, aviation, hotels, retail, food and beverage. From the various reviews conducted, our overall portfolio was assessed to be resilient with relevant risk mitigation strategies in place.\n\nThe nature of our exposure to the oil and gas segment has changed in recent years and the bulk of our current exposure is to investmentgrade producers and processors, comprising mainly oil majors and state-owned companies. In addition, we have scaled back and been disciplined with our oil traders' exposure over the years. However, we recognised a major non-performing loan during the first quarter of the year. Our portfolio is generally assessed to be stable. Lately, the oil price has recovered to above USD 50 per barrel, which is higher than our stress testing assumption.\n\nThe majority of our aviation portfolio is to national flag carriers, global aircraft leasing companies as well as leasing companies affiliated to large banks. While the credit quality of our aviation portfolio remains satisfactory, we will continue to monitor the portfolio closely, which is dependent on the containment of the Covid-19 situation and resumption of travel.\n\nDue to volatile commodity prices and heightened fraud risk, key industry players came together to establish a code of best practices for commodity financing. The code was announced by the Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS) in November 2020. DBS remains active in trade finance, and we view the establishment of the code as a major positive development to support the financing of commodity players.\n\nOverall, our corporate and institutional banking portfolio is diversified across industry and business segments, with approximately 75% to investment-grade borrowers.\n\nThe small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) segment is expected to be more vulnerable during the downturn. Most of our SME exposure is in Singapore and Hong Kong, and is predominantly secured against properties with prudent loan-to-value (LTV). Our growth in loans to the SMEs in 2020 is mainly attributed to relief loans to the Singapore SMEs which are 90% secured by the Singapore government.\n\nOur residential mortgages are also primarily in Singapore and Hong Kong. The majority of our exposure is for owner occupation. Overall, our housing mortgages are mostly well secured with relatively low LTVs. Unsecured consumer credit loans constitute less than 2% of the bank's total loan exposure. With unemployment likely to rise, we expect some deterioration in our portfolio, but overall credit quality should remain healthy.\n\nWe continue to watch the macroeconomic developments closely as the global pandemic situation evolves.\n\nThe mainland China economy has rebounded after the steep contraction during the first quarter of the year. The Covid-19 situation also appears to be under control in Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Our exposure to these locations constitutes more than 80% of our total corporate and institutional banking portfolio, and we have been proactive in managing our risk. In Indonesia and India, our portfolios comprise largely lending to large corporates, and remain resilient amid the Covid-19 environment. Nevertheless, given that the pandemic still affects the European and US markets, and coupled with resurgence risk, the global economic activity is not expected to return to pre-pandemic levels in the near term. Tensions between the US and China as well as the de-coupling of the supply chain across the world are also likely to persist.\n\nGiven the ongoing macroeconomic challenges, we will continue to exercise prudence in our client selection and credit underwriting criteria, as well as closely monitor our portfolio.\n\nWe continue to enhance our credit underwriting capabilities leveraging traditional and non-traditional data sources, and through ecosystem partnerships. In 2020, we experimented with new credit underwriting models for the Singapore SME segment. We also furthered our collaboration with ecosystem partners in markets such as India, Indonesia, and China to enable lending to the underserved consumer segment.\n\nWe continued our multi-year credit architecture programme (CAP) journey which includes putting in place a robust credit risk data infrastructure and workflow management system, underpinned by modern technology architecture to support our Institutional Banking Group (IBG). By the end of 2020, we had launched the core modules of CAP in most of our locations. In addition, the Credit E-Memo, a key module of CAP, was one of the 12 winners among 40 finalists in the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) FinTech Awards 2020. The award is a testament to our goals towards reimagining credit.\n\n## Managing liquidity risks during increased market volatility due to Covid-19\n\nWith the outbreak of Covid-19 globally, the US dollar wholesale funding market froze in March 2020. As a precautionary measure, we took early action to increase customer deposits to further strengthen our funding liquidity profile. Subsequently, from April 2020, central banks' actions to assure wholesale market liquidity led to a more benign funding environment. Our liquidity profile remains well-diversified with multiple avenues to access further wholesale funding and customer deposits whenever necessary.\n\n## Managing operational risks amidst Covid-19 disruptions\n\nWhen remote working arrangements were activated during the pandemic, we developed new processes or revised existing processes to ensure that the bank's operations were not disrupted. Key operational risks were identified, assessed and mitigated or residual risks accepted according to the established governance process. In addition, we worked with our material outsourced service providers to ensure service delivery was not adversely impacted.\n\nThe experience and learnings from managing operational risks during the pandemic accelerated our digital transformation and\n\n## Cyber security and data protection\n\nAs the bank adopts work from home measures, we expedited the implementation of our cyber security initiatives to mitigate potential incremental security threats from possible security risk exposures. We reinforced and scaled up the internal environment to ensure the network is secured and healthy for staff working remotely. Cyber security subject matter experts were further engaged to validate our control environment and key processes to provide assurance on our cyber security programme and controls. Along with our digital transformation, we continue to invest in innovative security controls. We also believe that people are integral to overall cyber defence and further enhanced our staff security awareness through training.\n\nRead more about our principal risks and risk management approach on pages 76 to 94.\n\nTan Teck Long Chief Risk Officer DBS Group Holdings\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2021 Focus Areas\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \uf075 Further refine and streamline end-toend credit processes across all markets\n- \uf075 Enhance our existing credit underwriting capabilities\n- \uf075 Mitigate financial crime risk\n- \uf075 Further deepen our credit and portfolio management capabilities\n- Institutional Banking \uf075 Continue to strengthen our multilayered cyber security defence\n\nenhanced controls in the digital solutions offered to our customers and employees. We also successfully mitigated the cyber security and data protection risks associated with remote working (Refer to 'Cyber security and data protection').\n\n## Environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks incorporated into credit risk management and sustainable finance\n\nIn 2020, we added a new ESG sector guide for the apparel, footwear and textile industry.\n\nWith the issuance of the Environmental Risk Management Guidelines for Financial Institutions by the MAS, we spearheaded the development of a handbook, which forms the basis for industry-wide training to build capacity and capability.\n\nIn July 2020, we launched the Sustainable and Transition Finance Framework and Taxonomy, to guide our business originations and advisory efforts in this area. We concluded 50 transactions covering sustainability-linked loans, renewable financing and other green loans, amounting to SGD 9.6 billion.\n\nRead more about 'Responsible financing' in the Sustainability Report.\n\n## Financial crime risk\n\nLeveraging technology and data analytics, substantial progress was made to enhance our systems to further mitigate financial crime risk. Over the years, we heightened our risk surveillance at various levels. We used artificial intelligence at the transaction level, dynamic analytical reviews at the customer level, and macro analysis of fund flows at the country level. We also continued to focus on public-private sector collaboration, developing a platform for risk information sharing between financial institutions and law enforcement agencies.\n\n## Data governance risk\n\nWe recognise that responsible practices around data governance are key for customer and stakeholder trust. We continue to develop our data governance framework along three prisms. Firstly, a baseline prism encompassing data lineage, data quality, and legal and regulatory compliance. Secondly, an ethical prism - PURE (Purposeful, Unsurprising, Respectful and Explainable) for the responsible use of data. And thirdly, a model governance covering regulated and artificial intelligence models and their performance over time.",

        "page_content": "## CIO statement\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'We could respond nimbly to the crisis because of the technology investments we made over the years. We will accelerate our technology transformation efforts to pull further ahead with our digital advantage to better serve our customers.'\n\nAt the start of 2020, few could have foreseen the turmoil that the Covid-19 pandemic would create. The silver lining to this is that our digital transformation investments over the last eight years helped position us well to face the crisis. Our digital readiness enabled us to support our customers, employees and the wider community.\n\n## Taking on a pandemic\n\nThe pandemic tested the readiness of both the 'hardware' and 'heartware' of organisations. We could respond nimbly because of our modern technology stack, enterprise adoption of Agile, and two-in-a-box platform-based organisational structure (where Business and Technology groups work together as equal partners).\n\nFor our employees, our early adoption of Cloud and our Mobility First strategy was a boon when we transited to home-based working arrangements. Over 90% of our workforce were already using laptops. Owing to our flexible private cloud infrastructure, and ability to increase the Virtual Private Network (VPN) and Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) capacity at short notice, we pivoted quickly with almost no loss of productivity. We achieved a first in managing production continuity with 100% of our developers working from home.\n\nTo enable our employees to work securely from home, our security controls were as stringent as the controls for our customers with our 'Inside is the New Outside' strategy. Advanced security solutions such as web isolation and content sanitation enabled us to scale up our infrastructure safely and securely. We further heightened our security monitoring and staff awareness with CYBRFIT, a gamified campaign, and ongoing phishing exercises.\n\nTo enhance the safety of our employees at the workplace, we used our data infrastructure, analytics capabilities and reusable library of Artificial Intelligence (AI)/ Machine Learning (ML) models to develop a contact-tracing app for employees in just three days. The data analytics also allowed us to monitor the density of people in our workplace and ensure adherence to safe distancing measures.\n\nFor our customers, we worked closely with the Singapore government to fast-track relief measures. To allay our customers' anxiety, we configured chatbots to guide them in applying for Covid-19 relief measures during Singapore's circuit breaker period. We also accelerated the\n\nrollout of DBS DigiDocs to enable corporate customers in Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan and China to initiate transactions and submit supporting documents digitally.\n\nTo better support migrant workers during the pandemic, cross-functional teams helped them adopt digital banking solutions such as DBS digibank and POSB Jolly. This availed them with uninterrupted access to banking services while they were in quarantine, ensuring they could remit funds back home. Additionally, the teams also ensured Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) were replenished at the dormitories for migrant workers to fulfil their cash needs.\n\n## Pressing on with our technology transformation\n\nAmid a challenging landscape, we rearchitected our backend and middleware layers in five key areas: Cloud, Blockchain, Data Analytics, AI/ ML and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE). This readiness served us well in 2020 and we will continue to build on efforts in these areas.\n\n## Cloud\n\nWe made further progress on our Virtual Private Cloud infrastructure by moving to a hybrid multicloud infrastructure. This layer of abstraction and moving towards containerisation enabled greater agility, reduction of infrastructure costs and improvements in resiliency and scalability of apps.\n\n## Blockchain\n\nDBS will leverage blockchain technology to provide an ecosystem for fundraising through asset tokenisation and secondary trading of digital assets through the DBS Digital Exchange. Our Institutional Investors and Accredited Investors can now tap into a fully integrated tokenisation, trading and custody ecosystem for digital assets, including services around Security Token Offerings, Digital Currency Exchange, and Digital Custody.\n\n## Data Analytics\n\nOur stable and scalable data infrastructure, ADA (Advancing DBS with AI), can handle high volumes of data. We have created a library of reusable assets for AI/ ML models and analytics to reduce time and effort in delivering ML deployment and shortening the deployment lifecycle. This elevates us towards customerdriven investment recommendations and hyper-personalised banking.\n\nOur AI/ ML capabilities drive our chatbot technology. Powered by Natural Language Processing capabilities, our chatbot went bilingual with English and Traditional Chinese in 2020, making it more accessible to customers in Hong Kong. Chatbot usage volume increased from 350,000 to 400,000 unique conversations, with 82% of requests self-fulfilled by customers. Looking ahead, we plan to use sentiment analysis by integrating text, voice and video data to enhance our conversational chatbot capability.\n\n## SRE\n\nOur systems and applications proved to be resilient, reliable and scalable, even as traffic volumes and application deployments surged during the pandemic due to accelerated digital adoption. We improved on our controls, with close to 100 key applications being SREcertified and 4,000 employees upskilled in SRE practices.\n\nWe implemented predictive analytics through machine learning to aid automating capacity planning for critical systems. ML also improved traceability, detection and recovery capability through quicker identification of bottlenecks in our customer journeys. In 2021, we will focus on SRE-driven auto error remediation, predictive chaos testing and capacity management.\n\n## Opening a realm of possibilities with future technologies\n\n5G and other emerging technologies will play an outsized role in a post-pandemic world. The bank's 'innovation radar' is based on nine Big Themes, a set of disruptive trends and technologies that includes blockchain, AI and multi-cloud adoption, which create an ecosystem for constant innovation.\n\nIn preparation for the 5G era, we conducted end-to-end tests of our contactless ATM and Video Teller Machine (VTM). The 5G contactless ATM combines different technologies that eliminates the need for physical cables and can be placed anywhere. With contactless VTMs, our customers can be authenticated via facial verification using biometric data, instead of an ATM card or pin number.\n\nAnother key building block is transforming our Operations to benefit customers and employees. With the OPPR (Operations Processes and Platform Re-engineering) programme, we accelerated our process automation to enable Straight-ThroughProcessing capability with 8% productivity saves year-on-year. This enabled us to support increased processing volumes with the same staff strength over the last five years.\n\nMoving forward, this will accelerate the delivery of an omni-digital experience to pre-empt and pro-actively service customer needs. We can better manage risk by improving operational\n\nworking parents more flexibility. With 5G as a key enabler, technology will make it possible to help the homebound stay employed with job sharing opportunities.\n\nSecond, we are leveraging our skills to benefit the community through Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) efforts. For instance, we actively promoted awareness of cyberattacks through our #CyberWellness initiative, helping 668 staff members in 15 charities through e-learning.\n\nLast, but not least, we dialled up our sustainability agenda, increasing our solar production capacity by over 50% through three new regional solar installations, bringing us closer to our RE100 aspiration of using 100% renewable energy in Singapore by 2030.\n\nWe are primed to build back better and stronger while delivering a differentiated customer experience. And together, we will create a more resilient and better future for all of us.\n\nJimmy Ng Chief Information Officer DBS Group Holdings\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2021 Focus Areas\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \uf075 Accelerate our hybrid multi-cloud infrastructure transformation, 5G, AR/ VR/ MR, IoT and Blockchain adoption\n- \uf075 Optimise employee journeys of production support staff and developers\n- \uf075 Embed data driven operating model in platforms\n- Institutional Banking \uf075 Industrialise AI at scale\n- \uf075 Execute on Operations Processes and Platform Re-engineering (OPPR) agenda\n- \uf075 Embed the customised employee value proposition for technology workforce and build a future-ready workforce with our own tech DNA\n- \uf075 Dial up on DBS' sustainability agenda\n\nresiliency, through establishing a data-driven operating model in Operations across all functions and locations. This will safeguard our operations staff's security regardless whether they are working remotely or in the office.\n\n## Building our timber\n\nWith our aggressive inroads into digitisation, our workforce needs to remain skilled and nimble. Our three-pronged approach is to: (1) build our own tech DNA and capabilities; (2) be the employer of choice for top tech talent; and (3) upskill and reskill employees to be future-ready.\n\nIn January 2021, we launched our in-house digital training Future Tech Academy to keep our technology workforce updated with cuttingedge skills, including SRE, data processing and analytics and application security. Over 18,000 employees have been trained in our ADA curriculum, with over 2,000 upskilled in areas such as data science and business intelligence. We enhanced our cloud curriculum, in partnership with tech giants such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google and VMware, providing more learning opportunities.\n\nBesides building our own capabilities, DBS hires talents from a gamut of companies including tech firms, e-commerce and fintech. We also extended our reach to help young professionals and graduates secure fulfilling jobs during these challenging times. Close to 1,000 hires and traineeships were made through partner programmes such as the Technology in Finance Immersion Programme (TFIP), TechSkills Accelerator (TeSA) and the Skill Enhancement Education and Development (SEED) programme.\n\nTechnology has already created many exciting roles within DBS, such as chatbot coaches and machine learning architects. We encourage our employees to keep upskilling to stay futureready. An example is the AWS DeepRacer, a gamified learning platform in partnership with AWS, where over 3,000 employees familiarised themselves with AI/ ML.\n\n## Technology for a better world\n\nWe used this watershed year as an opportunity to promote diversity and inclusion in our talent pool, drive cybersecurity education in the larger community, and dial up our sustainability agenda.\n\nFirst, having a diverse workforce can only make us stronger. To attract more female tech talents, we emphasised diversity hiring through the DBS Women in Tech and 'EquAlly - Be an Ally' campaigns. The former, a virtual event to hire top female talents into Technology, attracted over 500 applications from 16 countries.\n\nOur drive to promote greater diversity in our workforce dovetails with our aim of giving",

Despite the pandemic and a challenging business environment underpinned by low interest rates, IBG navigated the year with resilience and closed it with strong business momentum in the fourth quarter. We delivered total income of SGD 5.75 billion.\n\nCompared to 2019, net profit before tax fell 39% to SGD 2.27 billion, primarily due to allowances increasing three-fold. 30% of this amount was conservatively set aside as general allowances to fortify the balance sheet while 70% was for specific allowances for exposures recognised as non-performing arising from the volatile economic backdrop. Net interest income fell 7% to SGD 4 billion amid operating headwinds. Cost-income ratio was little changed at 34%.\n\nOur early investments in digitalisation paid dividends as we were able to promulgate digital end-to-end solutions that helped customers transact and get access to financing from the comfort of their home offices. It enabled us to book revenue while providing full support to customers as the ways of doing business and working evolved.\n\n## Accelerating the rate of digital adoption for businesses\n\nWe fast-tracked key digital initiatives to help clients leverage digital channels for their day-to-day business operations. This included investments to revamp our corporate online banking platform (DBS IDEAL), digitalising customer onboarding and account provisioning (DBS DigiOnboarding), delivering QR pointof-sale and last-mile collections (DBS MAX), and deploying digital document submissions solutions (DBS DigiDocs).\n\nWe revamped SME digital onboarding processes in our six core markets, along with digital loan application functions in Singapore, Hong Kong, China, India and Taiwan. We also compressed the timeframe to bridge gaps in last-mile processes and expedited the introduction of 'contact-free' digital capabilities for trade financing solutions. We were the first bank to launch real-time online tracking of cross-border collections in Asia, giving more than 240,000 businesses in Singapore and\n\nHong Kong visibility to incoming cashflow to optimise their working capital management.\n\nThe business registered strong growth in digital adoption across our customer segments, with digital onboarding volumes for suppliers increasing more than six times, and volume of traditional customers migrating to DBS' digital banking channels tripling year-onyear (YoY). Our customers also put our digital solutions to business use as reflected by our API calls increasing more than five-fold YoY.\n\n## Powering ahead with large corporates\n\nOur IBG 1&2 franchise which services large corporates and MNCs saw steady loans growth. Technology, e-commerce and logistics sectors did well, registering 2% income growth.\n\nWith the impending discontinuation of interest rate benchmarks such as the London Inter-bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and Swap Offer Rate (SOR), DBS is committed to partnering our clients to achieve a smooth and seamless transition to the alternative Risk Free Benchmark Rates (RFRs). We closed more than SGD 1 billion in loans referencing the RFRs in 2020 and along the way, we broke new grounds with our clients such as the first Singapore Overnight Rate Average (SORA) club loan coupled with a cross currency swap and Singapore's first business property mortgage loan referencing SORA.\n\nOur WMNC business was also productive and registered a 13% increase in income led by customers from the UK and Europe. The account receivables financing business grew over 40% YoY on the back of a broad mix of new and existing programmes in markets like China, Hong Kong and India.\n\n## Supporting SMEs through hard times\n\nFor the SME Business, China and India registered approximately 25% YoY increase in revenues as well as deposit growth in excess of 40% YoY.\n\nThrough the pandemic, DBS remained a trusted partner to SMEs and extended the financial support needed to weather the crisis. We partnered with governments and industry associations to avail critical working capital support to SMEs. In Singapore, DBS approved over SGD 5 billion in collateral-free loans to SMEs, with over 90% of total SME loans\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| SGD million              | 2020   | 2019   | YoY%   |\n|--------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Total income             | 5,745  | 6,073  | (5)    |\n| \u00b7  Corporate             | 4,028  | 3,943  | 2      |\n| \u00b7  SME                   | 1,717  | 2,130  | (19)   |\n| Expenses                 | 1,987  | 2,015  | (1)    |\n| Profit before allowances | 3,758  | 4,058  | (7)    |\n| Allowances               | 1,485  | 327    | >100   |\n| Profit before tax        | 2,273  | 3,731  | (39)   |\n\napproved since March, for micro, small and medium-sized businesses.\n\nWith digital banks entering the market, we expect increased competition but we are confident that we have what it takes to compete effectively.\n\nRead more about this on page 12.\n\n## Steady momentum in core markets\n\nWe executed well on our country strategies and grew revenues from India by 30% YoY driven by strong business momentum from multinational corporates. We remained focused on sharpening our Greater Bay Area strategy to capture business flows from new industries, while balancing growth with risk considerations. We gained business momentum by deeply integrating our trade and financial solutions into supply chains as well as helping Chinese companies expand overseas.\n\n## Re-energising our Treasury Markets focus\n\nWe refreshed our Treasury Markets business and grew revenues by 11% YoY. As a result, this contributed 2% more to IBG's revenues in 2020. Two new FX pricing engines in major FX hubs in London and Tokyo were also launched, enabling our clients to gain faster access to multiple liquidity pools.\n\n## Redefining the future of capital markets\n\nAccelerating the growth of Singapore's digital assets ecosystem, DBS announced what we believe was a world first - The DBS Digital Exchange, enabling institutional clients to tap into a fully integrated tokenisation, trading and custody ecosystem for digital assets.\n\nWe continued to be in pole position in Singapore's equity space, advising and lead managing the largest number and value of equity deals on the SGX, accounting for 88.3% of the total equity proceeds from the Singapore market. We continued to play a dominant role in growing Singapore as an international financial centre for REITs and Business Trusts,\n\ncontributing to 87.4% of the total equity proceeds raised from the REIT market.\n\nDBS remained the top SGD bond house with close to SGD 5.85 billion in issuances and around 34% market share. We made headway in Asia ex-Japan G3 bond markets with issuances of close to USD 9 billion, up 8% from last year.\n\n## Upping the ante on Sustainability Financing\n\nDBS also launched the world's first Sustainable and Transition Finance Framework and Taxonomy, by a bank, which helps clients to adapt and build resilience in the face of climate change and resource scarcity. Since 2018, DBS has closed more than 100 sustainable financing deals worth over SGD 18 billion. We ranked first in Bloomberg's Asia (ex Japan) league tables for green loans for our role as Mandated Lead Arranger (MLA) for the full year 2020.\n\nLandmark sustainable and green financing transactions include the USD 1.11 billion dualtranche green project bond by Star Energy Geothermal, PSA Marine's three-year EUR 30 million equivalent sustainability-linked loan and the EUR 500 million Korea Housing Finance Corporation Covid-19 social bond.\n\n## Exploring new engines of growth\n\nOur initial digital investments are paving the way for new opportunities of growth.\n\nOne area of focus is the development of hyper-connected ecosystems. This enabled us to support the financial needs of large anchor companies as well as their suppliers, distributors and customers at different stages of the value chain, ensuring they had access to financing throughout the pandemic. Through our digital financing programmes with Haier, Huawei and JD Logistics, we were able to provide their ecosystem of suppliers and distributors access to trade financing digitally, enhancing their financial resiliency amid the crisis. We also made steady progress with other strategic partners and customers with DBS being the first Asian bank partner on AntChain's blockchain trade platform, Trusple, and was the first Singapore bank\n\nto join Contour's global ecosystem of banks and partners to drive greater efficiencies in trade. DBS together with JP Morgan and Temasek Holdings have also agreed to launch an initiative leveraging blockchain to enhance the efficiency of wholesale payments.\n\nWhile our SME business in India recorded good topline revenue and deposit growth, we believe that the amalgamation of Lakshmi Vilas Bank with DBS India will also help us scale and open up new profit pools for our SME business.\n\n## Staying the course in 2021\n\nEven as markets recover at different speeds, latest economic data point to a strong economic rebound in 2021. In addition, I'm also optimistic that asset quality will improve over the course of the year. To augment the impending recovery, we will execute on new initiatives to grow new revenue streams, particularly fee income. To protect our franchise, we continue to strengthen compliance processes, as well as embed a robust risk agenda into our business. We remain focused on differentiating DBS as a leader in sustainability financing, innovating green products and structures for IBG clients and will continue to work closely with clients on their digital transformation journeys.\n\nWith every crisis comes silver linings and we will continue to look for new revenue streams and avenues of growth to create long-term value for our customers and stakeholders.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Tan Su Shan\n\nInstitutional Banking DBS Group Holdings\n\n## 2021 Focus Areas\n\n- \uf075 Integrate environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) considerations into a wider range of products and services, with a focus on transition finance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \uf075 Grow new revenue streams with new initiatives and a focus on fee income\n- \uf075 Scale and drive productivity with new digital tools internally and externally by harnessing digital tools and data analytic capabilities\n- \uf075 Dial up market coverage around new growth areas like digital platforms, start-up and growth companies\n- \uf075 Ensure a smooth IBOR transition for clients",

We doubled down on our digitalisation agenda and accelerated the completion of 'last mile' initiatives. Leveraging our digital channels, we continued to deliver seamless and end-to-end services to our customers amid the pandemic. We also pivoted quickly to roll out new ways of serving our customers and introduced measures to support affected communities.\n\n## Consumer Banking/ Wealth Management remains resilient amid challenging environment\n\nDespite headwinds in 2020, we were able to deliver sustained earnings for Consumer Banking/ Wealth Management even as we almost doubled our provisions to shore up our balance sheet against potential risks arising from the pandemic. Our total income came in at SGD 5.77 billion, a fall of 8% against last year while strong cost discipline kept our expenses flat. Net profit before tax fell 27% to SGD 2.02 billion.\n\nNet interest income fell 17% to SGD 3.34 billion amid headwinds from the prolonged lower interest rate environment and Covid-19. Card income was impacted by a drop in retail and travel-related spending, but we were able to maintain or grow our market share across Singapore, Hong Kong, Indonesia and Taiwan. Singapore's property market transactions picked up towards the second half of the year and we maintained our leading mortgage market share. With the external environment in mind, we deliberately slowed our lending in the unsecured space and are keeping an eye on delinquencies, which have risen in Indonesia and other markets. We remain confident however, that consumer finance is the right space to be in and have built up partnerships in China and Taiwan to scale up this business in 2021.\n\nNon-interest income rose 7% to SGD 2.43 billion as higher investment fees offset the drop in bancassurance and cards. Investments registered a record growth of 13%, hitting more than SGD 1.94 billion in income. Although bancassurance saw industry-wide impact due to safe-distancing measures, we were able to maintain our lead in market share for new business. We also introduced new general\n\ninsurance solutions that better met customers' new needs, such as staycations, work-fromhome offerings, and healthcare coverage for gig economy workers.\n\nWe continue to solidify our companion app proposition in Singapore, where every customer will only require two apps to access our full range of services - using DBS digibank or DBS iWealth to bank and DBS PayLah! for all other services. DBS PayLah!'s 1.9 million users can now use the platform to book movie tickets and rides, pay bills and transport expenses, access card rewards, and scan to pay at more than 180,000 acceptance points.\n\n## Wealth Management: Growth trajectory continues\n\nOur wealth franchise, representing 20% of group income, continued to grow. AUM rose 7% to SGD 264 billion, though income fell 7% to SGD 2.87 billion.\n\nDespite widespread market volatility, our flagship investment portfolio - the DBS Chief Investment Office Barbell Strategy Portfolio - consistently outperformed its composite benchmark. Designed to capitalise on longterm growth trends while mitigating shortterm volatility, the portfolio's strategy became particularly relevant in 2020. More than SGD 1.9 billion of discretionary assets under management in DBS Private Bank today reference this strategy.\n\nWe also continued to create wealth investment solutions within the environmental, social and governance (ESG) space. In October, we launched a new tranche of our MSCI EM Asia ESG Leaders Outperformance Trade (ESG Outperformance Trade). This follows a successful run of our first ESG Outperformance Trade, which was the first of its kind in Asia when introduced in 2018 and raised SGD 95 million. The 2020 relaunch was hugely successful and raised over SGD 670 million in two months.\n\nDBS iWealth, our digital wealth management platform, was named 'Global no. 1 wealth mobile app' by Cutter Research for the third year running. We also introduced smart triggers that provide personalised investment insights and prompts, powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), to wealth customers via DBS iWealth. The early digital foundation we laid over the past few years paid off when customers collectively turned to DBS iWealth for self-directed\n\n| SGD million              | 2020   | 2019   | YoY%   |\n|--------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Total income             | 5,767  | 6,299  | (8)    |\n| \u00b7  Retail                | 2,902  | 3,219  | (10)   |\n| \u00b7  Wealth Management     | 2,866  | 3,080  | (7)    |\n| Expenses                 | 3,288  | 3,280  | 0      |\n| Profit before allowances | 2,479  | 3,019  | (18)   |\n| Allowances               | 456    | 242    | 88     |\n| Profit before tax        | 2,023  | 2,777  | (27)   |\n\ntrades during Covid-19. Revenues from these investments in Singapore and Hong Kong more than doubled, and online investment transactions in both markets tripled.\n\nOur wealth management business was also recognised in 2020 as 'Outstanding Private Bank - Global', 'Best Private Bank for Use of Technology' and 'Best Private Bank - AsiaPacific' by Global Finance.\n\nOur family office business saw strong growth, as Covid-19 and geopolitical uncertainties sparked succession planning and wealth preservation concerns among the world's wealthy. With Singapore establishing itself as a family office hub of choice and a safe, stable gateway to Asia's opportunities, we are wellpositioned to capture growing interest from these families.\n\n## Consumer Banking: Invisible, intuitive and intelligent services for all\n\nAs the pandemic spread, customers turned en masse to digital channels. As the world's leading digital bank, we were well-placed to capitalise on this shift. We witnessed an unprecedented surge in digital adoption across the region, with digital financial transactions showing doubledigit growth. In April, we launched TeleAdvisory, a service allowing clients to consult our wealth planning managers via video-conferencing platforms, to replace face-to-face interactions in Singapore. 17,000 TeleAdvisory consultations have since been completed. In India, we launched the Voice & Virtual channel which remotely assists our wealth customers. The channel now averages 5,000 conversations per month. DBS Remit saw exceptional growth, with remittance volumes rising 38%. From Singapore, customers can remit to 49 markets in 17 currencies, on a near real-time or sameday basis. DBS Remit is also available to customers in Hong Kong, India and Indonesia.\n\nWe also doubled down on implementing our AI and ML-powered Intelligent Banking capabilities across our digital services. The capabilities combine predictive analytics and customer-centric design to transform data into hyper-personalised, intuitive insights that simplify the way customers manage their finances. In 2020, we generated 13 million\n\nIntelligent Banking insights a month, helping customers improve their financial planning, uncover blind spots, and make timely investments. These insights have been rolled out in Singapore and to one million digibank customers in India.\n\nIn April, we launched one of the world's most advanced financial planning solutions: DBS NAV Planner. The solution leverages tech to democratise financial planning, helping all Singapore residents better manage their money and grow their wealth. Customers can use DBS NAV Planner to track, protect and grow their money with personalised and actionable insights powered by more than 100 AI models, and more than 30 million financial planning insights have since been delivered. The solution's capabilities were supercharged with the launch of SGFinDex, the world's first public-private open banking initiative in December, allowing us to widen our reach. DBS NAV Planner now has two million users.\n\nIn November, the Reserve Bank of India approved the amalgamation of Lakshmi Vilas Bank with DBS Bank India Limited. The amalgamation complements DBS' digibank strategy with an expanded network of 600 branches and 1,000 ATMs, and an additional two million retail customers as well as a strengthened deposit franchise. We see the expanded branch network and larger retail customer base - where we can overlay our world-class digital banking and build a sticky deposit base - as value enhancing.\n\nWe also continue to ramp up and solidify our ecosystem partnerships to provide customers seamless access to everyday services. In 2020, we integrated partners such as ComfortDelGro, FavePay, Gojek, Temasek Foundation's StayMasked, WhyQ into our DBS PayLah! platform.\n\n## Providing support to affected communities\n\nWhen the pandemic hit, we immediately rolled out support measures to affected communities. In February, we worked with Chubb to provide complimentary Covid-19 insurance coverage across four markets, and more than one million customers and their family members signed\n\nup. We also enabled some 7,200 homeowners in Singapore and Hong Kong to defer mortgage repayments. In Singapore, we partnered 88Tuition to provide free online supplementary classes to 850 students.\n\nWhen Singapore implemented a lockdown, migrant worker employers realised that all transactions had to go digital, including salary distribution, remittances and phone card topups. This accelerated the registration of digital bank accounts for migrant workers. From April to June, we processed almost 60,000 accounts, being the only bank able to provide end-to-end digital account opening for migrant workers, by working with Singapore's Ministry of Manpower.\n\n## What we look forward to in 2021\n\nThe sweeping changes and upheavals brought forth in 2020 will continue to spill over to 2021. Digital adoption accelerated across the world and consumer habits saw a seismic shift. We believe that companies such as ours can contribute towards a more equitable world: from empowering our customers in their everyday decision-making with hyperpersonalised insights, to providing more ways to give back to those in need. In 2021, we will continue to grow our business with purpose and prove that we can do good and do well.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Sim S Lim\n\nConsumer Banking/ Wealth Management DBS Group Holdings\n\n## 2021 Focus Areas\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \uf075 Accelerate 'phygital' agenda by doubling down on AI/ ML capabilities and branch transformation initiatives\n- \uf075 Build on wealth business growth momentum by leveraging digital capabilities, capturing market opportunities and championing ESG\n- Institutional Banking \uf075 Leverage open banking and ecosystem partnerships to provide inclusive, intuitive and invisible services",

Our Board plays a key role in setting our governance standards to meet our stakeholders' expectations, and our leadership model ensures an appropriate balance of power, accountability and independence in decisionmaking across our various functional and geographic units.\n\nOur corporate governance practices comply with the Banking (Corporate Governance) Regulations 2005 (Banking CG Regulations). We also comply, in all material aspects, with the following corporate governance best practice guidelines issued by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS):\n\n- i) the Guidelines on Corporate Governance for Financial Holding Companies, Banks, Direct Insurers, Reinsurers and Captive Insurers issued on 3 April 2013, which comprises:\n- \u00b7 the Code of Corporate Governance 2012 (2012 Code); and\n- \u00b7 supplementary guidelines and policies added by the MAS to cater to the diverse and complex risks undertaken by financial institutions (Supplementary Guidelines).\n- ii) the Code of Corporate Governance 2018 issued on 6 August 2018 (2018 Code).\n\nWe have described our corporate governance practices for our financial year ended 31 December 2020 with specific reference to the 2018 Code and the Supplementary Guidelines. A summary disclosure of our compliance with the express disclosure requirements in the 2018 Code and the Supplementary Guidelines, have been provided on pages 102 to 104.\n\n## Board highlights - 2020\n\n## Navigating the challenges arising from Covid-19 pandemic\n\nAs the Covid-19 pandemic unfolded in the course of 2020 with unprecedented uncertainty across all key locations of the Group, the Board spent a significant amount of time reviewing and discussing with management:\n\n- i) the impact of Covid-19 on our business operations (including the actions taken to safeguard the health and safety of our employees, fortify our balance sheet, ensure business continuity, and support our communities);\n- ii) the establishment of the DBS Digital Exchange, which leverages blockchain technology to provide an ecosystem for fund raising through asset tokenization and secondary trading of digital assets, including cryptocurrencies. The DBS Digital Exchange will allow institutional investors and accredited investors to tap into a fully integrated tokenization, trading and custody ecosystem for digital assets.\n\nThe Board was also given an update on the Singapore digital banking landscape and deliberated on our strategic responses to the competition from digital banks.\n\n## Two new Independent Directors appointed in 2020\n\nDuring the year, we appointed two new Directors (Ms Punita Lal and Mr Anthony Lim). In addition, two long-serving Directors (Mr Danny Teoh and Mr Nihal Kaviratne) stepped down after having served on the Board for nine years or more.\n\nMr Anthony Lim is a seasoned financial markets veteran with expertise in market risk and trading. He joined GIC Pte Ltd (GIC) as its president of the London office in 1998 and was appointed in 2009 as its president (Americas) based in New York. Prior to joining GIC, he held various management and trading positions in the global markets' division of the Bankers Trust Company in Singapore and London. Ms Punita Lal has over 30 years of experience in strategy, marketing and leadership in the consumer-packaged goods industry, and her prior experience includes working for Coca Cola in China and PepsiCo in India. Her last held executive role was MD & CEO for NourishCo, a strategic joint venture between Tata Global Beverages and PepsiCo, from 2010 to 2012.\n\nBoth Mr Lim and Ms Lal were appointed as Directors of DBS Group Holdings Ltd (DBSH) and DBS Bank Ltd (DBS Bank) with effect from 1 April 2020. Mr Lim serves on the Board Executive Committee (EXCO) and Board Risk Management Committee (BRMC) while Ms Lal serves on the Compensation and Management Development Committee (CMDC) and Nominating Committee (NC).\n\n## Board Renewal\n\nBoard renewal is a key focus for us. In 2020, the NC continued the search for potential candidates who could be lined up for appointment as Directors of DBSH and DBS Bank over the next few years. New Directors will be introduced gradually so that the Board and Board committees have a smooth transition period.\n\nDiversity is one of the key considerations in the board renewal process to ensure that the Board is appropriately balanced to support the long-term success of DBS. Other key considerations include (i) whether the skillsets of the candidates would replace skillsets of long-serving Directors, and/or would supplement the collective skillsets of\n\n- ii) the business and credit costs outlook in 2020 and 2021;\n- iii)   the risks arising from the changes necessitated by Covid-19 (such as increased cyber security risk arising from the significant increase of staff having to work from home); and\n- iv)   strategies to prepare for the new normal post-Covid-19 and to look for business opportunities that may come out of this crisis.\n\nThe Board also provided valuable insights and advice on managing the Covid-19 crisis without losing focus on our long-term strategies (such as making the necessary investments for the future).\n\n## Voluntary reductions in Directors' fees\n\nIn a show of solidarity with the nation and our stakeholders during the Covid-19 pandemic, all the Non-Executive Directors who are currently in office have volunteered to take a 10% reduction in their basic retainer fees of SGD 100,000 for the financial year ended 31 December 2020 (FY2020).\n\nOn top of the 10% reduction in his basic retainer fees, the Board Chairman has also volunteered to take an additional 10% reduction (amounting to SGD 145,000) in his Board Chairman's fees for FY2020. With these reductions, the total fees payable to the Board Chairman for FY2020 will be approximately 10.4% (or SGD 204,000) lower compared to the financial year ended 31 December 2019 (FY2019).\n\nAccordingly, shareholders' approval will be sought for the payment of a reduced amount of SGD 4,101,074 as Directors' fees for the Non-Executive Directors for FY2020. The Directors' fees for FY2020 are approximately 13% lower than the Directors' fees for FY2019 (SGD 4,719,707) after factoring in the aforesaid voluntary 10% reductions, as well as lower attendance fees from the holding of various Board and Board committee meetings via video-conference in 2020 due to Covid-19 restrictions.\n\nPlease refer to pages 46 to 47 for details of remuneration of each Non-Executive Director (including the Board Chairman) for FY2020.\n\n## Pursuing inorganic acquisitions and new business initiatives\n\nIn addition to its focus on navigating the challenges arising from the Covid-19 pandemic, the Board deliberated extensively on various inorganic acquisitions and new business initiatives to seek alternative sources of revenue in view of the low-for-long interest rate environment, including:\n\n- i) the acquisition of Lakshmi Vilas Bank (LVB) in India, which complements our digibank strategy with an expanded network of branches and ATMs, an additional two million retail and 125,000 non-retail customers, as well as a strengthened deposit franchise; and",

A skills matrix is used to assess if the skills and experience of a candidate complement those of the existing Board members. Potential candidates are informed of the level of contribution and commitment expected of a DBS Director.\n\nAs part of the Board renewal process:\n\n- \u00b7 Ms Euleen Goh, Mr Andre Sekulic and Mrs Ow Foong Pheng will be stepping down from the Board at the conclusion of our forthcoming Annual General Meeting (2021\n\nAGM), having served on the Board for nine years or more. The Board and Management of DBS would like to express their gratitude to Ms Goh, Mr Sekulic and Mrs Ow for their invaluable contributions to the DBS Group over the years. Ms Goh has also served as the chairperson on the Board of DBS Foundation since it was established in 2014. Although she is retiring as a Director of DBSH and DBS Bank, she has graciously agreed to remain as the chairperson of DBS Foundation.\n\n- \u00b7 The Board has also approved the appointment of a non-executive nonindependent director and we are in the process of obtaining regulatory approval for this appointment.\n- \u00b7 The NC has been actively looking for new independent directors to serve on the\n\nBoard and expects to appoint at least one new independent director in 2021.\n\nIn view of the impending retirement of Ms Goh, Mr Sekulic and Mrs Ow, the Board (upon the recommendation of the NC) have made the following changes to the compositions of the Audit Committee (AC), the BRMC and CMDC, which will take effect on 31 March 2021:\n\n- i) Mr Olivier Lim will be appointed as the Chairman of the BRMC;\n- ii) Mr Anthony Lim will be appointed as the Chairman of the CMDC; and\n- iii)   Ms Punita Lal will be appointed as a member of the AC.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Competent leadership\n\n## Our board\n\nThe Board directs DBS in the conduct of its affairs and provides sound leadership to management. We have 11 Board members (including three female directors) with a broad range of experience and deep industry expertise. The make-up of our Board reflects diversity of gender, nationality, age, skills and knowledge. A majority of the Directors are Independent Directors, and there are no alternate Directors on our Board.\n\nOur Chairman, Mr Peter Seah, sits on all Board committees and he also chairs the Board Executive Committee (EXCO). Mr Seah performs a key role as an ambassador for DBS in our dealings with various stakeholders as well as in ensuring effective communication with our shareholders. He guides the Board through its decision-making process and ensures that the Board operates effectively as a team.\n\nThere is a very positive and constructive working relationship between our Chairman and CEO, Mr Piyush Gupta. Mr Gupta oversees the execution of DBS' strategy and is responsible for managing the day-to-day operations. Other than the CEO, none of the other Directors is a former or current employee of DBSH or its subsidiaries.\n\n## Lead independent director\n\nAs Mr Ho Tian Yee was re-designated as a non-independent Director with effect from 29 April 2020 (having served as a Director for more than nine years by then), the Board appointed Mr Olivier Lim to take over from Mr Ho as the Lead Independent Director with effect from 29 April 2020.\n\nEach of Mr Ho Tian Yee and Mr Olivier Lim had regular private sessions with the other independent Directors in the course of the year and provided feedback to the Chairman where necessary.\n\n## Key responsibilities of the Board\n\n- \u00b7 Sets the strategic direction and long-term goals of DBS, and ensures that adequate resources are available to meet these objectives.\n- \u00b7 Monitors the responsibilities delegated to the Board committees to ensure proper and effective oversight and control of DBS' activities.\n- \u00b7 Establishes a framework for risks to be assessed and managed.\n- \u00b7 Reviews management performance.\n- \u00b7 Determines DBS' values and standards (including ethical standards) and ensures that obligations to its stakeholders are understood and met.\n- \u00b7 Ensures that corporate responsibility and ethical standards underpin the conduct of DBS' business.\n- \u00b7 Develops succession plans for the Board and CEO.\n- \u00b7 Considers sustainability issues (including environmental and social factors) as part of DBS' strategy.",

Ad-hoc meetings are also held when necessary. There was one ad-hoc Board meeting held in 2020. Please refer to the\n\nBoard highlights - 2020 section on pages 44 to 45 for more information on the key focus areas of the Board in 2020.\n\nBefore each Board meeting, the Chairman oversees the setting of the agenda of Board\n\nmeetings, in consultation with the CEO, to ensure that there is sufficient information and time to address all agenda items. The agenda also allows for flexibility when needed. Directors are provided with complete",

        "page_content": "information related to agenda items in a timely manner. All materials for Board and Board committee meetings are uploaded onto a secure portal which can be accessed on tablet devices provided to the Directors.\n\nDuring every quarterly Board meeting:\n\n- \u00b7 the Chairperson of each Board committee provides an update on significant matters discussed at the Board committee meetings which are typically scheduled before the quarterly Board meeting;\n- \u00b7 the CFO presents the financial performance for that quarter and significant financial highlights;\n- \u00b7 the CEO gives an update on certain aspects of the Group's business and operations and/ or a macro perspective on industry trends and developments;\n- \u00b7 the Board holds a private session for Directors; and\n- \u00b7 the Lead Independent Director holds a private session with the other independent directors.\n\nIn addition to the quarterly Board meetings, a Board meeting is typically scheduled in December each year where the CEO gives the Board an update on DBS' performance against the balanced scorecard for that financial year. In addition, the CEO and CFO will present the Group's budget for the next financial year to the Board for approval.\n\nThe Chairman promotes open and frank debates by all Directors at every Board meeting. If there is a conflict of interest, the Director in question will recuse himself or herself from the discussions and abstain from participating in any Board decision. When exigencies prevent a Director from attending a Board or Board committee meeting in person, that Director can participate by telephone or video-conference.\n\nDirectors have the discretion to engage external advisers. External professionals or in-house subject matter experts may also be invited to present key topics to the Board as well as updates on corporate governance, risk management, capital, tax, accounting, listing and other regulations, which may have an impact on DBS' affairs.\n\nDirectors have independent access to the Group Secretary. The Group Secretary attends all Board meetings and minutes are prepared to record key deliberations and decisions taken during the meetings. The Group Secretary facilitates communication between the Board, its committees and management, and generally assists Directors in the discharge of their duties. The Group Secretary helps with the induction of new Directors. The appointment and removal of the Group Secretary require the approval of the Board.\n\n## Matters discussed by the Board and Board Committees in 2020\n\nNote: Further details of the activities of the Board and Board committees in 2020 can be found on pages 44, 45 and 47 to 56.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Frequent and effective engagement\n\nDirectors have ongoing interactions across various levels, functions and countries within DBS. In addition, some Directors also sit on the boards of our overseas subsidiaries; this arrangement gives the Board access to first-hand insight on the activities of these subsidiaries. The CFO provides the Board with detailed financial performance reports monthly.\n\nDirectors also have various opportunities to interact with members of the Group Management Committee (GMC) (for instance, at quarterly Board-hosted dinners and during the annual board strategy offsite). Due to Covid-19, most of these interactions in 2020 were conducted virtually.\n\n## Annual Board strategy offsite\n\nEach year, the Board and our senior executives attend a four-day strategy offsite held in one of our markets, which allows them to:\n\n- \u00b7 focus on DBS' long-term strategy apart from the regular agenda at the quarterly Board meetings;\n- \u00b7 engage in dynamic and in-depth strategic discussions to promote deeper understanding of our business\n- environment and our operations, and refine our strategy; and\n- \u00b7 engage with our stakeholders in the host country (such as regulators, media, customers including CEOs and CFOs of our corporate clients and staff in the local franchise).\n\nHowever due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the 2020 Board strategy offsite was held over a two-day period in Singapore (during the first week of October). The Board had in-depth discussions with senior executives on the DBS' business model, the future of work and reshaping the way we work, as well as strategies to seek alternative revenue sources in view of the low-for-long interest rate environment.\n\n## Delegation by the Board to the Board committees\n\nThe Board has delegated authority to various Board committees to enable them to oversee certain specific responsibilities based on their terms of reference. The terms of reference of each Board committee set out the responsibilities of the Board committee, conduct of meetings including quorum, voting requirements and qualifications for Board committee membership.

Any change to the terms of reference for any Board committee requires Board approval. The minutes of Board Committee meetings, which records the key deliberations and decisions taken during these meetings, are circulated to\n\nall Board members for their information.\n\n## Nominating Committee (NC)\n\n## Key responsibilities of the NC\n\n- \u00b7 Regularly reviews the composition of the Board and Board committees, and independence of Directors;\n- \u00b7 Identifies, reviews and recommends Board appointments for approval by the Board, taking into account the experience, expertise, knowledge, age and skills of the candidate and the needs of the Board;\n- \u00b7 Conducts an annual evaluation of the performance of the Board, the Board committees and the Directors;\n- \u00b7 Implements the Board Diversity Policy and reviews its effectiveness;\n- \u00b7 Exercises oversight of the induction programme and continuous development programme for Directors, and ensures that first-time directors with no prior experience as a director of a listed company in Singapore undergo relevant training;\n- \u00b7 Reviews and recommends to the Board the re-appointment of each Director having regard to his/ her performance, commitment and ability to contribute to the Board as well as his/ her age and skillset;\n- \u00b7 Assesses annually whether each Director has sufficient time to discharge his/ her responsibilities; and\n- \u00b7 Reviews the Board's succession plans for Directors.\n\n## Selection criteria and nomination process for Directors\n\nBefore a new Director is appointed, suitable candidates are identified from various sources. Thereafter, the NC conducts an assessment to:\n\n- \u00b7 Review the candidate (including qualifications, attributes, capabilities,\n\nskills, age, past experience) to determine whether the candidate is fit and proper in accordance with the fit and proper guidelines issued by the MAS; and\n\n- \u00b7 ascertain whether the candidate is independent from DBSH's substantial shareholder and/or from management and business relationships with DBS.\n\nThe NC then interviews the short-listed candidates and makes its recommendations to the Board. All Board appointments are based on merit, taking into account the contributions the candidates can bring to the Board to enhance its effectiveness. Upon the appointment of a new Director, the NC will recommend to the Board his or her appointment to the appropriate Board committee(s) after matching the Director's skillset to the needs of each Board committee.\n\n## Induction and Training for new Directors\n\nThe NC oversees the onboarding of new Directors. All new Directors go through our\n\ninduction programme, which covers the",

        "page_content": "duties and obligations of a Director and the responsibilities of and work carried out by the Board committees. We provide a Director's pack, which acts as an aide memoire for the information covered by the induction programme. We have briefing sessions for Directors given by members of senior management on the various businesses of DBS and its supporting functions. The NC is also responsible for ensuring that new Directors with no prior experience as a director of a listed company undergo training in the roles and responsibilities of a director of a listed company in Singapore.\n\n## Highlights of NC's activities in 2020\n\n## Board renewal process\n\nPlease refer to the Board highlights - 2020 section on pages 44 to 45.\n\n## Annual review of Directors' independence\n\nThe NC reviews and determines annually whether each Director is independent in accordance with the stringent standards required of financial institutions prescribed under the Banking CG Regulations. Under the Banking CG Regulations, an 'independent director' is defined to mean a Director who is:\n\n- \u00b7 independent from any management and business relationship with DBS;\n- \u00b7 independent from any substantial shareholder of DBS; and\n- \u00b7 has not served on the Board of DBS for a continuous period of nine years or longer.\n\nThe NC assessed and concluded that (i) all Directors are considered to be independent from business relationships with DBS; (ii) with the exception of Mr Piyush Gupta, all Directors are considered to be independent from management relationships with DBS; (iii) with the exception of Mrs Ow Foong Pheng, all Directors are considered to be independent from DBSH's substantial shareholder, Temasek Holdings (Private) Limited (Temasek). Mrs Ow, who is the Permanent Secretary for the Ministry of National Development, Singapore, is considered not independent of Temasek as the Singapore government is its ultimate owner; and (iv) Mr Peter Seah, Ms Euleen Goh and Mr Ho Tian Yee are Non-Independent directors as they have served on the Board for more than nine years. Based on the NC's assessment, the Independent Directors are Dr Bonghan Cho, Ms Punita Lal, Mr Olivier Lim, Mr Anthony Lim, Mr Andre Sekulic and Mr Tham Sai Choy.\n\nAlthough Ms Euleen Goh, Mr Ho Tian Yee, Mr Olivier Lim, Mr Anthony Lim, Mr Peter Seah and Mr Tham Sai Choy are on the boards of companies that have a banking relationship with DBS, and are also directors of companies in which Temasek has investments (Temasek portfolio companies), the NC considers\n\nThe NC assesses each Director's ability to commit time to DBS' affairs in accordance with internal guidelines which take into account the number of other board and committee memberships a Director holds, as well as the size and complexity of the companies in which he/ she is a board member. Additionally, each Director is required to complete a selfassessment of his/ her time commitments on an annual basis. While the Board has not set a maximum number of listed company board representations a Director may hold, all Directors appreciate the high level of commitment required of a Director. All Directors have met the requirements under the NC's guidelines.\n\n## Directors' tenure\n\nThe NC believes that it is in the interest of DBS for the Board to comprise of Directors with longer tenures who have a deep understanding of the banking industry, as well as Directors with shorter tenures who can bring fresh ideas and perspectives.\n\nAlthough there are currently six Directors (including Mr Piyush Gupta) who have served for more than eight years, this is balanced by the progressive refreshing of the Board where five new independent Directors were appointed since November 2017. In addition, three long-serving Directors (i.e. Ms Euleen Goh, Mr Andre Sekulic and Mrs Ow Foong Pheng) will be stepping down from the Board at the conclusion of the 2021 AGM and the search for new independent Director(s) is in progress.\n\nThe NC specifically considered the skillsets and contributions of the remaining three long-serving Directors (being Mr Peter Seah, Mr Ho Tian Yee and Mr Piyush Gupta). The NC deliberated and agreed that it is in DBS' interests for these Directors to continue serving on the Board of DBS for the following reasons:\n\n- i) it is important for Mr Peter Seah to continue serving as the Board Chairman to provide leadership and continuity. Mr Seah is a veteran former banker with wide industry experience, and he has been instrumental in the growth and transformation of DBS over the past 11 years. From a strategic perspective, the next few years continue to be critical as DBS continues to execute on its digital transformation and growth strategies (especially with the prevailing macroeconomic and geo-political headwinds and challenging outlook for 2021 due to the Covid-19 pandemic) and enhance its franchise in the Greater Bay Area, China, India, Indonesia and Vietnam;\n- ii) it is in DBS' interests for Mr Ho Tian Yee to continue serving on the Board for another year as he is currently one of only two Directors with both banking experience\n\nthese Directors (i) independent of business relationships as the revenues arising from such relationships are not material; and (ii) independent of Temasek as their appointments on the boards of Temasek portfolio companies are non- executive in nature and they are not involved in the day-today conduct of the businesses of the Temasek portfolio companies.\n\nIn addition, none of these Directors sit on any of the boards of the Temasek portfolio companies as a representative of Temasek and they do not take instructions from Temasek in acting as Directors.\n\n## Board performance and evaluation\n\nThe NC makes an assessment at least once a year to determine whether the Board and Board committees are performing effectively and identify steps for improvement. The NC believes that it is important to obtain an independent perspective on the Board's performance once every three to four years, and to gain insights on the Board's performance against peer boards and best practices. An external evaluator was last engaged to conduct the Board performance evaluation for the financial year ended 2018.\n\nIn 2020, the NC considered the results and key action items from the 2019 Board evaluation and decided to use substantially the same evaluation questionnaire for 2020 for benchmarking purposes. The questionnaire included questions on Board composition, Board processes and culture, quality of information provided to the Board, succession planning, risk management and effectiveness of Board committees. Each Director was asked to complete the questionnaire and submit it directly to the Group Secretary who collated the responses and produced a summary report for the NC. The NC analysed the report and submitted its findings to the Board. The Board discussed the findings of the evaluation and agreed to follow-up on certain items.\n\nIn addition to the annual Board evaluation exercise, the NC also conducts an annual review of each Director to determine whether each Director remains qualified for office. In making its determination, the NC will take into account (i) the Director's age, track record, experience, skills and capabilities; (ii) whether each Director is able to and has been adequately carrying out his/ her duties as a Director, including the contributions and performance of each Director; and (iii) whether each Director has committed sufficient time to his/ her duties as a director of DBS. The Board is satisfied that each Director has diligently discharged his or her duties as a Director of DBS and has contributed meaningfully to DBS.\n\n## Directors' time commitment\n\nThe meeting attendance records of all Directors as well as a list of their directorships are fully disclosed in our Annual Report.",

The other Director, Mr Anthony Lim, who also has market risk and trading experience, joined the Board on 1 April 2020 and will need more time to familiarize himself with DBS' business; and\n\n- iii)   as CEO, Mr Piyush Gupta should remain as a Director to provide the Board with insights into the business.\n\n## Re-election of Directors\n\nUnder the Constitution of DBSH, one-third of Directors who are longest-serving since their last re-election are required to retire from office and, if eligible, stand for re-election at each AGM. Based on this rotation process, each Director is required to submit himself or herself for re-election by shareholders at least once every three years. In addition, new Directors (who are appointed in between AGMs) are required under DBSH's Constitution to stand for re-election at the first AGM after their appointment. The NC reviews and recommends to the Board the rotation and re-election of Directors at the AGM.\n\nPrior to each AGM, Group Secretariat informs the NC which Directors are required to retire at that AGM. The NC will then review the composition of the Board and decide whether to recommend to the Board the re-election of these Directors, after taking into account factors such as their attendance, participation, contribution, expertise and competing time commitments.\n\nAt the 2021 AGM, Ms Euleen Goh, Mr Piyush Gupta and Mr Andre Sekulic will be retiring by rotation, while Ms Punita Lal and Mr Anthony Lim are required to stand for re-election as this is the first AGM after their appointment. At the recommendation of the NC and as approved by the Board, Mr Piyush Gupta, Ms Punita Lal and Mr Anthony Lim will be seeking re-election as Directors at the 2021 AGM, while Ms Euleen Goh (who has served on the Board for more than 12 years) and Mr Andre Sekulic (who has served on the Board for 9 years) will be retiring at the conclusion of the 2021 AGM.\n\n## Review of composition of Board Committees\n\nThe NC regularly reviewed the size and composition of the Board committees in 2020 to ensure that all independence requirements continue to be met, and that the Board committees are of an appropriate size and comprise the appropriate balance of skills, knowledge and experience, as well as diversity of nationality, age and gender.\n\nThe following changes were made to the composition of the Board committees in 2020:\n\n- \u00b7 With effect from 29 April 2020, Mr Ho Tian Yee (who had served for more than 9\n- years by then) stepped down from the NC and the EXCO after he was re-designated as a non-independent and non-executive Director under the Banking CG Regulations.\n- \u00b7 Mr Tham Sai Choy took over from Mr Ho as the NC chairman with effect from 29 April 2020.\n- \u00b7 Mr Olivier Lim was appointed as a member of the NC with effect from 6 April 2020 and stepped down as a member of the CMDC on 1 April 2020.\n- \u00b7 Dr Bonghan Cho was appointed as a member of the CMDC with effect from 1 April 2020.\n- \u00b7 Ms Punita Lal was appointed as a member of the CMDC and the NC with effect from 1 April 2020 and 6 April 2020 respectively.\n- \u00b7 Mr Anthony Lim was appointed as a member of the EXCO and the BRMC with effect from 1 April 2020.\n\n## Continuous development programme for all Directors\n\nThe NC monitors the frequency and quality of the Board training sessions, which are conducted either by external professionals or by management. The NC selects topics which are relevant to the Group's activities. Board members also contribute by highlighting areas of interests and possible topics.\n\nThe topics presented to the Board in 2020 as part of the continuous development programme included: (i) an update on the digital banking landscape in Singapore; (ii) Covid & the Next Normal (presented by a global management consulting firm); (iii) lessons learnt from the Covid-19 pandemic from a business continuity management perspective; and (iv) insights by external experts on the US-China geopolitical tensions, as well as the impact on global markets resulting from low rates, pandemic and geopolitical tensions.\n\n## Board diversity\n\nWe recognise that diversity is not merely limited to gender or any other personal attributes. We adopted a Board Diversity Policy which recognises the importance of having an effective and diverse Board, and states that the NC is responsible for setting the relevant objectives to promote and achieve diversity on the Board. In discharging its duties, the NC shall give due regard to the benefits of all aspects of diversity and strive to ensure that the Board is appropriately balanced to support the long-term success of DBS.\n\nThe main objective of the Board Diversity Policy is to continue to maintain the appropriate balance of perspectives, skills and experience on the Board to support the long-term success of DBS. The Board Diversity Policy provides that the NC shall endeavor to ensure that female candidates are included\n\nfor consideration when identifying candidates to be appointed as new directors, with the aim of having not less than 2 female directors on the Board. With the appointment of Ms Punita Lal as a new director on 1 April 2020, 3 out of 11 directors on the Board (about 27% of the Board) are female.\n\nThe NC believes that there is an appropriate balance of industry knowledge, skills, background, experience, professional qualifications, gender and nationalities on the Board, and is satisfied that the objectives of the Board Diversity Policy continue to be met.\n\n## Board Executive Committee (EXCO)\n\n## Key responsibilities of the EXCO\n\n- \u00b7 Approves certain matters specifically delegated by the Board such as acquisitions and divestments up to a certain material limit, credit transactions, investments, capital expenditure and expenses that exceed the limits that can be authorised by the CEO;\n- \u00b7 Reviews weak credit cases on a quarterly basis;\n- \u00b7 Oversees the governance of strategic risks such as sustainability (including review of the annual Sustainability Report), technology, artificial intelligence and data (including data privacy and appropriate use of data); and\n- \u00b7 Reviews and provides recommendations on matters that will require Board approval, including acquisitions and divestments exceeding certain material limits.\n\n## Highlights of EXCO's activities in 2020\n\n- \u00b7 The EXCO assists the Board to enhance the business strategies and strengthen core competencies of DBS. The EXCO meets frequently (14 meetings in 2020) and is able to offer greater responsiveness in the decision-making process of DBS.\n- \u00b7 In addition to its quarterly review of weak credit cases, matters discussed at the EXCO meetings in 2020 included (i) impact of Covid-19 pandemic on our 2020 financials and action plans; (ii) impact on our business arising from the US' response to Hong Kong's new national security law; (iii) capital distribution and changes to dividends in light of regulatory measures; (iv) update on DBS' business in the current climate and the taskforces which had been set up to look into the long-term consequences of the post-Covid new normal, and business opportunities that may come out of this crisis; and (v) various acquisition and investment opportunities including the amalgamation of LVB with DBS Bank India Limited.",

The Board has been notified that the Group's external auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC), has read and considered the other information (i.e. other than the financial statements and auditor's report thereon) in the annual report, whether financial or non-financial, in accordance with the Singapore Standard of Auditing 720.

The AC receives reports from Group Audit at each quarterly AC meeting, which provide the AC with an update on (i) the overall control environment (based on the results of the audit reviews in the preceding quarter); (ii) the key findings from audit reviews and the remediation actions which have been, or will be, taken to address these findings; (iii) an overview of the audit issues (including re-aged and past due issues) and audit reports issued during the preceding quarter; and (iv) any changes to the audit plan for AC approval.\n\nPlease refer to pages 56 and 57 for details on Group Audit's key responsibilities and processes.\n\nIn addition to the findings from the routine audits conducted by Group Audit in 2020, the AC was also apprised of the findings from special reviews initiated by Group Audit in response to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. These special reviews included audits on\n\n(i) the overall governance and compliance with Safe Management guidelines in office premises and bank branches; (ii) management of operational and technology risks (such as IT systems readiness) due to expanded Work From Home requirements; and (iii) implementation of credit relief measures by IBG and CBG across DBS' core markets. The AC was also updated on the results of the cyber red team simulation (led by Group Audit and Group Technology & Operations) conducted to assess DBS' cyber security posture across all locations and the scope of this simulation exercise covered remote working scenarios arising from the Covid-19 pandemic, large-scale ransomware, malicious code manipulation and insider threats.\n\nThe AC assessed the adequacy, effectiveness and independence of Group Audit, and is of the view that Group Audit is independent, effective and adequately resourced. Group Audit understands the risks that the Group faces and has aligned its work to review these risks.\n\nThere is at least one scheduled private session annually for the Head of Group Audit to meet\n\nthe AC. The Chair of the AC meets the Head of Group Audit regularly to discuss the audit plans, current work, key findings and other significant matters.\n\n## Reviewing performance, objectivity and\n\nindependence of the external auditor The AC has unfettered access to the external\n\nauditor. Separate sessions were held during each of the four quarterly AC meetings in 2020 for the AC to meet with the external auditor without the presence of management to discuss matters that might have to be raised privately.\n\nThe AC monitors the performance, objectivity and independence of the external auditor. For this purpose, the AC takes into account the Audit Quality Indicators Disclosure Framework issued by the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA); the guidance provided in Practice Guidance 10 of the 2018 Code, as well as the principles outlined by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in its document 'The External Audits of Banks'.\n\nThe total fees due to PwC, for the financial year ended 31 December 2020 and the\n\n## AC commentary on key audit matters\n\n| Significant matters                          | How the AC reviewed these matters                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Specific allowances  for loans and  advances | The AC reviewed the significant non-performing credit exposures periodically and considered management's  judgments, assumptions and methodologies used in the determination of the level of specific allowances required.  The AC focused, in particular, on management's assessment of the effect of Covid-19 on the economic outlook and  asset quality, relief measures granted as well as guidance issued by regulators on the recognition of loss allowances  in the context of Covid-19. The AC noted that major weak credits would also have been reviewed by the Board  Executive Committee quarterly. The AC was apprised of PwC's assessment following its credit review, which included  a sampling across performing, watch-list and non-performing portfolios to assess the appropriateness of the loan  ratings and classification, the adequacy of specific allowances where applicable, and an evaluation of how the impact  from Covid-19 had been taken into account. Additionally, the AC took into account the results from Group Audit's  independent assessment of the Group's asset quality and credit risk management process. The AC is of the view that  the specific allowances that have been set aside for non-performing credit exposures are appropriate. |\n| General  Allowances for  credit losses       | The AC reviewed the governance arrangements, including the matters considered by the Expected Credit Loss  (ECL) Review Committee, as well as the key drivers of the quarterly movements in Stage 1 and Stage 2 ECL (General  Allowances). These included the changes in portfolio asset quality, prevailing economic and geopolitical conditions,  as well as post model adjustments made to reflect the unprecedented and higher uncertainty in credit outlook as a  result of Covid-19. The AC took into account PwC's observations from its audit, which had included a review of selected  portfolios by credit specialists, along with assessments of the Group's methodologies (including the reasonableness of  certain forward-looking economic inputs), processes and controls. The AC, on the back of these reviews, considers the  General Allowances to be within a reasonable range.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Goodwill                                     | The AC reviewed the methodology and key assumptions driving the cash flow projections that are used in the  determination of the value-in-use of the DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Ltd's franchise, including the macroeconomic outlook,  geopolitical developments and the ramifications arising from the Covid-19 pandemic. It assessed the sensitivities  of the value-in-use to reasonably possible changes in the valuation parameters. The AC also reviewed the fair value  adjustments made to the assets and liabilities of Lakshmi Vilas Bank and the resultant provisional goodwill. The AC was  apprised of PwC's observations from its review of management's goodwill impairment assessment, and concurs that  there is no impairment as at 31 December 2020.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| Valuation matters                            | The AC reviewed the governance arrangements, including the deliberations of the Group Valuation Committee, as well  as the fair value hierarchy of financial instruments held at fair value, the quarterly movements in valuation reserves,  the appropriateness of the Group's valuation methodology in light of industry developments, and the overall adequacy  of valuation reserves. The AC was apprised of PwC's observations from its assessment of the Group's controls over  the valuation process, as well as its conclusion, based on the result of its independent estimates, that the valuation  of financial instruments held at fair value was within a reasonable range of outcomes. The AC considers the valuation  process, policies and estimates as adopted and disclosed in the financial statements to be appropriate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |",

The CMDC also reviews cases where total remuneration exceeds a pre-defined threshold, or where a deferral mechanism is implemented as a risk control process.\n\nWe have a robust disciplinary framework linked to individual compensation. The CMDC was apprised of the impact of disciplinary actions on individuals' compensation when approving the annual variable compensation pool and noted that (i) the Group's risk management and internal control  systems are adequate and effective, and (ii) the 2020 Risk & Culture score from the Kincentric My Voice survey remains stable at 88%.\n\nWith the emergence of the Covid-19 pandemic at the beginning of 2020, safeguarding the wellbeing and health of employees across our markets was our key priority. The CMDC was apprised of how we managed the Covid-19 situation for our employees, including the DBS Together Movement (which included a series of regular virtual, bankwide campaigns to bring employees across markets together) and actions taken to galvanise our employees to reimagine the future of work, workforce and workplace.\n\n## Talent Review and Succession Planning\n\nThe CMDC reviews the state of the talent and the strength of the human capital in DBS in support of its overall strategy. This includes a review of the talent bench strength, 'team in the field', succession plans for CEO and GMC members, as well as development plans for our High Potentials (HIPOs).\n\nThe CMDC reviewed the succession plans of CEO and the GMC members based on a DBS proprietary 'Key Success Factors' framework, which comprises four dimensions of a DBS senior leader success profile viz (i) domain knowledge, (ii) critical experiences,\n\n## Annual directors' fee structure for FY2020 (unchanged from FY2019)\n\n| Basic annual retainer fees                                                                        | SGD         |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|\n| Board                                                                                             | 100,000*    |\n| Lead Independent Director                                                                         | 75,000      |\n| Additional Chairman fees for:                                                                     |             |\n| Board                                                                                             | 1,450,000** |\n| Audit Committee                                                                                   | 90,000      |\n| Board Risk Management Committee                                                                   | 90,000      |\n| Compensation and Management Development Committee                                                 | 65,000      |\n| Executive Committee                                                                               | 75,000      |\n| Nominating Committee                                                                              | 45,000      |\n| Additional committee member fees for:  (Note: Board committee chairpersons do not get these fees) |             |\n| Audit Committee                                                                                   | 60,000      |\n| Board Risk Management Committee                                                                   | 60,000      |\n| Compensation and Management Development Committee                                                 | 35,000      |\n| Executive Committee                                                                               | 60,000      |\n| Nominating Committee                                                                              | 30,000      |\n\n- * The Non-Executive Directors who are currently in office have volunteered to take a 10% reduction in their basic retainer fees for FY2020. Subject to shareholders' approval at the 2021 AGM for the payment of Directors fees, the basic retainer fees payable to each Non-Executive Director (including the Board Chairman) will be SGD 90,000 for FY2020.\n- ** The Board Chairman has volunteered to take an additional 10% reduction in his Board Chairman's fee for FY2020. Subject to shareholders' approval at the 2021 AGM for the payment of Directors fees, the Board Chairman's fees payable will be SGD 1,305,000 for FY2020.\n\n(iii) leadership competencies and (iv) leadership traits. Potential successors for GMC were evaluated against these four dimensions to assess their readiness, and development plans to address their leadership gaps were put in place to prepare them for succession.\n\nThe CMDC also reviewed the development plans for the emerging young HIPOs with potential for GMC roles.\n\nIn assessing its Talent bench strength, the bank follows a robust HIPO identification process based on the '3P framework' namely Performance, PRIDE! and Potential. The assessment of potential is based on one's ability, aspiration and engagement.\n\nIdentified HIPOs are developed through a comprehensive 'triple-E development framework' which focuses on actionable development activities around education (conferences and leadership programs), exposure (mentoring, coaching and networking) and experience (new or stretched roles, cross country and cross function assignments), designed to accelerate their growth.\n\nThe commitment to HIPO development has paid off.  In 2020, HIPO attrition was healthy at 4.8%, well within our target of below 10%. 49% of our HIPOs also took on enhanced or changed roles, well above our target of 30%.\n\n## Remuneration of Non-Executive Directors\n\nPlease refer to pages 46 to 47 for details of remuneration of each Non-Executive Director (including the Chairman) for FY2020.\n\nThe CMDC reviews and recommends a framework to the Board for determining the remuneration of all Non-Executive Directors. The remuneration of Non-Executive Directors, including the Chairman, has been benchmarked against global and local financial institutions. Unless otherwise determined by the Board, Non-Executive Directors receive 70% of their fees in cash and the remaining 30% in share awards.\n\nThe share awards are not subject to a vesting period, but are subject to a selling moratorium whereby each Non-Executive Director is required to hold the equivalent of one year's basic retainer fees for his or her tenure as a Director and for one  year after the date he or she steps down. The fair value of share grants to the Non-Executive Directors are based on the volume-weighted average price of the ordinary shares of DBSH over the 10 trading days immediately prior to (and excluding) the date of the AGM. The actual number of ordinary shares to be awarded are rounded down to the nearest share, and any residual balance is paid in cash. Other than these share awards, the Non-Executive Directors do",

There is no change to the annual fee structure from FY2019. NonExecutive Directors are also paid attendance fees for attending Board and Board committee meetings. Shareholders are entitled to vote on the remuneration of Non-Executive Directors at the 2021 AGM.\n\nIn a show of solidarity with the nation and our stakeholders during the Covid-19 pandemic, all the Non-Executive Directors, who are currently in office, have volunteered to take a reduction in their Directors fees for FY2020.\n\nPlease refer to the Board highlights - 2020 section on page 44 for more information on the voluntary reduction in fees.\n\nNone of the Group's employees was an immediate family member of a Director with remuneration exceeding SGD 100,000 in 2020.\n\n## Effective controls\n\n## Group Approving Authority\n\nThe Group Approving Authority (GAA) is an integral part of our corporate governance framework.\n\nThe Board's responsibilities are well defined in the GAA. The Board is the decision-making body for matters with significant impact to DBS as a whole; these include matters with strategic, financial or reputational implications or consequences. The specific matters that require board approval under the GAA include:\n\n- \u00b7 Group's annual and interim financial statements\n- \u00b7 acquisitions and divestments exceeding certain material limits\n- \u00b7 Group's annual budget\n- \u00b7 capital expenditures and expenses exceeding certain material limits\n- \u00b7 capital-related matters including capital adequacy objectives, capital structure, capital issuance and redemption\n- \u00b7 dividend policy\n- \u00b7 risk strategy and risk appetite statement\n\n## Scope of delegation of authority in the GAA\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe GAA ensures that appropriate controls and decision-making are consistently applied throughout DBS. Under the GAA, the Board has delegated to the CEO the responsibility to ensure that the Group's businesses and operations are operated in accordance with Board-approved strategies and standards, which include responsibilities for the internal control framework within DBS. On matters where authority has been delegated to him, the CEO may further delegate his responsibilities and authorities to any GMC member or members and may empower them to, in turn, delegate their responsibilities and authorities to other executives and committees of the Group.\n\nThe GAA covers internal authority only and does not override any specific provisions arising from statutory, regulatory, exchange listing requirements, or the DBSH's Constitution. The GAA is regularly reviewed and updated to accommodate changes in the scope and activities of DBS' business and operations. The Board approves the GAA and any change to it.\n\n## Internal controls framework\n\nOur internal controls framework covers financial, operational, compliance and information technology controls, as well as risk management policies and systems. The Board, supported by the AC and BRMC, oversees the Group's system of internal controls and risk management. DBS has three lines of defence when it comes to risk taking, where each line of defence has a clear responsibility.\n\n## First line of defence\n\nOur business and support units are our first line of defence. Their responsibilities include\n\nthe identification and management of risks arising from and relating to their respective areas of responsibilities, and ensuring that our operations remain within approved boundaries of our risk appetite and policies.\n\nDBS has an established incident notification protocol that sets out processes for the escalation of incidents according to the level of severity. In this way, appropriate levels of management are made aware of such incidents and can take action accordingly. There are also well-defined procedures for the escalation, investigation and follow up of any reported wrong-doing by a DBS employee, customer, vendor or third party.\n\n## Second line of defence\n\nRisk Management Group, Group Legal and Compliance and parts of Group Technology & Operations and Group Finance form the second line of defence. They are responsible for the development and maintenance of risk management policies and processes and they provide objective review and challenge on the activities undertaken by business and support units.\n\n## Third line of defence\n\nGroup Audit forms the third line of defence. It provides an independent assessment and assurance on the reliability, adequacy and effectiveness of our system of internal controls, risk management, governance framework and processes.\n\n## Group Audit\n\n## Key responsibilities and processes\n\nGroup Audit is independent of the activities it audits. Its objectives, scope of authority and responsibilities are defined in the Audit Charter, which is approved by the AC. Group Audit reports functionally to the Chairperson of the AC and administratively to the CEO.\n\nGroup Audit's responsibilities include:\n\n- \u00b7 evaluating the reliability, adequacy and effectiveness of the Group's system of internal controls, risk management, governance framework and processes;\n- \u00b7 providing an objective and independent assessment of the Group's credit portfolio quality, the execution of approved credit portfolio strategies and control standards relating to credit management processes;\n\n| Board, CEO and Senior   | Provides oversight of the three lines of defence             | Provides oversight of the three lines of defence               | Provides oversight of the three lines of defence   |\n|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|\n| Management              | First line of defence                                        | Second line of defence                                         | Third line of defence                              |\n| Role                    | Own and manage risks  in respective areas of  responsibility | Provide independent risk  oversight, monitoring and  reporting | Provide independent assurance                      |\n| Unit                    | Business and support units                                   | Risk Management, Legal and  Compliance                         | Internal Audit                                     |",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 reviewing whether DBS complies with laws and regulations and adheres to established policies; and\n- \u00b7 reviewing whether management is taking appropriate steps to address control deficiencies.\n\nGroup Audit adheres to the DBS Code of Conduct and is guided by the Mission Statement in the Audit Charter. It adopted the Code of Ethics and aligned its practices with the International Professional Practices Framework established by the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA). In addition, it has embedded IIA's 10 Core Principles for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing into its activities.\n\nGroup Audit has unfettered access to the AC, the Board and management, as well as the right to seek information and explanation. Group Audit has an organisational and strategic alignment to the Group. The Head of Group Audit has a seat in the GMC and attends all the business reviews and strategic planning forums. The respective heads of audit in each of the five key locations outside Singapore are part of that location's management team.\n\nGroup Audit adopts a risk-based approach in its auditing activities. An annual audit plan is developed using a structured risk and control assessment framework through which the inherent risk and control effectiveness of each auditable entity in the Group are assessed. This risk assessment methodology and approach are aligned with that of Group, including the risk taxonomy.\n\nThe assessment also covers risks arising from new lines of business, new products and emerging risks from DBS' operating environment. Audit projects are planned based on the results of the assessment, with priority given to auditing higher risk areas and as required by regulators.\n\nAudit reports containing identified issues and corrective action plans are reported to the AC and senior management. Progress of the corrective action plans is monitored, and past due action plans are included in regular reports to the senior management and the AC. In all routine audits, Group Audit evaluates the control environment and management's control awareness which incorporates risk culture as guided by the Financial Stability Board's Guidance on Sound Risk Culture.\n\nGroup Audit apprises regulators and external auditors of all relevant audit matters. It works closely with external auditors to coordinate audit efforts.\n\n## Quality assurance and key developments\n\nIn line with leading practices, Group Audit has a quality assurance and improvement programme (QAIP) that covers its audit\n\nactivity and conforms to the International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing. As part of the QAIP, internal quality assurance reviews (QAR) are conducted quarterly and external QAR are carried out at least once every five years by qualified professionals from an external organisation. Since 2019, the internal QAR has been contracted to an independent assessor, Protiviti.\n\nBased on Protiviti's assessment, Group Audit leads the industry in the use of Agile Auditing approach and application of digital audit tools. These tools incorporate both rule-based and predictive analytics, enabling continuous risk monitoring. Group Audit was also rated the highest level in Protiviti's capability maturity model for audit planning, agile auditing, dynamic risk assessment and data analytics.\n\nIn 2020, Group Audit embedded the Data Driven Operating Model and Agile into its auditing journey to improve the speed of risk discovery and provide audit assurance.  The increased use of audit's analytical tools and data driven approach, coupled with the bank's suite of remote working technologies, enabled Group Audit to continue to conduct audit reviews under Covid-19 conditions.\n\n## Dealings in securities\n\nAlthough the Group has transitioned to a semi-annual reporting regime, the trading updates that are provided for the first and third quarters of each financial year are, for the purpose of the 'black-out' policies prescribed under Rule 1207(19) of the SGX Listing Rules, deemed to constitute 'financial statements'. Accordingly, Directors and employees are prohibited from trading in DBS' securities (i) one month before the release of the full-year financial statements; and (ii) two weeks before the release of its quarterly financial statements for the first, second and third quarters of each financial year.\n\nIn addition, business units and subsidiaries engaging in proprietary trading are restricted from trading in DBS' securities during the black-out period. Group Secretariat informs all Directors and employees of each blackout period ahead of time. Directors and employees are prohibited at all times from trading in DBS' securities if they are in possession of material non-public information.\n\nGMC members are only allowed to trade in DBS' securities within specific window periods (15 market days immediately following the expiry of each black-out period) subject to preclearance. GMC members are also required to obtain pre-approval from the CEO before any sale of DBS' securities. Similarly, the CEO is required to seek pre-approval from the Chairman before any sale of DBS' securities. As part of our commitment to good governance and the principles of share\n\nownership by senior management, the CEO is expected to build up and hold at least the equivalent of three times his annual base salary as shareholding over time.\n\nDBS has put in place a personal investment policy which prohibits employees with access to price-sensitive information in the course of their duties from trading in securities in which they possess such price-sensitive information. Such employees are also required to seek preclearance before making any personal trades in securities, and may only trade through the Group's stockbroking subsidiaries and bank channels for securities listed in Singapore and Hong Kong. The personal investment policy discourages employees from engaging in short-term speculative trading.\n\n## Related Party Transactions\n\nDBS has embedded procedures to comply with regulations governing related party transactions, including those in the Banking Act, MAS directives and the SGX Listing Rules. The Banking Act and MAS directives impose limits on credit exposures by DBS to certain related entities and persons, while the SGX Listing Rules cover interested person transactions in general.\n\nAll new Directors are briefed on relevant provisions that affect them. If necessary, existing credit facilities to related parties are adjusted prior to a Director's appointment, and all credit facilities to related parties are continually monitored. DBS has robust procedures to manage any potential conflict of interest between a Director and DBS. Checks are conducted before DBS enters into credit or other transactions with related parties to ensure compliance with regulations.\n\nAs required under the SGX Listing Rules, the details of interested person transactions in 2020 are set out in the table on page 58. These interested person transactions are for the purpose of carrying out day-to-day operations such as leasing of premises, telecommunication/ data services, IT systems and related services, redemption of KrisFlyer miles by DBS/ POSB credit card holders, logistics, as well as security services.\n\n## Material contracts\n\nSince the end of the previous financial year, no material contracts involving the interest of any Director or controlling shareholder of DBS has been entered into by DBS or any of its subsidiary companies, and no such contract subsisted as at 31 December 2020, save as disclosed via SGXNET.\n\n## Assessing the effectiveness of internal controls\n\nDBS has a risk management process that requires all units to perform a half-yearly risk and control self-assessment (RCSA) to assess the effectiveness of their internal controls.",

Based on the RCSA and the quarterly and annual attestations, the CEO and the key management personnel responsible for risk management and internal control systems provide an annual attestation to the AC relating to the adequacy and effectiveness of DBS' risk management and internal control systems.\n\nGroup Audit performs regular independent reviews to provide assurance on the adequacy and effectiveness of DBS' internal controls on risk management, control and governance processes. The overall adequacy and effectiveness of DBS' internal controls framework is reviewed by the AC and BRMC.\n\n## Board's commentary on adequacy and effectiveness of internal controls\n\nThe Board has received assurance from the CEO and CFO that, as at 31 December\n\n2020, the Group's financial records have been properly maintained, and the financial statements give a true and fair view of DBS Group's operations and finances.\n\nThe Board has also received assurance from the CEO and the key management personnel responsible for risk management and internal control systems that, as at 31 December 2020, the Group's risk management and internal control systems were adequate and effective to address financial, operational, compliance and information technology risks which the Group considers relevant  and material to its operations. The Board noted that efforts to integrate LVB commenced on 27 November 2020 and are ongoing.\n\nBased on the internal controls established and maintained by the Group, work performed by internal and external auditors, reviews performed by management and various Board Committees, as well as assurances received from management, the Board, with the concurrence of the AC, is of the opinion that the Group's internal controls and risk management systems were adequate and effective as at 31 December 2020 to address\n\nfinancial, operational, compliance risks and information technology risks  which the Group considers relevant and material to its operations.\n\nThe Board notes that the internal controls and risk management systems provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that the Group will not be affected by any event that could be reasonably foreseen as it strives to achieve its business objectives. In this regard, the Board also notes that no system can provide absolute assurance against the occurrence of material errors, poor judgement in decision-making, human error, fraud or other irregularities.\n\n## Strong culture\n\n## Effective safeguards\n\nWe believe that effective safeguards against undesired business conduct have to go beyond a 'tick-the-box' mentality. In DBS, other than relying on published codes of conduct, we also advocate the following organisational safeguards to maintain a strong risk and governance culture.\n\n- \u00b7 Tone from the top: The tone set by the Board and senior management is vital; it is equivalent to the moral compass of the organisation. In addition to having in place comprehensive policies, we conduct a robust self-assessment on the Group's risk culture. Please refer to the risk culture section on page 59 for more information.\n- \u00b7 Aligning strategies and incentives via the balanced scorecard: Please refer to the section on 'Our 2020 priorities' on pages 26 to 33 for more information.\n- \u00b7 Respecting the voice of control functions: We believe that respect for the voice of control functions is a key safeguard. We ensure that control functions are well integrated into our organisational structure so that they can properly discharge their responsibilities.\n- \u00b7 Risk ownership: Please refer to page 56 for details on our three lines of defence.\n- \u00b7 Having established escalation protocols: We designed a notification protocol that makes it mandatory for staff to report significant incidents. This means that the organisation is prepared to receive bad news and take necessary remedial actions without shooting the messengers.\n- \u00b7 Encouraging constructive challenges at all levels: Fundamentally, we inculcate a culture that encourages constructive challenges and debate, where all views are evaluated for decision-making. We also operate a culture where we actively engage the Board for their views early.\n- \u00b7 Reinforcing cultural alignment: Finally, we conscientiously reinforce our cultural norms by rewarding right behaviours and censuring wrong ones.",

        "page_content": "## Risk Culture\n\nRisk Culture is closely intertwined with our corporate values and it encompasses the general awareness, attitudes and behaviour of our employees towards risks. The results of our Risk Culture and Conduct Survey conducted in 2020 indicated a satisfactory risk culture bank-wide.\n\nIn 2020, we continued to align ourselves with the industry's best practices and lessons learnt to constantly drive improvements in this area. A risk culture and conduct dashboard, comprising multi-faceted indicators, was established to provide a holistic view of our risk culture pulse. Creating awareness continued to be the key focus as we further embedded a strong culture of risk and control across all levels within the organisation. We leveraged digital communication channels to share culture-related content and implemented a training curriculum to aid managers in strengthening the 'Tone from the Middle'. We continue to place emphasis on conduct as part of our compensation evaluation process.\n\n## The DBS Code of Conduct (Code of Conduct)\n\nThe Code of Conduct sets out the principles and standards of behaviour that are expected of employees of the Group (including parttime and temporary employees) when dealing with customers, business associates, regulators and colleagues. The principles covered in the Code of Conduct include professional integrity, confidentiality, conflicts of interests, fair dealings with customers and whistle-blowing. It also defines the procedures for employees of DBS to report incidents and provides protection for those staff for these disclosures.\n\nAll employees of DBS are required to read and acknowledge the Code of Conduct on an annual basis. Members of the public may access the Code of Conduct on DBS' website, as well as write in via an electronic feedback form on the website. The Code of Conduct encourages employees of DBS to report their concerns to DBS' dedicated, independent investigation team within Group Compliance which handles whistle-blowing cases according to a well-defined protocol. Alternatively, in case of actual or potential conflict of interest or fear of retribution, employees of DBS may write in confidence to Human Resources, Group Audit, or even the CEO or the Chairman. In addition, employees of DBS have the option of using the DBS Speak Up service.\n\n## Whistle-blowing policy\n\nDBS Speak Up is a hotline service run by an independent external party that gives employees of the Group the opportunity to speak up on misconduct and/ or wrongdoing by a DBS employee, customer, vendor or third party.\n\nDBS Speak Up service includes:\n\n- \u00b7 a dedicated hotline number, website, email address, fax number and postal address for reporting of suspected incidents of misconduct and wrongdoing;\n- \u00b7 specialist call centre operators with knowledge of individual organisations;\n- \u00b7 expert forensic investigators to analyse reports;\n- \u00b7 timely reporting of incidents to dedicated representatives within an organisation; and\n- \u00b7 recommendations on corrective action.\n\n## Accountability to our shareholders\n\n## Shareholder rights\n\nDBS promotes fair and equitable treatment of all shareholders. All shareholders enjoy specific rights under the Singapore Companies Act and DBSH's Constitution. These rights include, among others, the right to participate in profit distributions and the right to attend and vote at general meetings. Ordinary shareholders are entitled to attend and vote at general meetings in person or by proxy. Indirect investors who hold DBSH shares through a nominee company or custodian bank or through a CPF agent bank ('Relevant Intermediaries') may attend and vote at general meetings by requesting their Relevant Intermediaries to appoint them as proxies.\n\nDBS respects the equal information rights of all shareholders and is committed to the practice of fair, transparent and timely disclosure. All price-sensitive information is publicly released prior to any sessions with individual investors or analysts.\n\nThe Board provides shareholders with regular financial reports, which aim to give shareholders a balanced assessment of the Group's financial performance and position. The Board also ensures timely and full disclosure of material corporate developments to shareholders.\n\n## Engagement with shareholders\n\nOur investor relations activities promote regular, effective and fair communication with shareholders. Separate briefing sessions were conducted for the media and analysts when quarterly results were released. All press statements and quarterly financial statements have been published on our website and the SGX website. A dedicated investor relations team supports the CEO and the CFO in maintaining a close and active dialogue with investors. The DBS website provides contact details for investors to submit their feedback and raise any questions.\n\nDuring the year, we engaged with more than 600 debt and equity investors. We participated in 12 investor conferences and road shows. As a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, these\n\nengagements were conducted through virtual meetings and phone calls. These meetings provide a forum for management to explain DBS' strategy and financial performance, and solicit analysts' and investors' perceptions of DBS.\n\nWe have a disclosure policy to ensure that all disclosures of material information are timely, complete and accurate. The policy sets out how material information should be managed to prevent selective disclosure. Our Group Disclosure Committee (GDC) assists the CEO and the CFO in implementing the disclosure policy. The GDC's objectives are to: (a) periodically review DBS' disclosure policy and update it as needed, (b) ensure that all material disclosures are appropriate, complete and accurate, and (c) ensure selective or inadvertent disclosure of material information is avoided.\n\n## Conduct of shareholder meetings\n\nThis section describes DBS' usual practice for the conduct of general meetings prior to the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic in early 2020.\n\nDBS encourages and values shareholder participation at its general meetings. The Chairman plays a pivotal role in fostering constructive dialogue between shareholders, Board members and management at general meetings. Resolutions requiring shareholders' approval are tabled separately for adoption at general meetings unless they are closely related and are more appropriately tabled together. The minutes of our general meetings may be accessed via our website.\n\nDBS puts all resolutions at general meetings to a vote by electronic poll and announces the results by showing the number of votes cast for and against each resolution and the respective percentages. DBS appoints an independent external party as scrutineer for the electronic poll voting process. Prior to the commencement of a general meeting, the scrutineer would review the proxies and the electronic poll voting system as part of the proxy verification process. At the general meeting, mobile devices are used for poll voting and the results of the electronic poll voting are announced immediately after each resolution has been put to a vote. DBS maintains an audit trail of all votes cast at the general meeting.\n\nThe outcome of the general meeting (including detailed results of the poll vote for each resolution) is promptly disclosed on SGXNET within the same day after the conclusion of that meeting.\n\nAnnual General Meetings (AGMs) provide shareholders with the opportunity to share their views and to meet the Board, including the chairpersons of the Board committees and certain members of senior management. Our external auditor is available to answer",

At each AGM, DBS' financial performance for the preceding year is presented to shareholders.\n\n## Conduct of AGM in 2020 amidst current Covid-19 pandemic\n\nOn 9 March 2020, we issued our Notice of 2020 AGM to notify shareholders that our 2020 AGM will be held at Marina Bay Sands Expo and Convention Centre on 31 March 2020. However, in view of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Singapore government issued an order on 24 March 2020 requiring all events and mass gatherings to be deferred. As Singapore law then did not allow companies to hold general meetings by purely virtual means, we were required to adjourn our 2020 AGM.\n\nWe held our adjourned 2020 AGM by electronic means on 30 April 2020, pursuant to the Covid-19 (Temporary Measures) (Alternative Arrangements for Meetings for\n\nCompanies, Variable Capital Companies, Business Trusts, Unit Trusts and Debenture Holders) Order 2020 (the 'Order') which was gazetted on 13 April 2020. Shareholders were invited to participate in the virtual 2020 AGM by (a) observing and/or listening to the AGM proceedings via live audio-visual webcast or live audio-only stream; (b) submitting questions in advance of the 2020 AGM; and (c) appointing the Chairman of the Meeting as proxy to attend, speak and vote on their behalf at the 2020 AGM. The Chairman and CEO were present in person at the virtual 2020 AGM proceedings, while the rest of the Directors joined the 2020 AGM by way of video conference. We have disclosed, on our website and SGXNET, the names of the Directors and senior executives who attended the 2020 AGM held by way of electronic means as well as detailed records of the proceedings including responses to questions raised by shareholders in advance of the 2020 AGM.\n\n## Where to find key information on each Director?\n\nIn this Annual Report:\n\n- \u00b7 Pages 46 to 47 - Directors' independence status, appointment dates, meeting attendance and remuneration details\n- \u00b7 Pages 190 to 195 - Directors' length of directorship, academic and professional qualifications and present and past directorships\n- \u00b7 Pages 214 to 217 - Additional Information on Directors seeking re-election at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 30 March 2021\n\nAt our website (www.dbs.com): Directors' biodata\n\n## Conduct of 2021 AGM\n\nDue to prevailing Covid-19 restrictions, shareholders will not be able to attend our 2021 AGM in person. Instead, we will be holding our 2021 AGM by electronic means on 30 March 2021 and shareholders are invited to participate at our virtual 2021 AGM by (a) observing and/or listening to the 2021 AGM proceedings via live audio-visual webcast or live audio-only stream; (b) submitting questions in advance of, or 'live' at, the 2021 AGM; and (c) appointing the Chairman of the Meeting as proxy to attend, speak and vote on their behalf at the 2021 AGM. Details of the steps for pre-registration, submission of questions and voting at the 2021 AGM by shareholders, including CPF and SRS investors, are set out in a separate announcement released on SGXNET on 8 March 2021. In view of the constantly evolving Covid-19 situation in Singapore, we may be required to change our arrangements for the AGM at short notice and shareholders should check SGXNET for the latest updates on the status of the 2021 AGM.",

These retention shares are subject to DBS' usual four-year vesting period.\n\nRead more about the Share Plan on page 107.\n\n## 5 Summary of 2020 remuneration outcomes\n\nOur remuneration is linked to how we perform against our balanced scorecard (see pages 26 to 33) which is aligned to long-term value creation for our stakeholders in a sustainable way (see pages 66 to 67). Reflecting the lower balanced scorecard rating, caused by an unprecedented operating environment brought about by the global pandemic in 2020, our variable pay pool was lower than the previous year, with the per employee average variable pay down by a double-digit percentage. The Compensation and Management Development committee (CMDC) evaluated and approved the variable pay pool which was subsequently endorsed by the Board of Directors (Board).\n\nIn 2020, an external management consulting firm, Oliver Wyman, was engaged to provide an independent review of the Group's compensation system and processes to ensure compliance with the FSB Principles for Sound Compensation Practices. Oliver Wyman and its consultants are independent and not related to us or any of our Directors. The results of the review showed that we are in compliance with the FSB Principles for Sound Compensation Practices.\n\n## Senior management and material risk takers\n\nIn line with the principles set out by FSB, a substantial portion of remuneration (more than 50%) for our Senior Management as well as material risk takers (i.e. other employees whose actions have a material impact on the risk exposure of the bank) are variable. The variable remuneration in excess of a certain threshold are subject to deferral, thus ensuring alignment to the time horizon of risks.\n\nThe following charts show the mix of fixed and variable pay for both groups for performance year 2020:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Fixed pay\n\nVariable pay-cash\n\nVariable pay-deferred shares and/ or deferred cash (including retention awards)\n\n## Note:\n\nWe do not provide any other forms of fixed and variable remuneration aside from those disclosed in this section\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Our Senior Management's aggregate total remuneration in 2020 amounted to SGD 63.2 million, including the CEO's remuneration of SGD 9.2 million. This was 14% lower than 2019's aggregate total remuneration of SGD 73.5 million. Excluding the CEO's remuneration which has been separately disclosed, the median decrease in total remuneration and variable pay of the Senior Management who were members of the Group Management Committee for both 2019 and 2020 was 12% and 17% respectively.\n\nWhile corporate governance guidelines recommend that at least the top five key executives' remuneration be disclosed, the Board believes that it would be disadvantageous for us to do so because of the constant battle for talent in a highly competitive industry. This is consistent with banking industry practice in the local market. However, we do provide additional information on the median decrease in remuneration and variable pay of our Senior Management in the year as detailed above.\n\n## Breakdown of deferred remuneration awards\n\n| Category                                                                  | Senior Management  (1)   | Material Risk Takers  (2)   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Total outstanding deferred remuneration (3) :                             |                          |                             |\n| Cash                                                                      | 0.6%                     | 0.6%                        |\n| Shares and share-linked instruments                                       | 99.4%                    | 99.4%                       |\n| Other forms of remuneration                                               | -                        | -                           |\n| Total                                                                     | 100.0%                   | 100.0%                      |\n| Outstanding deferred and retained remuneration (3) (4) :                  |                          |                             |\n| Of which exposed to ex-post adjustments                                   |                          |                             |\n| Cash                                                                      | 0.6%                     |                             |\n| Shares and share-linked instruments                                       | 99.4%                    |                             |\n| Other forms of remuneration                                               |                          |                             |\n| Total                                                                     | 100.0%                   | 100.0%                      |\n| Total amendment during the year due to ex-post explicit adjustments (5) : |                          |                             |\n| Cash                                                                      | -                        | -                           |\n| Shares and share-linked instruments                                       | -                        | -                           |\n| Other forms of remuneration                                               | -                        | -                           |\n| Total                                                                     | -                        | -                           |\n| Total amendment during the year due to ex-post implicit adjustments (5) : |                          |                             |\n| Cash                                                                      | -                        | -                           |\n| Shares and share-linked instruments (6)                                   | (9.0)%                   | (11.4)%                     |\n| Other forms of remuneration                                               | -                        | -                           |\n| Total                                                                     | (9.0)%                   | (11.4)%                     |\n| Total deferred remuneration paid out in the financial year:               | 34.3%                    | 32.2%                       |\n| Headcount                                                                 | 20                       | 234                         |",

In the last 12 years, DBS has also built resiliency into its franchise, enabling it to withstand the global economic slowdown brought about by Covid-19 which paralysed economies around the world.\n\nDBS' franchise has demonstrated remarkable strength despite the significant economic impact of the pandemic. Even in an extremely challenging operating environment, as a testament to the quality of the franchise and nimble execution, the bank registered a record profit before allowances of SGD 8.43 billion, up 2% from 2019. Business volumes were resilient as loans grew, fee income was stable and Treasury Markets income rose to a record. Expenses were well managed. Net earnings, however, declined 26% due to a quadrupling of total allowances as general allowances were conservatively set aside for asset quality risks arising from the pandemic.\n\nDBS' early investments in digital transformation also paid off as both corporate and retail customers were able to bank with us in an uninterrupted manner from the safety of their homes, even as different markets experienced lockdowns and circuit breakers throughout the year. We also realised new opportunities for growth in the area of asset digitalisation, launching the DBS Digital Exchange which has the potential to reshape capital markets.\n\nTo address the massive changes to the future of work, DBS rolled out upskilling, reskilling and job-sharing programmes across the Group to better arm its workforce to be confident and future-ready.\n\nThe bank's efforts were recognised as DBS was named the \"Best Bank in the World\" by Global Finance in 2020, making it the third year in a row to be recognised on the world stage.\n\nHolding on to its long-term view of the region, DBS also continued to build a meaningful presence in core markets such as India, China and Indonesia. For example, the amalgamation of Lakshmi Villas Bank with DBS Bank India afforded us the opportunity to enlarge our footprint in that market.\n\nNotwithstanding the above, Mr Gupta's bonus was adjusted downwards by 27% (SGD 2.9 million) reflecting the difficult operating environment, general cutbacks adopted across the bank and the reduction in the bank's profits by 26%.\n\n## Breakdown of remuneration for performance year 2020 (1 January - 31 December)\n\n|                 | Salary  remuneration   SGD   | Cash bonus SGD   | Share Plan (2) SGD   | Others (3) SGD   | Total (4) SGD   |\n|-----------------|------------------------------|------------------|----------------------|------------------|-----------------|\n| Mr Piyush Gupta | 1,200,000                    | 3,413,200        | 4,507,300            | 62,130           | 9,182,630       |",

These local risk committees oversee the local risk positions for all businesses and support units, ensuring that they keep within limits set by the Group risk committees. They also approve location-specific risk policies.\n\nThe Chief Risk Officer (CRO), who is a member of the Group Executive Committee and reports to the Chairman of the BRMC and the CEO, oversees the risk management function. The CRO is independent of business lines and is actively involved in key decision-making processes. He often engages with regulators to discuss risk matters, enabling a more holistic risk management perspective.\n\nWorking closely with the risk and business committees, the CRO is responsible for the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Management of DBS' risks, including systems and processes to identify, approve, measure, monitor, control and report risks\n- \u00b7 Engagement with senior management about material matters regarding all risk types\n- \u00b7 Development of risk controls and mitigation processes\n- \u00b7 Ensuring DBS' risk management is effective, and the Risk Appetite established by the Board is adhered to\n\n## 4 Risk Appetite\n\nDBS' Risk Appetite is set by the Board and governed by the Risk Appetite Policy, which articulates the risks that we are willing to accept. It also serves to reinforce our risk culture by setting a clear message from the 'tone from the top'. A strong organisational risk culture, complemented with a balanced incentive framework (refer to 'Remuneration Report' section on page 61), helps to further embed our Risk Appetite.\n\n## 4.1 Risk thresholds and economic capital usage\n\nOur Risk Appetite takes into account a spectrum of risk types and is implemented using thresholds, policies, processes and controls.\n\nThreshold structures are essential in making DBS' Risk Appetite an intrinsic part of our businesses because they help to keep all our risks within acceptable levels. Portfolio risk limits for the quantifiable risk types reach all parts of DBS from the top down, and these are implemented using formal frameworks. As for the non-quantifiable risk types, these are controlled using qualitative principles.\n\nTo ensure that the thresholds pertaining to our Risk Appetite are completely risk sensitive, we have adopted economic capital (EC) as our primary risk metric. EC is assessed on top of regulatory capital as part of our Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP).\n\nRisk Appetite is managed through a capital allocation structure to monitor internal capital demand. The diagram below shows how risk is managed along the dimensions of customer-facing and non-customer-facing units.",

A buffer is also maintained for other risks, such as country, reputational, model risks, etc.\n\nThe following chart provides a broad overview of how our Risk Appetite permeates throughout DBS. Refer to Sections 5 through 9 for more information about each risk type.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- * Refer to Capital allocation diagram above\n\n## 4.2 Stress testing\n\nStress testing is an integral part of our risk management process. It includes both sensitivity analysis and scenario analysis, and is conducted regularly. In particular, the ICAAP (a group-wide exercise spanning risk types) is performed annually. In addition, stress tests are carried out in response to microeconomic and macroeconomic conditions, or portfolio developments. Every stress test is documented and the results are discussed at the BRMC.\n\nStress testing alerts senior management to our potential vulnerability to exceptional but\n\nplausible adverse events. As such, stress testing enables us to assess capital adequacy and identify potentially risky portfolio segments as well as inherent systematic risks. This then allows us to develop the right contingency plans, exit strategies and mitigating actions beforehand.\n\nThe ICAAP ensures our business plans are consistent with our Risk Appetite. This is done by comparing the projected demand for capital to the projected supply of capital under various scenarios, including severe macroeconomic stress.\n\n## 5 Credit risk\n\nThe most significant measurable risk DBS faces - credit risk - arises from our daily activities in our various businesses. These activities include lending to retail, corporate and institutional customers. It includes the risk of lending, pre-settlement and settlement risk of foreign exchange, derivatives and debt securities.\n\nRefer to Note 42.1 to the financial statements on page 169 for details on DBS' maximum exposure to credit risk.",

These policies, supplemented by a number of operational standards and guidelines, ensure consistency in identifying, assessing, underwriting, measuring, reporting and controlling credit risk across DBS, and provide guidance in the formulation of business-specific and/ or location-specific credit risk policies and standards.\n\nThe operational standards and guidelines are established to provide greater details on the implementation of the credit principles within the Group CCRPs and are adapted to reflect different credit environments and portfolio risk profiles. The CCRPs are approved by the GCPC.\n\n## Risk methodologies\n\nCredit risk is managed by thoroughly understanding our corporate customers - the businesses they are in, as well as the economies in which they operate. It is also managed through statistical models and data analytics for retail customers.\n\nThe assignment of credit risk ratings and setting of lending limits are integral parts of DBS' credit risk management process, and we use an array of rating models for our corporate and retail portfolios. Most of these models are built internally using DBS' loss data, and the limits are driven by DBS' Risk Appetite Statement and the Target Market and Risk Acceptance Criteria (TMRAC).\n\nFor credit risk concentration, we use EC as our measurement tool as it combines the individual risk factors such as the probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD) and exposure at default (EAD), in addition to industry correlation and portfolio concentration. EC thresholds are set to ensure that the allocated EC stays within our Risk Appetite. Governance processes are in place to ensure that these thresholds are monitored regularly, and appropriate actions are taken when the thresholds are breached.\n\nDBS continually examines and reviews how we can enhance the scope of our thresholds and approaches to manage concentration risk.\n\n## Environmental, social and governance risk\n\nResponsible financing, covering environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues, is a topic of increasing importance to societal constituents, and one that affects investing and lending decisions across the bank. DBS recognises that our financing practices have a substantial impact on society and failure of our customers to appropriately manage ESG issues can directly impact their operations and long-term economic viability, and the communities and environment in which they operate.\n\nThe Board approves DBS' overall and specific risk governance frameworks and oversees an independent Group-wide risk management system, including responsible financing. DBS had established a Group Responsible Financing Standard that documents our overarching approach to responsible financing and additional assessment required when entering into transactions with elevated ESG risks. The requirements of this Standard represent the minimum standards for DBS and we have also sought alignment, where possible, with international standards and best practices. Where significant ESG issues are identified, escalation is required to the relevant industry specialist and IBG Sustainability Office for further guidance before submitting the credit memorandum to the credit approving authority.\n\nRefer more about \"Responsible financing\" in the Sustainability Report.\n\n## Country risk\n\nCountry risk refers to the risk of loss due to events in a specific country (or a group of countries). This includes political, exchange rate, economic, sovereign and transfer risks.\n\nWholesale borrowers are assessed individually using both judgmental and statistical credit risk models.\n\nThey are further reviewed and evaluated by experienced credit risk managers who consider relevant credit risk factors in the final determination of the borrower's risk. For some portfolios within the SME segment, DBS also uses a programmebased approach to achieve a balanced management of risks and rewards. Retail exposures are assessed using credit score models, credit bureau records as well as internally and externally available customer behaviour records supplemented by our Risk Acceptance Criteria (RAC). Credit applications are proposed by the business units, and applications outside the RAC are independently assessed by the credit risk managers.\n\nRefer to Section 5.3 on page 83 to read more about our internal credit risk models.\n\nPre-settlement credit risk for traded products arising from a counterparty potentially defaulting on its obligations is quantified by evaluation of the market price plus potential future exposure. This is used to calculate DBS' regulatory capital under the Current Exposure Method (CEM), and is included within DBS' overall credit limits to counterparties for internal risk management.\n\nWe actively monitor and manage our exposure to counterparties for overthe-counter (OTC) derivative trades to protect our balance sheet in the event of a counterparty default. Counterparty risk exposures that may be adversely affected by market risk events are identified, reviewed and acted upon by management, and highlighted to the appropriate risk committees. Specific wrong-way risk arises when the credit exposure of a counterparty (from the traded product transaction) directly correlates with the probability of default of the counterparty. DBS has a policy to guide the handling of specific wrong-way risk transactions, and its risk measurement metric takes into account the higher risks associated with such transactions.\n\nIssuer default risk that may also arise from derivatives, notes and securities are generally measured based on jump-todefault computations.\n\n## Concentration risk management\n\nOur risk management processes, which are aligned with our Risk Appetite, ensure that an acceptable level of risk diversification is maintained across DBS.",

        "page_content": "DBS manages country risk through the requirements of the Group CCRP and the said risk is part of our concentration risk management. The way we manage transfer risk at DBS is set out in our Country Risk Management Standard. This includes an internal transfer risk and sovereign risk rating system, where assessments are made independently of business decisions. Our transfer risk limits are set in accordance with the Group Risk Appetite Policy.\n\nTransfer risk limits for priority countries are set based on country-specific strategic\n\nbusiness considerations as well as the acceptable potential loss according to our Risk Appetite. Management actively evaluates and determines the appropriate level of transfer risk exposures for these countries taking into account the risks and rewards and whether they are in line with our strategic intent. Limits for all other non-priority countries are set using a model-based approach.\n\nAll transfer risk limits are approved by the BRMC.\n\n## Credit stress testing\n\nDBS engages in various types of credit stress testing, and these are driven either by regulators or internal requirements and management.\n\nOur credit stress tests are performed at the total portfolio or sub-portfolio level, and are generally conducted to assess the impact of changing economic conditions on asset quality, earnings performance, capital adequacy and liquidity. DBS' stress testing programme is comprehensive and covers all major functions and areas of business.\n\nDBS typically performs the following types of credit stress testing at a minimum and others as necessary:\n\n| stress testing DBS conducts Pillar 1 credit stress testing regularly as required by regulators. Under Pillar 1 credit stress testing,  DBS assesses the impact of a mild stress scenario (at least two consecutive quarters of zero GDP growth) on  Internal Ratings-Based (IRB) estimates (i.e. PD, LGD and EAD) and the impact on regulatory capital.

Under Pillar 2 credit stress testing,  DBS assesses the impact of stress scenarios, with different levels of severity, on asset quality, earnings  performance as well as internal and regulatory capital. The results of the credit stress test form inputs to  the capital planning process under ICAAP. The purpose of the Pillar 2 credit stress testing is to examine, in a  rigorous and forward-looking manner, the possible events or changes in market conditions that could adversely | Pillar 2 credit   stress testing    |\n| DBS participates in the annual industry-wide stress test (IWST) conducted by the Monetary Authority of  Singapore (MAS) to facilitate the ongoing assessment of Singapore's financial stability. Under the IWST, DBS  is required to assess the impact of adverse scenarios, as defined by the regulator, on asset quality, earnings  performance and capital adequacy.                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Industry-wide   stress testing      |\n| DBS also conducts multiple independent sensitivity analyses and credit portfolio reviews based on various  scenarios. The intent of these analyses and reviews is to identify vulnerabilities for the purpose of developing  and executing mitigating actions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Sensitivity and   scenario analyses |\n\n## Processes, systems and reports\n\nDBS constantly invests in systems to support risk monitoring and reporting for our Institutional Banking and Consumer Banking/ Wealth Management businesses.\n\nThe end-to-end credit process is continually being reviewed and improved through various front-to-back initiatives involving business, operations, risk management and other key stakeholders. Day-to-day monitoring of credit exposures, portfolio performance and external environmental factors potentially affecting credit risk profiles is key to our philosophy of effective credit risk management.\n\nIn addition, credit trends, which may include industry analysis, early warning alerts and significant weak credits, are submitted to the various risk committees, allowing key strategies and action plans to be formulated and evaluated. Credit control functions also\n\nensure that any credit risk taken complies with the credit risk policies and standards. These functions ensure that approved limits are activated, credit excesses and policy exceptions are appropriately endorsed, compliance with credit standards is carried out, and covenants established are monitored.\n\nIndependent risk management functions that report to the CRO are jointly responsible for developing and maintaining a robust credit stress testing programme. These units oversee the implementation of credit stress tests as well as the analysis of the results, of which management, various risk committees and regulators are informed.\n\n## Non-performing assets\n\nDBS' credit facilities are classified as 'Performing assets' or 'Non-performing assets' (NPA), in accordance with the MAS\n\nNotice to Banks No. 612 'Credit Files, Grading and Provisioning' (MAS Notice 612).\n\nCredit exposures are categorised into one of the following five categories, according to our assessment of a borrower's ability to repay a credit facility from its normal sources of income and/ or the repayment behaviour of the borrower.",

A restructured credit facility is classified into the appropriate nonperforming grade based on the assessment of the borrower's financial condition and its ability to repay according to the restructured terms.\n\nSuch credit facilities are not returned to the performing status until there are reasonable grounds to conclude that the borrower will be able to service all future principal and interest payments on the credit facility in accordance with the restructured terms and MAS Notice 612. Apart from what has been described, we do not grant concessions to borrowers in the normal course of business.\n\nIn addition, it is not within DBS' business model to acquire debts that have been restructured at inception (e.g. distressed debts).\n\nRefer to Note 2.11 to the financial statements on page 125 for our accounting policies regarding specific and general allowances for credit losses.\n\nIn general, specific allowances are recognised for defaulting credit exposures rated substandard and below.\n\nThe breakdown of our NPA by loan grading and industry and the related amounts of specific allowances can be found in Note 42.2 to the financial statements on page 171. A breakdown of past due loans can also be found in the same note.\n\nWhen required, we will take possession of all collateral and dispose them as soon as practicable. Realised proceeds are used to reduce outstanding indebtedness.\n\nA breakdown of collateral held for NPA is shown in Note 42.2 to the financial statements on page 174.\n\nRepossessed collateral is classified in the balance sheet as other assets. The amounts of such other assets for 2019 and 2020 were not material.\n\n## 5.2 Credit risk mitigants Collateral received\n\nWhere possible, DBS takes collateral as a secondary source of repayment. This includes, but is not limited to, cash, marketable securities, real estate, trade receivables, inventory, equipment, and other physical and/ or financial collateral. We may also take fixed and floating charges on the assets of borrowers.\n\nPolicies are in place to determine the eligibility of collateral for credit risk mitigation. Collateral is generally diversified and periodic valuations of collateral are required. Real estate constitutes the bulk of our collateral, while marketable securities and cash are immaterial.\n\nFor derivatives, repurchase agreements\n\n(repo) and other repo-style transactions with financial market counterparties, collateral arrangements are typically covered under market-standard documentation, such as International Swaps & Derivatives Association (ISDA) Agreements and Master Repurchase Agreements. The collateral received is marked-tomarket on a frequency that DBS and the counterparties have mutually agreed upon. This is governed by internal guidelines with respect to collateral eligibility. In the event of a default, the credit risk exposure is reduced by master-netting arrangements where DBS is allowed to offset what we owe a counterparty against what is due from that counterparty in a netting-eligible jurisdiction.\n\nRefer to Note 14 to the financial statements on page 137 for further information on financial assets and liabilities subject to netting agreement but not offset on the balance sheet.\n\nCollateral held against derivatives generally consists of cash in major currencies and highly rated government or quasigovernment bonds. Exceptions may arise in certain countries, where due to domestic capital markets and business conditions, the bank may be required to accept less highly rated or liquid government bonds and currencies. Reverse repo-transactions are generally traded with large institutions with reasonably good credit standing. DBS takes haircuts against the underlying collateral of these transactions that commensurate with collateral quality to ensure credit risks are adequately mitigated.\n\nIn times of difficulty, we will review the customers' specific situation and circumstances to assist them in restructuring their financial obligations.",

DBS maintains a panel of agents and solicitors to assist in the disposal of non-liquid assets and specialised equipment quickly.\n\n## Collateral posted\n\nDBS is required to post additional collateral in the event of a rating downgrade. As at 31 December 2020, for a three-notch downgrade of its Standard & Poor's Ratings Services and Moody's Investors Services ratings, DBS will have to post additional collateral amounting to SGD 11 million (2019: SGD 11 million).\n\nFor additional collateral amount in the event of a rating downgrade, Lakshmi Vilas Bank is excluded as the impact is estimated to be insignificant.\n\n## Other credit risk mitigants\n\nDBS accepts guarantees as credit risk mitigants. Internal requirements for considering the eligibility of guarantors for credit risk mitigation are in place.\n\n## 5.3 Internal credit risk models\n\nDBS adopts rating systems for the different asset classes under the Internal Ratings Based Approach (IRBA).\n\nThere is a robust governance process for the development, independent validation and approval of any credit risk model. The models go through a rigorous review process before they are endorsed by the GCRMC and Risk EXCO. They must also be approved by the BRMC before submission for regulatory approval. The key risk measures generated by the internal credit risk rating models to quantify regulatory capital include PD, LGD and EAD. For portfolios under the Foundation IRBA, internal estimates of PD are used while the supervisory LGD and EAD estimates are applied. For retail portfolios under the Advanced IRBA, internal estimates of PD, LGD and EAD are used. In addition, the ratings from the credit models act as the basis for underwriting credit risk, monitoring portfolio performance and determining business strategies. The performance of the rating systems is monitored regularly and reported to the GCRMC, Risk EXCO and BRMC to ensure their ongoing effectiveness.\n\nAn independent risk unit conducts formal validations for the respective rating systems annually. The validation processes are also independently reviewed by Group Audit. These serve to highlight material deterioration in the rating systems for management attention.\n\n## 5.3.1 Retail exposure models\n\nRetail portfolios are categorised into the following asset classes under the Advanced IRBA: residential mortgages, qualifying revolving retail exposures and other retail exposures.\n\nWithin each asset class, exposures are managed on a portfolio basis. Each customer or account is assigned to a risk pool, considering factors such as borrower characteristics and collateral type. PD, EAD and LGD estimates are based on internal historical default, utilisation and realised losses within a defined period. Default is identified at the facility level.\n\nProduct-specific credit risk elements such as underwriting criteria, scoring models, approving authorities and asset quality and business strategy reviews, as well as systems, processes and techniques to monitor portfolio performance, are in place. Credit risk models for secured and unsecured portfolios are also used to update the risk level of each loan on a monthly basis, reflecting the broad usage of risk models in portfolio quality reviews.\n\n## 5.3.2 Wholesale  exposure models\n\nWholesale exposures are under the Foundation IRBA for capital computation. They include sovereign, bank and corporate. Specialised lending exposures are under IRBA using supervisory slotting criteria.\n\nSovereign exposures are risk-rated using internal risk-rating models. Factors related to country-specific macroeconomic risk, political risk, social risk and liquidity risk are included in the sovereign rating models to assess the sovereign credit risk in an objective and systematic manner.\n\nBank exposures are assessed using the bank-rating model. The model considers both quantitative and qualitative factors such as capital levels and liquidity, asset quality, earnings, management and market sensitivity.\n\nLarge corporate exposures are assessed using internal rating models. Factors considered in the risk assessment process include the counterparty's financial strength and qualitative factors such as industry risk, access to funding, market standing and management strength.\n\nSME credit rating models consider risk factors such as those relating to the counterparty's financial strength, qualitative factors, as well as account performance.\n\nCredit risk ratings under the IRBA portfolios are, at a minimum, reviewed by designated approvers on an annual basis unless credit conditions require more frequent assessment.\n\n## 5.3.3 Specialised  lending exposures\n\nSpecialised lending IRBA portfolios include income-producing real estate, project finance, object finance, and commodities finance. These adopt the supervisory slotting criteria specified under Annex 7v of MAS Notice 637, which are used to determine the risk weights to calculate credit risk-weighted exposures.\n\n## 5.3.4 Securitisation exposures\n\nWe arrange securitisation transactions for our clients for fees. These transactions do not involve special-purpose entities that we control. For transactions that are not underwritten, no securitisation exposures are assumed as a direct consequence of arranging the transactions. Any decision to invest in any of such arranged transactions is subject to independent risk assessment.\n\nWhere DBS provides an underwriting commitment, any securitisation exposure that arises will be held in the trading book to be traded or sold down in accordance with our internal policy and risk limits. In addition, DBS does not provide implicit support for any transactions we structure or have invested in.\n\nWe invest in our clients' securitisation transactions from time to time. These may include securitisation transactions arranged by us or with other parties.\n\nWe may also act as a liquidity facility provider, working capital facility provider or swap counterparty. Such exposures require the approval of the independent risk function and are subject to regular risk reviews. We also have processes in place to monitor the credit risk of our securitisation exposures.\n\n## 5.3.5 Credit exposures falling outside internal credit risk models\n\nDBS applies the Standardised Approach (SA) for portfolios that are expected to transit to IRBA or for portfolios that are immaterial in terms of size and risk profile. These portfolios include:\n\n- \u00b7 IRBA-transitioning retail and wholesale exposures\n- \u00b7 IRBA-exempt retail exposures\n- \u00b7 IRBA-exempt wholesale exposures",

In absolute terms, our total NPA, including the addition from the consolidation of Lakshmi Vilas Bank, increased by 16% from the previous year to SGD 6.69 billion and non-performing loans (NPL) ratio was at 1.6% in 2020.\n\nRefer to 'CFO Statement' on page 20.\n\n## Collateral received\n\nThe tables below provide breakdowns by loan-to-value (LTV) bands for the borrowings secured by real estate and other collateral from the various market segments.\n\n## Residential mortgage loans\n\nThe LTV ratio is calculated using mortgage loans including undrawn commitments divided by the collateral value. Property valuations are determined using a combination of professional appraisals and housing price indices.\n\nFor Singapore mortgages, new loans are capped at LTV limits of up to 75% for private residential mortgages, since July 2018. In tandem with the macro-prudential measures, private property price increases have moderated at about 2.2% year-onyear, there was an approximate 1.9% shift in the proportion of mortgage exposure from the LTV > 50% to the up-to-50% LTV band.\n\nFor Hong Kong mortgages, there was an approximate 2.2% increase in the proportion of mortgage exposure in the 51% to 80% LTV band due to higher proportion of matured/closed mortgage accounts in the up to 50% LTV band. Hong Kong property price index increased slightly by 1.3% in 2020.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Others\n- Professionals and private individuals (excluding housing loans)\n- Financial institutions, investments and holding companies\n- Transportation, storage & communications\n- General commerce\n- Housing loans\n- Building and construction\n- Manufacturing\n\nSingapore, our home market, continues to account for the largest share of our gross loans and advances to customers which contributed to 47% of our total portfolio. Growth was seen mainly in Singapore, Hong Kong and Rest of the World.\n\nOur portfolio is well diversified across industry and business segments. Building and construction, general commerce and manufacturing remain the largest contributors in the wholesale portfolio, accounting for 48% of the total portfolio.\n\nDBS uses external ratings for credit exposures under the SA where relevant, and we only accept ratings from Standard & Poor's, Moody's and Fitch in such cases.

The backtesting P&L excludes fees and commissions, revenues from intraday trading, non-daily valuation adjustments and time effects.\n\nFor backtesting, VaR at the 99% confidence interval and over a one-day holding period is used. We adopt the standardised approach to compute market risk regulatory capital under MAS Notice 637 for the trading book positions. As such, VaR backtesting does not impact our regulatory capital for market risk.\n\nThere are limitations to VaR models; for example, past changes in market risk factors may not provide accurate predictions of future market movements, and the risk arising from adverse market events may be understated.\n\nTo monitor DBS' vulnerability to unexpected but plausible extreme market risk-related events, we conduct multiple market risk stress tests regularly. These cover trading and non-trading portfolios and follow a combination of historical and hypothetical scenarios depicting risk-factor movement.\n\nES and Net Interest Income (NII) variability are the key risk metrics used to manage our assets and liabilities. Credit risk arising from loans and receivables is managed under the credit risk management framework. Interest rate risk in the banking book (IRRBB) arises from mismatches in the interest rate profiles of assets, liabilities and capital instruments. Estimating IRRBB requires the use of behavioural models and assumptions on certain parameters such as loan prepayment, fixed deposits early redemption and the duration of nonmaturity deposits. DBS measures IRRBB on a weekly and monthly basis.\n\n## Processes, systems and reports\n\nRobust internal control processes and systems have been designed and implemented to support our market risk management approach. DBS reviews these control processes and systems regularly, and these reviews allow senior management to assess their effectiveness.\n\nThe RMG Market and Liquidity Risk unit an independent market risk management function reporting to the CRO - monitors, controls and analyses DBS' market risk daily. The unit comprises risk control, risk analytics, production and reporting teams.\n\ninvestments, which are denominated in currencies other than the Singapore Dollar.\n\nWe use a variety of financial derivatives such as swaps, forwards and futures, and options for trading and hedging against market movements.\n\n## 6.1 Market risk management at DBS\n\nDBS' approach to market risk management comprises the following building blocks:\n\n| Policies                       |\n|--------------------------------|\n| Risk methodologies             |\n| Processes, systems and reports |\n\n## Policies\n\nThe Group Market Risk Management Policy sets our overall approach towards market risk management. This policy is supplemented with standards and guides, which facilitate the identification, measurement, control, monitoring and reporting of market risk in a consistent manner. They also set out the overall approach, requirements and controls governing market risk stress testing across DBS.\n\nThe criteria for determining the positions to be included in the trading book are stipulated in the Trading Book Policy Statement.\n\n## Risk methodologies\n\nDBS utilises Value-at-Risk (VaR), a statistical risk measure, to estimate the potential loss from market movements. This measure uses historical simulation based on data for the previous 12 months. It assumes that historical changes in market values reflect the distribution of potential outcomes in the immediate future.\n\nDBS limits and monitors market risk exposures using Expected Shortfall (ES) that is VaR calculated with a one-day holding period and an expected tail-loss methodology which approximates a 97.5% confidence interval.\n\nThe market risk economic capital that is allocated by the BRMC is linked to ES by a multiplier. ES is supplemented with risk control metrics such as sensitivities to risk factors and loss triggers for management action.\n\nDBS conducts backtesting to verify the predictiveness of the VaR model. Backtesting compares VaR calculated for positions at the close of each business day with the profit and loss (P&L) that arises",

In the event of a potential or actual crisis, we have in place a set of liquidity contingency and recovery plans to ensure that we maintain adequate liquidity.\n\nThe Group Liquidity Risk Management Policy is supported by Standards that establish the detailed requirements for liquidity risk identification, measurement, reporting and control within DBS. The set of Policies, Standards and supporting Guides communicate these baseline requirements to ensure a consistent application throughout DBS.\n\n## Risk methodologies\n\nThe primary measure used to manage liquidity within the tolerance defined by the Board is cash flow maturity mismatch analysis.\n\nThis form of analysis is performed on a regular basis under normal and adverse scenarios. It assesses the adequacy of our counterbalancing capacity to fund or mitigate any cash flow shortfalls that may occur as forecasted in the cash flow movements across successive time bands. To ensure that liquidity is managed in line with our Risk Appetite, core parameters such as the types of scenarios, the survival period and the minimum level of liquid assets, are pre-specified for monitoring and control on a group-wide basis. Any occurrences of forecasted shortfalls that cannot be covered by our counterbalancing capacity will be escalated to the relevant committees for evaluation and action.\n\nLiquidity risk stress testing is performed regularly using cash flow maturity mismatch analysis, and covers adverse scenarios including general market and idiosyncratic stress scenarios. Stress tests assess our vulnerability when liability run-offs increase, asset rollovers increase and/ or liquid asset buffers decrease. In addition, ad hoc stress tests are performed as part of our recovery planning and ICAAP exercises.\n\nLiquidity risk control measures such as liquidity-related ratios and balance sheet analysis are complementary tools for cash flow maturity mismatch analysis, and they are performed regularly to obtain deeper insights and finer control over our liquidity profile across different locations. The liquidity risk control measures also include concentration measures regarding top depositors, wholesale borrowing and swapped funds ratios.\n\n## Processes, systems and reports\n\nRobust internal control processes and systems support our overall approach in identifying, measuring, aggregating,\n\ncontrolling and monitoring liquidity risk across DBS. Continuous improvement in data and reporting platforms has allowed most elements of internal liquidity risk reporting to be centralised.\n\nThe RMG Market and Liquidity Risk unit manages the day-to-day liquidity risk monitoring, control reporting and analysis.\n\n## 7.2 Liquidity risk in 2020\n\nDBS actively monitors and manages our liquidity profile through cash flow maturity mismatch analysis.\n\nIn forecasting cash flow under the analysis, behavioural profiling is necessary in cases where a product has indeterminate maturity or the contractual maturity does not realistically reflect the expected cash flow.\n\nTwo examples are maturity-indeterminate savings and current account deposits, which are generally viewed as sources of stable funding for commercial banks. In fact, they consistently exhibit stability even under historic periods of stress. A conservative view is adopted in the behavioural profiling of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet commitments that have exhibited cash flow patterns that differ significantly from the contractual maturity profile shown under Note 43.1 of our financial statements on page 177.\n\nThe table below shows our behavioural net and cumulative maturity mismatch between assets and liabilities over a one-year period, in a normal scenario without incorporating growth projections. DBS' liquidity was observed to remain adequate in the maturity mismatch analysis. In 2020, the liquidity profile improved as deposit growth replaced shorter term funding while excess liquidity is retained in short term funds.\n\n| SGD million (a)                                    | Less than   7 days   | 1 week to   1 month   | 1 to 3  months   | 3 to 6 months   | 6 months to   1 year   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|------------------|-----------------|------------------------|\n| As at 31 Dec 2020 (b) (c)  Net liquidity  mismatch | 26,191               | 12,542                | 6,407            | 9,742           | 6,158                  |\n| Cumulative mismatch (c)                            | 26,191               | 38,733                | 45,140           | 54,882          | 61,040                 |\n| As at 31 Dec 2019 (b)  Net liquidity  mismatch     | 24,645               | (1,458)               | (11,813)         | 6,162           | 12,039                 |\n| Cumulative mismatch                                | 24,645               | 23,187                | 11,374           | 17,536          | 29,575                 |\n\n- (a) Positive indicates a position of liquidity surplus.

DBS' Treasury function expects to be able to operationally monetise our pool of liquid assets to meet liquidity shortfalls when the need arises. These liquid assets must be unencumbered and free of any legal, regulatory, contractual or other restrictions.\n\nIn practice, liquid assets are maintained in key locations and currencies to ensure that operating entities in such locations possess a degree of selfsufficiency to support business needs and guard against contingencies. The main portion of our liquid assets is centrally maintained in Singapore to support liquidity needs in smaller overseas subsidiaries and branches. Internally, DBS sets a requirement to maintain its pool of liquid assets above a minimum level as a source of contingent funds, taking into account regulatory recommended liquid asset levels as well as internally projected stress shortfalls under the cash flow maturity mismatch analysis.\n\nThe table below shows DBS' encumbered and unencumbered liquid assets by instrument and counterparty against other assets in the same category under the balance sheet.

Group LCR has been maintained well above the minimum LCR requirements of 100% for both all-currency and SGD.\n\nDBS' LCR is sensitive to balance sheet movements resulting from commercial loan/ deposit activities, wholesale inter-bank lending/ borrowing, and to the maturity tenor changes of these positions as they fall into or out of the LCR 30-day tenor. In order to meet the LCR requirements, DBS holds a pool of unencumbered High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) comprising predominantly cash, balances with central banks and highly rated bonds issued by governments or supranational entities.\n\n## 7.5 Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR)\n\nDBS is subject to the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) under MAS Notice to Banks No. 652 'Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR)' (MAS Notice 652). Group NSFR has been maintained consistently above the minimum regulatory requirement of 100%.\n\nNSFR aims to improve the resiliency of banks by promoting long term funding stability. We manage our NSFR by maintaining a stable balance sheet supported by a diversified funding base with access to funding sources across retail and wholesale channels.",

        "page_content": "## 8 Operational risk\n\nOperational risk is inherent in our business activities and may arise from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, systems, or from external events. DBS' objective is to keep operational risk at appropriate levels, taking into account the markets we operate in, the characteristics of the businesses as well as our economic and regulatory environment.\n\n## 8.1 Operational  risk management at DBS\n\nDBS' approach to operational risk management comprises the following building blocks:\n\n## Policies\n\nRisk methodologies\n\n## Processes, systems and reports\n\n## Policies\n\nThe Group Operational Risk Management (ORM) Policy sets our overall approach for managing operational risk in a structured, systematic and consistent manner.\n\nThere are policies, standards, tools and programmes in place to govern ORM practices across DBS. These include corporate operational risk policies and standards that are owned by the respective corporate oversight and control functions. The key policies address risk areas relating to technology, compliance, fraud, money laundering, financing of terrorism and sanctions, new product, outsourcing and ecosystem partnership.\n\n## Risk methodologies\n\nDBS adopts the standardised approach to compute operational risk regulatory capital.\n\nTo manage and control operational risk, we use various tools, including risk and control self-assessment, operational risk event management and key risk indicator monitoring.\n\nDBS' three lines of defence adopt one common risk taxonomy, and a consistent risk assessment approach to managing operational risk. Risk and control selfassessment is conducted by each business or support unit to identify key operational risk and assess the effectiveness of internal controls. When control issues are identified,\n\ncompliance programme designed to identify, assess, measure, mitigate and report on such risks through a combination of policy and relevant systems and controls.\n\nTo counter financial crime and sanctions risks, DBS established minimum standards for our business and support units to manage our actual and/ or potential risk exposures. In addition, standards aimed to provide the end-to-end management for fraud and related issues at the unit and geographical levels, were implemented through the Fraud Management Programme.\n\nDBS also provides relevant training and implements assurance processes. We strongly believe in the need to promote a strong compliance culture as well, and this is developed through the leadership of our Board and senior management.\n\n## New product, outsourcing and ecosystem partnership risks\n\nEach new product, service, outsourcing arrangement or ecosystem partnership is subject to a risk review and sign-off process, where relevant risks are identified and assessed. Variations of existing products or services and existing outsourcing arrangements and ecosystem partnerships are also subject to a similar process.\n\n## Other mitigation programmes\n\nA robust business continuity management programme is in place to ensure that essential banking services can continue in the event of unforeseen events or business disruptions. This includes a crisis management plan to enable quick response to manage incidents. Exercises are conducted annually, simulating different scenarios to test business continuity plans and crisis management protocol. The effectiveness of these exercises as well as DBS' business continuity readiness and our alignment to regulatory guidelines are communicated and attested by senior management to the BRMC annually.\n\nTo mitigate losses from specific risk events which are unexpected and significant, DBS purchases group-wide insurance policies under the Group Insurance Programme. These include policies relating to crime and professional indemnity, directors and officers liability, cyber risk, property damage and business interruption, general liability and terrorism.\n\nthe units develop action plans and track the resolution of the issues.\n\nOperational risk events are classified in accordance with Basel standards. Such events, including any significant incidents that may impact DBS' reputation, must be reported based on certain established thresholds. Key risk indicators with predefined escalation triggers are employed to facilitate risk monitoring in a forwardlooking manner.\n\nAdditional methodologies are in place to address subject-specific risks, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\n## Technology risk\n\nInformation Technology (IT) risk is managed through an enterprise technology risk management approach. This covers risk identification, assessment, mitigation, monitoring and reporting. In addition, the appropriate governance, IT policies and standards, control processes and risk mitigation programmes are in place to support the risk management approach.\n\n## Cyber security risk\n\nCyber security risk is an important and continuous focus of the bank. DBS devotes significant attention and resources to protect and improve the security of its computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets. Similar to IT risk, cyber security risk is managed through the same enterprise risk management approach, which cuts across all lines of business. The Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) oversees the cyber security function and the one-stop competency centre for all cyber security related matters, such as operational risks and data protection risks.\n\n## Compliance risk\n\nCompliance risk refers to the risk of DBS not being able to successfully conduct our business because of any failure to comply with laws, regulatory requirements, industry codes or standards of business and professional conduct applicable to the financial sector.\n\nThis includes, in particular, laws and regulations applicable to the licensing and conducting of banking or other financial businesses, financial crime such as antimoney laundering (AML) and countering the financing of terrorism (CFT), fraud and bribery/ corruption.

The RMG Operational Risk unit and other corporate oversight and control functions:\n\n- \u00b7 Oversee and monitor the effectiveness of operational risk management\n- \u00b7 Assess key operational risk issues with the units\n- \u00b7 Report and/ or escalate key operational risks to risk committees with recommendations on appropriate risk mitigation strategies\n\nDBS has in place an integrated governance, risk and compliance system with aligned risk assessment methodology, common taxonomy, and unified processes for the three lines of defence. In 2020, we implemented an operational risk landscape profile which provides the Board and senior management with an integrated view of DBS' operational risk profile periodically, across key operational risk areas and business lines.\n\n## 8.2 Operational risk in 2020\n\nThe total operational risk losses in 2020 decreased to SGD 6 million (0.04% of DBS' total operating income), from SGD 33 million (0.23%) in 2019.

These risks include:\n\n- \u00b7 Financial risk (credit, market and liquidity risks)\n- \u00b7 Inherent risk (operational and business/ strategic risks)\n\n## 9.1 Reputational  risk management at DBS\n\nDBS' approach to reputational risk management comprises the following building blocks:\n\n## Policies\n\nRisk methodologies\n\nProcesses, systems and reports\n\n## Policies\n\nDBS adopts a four-step approach for reputational risk management, which is to prevent, detect, escalate and respond to reputational risk events.\n\nAs reputational risk is a consequence of the failure to manage other risk types, the definitions and principles for managing\n\nmanages its reputational risks. Stakeholders include customers, government agencies and regulators, investors, rating agencies, business alliances, vendors, trade unions, the media, the general public, the Board and senior management, and DBS' employees.\n\nWe recognise that creating a sense of shared value through engagement with key stakeholder groups is imperative for our brand and reputation.\n\nRead more about our stakeholder engagement on page 74.\n\n## Processes, systems and reports\n\nOur units are responsible for the day-today management of reputational risk, and ensure that processes and procedures are in place to identify, assess and respond to this risk. This includes social media monitoring to pick up adverse comments on DBS. Events affecting DBS' reputational risk are also included in our reporting of risk profiles to senior management and Boardlevel committees.\n\n## 9.2 Reputational risk in 2020\n\nDBS' priority is to prevent the occurrence of a reputational risk event, instead of taking mitigating action when it occurs. There were no significant reputational risk incidents endangering the DBS franchise in 2020.\n\nsuch risks are articulated in the respective risk policies. These are reinforced by sound corporate values that reflect ethical behaviours and practices throughout DBS.\n\nAt DBS, we have policies in place to protect the consistency of our brand and to safeguard our corporate identity and reputation.\n\n## Risk methodologies\n\nUnder the various risk policies, we have established a number of mechanisms for ongoing risk monitoring.\n\nThese mechanisms take the form of risk limits, key risk indicators and other operating metrics, and include the periodic risk and control self-assessment process. Apart from observations from internal sources, alerts from external parties/ stakeholders also serve as an important source to detect potential reputational risk events. In addition, there are policies relating to media communications, social media and corporate social responsibility to protect DBS' reputation. There are also escalation and response mechanisms in place for managing reputational risk.\n\nWhile the respective risk policies address the individual risk types, the Reputational Risk Policy focuses specifically on our stakeholders' perception of how well DBS",

        "page_content": "## Capital management and planning\n\n## Objective\n\nThe Board of Directors (Board) is responsible for setting our capital management objective, which is to maintain a strong capital position consistent with regulatory requirements under the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) Notice to Banks No. 637 'Notice on Risk Based Capital Adequacy Requirements for Banks Incorporated in Singapore' (MAS Notice 637) and the expectations of various stakeholders including customers, investors and rating agencies. The Board articulates this objective in the form of capital targets. This objective is pursued while delivering returns to shareholders and ensuring that adequate capital resources are available for business growth and investment opportunities as well as adverse situations, taking into consideration our strategic plans and risk appetite.\n\nOur dividend policy is to pay sustainable dividends that grow progressively with earnings. On 29 July 2020, the MAS called on locally-incorporated banks to cap their total dividends per share ('DPS') for FY2020 at 60% of FY2019's DPS, and offer shareholders the option of receiving the dividends to be paid for FY2020 in scrip in lieu of cash. While the MAS recognised that Singapore banks' capital positions are strong, the dividend restrictions were a pre-emptive measure to bolster the banks' resilience and capacity to support lending. In line with MAS' guidance, the Board has recommended a final dividend of SGD 0.18 per ordinary share, bringing the total ordinary dividend for the year to SGD 0.87 per share. The Scrip Dividend Scheme will be applied to the final dividend.\n\n## Process\n\nOur capital management objective is implemented via a capital management and planning process that is overseen by the Capital Committee. The Chief Financial Officer chairs the Capital Committee. The Capital Committee receives regular updates on our current and projected capital position. A key tool for capital planning is the annual Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) through which we assess our projected capital supply and demand relative to regulatory requirements and our capital targets. The\n\nICAAP generally has a three-year horizon and covers various scenarios, including stress scenarios of differing scope and severity.\n\nCapital capacity is allocated on two dimensions: by business line and by entity. Capital allocations by business line are set as part of the budget process and monitored during the year. Return on regulatory capital is one of several metrics used to measure business performance. Capital allocations by entity seek to optimise the distribution of capital resources across entities, taking  into account the capital adequacy requirements imposed on each subsidiary in its respective jurisdiction. Capital is allocated to ensure that each subsidiary is able to comply with regulatory requirements as it executes its business strategy in line with our strategy.\n\nDuring  the  course  of  the  year, these subsidiaries did not experience any impediments to the distribution of dividends.\n\n## Capital structure\n\nWe manage our capital structure in line with our capital management objective and seek to optimise the cost and flexibility offered by various capital resources. In order to achieve this, we assess the need and the opportunity to raise or retire capital. The following capital transactions were undertaken during the year.\n\n## Common Equity Tier 1 capital\n\n- \u00b7 The Scrip Dividend Scheme was not applied to the 2019 final or interim dividend for the first quarter of the year ended 31 December 2020.\n- \u00b7 DBS Group Holdings Ltd, on 5 October 2020, issued 2,184,219 ordinary shares pursuant to the Scrip Dividend Scheme in respect of the interim dividend for the second quarter of the year ended 31 December 2020. This added SGD 46 million to ordinary share capital.\n- \u00b7 DBS Group Holdings Ltd, on 29 December 2020, issued 9,743,049 ordinary shares pursuant to the Scrip Dividend Scheme in respect of the interim dividend for the third quarter of the year ended 31 December 2020. This added SGD 233 million to ordinary share capital.\n\n- \u00b7 As at 31 December 2020, the number of treasury shares held by the Group was 25,874,461 (2019: 10,330,656), which was 1.01% (2019: 0.40%) of the total number of issued shares net of treasury shares. In response to the MAS' direction for the sustaining of lending activities to take priority over discretionary distributions, the Group halted share buybacks at the end of March 2020.\n\nRefer to Note 32 to the financial statements for details on the movement of share capital during the year.\n\n## Additional Tier 1 capital\n\n- \u00b7 DBS Group Holdings Ltd, on 27 February 2020, issued USD 1,000 million 3.30% NonCumulative, Non-Convertible Perpetual Capital Securities First Callable in 2025.\n- \u00b7 DBS Bank Ltd., on 23 November 2020 redeemed the SGD 800 million 4.70% NonCumulative, Non-Convertible, Non-Voting Preference Shares Callable in 2020.\n\n## Tier 2 capital\n\n- \u00b7 DBS Group Holdings Ltd, on 8 October 2020, issued AUD 300 million Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due 2031 and Callable in 2026.\n\nRefer to Notes 31, 33 and 35 to the financial statements as well as the Main Features of Capital Instruments document (https://www.dbs.com/ investors/fixed-income/capital-instruments) for the terms of the capital instruments that are included in Eligible Total Capital.",

Under the MAS' framework for identifying and supervising D-SIBs, the higher loss absorbency requirement for locally incorporated D-SIBs is met by the foregoing minimum ratios being two percentage points higher than those established by the Basel Committee. The Basel Committee has developed an indicator-based methodology for identifying global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) on which higher loss absorbency requirements will be imposed. While we are not a G-SIB, we are required to disclose the 12 indicators which are included in the DBS Group's Pillar 3 disclosures published on DBS' website (https://www.dbs.com/ investors/default.page).\n\nOn 7 May 2019, the MAS released a consultation paper on 'Proposed Implementation of the Final Basel III Reforms in Singapore', seeking feedback on proposed revisions to the risk-based capital requirements and leverage ratio requirements for Singapore-incorporated banks to align with the Basel III reforms, and to implement these revisions from 1 January 2022. On 7 April 2020, the MAS announced that the implementation date of the Basel III reforms had been deferred by one year to 1 January 2023 to enable banks to prioritise their resources to respond to the impact of COVID-19.\n\nOn 31 March 2020, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, MAS Notice 637 was amended to allow the full recognition of balances maintained in regulatory loss allowance reserve accounts as Tier 2 Capital between 31 March 2020 and 30 September 2021 (both dates inclusive). Further technical revisions to MAS Notice 637 were implemented with effect from 1 October 2020, including the capital treatment of public sector entities.",

Details of the DBSH Share Plan are set out in Note 39 of the Notes to the 2020 Company's financial statements\n\nThere was no change in any of the above-mentioned interests between the end of the financial year and 21 January 2021.\n\n## DBSH Share Plan\n\nAt the Annual General Meeting held on 25 April 2019, the DBSH Share Plan (which was first adopted on 18 September 1999) was extended for another ten years, from 18 September 2019 to 17 September 2029 (both dates inclusive). The DBSH Share Plan is administered by the Compensation and Management Development Committee (CMDC). As at the date of this statement, the members of the CMDC are Mr Andre Sekulic (Chairman), Mr Peter Seah, Dr Bonghan Cho, Ms Euleen Goh and Ms Punita Lal.\n\nUnder the terms of the DBSH Share Plan:\n\n- (a) Awards over DBSH's ordinary shares may be granted to Group executives who hold such rank as may be determined by the CMDC from time to time. Awards may also be granted to (amongst others) executives of associated companies of DBSH who hold such rank as may be determined by the CMDC from time to time, and non-executive Directors of DBSH;\n- (b) Where time-based awards are granted, participants are awarded ordinary shares of DBSH or, at the CMDC's discretion, their equivalent cash value or a combination of both as part of their deferred bonus, at the end of the prescribed vesting periods.  Awards are granted under the DBSH Share Plan at the absolute discretion of the CMDC.  Dividends on unvested shares do not accrue to employees;",

In addition, during the financial year, certain non-executive Directors received an aggregate of 60,236 share awards which vested immediately upon grant.

        "page_content": "## Our audit approach\n\n## Overview\n\n## Materiality\n\n- \u00b7 We determined the overall Group materiality based on 5% of the Group's profit before tax.\n\n## Group scoping\n\n- \u00b7 Full scope audit procedures were performed over the Singapore Operations of DBS Bank Ltd. and DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Limited ('significant components').\n- \u00b7 We identified DBS Bank Ltd. Hong Kong, Taipei and Seoul Branches, DBS Bank (China) Limited, PT Bank DBS Indonesia, DBS Bank (Taiwan) Ltd and DBS Bank India Limited as component entities where certain account balances were considered to be significant in size in relation to the Group ('other components'). Consequently, specific audit procedures for the significant account balances of these components were performed to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence.\n\n## Key audit matters\n\n- \u00b7 Specific allowances for loans and advances to customers\n- \u00b7 General allowances for credit losses (Stage 1 and 2 Expected Credit Loss)\n- \u00b7 Goodwill\n- \u00b7 Valuation of financial instruments held at fair value\n\nAs part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the accompanying financial statements. In particular, we considered where management made subjective judgements; for example, in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including, among other matters, consideration of whether there was evidence of bias that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.\n\n## Materiality\n\nThe scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. An audit is designed to obtain reasonable assurance as to whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement. Misstatements may arise due to fraud or error. They are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the consolidated financial statements.\n\nBased on our professional judgement, we determined certain quantitative thresholds for materiality, including the overall group materiality for the consolidated financial statements as a whole, as set out in the table below. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the effect of misstatements, both individually and on the financial statements as a whole.\n\n| How we determined overall Group materiality   | 5% of the Group's profit before tax                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Rationale for benchmark applied               | \u00b7  We chose 'profit before tax' as, in our view, it is the benchmark against  which performance of the Group is most commonly measured.  \u00b7  We selected 5% based on our professional judgement, noting that it is  also within the range of commonly accepted profit-related thresholds. |\n\nIn performing our audit, we allocated materiality levels to the significant components and other components of the Group.

        "page_content": "## How we developed the audit scope\n\nWe tailored the scope of our audit in order to perform sufficient work to enable us to provide an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the Group, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the Group operates. The Group's financial reporting process is dependent on its Information Technology ('IT') systems. Our audit scope included testing the operating effectiveness of the controls over the integrity of key financial data processed through the IT systems that are relevant to financial reporting.\n\nIn establishing the overall Group audit approach, we determined the extent of audit procedures that were needed to be performed across the Group by us or by other PwC network firms, operating under our instruction, who are familiar with the local laws and regulations in each respective territory, (the 'component auditors'). Where the work was performed by component auditors, we determined the level of involvement we needed to have in the procedures to be able to conclude whether sufficient and appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the financial statements as a whole.\n\n## Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements for the financial year ended 31 December 2020. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n## Key audit matter\n\n## How our audit addressed the key audit matter\n\n## Specific allowances for loans and advances to customers\n\nAs at 31 December 2020, the specific allowances for loans and advances to customers of the Group was $2,692 million, the majority of which related to Institutional Banking Group ('IBG') customers. Specific allowances refer to loss allowances for credit-impaired exposures (i.e. Stage 3, per SFRS (I) 9). Expected Credit Losses ('ECL') on non-impaired exposures (i.e. Stage 1 and Stage 2) is set out under the 'General allowances for credit losses' key audit matter.\n\nWe focused on this area because of the subjective judgements used by management in determining the necessity for, and estimating the size of, allowances against loans and advances.\n\nIn particular, we focused on specific allowances for loans and advances to IBG customers because any assessment of impairment can be inherently subjective and involves significant judgement over both the timing of recognition of any impairment and the estimation of the size of such impairment. This includes:\n\n- \u00b7 the principal assumptions underlying the calculation of specific allowances for loans and advances to IBG customers where there is evidence of impairment losses (including the future profitability of the borrowers and the expected realisable value of collateral held); and\n- \u00b7 the classification of loans and advances in line with MAS Notice 612 ('MAS 612').\n\nWe applied judgement in selecting samples focused on borrowers with exposures to certain sectors in view of continued heightened credit risks and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic impacting the portfolio.\n\n(Refer also to Notes 3 and 18 to the financial statements.)\n\nWe assessed the design and evaluated the operating effectiveness of the controls over the specific allowances for loans and advances to IBG customers. These controls included:\n\n- \u00b7 oversight of credit risk by the Group Credit Risk Committee;\n- \u00b7 timely management review of credit risk;\n- \u00b7 the watchlist identification and monitoring process;\n- \u00b7 timely identification of impairment events;\n- \u00b7 classification of loans and advances in line with MAS 612; and\n- \u00b7 the collateral monitoring and valuation processes.\n\nWe determined that we could rely on these controls for the purposes of our audit.\n\nWe inspected a sample of loans and advances to IBG customers to assess whether the classification of the loans and advances was in line with MAS 612 and, where there was evidence of an impairment loss, whether it had been identified in a timely manner. This included, where relevant, how forbearance had been considered, with particular focus on the impact of COVID-19.\n\nWhere impairment had been identified, for a sample of loans and advances, our work included:\n\n- \u00b7 considering the latest developments in relation to the borrower;\n- \u00b7 examining the forecasts of future cash flows prepared by management, including key assumptions in relation to the amount and timing of recoveries;\n- \u00b7 comparing the collateral valuation and other sources of repayment to support the calculation of the impairment against external evidence, where available, including independent valuation reports;\n- \u00b7 challenging management's assumptions; and\n- \u00b7 testing the calculations.\n\nFor a sample of performing loans and advances to IBG customers which had not been identified by management as potentially impaired, considering the latest developments in relation to the borrower, we challenged management's assumptions on whether their classification was appropriate, using external evidence where available in respect of the relevant borrower.\n\nBased on procedures performed, we have assessed that the aggregate specific allowance for loans and advances is appropriate.",

The valuations of 'Level 3' instruments rely on significant unobservable inputs.\n\nWe considered the overall valuation of financial instruments (Level 1, 2 and 3) to be a key audit matter given the financial significance to the Group, the nature of the underlying products and the estimation involved to determine fair value.\n\nIn determining fair value, management also make adjustments to recognise credit risk, funding costs, bid-offer spreads and, in some cases, parameter and model risk limitations. This is broadly consistent with the banking industry, albeit the methodology to calculate some of these adjustments is continuing to evolve.\n\n(Refer also to Notes 3 and 41 to the financial statements.)\n\n## Other Information\n\nManagement is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the Directors' Statement (but does not include the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon), which we obtained prior to the date of this auditor's report, and the other sections of the Annual Report ('the Other Sections') which are expected to be made available to us after that date.\n\nOur opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not and will not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nIf, based on the work we have performed on the other information that we obtained prior to the date of this auditor's report, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\nWhen we read the Other Sections, if we conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, we are required to communicate the matter to those charged with governance and take appropriate actions in accordance with SSAs.\n\n## Responsibilities of Management and Directors for the Financial Statements\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the provisions of the Act and SFRS(I)s, and for devising and maintaining a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide a reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorised use or disposition; and transactions are properly authorised and that they are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of true and fair financial statements and to maintain accountability of assets.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThe directors' responsibilities include overseeing the Group's financial reporting process.\n\nWe assessed the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the controls over the Group's financial instruments valuation processes. These included the controls over:\n\n- \u00b7 management's testing and approval of new models and revalidation of existing models;\n- \u00b7 the completeness and accuracy of pricing data inputs into valuation models;\n- \u00b7 monitoring of collateral disputes; and\n- \u00b7 governance mechanisms and monitoring over the valuation processes (including derivative valuation adjustments) by the Group Market and Liquidity Risk Committee and the Group Valuation Committee.\n\nWe determined that we could rely on the controls for the purposes of our audit. In addition, we:\n\n- \u00b7 engaged our own specialists to use their own models and input sources to determine an independent estimate of fair value for a sample of the Group's Level 1 and Level 2 financial instruments. We compared these to the Group's calculations of fair value to assess individual material valuation differences or systemic bias;\n- \u00b7 assessed the reasonableness of the methodologies used and the assumptions made for a sample of financial instrument valuations with significant unobservable valuation inputs (Level 3 instruments);\n- \u00b7 performed procedures on collateral disputes to identify possible indicators of inappropriate valuations;\n- \u00b7 performed tests of inputs and assessed the methodology over fair value adjustments, in light of available market data and industry trends; and\n- \u00b7 considered the implications of global reforms to Interest Reference Rates ('IBOR Reform') in our assessment of fair value.\n\nOverall, we considered that the valuation of financial instruments held at fair value was within a reasonable range of outcomes.",

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SSAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with SSAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n- \u00b7 Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- \u00b7 Obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with the directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide the directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\n## Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements\n\nIn our opinion, the accounting and other records required by the Act to be kept by the Company and by those subsidiary corporations incorporated in Singapore of which we are the auditors, have been properly kept in accordance with the provisions of the Act.\n\nThe engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditor's report is Antony Eldridge.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\n\nPublic Accountants and Chartered Accountants\n\nSingapore, 9 February 2021",

Domicile and Activities\n\nThe Company, DBS Group Holdings Ltd, is incorporated and domiciled in the Republic of Singapore and has its registered office at 12 Marina Boulevard, Marina Bay Financial Centre Tower Three, Singapore 018982.\n\nThe Company is listed on the Singapore Exchange.\n\nThe Company is an investment holding, treasury and funding vehicle for the group. Its main subsidiary is DBS Bank Ltd. (the Bank), which is wholly owned and engaged in a range of commercial banking and financial services, principally in Asia.\n\nThe financial statements relate to the Company and its subsidiaries (the Group) and the Group's interests in associates.\n\n## 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## 2.1 Basis of preparation\n\n## Compliance with Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (International) (SFRS(I))\n\nThe financial statements of the Company and the consolidated financial statements of the Group are prepared in accordance with Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (International) (SFRS(I)). As permitted by Section 201(10)(b) of the Companies Act (the Act), the Company's income statement has not been included in these financial statements.\n\nThe financial statements are presented in Singapore dollars and rounded to the nearest million, unless otherwise stated.\n\n## 2.2 Significant estimates and judgement\n\nThe preparation of financial statements requires management to exercise judgement, use estimates and make assumptions in the application of policies and in reporting the amounts in the financial statements. Although these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events and actions, actual results may differ from these estimates. Critical accounting estimates and assumptions used that are significant to the financial statements, and areas involving a higher degree of judgement and complexity, are disclosed in Note 3.\n\n## 2.3 New or amended SFRS(I) and Interpretations effective for 2020 year-end\n\nOn 1 January 2020, the Group adopted 'Amendments to SFRS(I) 9, SFRS(I) 1-39 and SFRS(I) 7 Interest Rate Benchmark Reform'. These amendments are issued due to global reform of interest rate benchmarks such as Interbank Offered Rates (IBOR) to phase out dealer-quotes and replace them with alternative risk-free reference rates (RFR).\n\nThe Group's main interest rate benchmark exposures are USD London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), Singapore Swap Offer Rate (SGD SOR), which is calculated based on USD LIBOR, and Singapore Interbank\n\nOffered Rate (SGD SIBOR). USD LIBOR will be replaced by USD Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) while the replacement benchmark rate for SGD SOR and SGD SIBOR is the Singapore Overnight Rate Average (SORA).\n\nThe other amendments and interpretations effective from 1 January 2020 do not have a significant impact on the Group's financial statements\n\n## Amendments to SFRS(I) 9, SFRS(I) 1-39 and SFRS(I) 7 Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase 1\n\n'Amendments to SFRS(I) 9, SFRS(I) 1-39 and SFRS(I) 7 Interest Rate Benchmark Reform' provide temporary exceptions that allow entities to continue hedge accounting for existing hedge relationships under the assumption that IBOR based hedged cash flows are not altered as a result of uncertainty arising from IBOR reform.\n\nThe uncertainty over IBOR reform ends when the key terms of the transition have been finalised i.e. the timing of the transition and adjustment spreads between the IBOR and the RFR (not just the methodology) have been finalised for the affected contracts. As at 31 December 2020, the Group continues to apply these temporary exceptions.\n\nIn accordance with the transitional provisions, the amendments have been adopted retrospectively and there was no impact to the Group's financial statements.\n\nThe key assumption made when performing hedge accounting is that both the hedged item and hedging instrument will be amended from existing IBOR-linked interest rates to the new RFR at the same time. Where actual differences between those dates arise, hedge ineffectiveness will be recorded in the income statement.\n\nA Group steering committee was established in 2019 to manage the impact of IBOR reform on the Group. The committee comprises senior representatives from Institutional Banking Group, Consumer Banking Group, Treasury Markets, Finance, Risk Management Group, Technology & Operations, Legal and Compliance and is chaired by the Corporate Treasurer. The Terms of Reference of the committee are to review transition plans related to LIBOR and SGD SOR discontinuation, SIBOR reform, and other interest rate benchmark reform, to assess the Group's key risks across different scenarios, and to develop strategies to manage existing and new business in the context of these risks. Oversight of IBOR reform is provided by the Group Executive Committee and the Board Risk Management Committee.\n\n## 2.4 New SFRS(I) and Interpretations effective for future periods\n\nThe amendments and interpretations effective for future periods do not have a significant impact on the Group's financial statements, except for Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase 2 where impact is being assessed.\n\n## Amendments to SFRS(I) 9, SFRS(I) 1-39 and SFRS(I) 7, SFRS(I) 4, SFRS(I) 16, Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase 2\n\nIn November 2020, the ASC issued 'Amendments to SFRS(I) 9, SFRS(I) 1-39 and SFRS(I) 7, SFRS(I) 4, SFRS(I) 16, Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase 2'. The amendments are effective from 1 January 2021 and\n\n- \u00b7 require the Group to account for changes in the contractual cash flows of financial instruments that result solely from IBOR reform",

Hedge ineffectiveness (e.g. arising from mismatches of timing or cash flows) would continue to be recorded in the income statement\n\nThe Group is currently assessing the impact of the amendments.\n\n## A) General Accounting Policies\n\nA summary of the significant group accounting policies is described further below starting with those relating to the entire financial statements, followed by those relating to the income statement, the balance sheet and other specific topics. This does not reflect the relative importance of these policies to the Group.\n\n## 2.5 Group  Accounting\n\n## Subsidiaries\n\nSubsidiaries are entities (including structured entities) over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.\n\nSubsidiaries are consolidated from the date control is transferred to the Group to the date control ceases.\n\nThe acquisition method is used to account for business combinations. Please refer to Note 2.13 for the Group's accounting policy on goodwill.\n\nAll intra-group transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation.\n\n## Associates\n\nAssociates are entities over which the Group has significant influence but no control, where the Group generally holds a shareholding of between and including 20% and 50% of the voting rights. Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method.\n\n## 2.6 Foreign currency treatment\n\n## Functional and presentation currency\n\nItems in the financial statements are measured using the functional currency of each entity in the Group, this being the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. The Group's financial statements are presented in Singapore dollars, which is the functional currency of the Company.\n\nWith effect from 1 January 2021, the functional currency of the Treasury Markets trading business in Singapore ('TM Singapore') will be changing prospectively from Singapore dollars to US dollars (USD).\n\nThe transition to the new USD functional currency on 1 January 2021 will have no impact on the income statement or equity. The change in functional currency better reflects the increasing dominance of the USD in the business activities of TM Singapore.\n\n## Foreign currency transactions and balances\n\nTransactions in foreign currencies are measured using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.\n\nMonetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency of the entity undertaking the transaction at the exchange rates at the balance sheet date. Foreign exchange differences arising from this translation are recognised in the income statement within 'Net trading income'.\n\nNon-monetary assets and liabilities measured at cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date of the transaction.\n\nNon-monetary assets and liabilities measured at fair values in foreign currencies are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair values are determined, which is generally the balance sheet date.\n\nUnrealised foreign exchange differences arising from non-monetary financial assets and liabilities classified as fair value through profit or loss (FVPL) are recognised in the income statement as trading income.\n\nNon-monetary financial assets that are classified at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) relates mainly to FVOCI equities. Please refer to Note 2.9 for the accounting treatment of FVOCI equities.\n\n## Subsidiaries and branches\n\nThe results and financial position of subsidiaries and branches whose functional currency is not Singapore dollars ('foreign operations') are translated into Singapore dollars in the following manner:\n\n- \u00b7 Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates at the balance sheet date;\n- \u00b7 Income and expenses in the income statement are translated at exchange rates prevailing at each month-end, approximating the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions; and\n- \u00b7 All resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated under capital reserves in equity. When a foreign operation is partially or fully disposed of, or when it is liquidated, such exchange differences are recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss.\n\nFor acquisitions prior to 1 January 2005, the foreign exchange rates at the respective dates of acquisition were used. Please refer to Note 27 for an overview of goodwill recorded. Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation on or after 1 January 2005 are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the closing rate.\n\n## 2.7 Segment reporting\n\nOperating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to management.\n\nIn preparing the segment information, amounts for each business segment are shown after the allocation of certain centralised costs, funding income and the application of transfer pricing, where appropriate. Transactions between segments are recorded within the segment as if they are third party transactions and are eliminated on consolidation.\n\nPlease refer to Note 45 for further details on business and geographical segment reporting.",

        "page_content": "## B) Income Statement\n\n## 2.8 Income  recognition\n\n## Interest income and interest expense\n\nInterest income and interest expense as presented in Note 4 arise from all interest-bearing financial assets and financial liabilities regardless of their classification and measurement, with the exception of the Group's structured investment deposits which are carried at FVPL. Interest expense on such structured investment deposits is presented together with other fair value changes in trading income.\n\nInterest income and interest expense are recognised on a timeproportionate basis using the effective interest method. The calculation includes significant fees and transaction costs that are integral to the effective interest rate, as well as premiums or discounts.\n\n## Fee and commission income\n\nThe Group earns fee and commission income from a diverse range of products and services provided to its customers. Fee and commission income are recognised when the Group has satisfied its performance obligation in providing the promised products and services to the customer, and are recognised based on contractual rates agreed with customers, net of expected waivers based on historical experience, and net of expenses directly related to it. The Group generally satisfies its performance obligation and recognises the fee and commission income on the following basis:\n\n- \u00b7 Transaction-based fee and commission income is recognised on the completion of the transaction. Such fees include underwriting fees, brokerage fees, bancassurance sales commission and variable service fees, and fees related to the completion of corporate finance transactions.\n- \u00b7 For a service that is provided over a period of time, fee and commission income is generally recognised on equal proportion basis over the period during which the related service is provided or credit risk is undertaken. This basis of recognition most appropriately reflects the nature and pattern of provision of these services to the customers over time. Fees for these services can be billed to customers in advance or periodically over time. Such fees include the income from issuance of financial guarantees and bancassurance fixed service fees.\n\nThe Group does not provide any significant credit terms to customers for the above products and services.\n\nDirectly related expenses typically include brokerage fees paid, cardrelated expenses and sales commissions, but do not include expenses for services delivered over a period (such as service contracts) and other expenses that are not specifically related to fee and commission income transactions.\n\n## Dividend income\n\nDividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established. This is generally the ex-dividend date for listed equity securities, and the date when shareholders approve the dividend for unlisted equity securities. Dividend income arising from financial assets classified as FVPL is recognised in 'Net trading income', while those arising from FVOCI financial assets is recognised in 'Net income from investment securities'.\n\n## Allowances for credit and other losses\n\nPlease refer to Note 2.11 for the accounting policy on impairment of financial assets.\n\n## C) Balance Sheet\n\n## 2.9 Financial  assets\n\n## Initial recognition\n\nPurchases and sales of all financial assets are recognised on the date that the Group enters into the contractual arrangements with counterparties. When the Group acts as a trustee or in a fiduciary capacity for assets it does not directly control or benefit from, the assets and the corresponding income belonging to a customer are excluded from the financial statements.\n\nFinancial assets are initially recognised at fair value, which is generally the transaction price.\n\n## Classification and subsequent measurement\n\nSFRS(I) 9 categorises debt-like financial assets based on the business model within which the assets are managed, and whether the assets constitute a 'basic lending arrangement' where their contractual cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI). Interest is defined as consideration for the time value of money, credit risk, other basic lending risks and may include a profit margin.\n\nThe classification of the financial assets and the associated accounting treatment are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Debt instruments are measured at amortised cost when they are in a 'hold to collect' (HTC) business model and have contractual cash flows that are SPPI in nature. The objective of a HTC business model is to collect contractual principal and interest cash flows. Sales are incidental to the objective and expected to be either insignificant or infrequent. These assets consist primarily of loans in the 'Consumer Banking/ Wealth Management' and 'Institutional Banking' segments as well as debt securities from the 'Others' segment.\n- \u00b7 Debt instruments are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) when they are in a 'hold to collect & sell' (HTC & S) business model and have cash flows that are SPPI in nature. Both the collection of contractual cash flows and sales are integral to achieving the objective of the HTC & S business model. Assets measured at FVOCI comprise mainly of debt securities from 'Treasury Markets' and the 'Others' segment.\n\nUnrealised gains or losses on FVOCI debt instruments are recorded in other comprehensive income and accumulated in FVOCI revaluation reserves. When they are sold, the accumulated fair value adjustments in FVOCI are reclassified to the income statement as 'Net income from investment securities'.\n\n- \u00b7 Debt instruments are measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL) when:\n- i) the assets are not SPPI in nature;\n- ii) the assets are not part of a 'HTC' or 'HTC & S' business model; or\n- iii)  the assets are designated at FVPL to eliminate or significantly reduce the measurement or recognition inconsistencies that would otherwise arise from measuring assets or liabilities on different bases.\n\nAssets measured at FVPL are mainly recorded in the 'Treasury Markets' segment. Realised and unrealised gains or losses on FVPL financial assets, except interest income, are taken to 'Net trading income' in the income statement in the period they arise.",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 Subsequent changes in fair value of non-trading equity can be taken through profit or loss or comprehensive income, as elected. The Group generally elects its non-trading equity instruments to be classified as FVOCI. Other than dividend income, gains and losses on FVOCI equity instruments are recorded in other comprehensive income and accumulated in FVOCI revaluation reserves, and not reclassified to profit or loss upon derecognition.\n- \u00b7 Derivatives (including derivatives embedded in financial liabilities but separated for accounting purposes) are also classified as held for trading unless they are designated as hedging instruments. Derivatives are classified as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative. Changes in the fair value of derivatives other than those designated as hedging instruments in cash flow or net investment hedges are included in 'Net trading income'.\n\n## Reclassification\n\nReclassification of financial assets are prohibited unless the Group changes its business model for managing financial assets. In practice, this is expected to be infrequent.\n\n## Determination of fair value\n\nThe fair value of financial assets is the price that would be received if the asset is sold in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value is generally estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows at the current market interest rate that is available to the Group for similar financial instruments. Where applicable, a valuation reserve or pricing adjustment is applied to arrive at the fair value. The determination of fair value is considered a significant accounting policy for the Group and further details are disclosed in Note 41.\n\n## Offsetting\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are presented net when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle them on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\n\n## Derecognition\n\nFinancial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or when they have been transferred together with substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.\n\nThe Group enters into certain transactions where it transfers financial assets recognised on its balance sheet but retains either all or a portion of the risks and rewards of the transferred financial assets. In such cases, the transferred financial assets are not derecognised from the balance sheet. Such transactions include repurchase agreements described in Note 2.12. They also include transactions where control over the financial asset is retained, for example, by a simultaneous transaction (such as options) with the same counterparty to which the asset is transferred. These are mainly transacted in the 'Treasury Markets' segment. In such cases, the Group continues to recognise the asset to the extent of its continuing involvement which is the extent to which it is exposed to changes in the value of the transferred asset.\n\nPlease refer to Note 19 for disclosures on transferred financial assets.\n\n## 2.10 Cash and cash equivalents\n\nFor the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and non-restricted balances with central banks which are readily convertible into cash.\n\n## 2.11 Impairment of financial assets at amortised cost and FVOCI\n\n## Expected Credit Losses (ECL)\n\nECL are recognised for all financial assets held at amortised cost, debt instruments measured at FVOCI, guarantees and undrawn credit commitments. It represents the present value of expected cash shortfalls over the residual term of a financial asset, guarantee or undrawn commitment.\n\nAt initial recognition, allowance is required for ECL resulting from possible default events that may occur within the next 12 months ('12-month ECL'). In the event of a significant increase in credit risk, allowance is required for ECL resulting from possible default events over the expected life of the instrument ('lifetime ECL').\n\nThe ECL recognised follows the three-stage model: financial instruments where 12-month ECL is recognised are considered Stage 1; financial instruments which experience a significant increase in credit risk are in Stage 2; and financial instruments with objective evidence of default or credit-impaired are in Stage 3.\n\n- \u00b7 Stage 1 - Financial instruments are classified as Stage 1 at initial recognition and will remain under Stage 1 unless they experience a significant increase in credit risk or become credit-impaired. 12-month ECL is recognised for these instruments.\n- \u00b7 Stage 2 - Financial instruments which experience a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) subsequent to initial recognition, but are not yet credit-impaired, will migrate from Stage 1 to Stage 2. Lifetime ECL is recognised for these instruments.\n\nSignificant increase in credit risk (SICR): SICR is assessed by comparing the risk of default at reporting date to the risk of default at origination using a range of qualitative and quantitative factors.\n\nFor wholesale exposures, a financial instrument is deemed to have experienced a significant increase in credit risk when:\n\n- \u00b7 the observed change in its probability of default (PD), as observed by downgrades in the Group's internal credit risk rating for this instrument between origination and reporting dates, is more than pre-specified thresholds; or\n- \u00b7 it is placed on internal credit watchlists for closer scrutiny of developing credit issues.\n\nFor retail exposures, days past due is the main driver, supplemented with a PD-based criterion. In any event, all retail and wholesale exposures that are more than 30 days past due are presumed to have experienced a significant increase in credit risk, unless assessed otherwise, and are classified as Stage 2.\n\nInstruments in Stage 2 that no longer exhibit a significant increase in credit risk will be transferred back to Stage 1.\n\n- \u00b7 Stage 3 - Financial instruments that become credit-impaired with evidence of default, i.e. non-performing assets, are transferred to Stage 3. Please refer to Risk Management section for the definition of non-performing assets.\n\nLifetime ECL is recognised for these assets. ECL for Stage 3 assets are also known as specific allowances.",

        "page_content": "A Stage 3 exposure that is restructured can be upgraded to Stage 2 if there are reasonable grounds to conclude that the obligor is able to service future principal and interest payments in accordance with the restructured terms. Stage 3 financial assets are written-off, in whole or in part, when the Group has exhausted all practical recovery efforts and has concluded that there is no reasonable expectation of future recoveries.\n\n## Measurement of ECL\n\nECL are unbiased and probability-weighted estimates of credit losses determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes, considering past events, current conditions and assessments of future economic conditions at the reporting date. The ECL associated with a financial instrument is typically a product of its probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD) and exposure at default (EAD) discounted using the original effective interest rate to the reporting date.\n\n| Component   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| PD          | Point-in-time (based on current conditions, adjusted to  take into account estimates of future conditions that  will impact PD) estimate of the likelihood of default.                                                             |\n| LGD         | Estimate of the loss arising on default. It is based on  the difference between the contractual cash flows due  and those that the Group would expect to receive,  including recoveries from collaterals.                          |\n| EAD         | Estimate of the expected credit exposure at time of  default, taking into account repayments of principal  and interest as well as expected drawdowns on  undrawn credit commitments and potential pay-outs  on guarantees issued. |\n\nThe 12-month ECL is calculated by multiplying the 12-month PD, LGD and EAD. Lifetime ECL is calculated using the lifetime PD. The 12-month and lifetime PDs represent the probability of default occurring over the next 12 months and the remaining maturity of the instrument respectively.\n\nIn most instances, expected remaining maturity is the same as the remaining contractual life which represents the maximum contractual period over which the Group is exposed to the credit risk of the borrower. However, for some revolving products (e.g. credit cards), the expected remaining maturity may exceed the contractual maturity. In such instances, behavioural expected remaining life will be used.\n\n## ECL Modelling - Point-in-Time and Forward-Looking Adjustments\n\nThe Group leverages the models and parameters implemented under the Basel II Internal Ratings-Based (IRB) framework where possible, with appropriate modifications to meet SFRS(I) 9 requirements.\n\nOther relevant historical information, loss experience or proxies will be utilised for portfolios without appropriate Basel models and parameters, with a view to maximise the use of available information that is reliable and supportable.\n\nFor the wholesale portfolios, credit cycle indices (CCIs) have been developed for the key industries and geographies. CCIs are summary measures that depict broad-based, sector-wide changes in credit risk, which are constructed by comparing the median expected default frequency of firms within each segment against a long-run average. Expected default frequency is in turn a market-based point-in-time default risk measure driven by the market value of firms' assets, asset volatility and leverage. CCIs are then used as inputs to convert the generally more through-the-cycle PDs derived from Basel models/ parameters into the point-in-time equivalents by adding the unaccounted portion of cyclical variations, as well as to incorporate forward-looking information. LGDs are determined using historical loss data, which are adjusted for both the latest and forecasted recovery experience.\n\nThe Group relies on a Monte Carlo simulation approach to consider over 100 probability-weighted forward-looking scenarios in estimating ECL. This involves simulations of many alternative CCI scenarios to arrive at an unbiased ECL estimate that are meant to cover all possible good and bad scenarios based on known estimates.\n\nFor retail portfolios, historical loss experience is used in conjunction with the forecast loss rates which take into account relevant macroeconomic variables, such as property-prices and unemployment rates.\n\n## Expert credit judgement and post model adjustments\n\nThe measurement of ECL requires the application of expert credit judgement. These include:\n\n- \u00b7 assignment of credit risk ratings and determination of whether exposures should be placed on credit watchlists;\n- \u00b7 assessment of whether a significant increase in credit risk has occurred;\n- \u00b7 selecting and calibrating the ECL models such as CCIs;\n- \u00b7 determining the expected remaining maturity of revolving products (e.g. overdrafts and credit cards);\n- \u00b7 determination of the forecast loss rates; and\n- \u00b7 application of thematic overlays based on emerging risk themes where potential risks may not be fully captured in the underlying modelled ECL. Such top-down additional modelled ECL was quantified by means of applying conditional probabilities on more severe scenarios materialising from emerging risk themes.\n\nAs at 31 December 2020, thematic ECL overlays were applied to account for uncertainties arising from the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, the continuing US-China trade tensions and the sociopolitical situation in Hong Kong. When determining the quantum of thematic overlays, the Group has considered a range of plausible credit cost outcomes under base and stress scenarios using a topdown approach. These assessments consider both the economic impact of Covid-19 and the various government relief measures implemented to mitigate the impact. The Group has assigned probabilities to the scenarios in-line with management's judgement of the likelihood of each scenario occurring in determining the overlay.\n\nThe base case scenario forecasts a deterioration in the short-term, with economic recovery within a 2-year horizon. The stress case scenario is a more severe outlook with a deeper and longer period of recession in which economic recovery is delayed till end 2023 and 2024. This includes a combination of negative GDP growth, declines in property prices and an increase in the unemployment rates.\n\n## Governance framework\n\nThe measurement of ECL is subject to a robust governance framework as described below.\n\n- \u00b7 The Group ECL Review Committee (Review Committee) is the overarching committee for ECL related matters and comprises senior management and representatives from functions across the Group. Significant changes to ECL models and methodologies and the application of thematic overlays are subject to the oversight and approval of the Review Committee.\n- \u00b7 The Review Committee is supported by the Group ECL Operating Committee (Operating Committee) which comprises cross functional representatives and subject matter experts. The Operating Committee recommends changes to ECL models, methodologies and thematic overlays to the Review Committee; provides oversight over system design, infrastructure and development; and establishes principles and significant policies pertaining to ECL. Group Credit Risk Models Committee oversees ECL models and credit risk models used by the Group.",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 Location ECL committees are established for key overseas subsidiaries to govern and manage location-specific ECL reporting.\n- \u00b7 ECL models are subject to independent validation by the Risk Management Group (RMG) as well as independent reviews by internal and external auditors. The validation and assurance processes cover the review of the underlying ECL methodology including its logic and conceptual soundness.\n\n## 2.12 Repurchase agreements\n\nRepurchase agreements (Repos) are treated as collateralised borrowings. The amount borrowed is reflected as a financial liability either as 'Due to banks' or 'Deposits and balances from customers'. The securities sold under repos are treated as pledged assets and remain on the balance sheet at amortised cost or fair value depending on their classification.\n\nReverse repurchase agreements (Reverse repos) are treated as collateralised lending. The amount lent is reflected as a financial asset as 'Cash and balances with central banks', 'Due from banks' or 'Loans and advances to customers'.\n\nAmounts paid and received in excess of the amounts borrowed and lent on the repos and reverse repos are amortised as interest expense and interest income respectively using the effective interest method.\n\n## 2.13 Goodwill\n\nGoodwill arising from business combinations generally represents the excess of the acquisition cost over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed on the acquisition date. Goodwill is stated at cost less impairment losses and is tested at least annually for impairment.\n\nAt the acquisition date, any goodwill acquired is allocated to each of the cash-generating units (CGU) or group of CGUs expected to benefit from the combination's synergies.\n\nAn impairment loss is recognised when the carrying amount of a CGU, or group of CGUs, including the goodwill, exceeds the applicable recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of a CGU or CGU group is the higher of the CGU's or CGU group's fair value less cost to sell and its value-in-use. An impairment loss on goodwill is recognised in the income statement and cannot be reversed in subsequent periods.\n\n## 2.14 Properties and other fixed assets\n\n## Owned properties and other fixed assets\n\nProperties (including investment properties) and other fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.\n\nDepreciation is calculated using the straight-line method to write down the costs of the assets to their estimated residual values over the estimated useful lives of the assets. No depreciation is recognised when the residual value is higher than the carrying amount.\n\nGenerally, the useful lives are as follows:\n\nLeasehold land\n\n100 years or over the remaining lease period, whichever is shorter. Leasehold land where the unexpired lease period is more than 100 years is not depreciated.\n\nBuildings\n\n30 to 50 years or over the remaining lease period, whichever is shorter.\n\nComputer software\n\n3 to 5 years\n\nOffice equipment, furniture and fittings\n\n5 to 10 years\n\nLeasehold improvements\n\nUp to 20 years\n\n## Leased properties and other fixed assets\n\nLease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term at the lease commencement date. The associated right-of-use assets are measured at the amount equal to the lease liability.\n\nLease liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The right-of-use assets are depreciated over the lease term on a straight-line basis.\n\nExtension options and termination options are included in the assessment of the lease term if the options are reasonably certain to be exercised or not exercised accordingly. If the Group changes its initial assessment, adjustments are made to the carrying amounts of the lease liabilities and right-of-use assets prospectively.\n\nThe recognition exceptions for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are applied.\n\nPlease refer to Note 26 for the details of owned and leased properties and other fixed assets and their movements during the year.\n\n## 2.15 Financial liabilities\n\n## Initial recognition, classification and subsequent measurement\n\nFinancial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value. The Group generally classifies and measures its financial liabilities in accordance with the purpose for which the financial liabilities are incurred and managed. Accordingly:\n\n- \u00b7 Financial liabilities are classified as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss if they are incurred for the purpose of repurchasing in the near term ( 'held for trading' ), and this may include debt securities issued and short positions in securities for the purpose of ongoing market-making or trading. Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss can also be designated by management on initial recognition ( 'designated at fair value through profit or loss' ) if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces measurement or recognition inconsistencies that would otherwise arise, or if the financial liability contains an embedded derivative that would otherwise need to be separately recorded. Financial liabilities in this classification are usually within the\n\n'Treasury Markets' segment.\n\nRealised or unrealised gains or losses on financial liabilities held for trading and financial liabilities designated under the fair value option, except interest expense, are taken to 'Net trading income' in the income statement in the period they arise. Interest expense on structured investment deposits at fair value through profit or loss is also presented together with other fair value changes in 'Net trading income'.\n\nThe changes to the fair value of financial liabilities designated under the fair value option that are attributable to a reporting entity's own credit risk are taken to revenue reserves through other comprehensive income. These amounts are not transferred to the income statement even when realised.\n\n- \u00b7 Derivative liabilities are treated consistently with derivative assets. Please refer to Note 2.9 for the accounting policy on derivatives.\n- \u00b7 Other financial liabilities are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. These comprise predominantly the Group's 'Deposits and balances from customers', 'Due to banks' and 'Other debt securities'.",

        "page_content": "Where the classification and measurement of financial liabilities do not reflect the management of the financial liabilities, the Group may apply hedge accounting where permissible and relevant to better reflect the management of the financial liabilities. Please refer to Note 2.19 for details on hedging and hedge accounting.\n\nPlease refer to Note 14 for further details on the types of financial liabilities classified and measured as above.\n\n## Determination of fair value\n\nThe fair value of financial liabilities is the price that would be paid to transfer the liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\n\nPlease refer to Note 41 for further fair value disclosures.\n\n## Derecognition\n\nA financial liability is derecognised from the balance sheet when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expired.\n\n## 2.16 Loan commitments, letters of credit and financial guarantees\n\n## Loan commitments\n\nLoan commitments are not recognised on the balance sheet and are disclosed in Note 36. Upon a loan draw-down, the amount of the loan is generally recognised as 'Loans and advances to customers' on the Group's balance sheet.\n\n## Letters of credit\n\nLetters of credit are recorded off-balance sheet as contingent liabilities upon issuance, and the corresponding payables to the beneficiaries and receivables from the applicants are recognised on the balance sheet upon acceptance of the underlying documents.\n\n## Financial guarantees\n\nFinancial guarantees are initially recognised in the financial statements at fair value on the date the guarantees are given.\n\nFinancial guarantees are subsequently measured at the higher of:\n\n- \u00b7 the amount of the ECL (Note 2.11); and\n- \u00b7 the unamortised portion of the fees that were received on initial recognition.\n\nPlease refer to Note 2.8 for the principles for recognising the fees.\n\nOff-balance sheet credit exposures are managed for credit risk in the same manner as financial assets.\n\nPlease refer to Note 2.11 on the Group's accounting policies on allowances for credit losses.\n\n## 2.17 Provisions and other liabilities\n\nProvisions for other liabilities of uncertain timing and amounts are recognised when:\n\n- \u00b7 the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events;\n- \u00b7 it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; and\n- \u00b7 a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made.\n\nThe amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date.\n\n## 2.18 Share capital and other instruments classified as equity\n\nOrdinary shares, preference shares and other instruments which do not result in the Group having a contractual obligation to deliver cash or another financial asset, or to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with the holder under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the Group, are classified as equity. Distributions arising from such instruments are recognised in equity as there is no contractual obligation to pay distributions on these instruments. Incremental external costs directly attributable to the issuance of such instruments are accounted for as a deduction from equity.\n\nWhen any entity within the Group purchases the Company's ordinary shares ('treasury shares'), the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental cost is presented as a component within equity, until they are cancelled, sold or reissued.\n\nWhen treasury shares are subsequently cancelled, the cost of the treasury shares is deducted against either the share capital account or retained earnings. When treasury shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any realised gain or loss on sale or reissue, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and related income tax, is recognised in capital reserves.\n\nFor ordinary and preference shares, interim dividends are recorded during the financial year in which they are declared payable. Final dividends are recorded during the financial year in which the dividends are approved by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.\n\n## D) Other Specific Topics\n\n## 2.19 Hedging and hedge accounting\n\nAs part of the overall risk management of the Group, derivatives and other instruments are used to manage exposures to interest rate and foreign currency risks, including exposures arising from forecast transactions.\n\nWhere hedge accounting is not applied, the derivatives are treated in the same way as derivatives held for trading purposes, i.e. realised and unrealised gains and losses are recognised in 'Net trading income'. The Group applies hedge accounting for economic hedge relationships that meet the hedge accounting criteria. To qualify for hedge accounting, at the inception of each hedging relationship, the Group designates and documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item; the risk management objective for undertaking the hedge transaction; and the methods used to assess the effectiveness of the hedge. At inception and on an on-going basis, the Group also assesses and measures the effectiveness of the hedging relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item.\n\nWhere all relevant criteria are met, hedge accounting is applied to remove the accounting mismatch between hedging instrument and the hedged item. The Group designates certain derivatives as hedging instruments in respect of foreign currency risk and interest rate risk in fair value hedges, cash flow hedges, or hedges of net investments in foreign operations as described below.\n\n## \u00b7 Fair value hedge\n\nFor a qualifying fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the hedging instruments are recorded in the income statement, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the adjustment to the carrying amount of a hedged item is amortised, using the effective interest method, to the income statement over its remaining maturity.",

        "page_content": "However, where the hedged item is an equity instrument classified as FVOCI, changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument and the hedged item are both recorded in other comprehensive income and accumulated in FVOCI revaluation reserves. The amounts recorded in FVOCI revaluation reserves are not subsequently reclassified to the income statement.\n\n## \u00b7 Cash flow hedge\n\nThe effective portion of changes in the fair value of a derivative designated and qualifying as a cash flow hedge is recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated under the cash flow hedge reserves in equity. This amount is reclassified to the income statement in the periods when the hedged forecast cash flows affect the income statement. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss is recognised immediately in the income statement under 'Net trading income'.\n\nWhen a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in the cash flow hedge reserves remains until the forecast transaction is recognised in the income statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss in the cash flow hedge reserves is reclassified from equity to the income statement.\n\n## \u00b7 Net investment hedge\n\nHedges of net investments in the Group's foreign operations are accounted for in a manner similar to cash flow hedges. On disposal of the foreign operations, the cumulative gain or loss in the capital reserves is reclassified to the income statement as part of the gain or loss on disposal.\n\nWhen designating the hedging instrument, the Group may elect to exclude the valuation components of currency basis spreads and forward points from the hedge relationship on a hedge-by-hedge basis.\n\nThe forward points and currency basis spreads which are excluded and recorded in other comprehensive income are:\n\n- \u00b7 reclassified to the income statement when the forecast transaction occurs; or\n- \u00b7 amortised to the income statement over the hedging tenor for time-period hedges. The amounts recorded in other comprehensive income are not subsequently reclassified to the income statement for hedges of FVOCI equities.\n\nThe Group has elected to apply the SFRS(I) 9 hedge accounting rules in full.\n\nPlease refer to Note 38 for further details relating to hedge accounting, including fair value, cash flow and net investment hedges.\n\n## 2.20 Employee benefits\n\nEmployee benefits, which include base pay, cash bonuses, share-based compensation, contribution to defined contribution plans such as the Central Provident Fund and other staff-related allowances, are recognised in the income statement when incurred. For defined contribution plans, contributions are made to publicly or privately administered funds on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. Once the contributions have been paid, the Group has no further payment obligations.\n\nEmployee entitlement to annual leave is recognised when they accrue to employees. A provision is made for the estimated liability for annual unutilised leave as a result of services rendered by employees up to the balance sheet date.\n\n## 2.21 Share-based compensation\n\nEmployee benefits also include share-based compensation, namely the DBSH Share Plan, the DBSH Employee Share Plan and the DBSH Employee Share Purchase Plan (the Plans). The details of the Plans are described in Note 39.\n\nEquity instruments granted and ultimately vested under the Plans are recognised in the income statement based on the fair value of the equity instrument at the date of grant. The expense is amortised over the vesting period of each award, with a corresponding adjustment to the share plan reserves.\n\nA trust has been set up for each share plan. The employee trust funds are consolidated and the DBSH shares held by the trust funds are accounted for as 'treasury shares', which is presented as a deduction within equity. The trust deeds for DBSH Share Plan and DBSH Employee Share Plan expired on 27 January 2021, following which the Company will directly undertake the administration of these Plans.\n\n## 2.22 Current and deferred taxes\n\nCurrent income tax for current and prior periods is recognised as the amount expected to be paid or recovered from the tax authorities, using the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. The Group considers uncertain tax positions generally at the level of the total tax liability to each tax authority for each period. The liability is determined based on the total amount of current tax expected to be paid, taking into account all tax uncertainties, using either an expected value approach or a single best estimate of the most likely outcome.\n\nTax assets and liabilities of the same type (current or deferred) are offset when a legal right of offset exists and settlement in this manner is intended. This applies generally when they arise from the same tax reporting group and relate to the same tax authority.\n\nDeferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.\n\nThe amount of deferred tax assets recognised takes into account the likelihood the amount that can be used to offset payable taxes on future profits.\n\nDeferred tax related to fair value re-measurement of FVOCI investments, which are recognised outside profit or loss, is also recognised outside profit or loss, i.e. in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the FVOCI revaluation reserves.",

        "page_content": "## 3. Critical Accounting Estimates\n\nThe Group's accounting policies and use of estimates are integral to the reported amounts in the financial statements. Certain accounting estimates require management's judgement in determining the appropriate methodology for valuation of assets and liabilities. Procedures are in place to ensure that methodologies are reviewed and revised as appropriate. The Group believes its estimates for determining the valuation of its assets and liabilities are appropriate.\n\nThe following is a brief description of the Group's critical accounting estimates that involve management's valuation judgement.\n\n## 3.1 Impairment of financial assets\n\nIt is the Group's policy to recognise, through charges against profit, allowances in respect of estimated and inherent credit losses in its portfolio as described in Note 2.11.\n\nECLs are probability-weighted amounts determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes and taking into account past events, current conditions and assessments of future economic conditions, which will necessarily involve the use of judgement.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic, related measures to control the spread of the virus and governmental support to mitigate the impact of the pandemic had a profound economic impact on the Group's key markets. A significant degree of judgement is required in estimating the ECLs in the midst of a rapidly evolving Covid-19 environment. Please refer to Note 2.11 for more details.\n\nPlease refer to Risk Management section for a further description of the Group's credit risk management framework, policies and procedures.\n\n## 3.2 Fair value of financial instruments\n\nThe majority of the Group's financial instruments reported at fair value are based on quoted and observable market prices or on internally developed models that are based on independently sourced or verified market parameters.\n\nThe fair value of financial instruments without an observable market price in an active market may be determined using valuation models. The choice of model requires significant judgement for complex products especially those in the 'Treasury Markets' segment.\n\nPolicies and procedures have been established to facilitate the exercise of judgement in determining the risk characteristics of various financial instruments, discount rates, estimates of future cash flows and other factors used in the valuation process.\n\nPlease refer to Note 41 for further details on fair valuation and fair value hierarchy of the Group's financial instruments measured at fair value.\n\n## 3.3 Goodwill impairment\n\nThe Group performs an impairment review to ensure that the carrying amount of a CGU to which goodwill is allocated does not exceed the recoverable amount of the CGU. Note 27 provides details of goodwill at the reporting date.\n\nThe recoverable amount represents the present value of the estimated future cash flows expected to arise from continuing operations. Therefore, in arriving at the recoverable amount, management exercises judgement in estimating the future cash flows, growth rate and discount rate.\n\n## 3.4 Income taxes\n\nThe Group has exposure to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Significant judgement is involved in determining the Group's provision for income taxes. The Group recognises liabilities for expected tax issues based on reasonable estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. Where uncertainty exists around the Group's tax position including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, appropriate provisions are provided based on technical merits of the positions with the same tax authority. Note 21 provides details of the Group's deferred tax assets/liabilities. In general, determination of the value of assets/ liabilities relating to carry forward tax losses requires judgement.",

ECL is estimated to reduce by $1,300 million (2019: $1,184 million) should all the exposures in Stage 2 return to Stage 1 and were assigned a lower 12-month ECL instead of lifetime ECL. The impact also reflects the higher PDs ascribed to Stage 2 exposures in addition to the recognition of lifetime instead of 12-month ECL.\n\nAs ECL estimation relies on multiple variables, no single analysis can fully demonstrate the sensitivity of the ECL to changes in macroeconomic variables.\n\n## Relief measures offered to customers\n\nIn response to the impact of Covid-19, various forms of relief measures, such as payment deferments, had been offered to eligible retail and corporate customers. Payment deferments were considered to be non-substantial modifications and accounted for as a continuation of the existing loan agreements.\n\nIn line with regulatory guidelines, customers' utilisation of relief measures does not automatically result in significant increase in credit risk and a transfer to Stage 2. The assessment of customer's risk of default continues to be performed comprehensively, taking into account the customer's ability to make payments based on the rescheduled payments and their creditworthiness in the long term.",

The credit risk associated with favourable contracts is reduced by a master netting arrangement to the extent that if an event of default occurs, all amounts with the counterparty are settled on a net basis. Master netting arrangements do not result in an offset of financial assets and liabilities on the balance sheet, as the legal right to offset the transactions is conditional upon default.\n\nThese agreements include derivative master agreements (including the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) Master Agreement), global master repurchase agreements and global securities lending agreements. The collaterals received and pledged under these agreements are generally conducted under terms that are in accordance with normal market practice. The agreements may allow rehypothecation of collateral received and there may be ongoing margin requirements to mitigate counterparty risk.",

        "page_content": "## 19. Financial Assets Pledged or Transferred\n\nThe Group pledges or transfers financial assets to third parties in the ordinary course of business. Transferred assets continue to be recognised in the Group's financial statements when the Group retains substantially all their risks and rewards. Among these, as set out below, are securities pledged or transferred pursuant to repurchase or securities lending or collateral swap agreements and for derivative transactions under credit support agreements.\n\nDerecognised assets that were subject to the Group's partial continuing involvement were not material in 2020 and 2019.\n\n## Securities and Certificates of deposit\n\nSecurities transferred under repurchase, securities lending and collateral swap arrangements are generally conducted under terms in line with normal market practice. The counterparty is typically allowed to sell or re-pledge the securities but has an obligation to return them at maturity. If the securities decrease in value, the Group may, in certain circumstances, be required to place additional collateral.\n\nFor repurchase agreements, the securities pledged or transferred continue to be recorded on the balance sheet while cash received in exchange is recorded as a financial liability. The Group also pledges assets to secure its short position in securities and to facilitate settlement operations. The fair value of the associated liabilities approximates their carrying amount of $5,184 million (2019: $5,374 million), which are recorded under 'Due to banks', 'Deposits and balances from customers' and 'Other liabilities' on the balance sheet.\n\nFor securities lending and collateral swap transactions, the securities lent continue to be recorded on the balance sheet. As the Group mainly receives other financial assets in exchange, the associated liabilities are not recorded on the balance sheet.\n\nIn addition, the Group also pledges securities for derivative transactions under credit support agreements. These assets continue to be recorded on the balance sheet. As the related derivative assets and liabilities are managed on a portfolio basis, there is no direct relationship between the securities pledged and the associated liabilities. As such, the associated liabilities are not disclosed.\n\n| In $ millions                                      | 2020   | 2019   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Financial assets pledged or transferred            |        |        |\n| Singapore Government securities and treasury bills | 1,360  | 803    |\n| Other government securities and treasury bills     | 8,642  | 8,206  |\n| Bank and corporate debt securities                 | 3,305  | 1,395  |\n| Equity securities                                  | -      | 274    |\n| Certificates of deposit                            | 542    | 516    |\n| Total                                              | 13,849 | 11,194 |\n\n## Covered bonds\n\nPursuant to the Bank's Global Covered Bond Programme, selected pools of residential mortgages originated by the Bank have been assigned to a bankruptcy-remote structured entity, Bayfront Covered Bonds Pte Ltd (see Notes 22.2 and 30.4). These residential mortgages continue to be recognised on the Bank's balance sheet as the Bank remains exposed to the risks and rewards associated with them.\n\nAs at 31 December 2020, the carrying value of the covered bonds in issue was $4,545 million (2019: $5,206 million), while the carrying value of assets assigned was $11,498 million (2019: $14,679 million). The difference in values is attributable to an intended over-collateralisation required to maintain the credit ratings of the covered bonds in issue, and additional assets assigned to facilitate future issuances.\n\n## Other financial assets\n\nThe Group also enters into structured funding transactions where it retains the contractual rights to receive cash flows of financial assets extended to third parties but assumes a contractual obligation to pay these cash flows under the issued notes. The carrying amounts and fair values of these financial assets and liabilities both amounted to $350 million (2019: $354 million).",

Statutory, contractual or regulatory requirements as well as protective rights of non-controlling interests may restrict the ability of the Company to access and transfer assets freely to or from other entities within the Group and to settle liabilities of the Group. Since the Group did not have any material non-controlling interests as at the balance sheet dates, any protective rights associated with these did not give rise to significant restrictions in 2019 and 2020.\n\nPlease refer to Note 35 for information on non-controlling interests.\n\n## DBS Bank India Limited\n\nFollowing the approval by Reserve Bank of India for the amalgamation of India branches operating under DBS Bank Ltd. with DBS Bank India Limited (a wholly owned subsidiary) on 28 February 2019,  all the branches of DBS Bank Ltd. operating in India ('DBS India branches') function as branches of DBS Bank India Limited with effect from 1 March 2019. All assets and liabilities of DBS India branches have been transferred from DBS Bank Ltd. to DBS Bank India Limited on 1 March 2019.\n\nLakshmi Vilas Bank (LVB) was amalgamated with DBS Bank India Limited (DBIL) with effect from 27 November 2020.

        "page_content": "## 24. Unconsolidated Structured Entities\n\n'Unconsolidated structured entities' are structured entities, as defined by SFRS(I) 12, that are not controlled by the Group. In the normal course of business, the Group enters into transactions with these structured entities to facilitate customer transactions and for specific investment opportunities.\n\nWhile the economic exposures may be the same as those to other type of entities, SFRS(I) 12 specifically requires companies to disclose such exposures arising from transactions with unconsolidated structured entities. The table below reflects exposures to third party securitisation structures where the Group holds an interest in the normal course of business.\n\nAs is the case with other types of counterparties, the carrying amount from transactions with unconsolidated structured entities have been included in the Group's financial statements.\n\nThe risks arising from such transactions are subject to the Group's risk management practices.\n\nThe table below represents the Group's maximum exposure to loss which for on-balance sheet assets and liabilities is represented by the carrying amount, and does not reflect mitigating effects from the availability of netting arrangements and financial instruments that the Group may utilise to economically hedge the risks inherent in third party structured entities, or risk-reducing effects of collateral or other credit enhancements.\n\n|                                 | The Group   | The Group   |\n|---------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| In $ millions                   | 2020        | 2019        |\n| Derivatives                     | 142         | 11          |\n| Corporate debt securities       | 3,627       | 3,045       |\n| Loans and advances to customers | 14          | 40          |\n| Other assets                    | 3           | 2           |\n| Total assets                    | 3,786       | 3,098       |\n| Commitments                     | 306         | 376         |\n| Maximum Exposure to Loss        | 4,092       | 3,474       |\n| Derivatives                     | 10          | 68          |\n| Total liabilities               | 10          | 68          |\n\nSFRS(I) 12 also requires additional disclosures where the Group acts as a sponsor to unconsolidated structured entities. The Group is deemed a sponsor of a third party structured entity if it plays a key role in establishing the entity, and has an on-going involvement with the structured entity or if the Group's name appears in the structured entity's name.\n\nThe Group has not sponsored any structured entity during the financial year.\n\n## 25.   Acquisition\n\nLakshmi Vilas Bank (LVB) has been amalgamated with DBS Bank India Limited (DBIL) with effect from 27 November 2020. The scheme of amalgamation is under the special powers of the Government of India and Reserve Bank of India under Section 45 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, India. The amalgamation provides stability to LVB's depositors, customers and employees following a period of uncertainty. It complements the Group's digibank strategy with an expanded network of 600 branches and 1,000 ATMs, an additional two million retail and 125,000 non-retail customers, as well as a strengthened deposit franchise.\n\nThe provisional goodwill from amalgamation of LVB was $153 million, being the difference between the fair value of its assets and liabilities of $3.89 billion and $4.04 billion respectively. As at 31 December 2020, total loans transferred amounted to $2.14 billion, including net nonperforming loans of $212 million and total deposits transferred amounted to $3.34 billion.\n\nAdditional general allowances were set aside at group level to build up general allowance reserves to 9.5% of LVB's performing loans.\n\n## 26.

If a CGU's carrying amount exceeds its recoverable value, a goodwill impairment charge is recognised in the income statement.\n\nThe recoverable value is determined based on a value-in-use calculation. The CGU's five-year projected free cash flows, after taking into account the maintenance of capital adequacy requirements at target levels, are discounted by its cost of capital to derive its present value. To derive the value beyond the fifth year, a long-term growth rate is imputed to the fifth-year cash flow and then discounted by the cost of capital to derive the terminal value. The long-term growth rate used does not exceed the historical long-term growth rate of the market the CGU operates in. The recoverable value is the sum of the present value of the five-year cash flows and the terminal value.\n\nA growth rate of 3.5% (2019: 4.5%) and discount rate of 9.0% (2019: 9.0%) were assumed in the value-in-use calculation for DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Limited's franchise.\n\nThe process of evaluating goodwill impairment involves management judgement and prudent estimates of various factors including future cash flows as well as the cost of capital and long-term growth rates. The results can be highly sensitive to the assumptions used. Key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amounts of the CGU, including growth rate and discount rate, are tested for sensitivity by applying a reasonably possible change to those assumptions. The reasonably possible changes in key assumptions did not result in an impairment of goodwill at 31 December 2020.",

        "page_content": "## 37. Financial Derivatives\n\nFinancial derivatives are financial instruments whose characteristics are derived from the underlying assets, or from interest and exchange rates or indices. These include forwards, swaps, futures and options. The following sections outline the nature and terms of the most common types of derivatives used by the Group.\n\n## Interest rate derivatives\n\nForward rate agreements give the buyer the ability to determine the underlying rate of interest for a specified period commencing on a specified future date (the settlement date). There is no exchange of principal and settlement is effected on the settlement date.  The settlement amount is the difference between the contracted rate and the market rate prevailing on the settlement date.\n\nInterest rate swaps involve the exchange of interest obligations with a counterparty for a specified period without exchanging the underlying (or notional) principal.\n\nInterest rate futures are exchange-traded agreements to buy or sell a standard amount of a specified fixed income security or time deposit at an agreed interest rate on a standard future date.\n\nInterest rate options give the buyer, on payment of a premium, the right but not the obligation, to fix the rate of interest on a future deposit or loan, for a specified period and commencing on a specified future date.\n\nInterest rate caps and floors give the buyer the ability to fix the maximum or minimum rate of interest. There is no facility to deposit or draw down funds, instead the writer pays to the buyer the amount by which the market rate exceeds or is less than the cap rate or the floor rate respectively. This category includes combinations of interest rate caps and floors, which are known as interest rate collars.\n\n## Foreign exchange derivatives\n\nForward foreign exchange contracts are agreements to buy or sell fixed amounts of currency at agreed rates of exchange on a specified future date.\n\nCross currency swaps are agreements to exchange, and on termination of the swap, re-exchange principal amounts denominated in different currencies. Cross currency swaps may involve the exchange of interest payments in one specified currency for interest payments in another specified currency for a specified period.\n\nCurrency options give the buyer, on payment of a premium, the right but not the obligation, to buy or sell specified amounts of currency at agreed rates of exchange on or before a specified future date.\n\n## Equity derivatives\n\nEquity options give the buyer, on payment of a premium, the right but not the obligation, either to purchase or sell a specified stock or stock index at a specified price or level on or before a specified date.\n\nEquity swaps involve the exchange of a set of payments whereby one of these payments is based on an equity-linked return while the other is typically based on an interest reference rate.\n\n## Credit derivatives\n\nCredit default swaps involve the transfer of credit risk of a reference asset from the protection buyer to the protection seller. The protection buyer makes one or more payments to the seller in exchange for an undertaking by the seller to make a payment to the buyer upon the occurrence of a predefined credit event.\n\n## Commodity derivatives\n\nCommodity contracts are agreements between two parties to exchange cash flows which are dependent on the price of the underlying physical assets.\n\nCommodity futures are exchange-traded agreements to buy or sell a standard amount of a commodity at an agreed price on a standard future date.\n\nCommodity options give the buyer, on payment of a premium, the right but not the obligation, to buy or sell a specific amount of commodity at an agreed contract price on or before a specified date.\n\n## 37.1 Trading derivatives\n\nMost of the Group's derivatives relate to sales and trading activities. Sales activities include the structuring and marketing of derivatives to customers to enable them to take, transfer, modify or reduce current or expected risks. Trading activities are entered into principally for dealer's margin or for the purpose of generating a profit from shortterm fluctuations in price.\n\nTrading includes mainly market-making and warehousing to facilitate customer orders. Market-making involves quoting bid and offer prices to other market participants with the intention of generating revenues based on spread and volume. Warehousing involves holding on to positions in order to liquidate in an orderly fashion with timing of unwinding determined by market conditions and traders' views of markets as they evolve.\n\n## 37.2 Hedging derivatives\n\nThe accounting treatment of the hedge derivative transactions varies according to the nature of the hedge and whether the hedge meets the specified criteria to qualify for hedge accounting.  Derivatives transacted as economic hedges but do not qualify for hedge accounting are treated in the same way as derivative instruments held for trading purposes.\n\nPlease refer to Note 38 for more details on derivatives used for hedging.",

They do not represent amounts at risk.\n\nIn the financial statements, trading derivative financial instruments are revalued on a gross position basis and the unrealised gains or losses are reflected as derivative assets or derivative liabilities. Derivative assets and liabilities arising from different transactions are only offset if the transactions are done with the same counterparty, a legal right of offset exists, and the parties intend to settle the cash flows on a net basis.  There were no offset of derivative assets and liabilities in 2020 and 2019.\n\nThe Group\n\n|                                                                                                         |

        "page_content": "## 38. Hedge Accounting\n\nThe Group enters into hedging transactions to manage exposures to interest rate and foreign currency risks. Hedge accounting is applied to minimise volatility in earnings arising from changes in interest rate and foreign exchange rates.\n\nPlease refer to Risk Management section for more information on market risk and the Group's risk management practices and Note 2.19 for the Group's accounting policy for hedge accounting.\n\n## 38.1 Fair value hedge\n\nIn accordance with the risk management strategy in place, the Group enters into interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk of changes in interest rates on the fair value of the following:\n\n- \u00b7 issued fixed rate debt;\n- \u00b7 a portion of purchased fixed rate bonds; and\n- \u00b7 some large exposures to corporate loans.\n\nIn such instances, the Group hedges the benchmark interest rate risk component which is an observable and reliably measurable component of interest rate risk. Specifically, the Group has designated fair value hedge relationships, on a hedge-by-hedge basis, to hedge against movements in the benchmark interest rate. This effectively results in the recognition of interest expense (for fixed rate liabilities), or interest income (for fixed rate assets) at floating rates. The Group also uses cross currency swaps when there is a need to hedge both interest rate and foreign exchange risks.\n\nThe Group manages all other risks arising from these exposures, such as credit risk, but hedge accounting is not applied for those risks.\n\nThe Group assesses prospective hedge effectiveness by comparing the changes in fair value of the hedged item resulting from movements in the benchmark interest rate with the changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps used to hedge the exposure. The Group determines the hedge ratio by comparing the notional of the derivative with the principal of the debt issued or the bond asset purchased, or the loan granted.\n\nFor all interest rate swaps used for hedging purposes, critical terms match or nearly match those of the underlying hedged items.\n\nThe Group has identified the following possible sources of ineffectiveness:\n\n- \u00b7 the use of derivatives as a protection against interest rate risk creates an exposure to the derivative counterparty's credit risk which is not offset by the hedged item. This risk is minimised by entering into derivatives with high credit quality counterparties;\n- \u00b7 the use of different discounting curves when measuring the fair value of the hedged items and hedging instruments. For derivatives, the discounting curve used depends on collateralisation and the type of collateral used; and\n- \u00b7 difference in the timing of settlement of hedging instruments and hedged items.\n\nNo other significant sources of ineffectiveness were identified in these hedge relationships.\n\nThe Group typically uses foreign currency denominated borrowings/ deposits to fund its investments in non-SGD denominated FVOCI equity instruments. To reduce the accounting mismatch on the borrowings/ deposits and FVOCI equity instruments because of foreign exchange rate movements, the Group designates the borrowings/ deposits as the hedging instruments in fair value hedges of the FVOCI equity instruments. The hedge ratio is determined by comparing the principal of the borrowings/ deposits with the investment costs of the FVOCI equity instruments. A potential source of ineffectiveness is a decrease in the fair value of the equity instruments below their investment costs.",

        "page_content": "## 38.2 Cash flow hedge\n\nThe Group is predominantly exposed to variability in future cash flows due to interest rate movements and foreign currency fluctuations from the following:\n\n- \u00b7 assets subject to repricing, reinvestment or refinancing risk;\n- \u00b7 forecasted interest earnings denominated in foreign currency;\n- \u00b7 issued floating or fixed rate foreign currency debt; and\n- \u00b7 a portion of purchased floating or fixed rate foreign currency bonds.\n\nIn accordance with the Group risk management strategy, the Group enters into interest rate swaps, forward contracts or cross currency swaps to protect against the variability of cash flows due to changes in interest rates and/ or foreign currency exchange rates.\n\nIn such instances, cash flow hedge relationships are designated. These are applied on a hedge-by-hedge basis, except for cash flows from assets subject to repricing, reinvestment or refinancing risk, for which a portfolio cash flow hedge relationship is designated using interest rate swaps. A dynamic process is applied for this hedge as the portfolio composition can change e.g. due to maturities and new originations. The portfolio cash flow hedge relationships effectively extend the duration of the assets, such that the interest cash flows are transformed from a floating rate basis to a fixed rate basis.\n\nThe Group enters into forward contracts to hedge against variability in future cash flows arising from USD-denominated interest income.\n\nThe Group also enters into cross currency swaps to mitigate 100% of the risk of fluctuation of coupon and principal cash flows due to changes in foreign currency rates of issued foreign currency debt and a portion of purchased foreign currency bonds. Critical terms of the cross-currency swaps match that of the issued foreign currency debt or purchased foreign currency bonds.\n\nThe Group manages all other risks derived by these exposures, such as credit risk, but they do not apply hedge accounting for these risks.\n\nThe Group assesses hedge effectiveness by comparing the changes in fair value of a hypothetical derivative reflecting the terms of the hedged item due to movements in the hedged risk with the changes in fair value of the derivatives used to hedge the exposure.\n\nThe Group determines the hedge ratio by comparing the notional of the derivatives with the assets subject to repricing/ reinvestment/ refinancing risk or amount of forecast earnings denominated in foreign currency or the principal of the debt securities issued or purchased foreign currency bonds.\n\nThe Group has identified the following possible sources of ineffectiveness in its cash flow hedge relationships:\n\n- \u00b7 the use of derivatives as a protection against currency and interest rate risk creates an exposure to the derivative counterparty's credit risk which is not offset by the hedged item. This risk is minimised by entering into derivatives with high credit quality counterparties;\n- \u00b7 difference in tenor of hedged items and hedging instruments;\n- \u00b7 difference in timing of settlement of the hedging instrument and hedged item; and\n- \u00b7 designation of off-market hedging instruments.\n\nThe following table sets out the maturity profile of the hedging instruments used in cash flow hedges. The amounts shown in the table reflect the notional amounts of derivatives.

The Group regularly reviews its hedging strategy, taking into account the long-term outlook of currency fundamentals and the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on capital adequacy ratios.\n\nThe tables below analyses the currency exposure of the Group by functional currency.\n\n| In $ millions    | Net  investments  in foreign  operations (a)   | The Group Financial  instruments  which hedge  the net  investments   | Remaining  unhedged  currency  exposures   |\n|------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| 2020             |                                                |                                                                       |                                            |\n| Hong Kong dollar | 11,772                                         | 2,261                                                                 | 9,511                                      |\n| Chinese yuan     | 2,730                                          | 283                                                                   | 2,447                                      |\n| Taiwan dollar    | 2,046                                          | 376                                                                   | 1,670                                      |\n| Others           | 7,001                                          | -                                                                     | 7,001                                      |\n| Total            | 23,549                                         | 2,920                                                                 | 20,629                                     |\n| 2019             |                                                |                                                                       |                                            |\n| Hong Kong dollar | 11,761                                         | 242                                                                   | 11,519                                     |\n| Chinese yuan     | 2,564                                          | 269                                                                   | 2,295                                      |\n| Taiwan dollar    | 1,878                                          | 309                                                                   | 1,569                                      |\n| Others           | 4,517                                          | -                                                                     | 4,517                                      |\n| Total            | 20,720                                         | 820                                                                   | 19,900                                     |\n\n## (a) Refers to net tangible assets of subsidiaries, associates and overseas branches\n\nPlease refer to Note 34 for information on the capital reserves.

Share-based Compensation Plans\n\nAs part of the Group's remuneration policy, the Group provides various share-based compensation plans to foster a culture that aligns employees' interests with shareholders', enable employees to share in the Bank's performance and enhance talent retention.\n\n| Main Scheme/ Plan                                                                                                                          | Note   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| DBSH Share Plan (Share Plan)                                                                                                               |        |\n| \u00b7  The Share Plan is granted to Group executives as determined by the Committee appointed to administer the Share  Plan from time to time. | 39.1   |\n\n- \u00b7 Participants are awarded shares of the Company or, at the Committee's discretion, their equivalent cash value or a combination.\n- \u00b7 Awards consist of main award and retention award (20%/ 15% of main award) for employees on bonus/ sales incentive plans respectively. Dividends on unvested shares do not accrue to employees.\n- \u00b7 For employees on bonus plan, the main award vests from 2 to 4 years after grant i.e. 33% will vest 2 years after grant; another 33% will vest on the third year and the remaining 34% plus the retention award will vest 4 years after grant.\n- \u00b7 For employees on sales incentive plans, the main award vests from 1 to 3 years after grant; i.e. 33% will vest 1 year after grant, another 33% will vest on the second year and the remaining 34% plus the retention award will vest 3 years after grant.\n- \u00b7 There are no additional retention awards for shares granted to top performers and key employees as part of talent retention.\n- \u00b7 The awards will lapse immediately upon termination of employment, except in the event of ill health, injury, disability, redundancy, retirement or death.\n- \u00b7 The market price of shares on the grant date is used to estimate the fair value of the shares awarded. The fair value of the shares granted includes an adjustment to exclude the present value of future expected dividends to be paid during the vesting period.\n- \u00b7 Vested and unvested shares are subject to clawback/ malus. Conditions that trigger such clawback/ malus are in the Remuneration Report section of the Annual Report.\n- \u00b7 Shares are awarded to non-executive directors as part of director's remuneration. Details of these awards are disclosed in the Corporate Governance section of the Annual Report.\n\n## DBSH Employee Share Plan (ESP)\n\n- \u00b7 The Committee has ceased granting shares under the ESP effective from financial year 2018 remuneration. Shares granted from prior years continue to be outstanding until the shares are fully vested.\n\n## DBSH Employee Share Purchase Plan (ESPP)\n\n- \u00b7 The ESPP was implemented in 2019 in selective markets across the Group. All confirmed permanent employees who hold the rank of Vice President and below with at least 3 months of service are eligible to participate in the scheme.\n- \u00b7 The ESPP is a share ownership plan for eligible employees to own DBSH shares through monthly contributions via deductions from payroll or designated bank accounts.\n- \u00b7 Participants contribute up to 10% of month salary (minimum S$50, capped at S$1,000) and the Group will match 25% of the participant's contributions to buy DBSH ordinary shares for a period of 12 months during each plan year.\n- \u00b7 The matching shares bought from the Group's contribution will vest 24 months after the last contribution month for each plan year.\n- \u00b7 The matching shares will lapse immediately upon termination of employment, except in the event of ill health, injury, disability, redundancy, retirement or death.\n\n## DBSH Share Ownership Scheme\n\n- \u00b7 The Scheme was wound down in 2019, where all assets have been distributed to unit holders.\n\n39.1\n\n39.2",

        "page_content": "## 41. Fair Value of Financial Instruments\n\n## 41.1 Valuation Process\n\nThe valuation processes within the Group are governed by the Valuation Policy, which is approved by the Board Audit Committee.\n\nThe Valuation Policy applies to all financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value, covering both market prices as well as model inputs. Financial assets and liabilities are marked directly using reliable and independent quoted market prices where available or by using reliable and independent market parameters (as model inputs) in conjunction with a valuation model.\n\nValuation models go through an assurance process carried out by the Risk Management Group (RMG), independent of the model developers. This assurance process covers the review of the underlying methodology including its logic and conceptual soundness together with the model inputs and outputs. Model assurances are conducted prior to implementation and subject to regular review or when there are significant changes arising from market or portfolio changes. Where necessary, the Group also imposes model reserves and other adjustments in determining fair value. Models are approved by the Group Market and Liquidity Risk Committee.\n\nA process of independent price verification (IPV) is in place to establish the accuracy of the market parameters used when the marking is performed by the Front Office. The IPV process entails independent checks to compare traders' marks to independent sources such as broker/ dealer quotes or market consensus providers.\n\nWhere market parameters are sourced independently for the marking of financial assets and liabilities, or used as inputs into a valuation model, these are checked for reliability and accuracy, for example by reviewing large daily movements or by referencing other similar sources, or transactions.\n\nValuation adjustments and reserves are taken to account for closeout costs, model and market parameter uncertainty, and any other factor that may affect valuations. Valuation adjustment and reserve methodologies are approved by the Group Market and Liquidity Risk Committee and governed by the Valuation Policy.\n\nThe valuation adjustments and reserves include but are not limited to:\n\n## Model and Parameter Uncertainty Adjustments\n\nValuation uncertainties may occur during fair value measurement either due to uncertainties in the required input parameters or uncertainties in the modelling methods used in the valuation process. In such situations, adjustments may be necessary to take these factors into account.\n\nFor example, where market data such as prices or rates for an instrument are no longer observable after an extended period of time, these inputs used to value the financial instruments may no longer be relevant in the current market conditions. In such situations, adjustments may be necessary to address the pricing uncertainty arising from the use of stale market data inputs.\n\n## Credit Valuation Adjustments\n\nCredit valuation adjustments are taken to reflect the impact on fair value of counterparty credit risk. Credit valuation adjustments are based upon the creditworthiness of the counterparties, magnitude of the current or potential exposure on the underlying transactions, netting and collateral arrangements, and the maturity of the underlying transactions.\n\n## Funding Valuation Adjustments\n\nFunding valuation adjustments represent an estimate of the adjustment to fair value that a market participant would make in incorporating funding costs and benefits that arise in relation to uncollateralised derivatives positions.\n\n## Day 1 Profit or Loss (P&L) Reserve\n\nIn situations where the market for an instrument is not active and its fair value is established using a valuation model based on significant unobservable market parameters, the Day 1 P&L arising from the difference in transacted price and end-of-day model valuation is set aside as reserves. A market parameter is defined as being significant when its impact on the Day 1 P&L is greater than an internally determined threshold. The Day 1 P&L reserve is released to the income statement when the parameters become observable or when the transaction is closed out or amortised over the duration of the transaction.  At year end, the unamortised Day 1 P&L was not material.\n\n## Bid-Offer Adjustments\n\nThe Group often holds, at varying points in time, both long or short positions in financial instruments which are valued using mid-market levels. Bid-offer adjustments are then made to account for close-out costs.\n\n## IBOR Transition Related Reserves\n\nFixings for most of the major currency IBORs would fall back to the respective Risk-Free Rates (RFR) plus a spread. Spread derivation details have been made known for most currencies. Valuation reserves have been set aside where derivation details are not known, and this leads to uncertainty in the forward rate estimation curves used for valuations.\n\n## 41.2 Fair Value Hierarchy\n\nThe fair value hierarchy accords the highest level to observable inputs such as unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest level to unobservable inputs. The fair value measurement of each financial instrument is categorised in accordance with the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the input with the lowest level that is significant to the entire measurement. If unobservable inputs are deemed significant, the financial instrument will be categorised as Level 3.\n\nFinancial instruments that are valued using quoted prices in active markets are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy. These would include government and sovereign securities, listed equities and corporate debt securities which are actively traded. Derivatives contracts which are traded in an active exchange market are also classified as Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.\n\nWhere fair value is determined using quoted market prices in less active markets or quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities, such instruments are generally classified as Level 2.  In cases where quoted prices are generally not available, the Group will determine the fair value based on valuation techniques that use market parameters as inputs including but not limited to yield curves, volatilities and foreign exchange rates.  The majority of valuation techniques employ only observable market data so that reliability of the fair value measurement is high. These would include corporate debt securities, repurchase, reverse repurchase agreements and most of the Group's OTC derivatives.\n\nThe Group classifies financial instruments as Level 3 when there is reliance on unobservable market parameters whether used directly to value a financial asset or liability, or used as inputs to a valuation model, attributing to a significant contribution to the instrument value. These would include all input parameters which are derived from historical data, for example, asset correlations or certain volatilities. Level 3 instruments also include unquoted equity securities which are measured based on the net asset value of the investments. In addition, Level 3 inputs include all stale quoted security prices and other approximations (e.g. bonds valued using credit default swap spreads).",

        "page_content": "## 41.3 Own credit adjustments on financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss\n\nChanges in the fair value of financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss related to the Group's own credit risk are recognised in other comprehensive income. As the Group does not hedge changes in own credit risk arising from financial liabilities, presenting the own credit movements within other comprehensive income does not create or increase an accounting mismatch in the income statement.\n\nThe change in fair value attributable to changes in own credit risk has been determined as the amount of change in fair value that is attributable to changes in funding spreads above benchmark interest rates.  Fair value changes arising from factors other than the Group's own credit risk are insignificant.\n\nThe cumulative amounts attributable to changes in own credit risk for these financial liabilities as at 31 December 2020 was a loss of $25 million (2019: loss of $67 million).\n\nRealised losses attributable to changes in own credit risk as at 31 December 2020 was a loss of $15 million (2019: less than $500k).\n\n## 41.4 Financial assets & liabilities not carried at fair value\n\nFor financial assets and liabilities not carried at fair value in the financial statements, the Group has ascertained that their fair values were not materially different from their carrying amounts at year-end.\n\nFor cash and balances with central banks, due from banks, loans and advances to customers, as well as due to banks and deposits and balances from customers, the basis of arriving at fair values is by discounting cash flows using the relevant market interest rates for the respective currencies.\n\nFor investment debt securities, subordinated term debts and other debts issued, fair values are determined based on independent market quotes, where available. Where market prices are not available, fair values are estimated using discounted cash flow method.\n\nThe fair value of variable interest-bearing as well as short-term financial instruments accounted for at amortised cost is assumed to be approximated by their carrying amounts.",

Credit Risk\n\n## 42.1 Maximum exposure to credit risk\n\nThe following table shows the exposure to credit risk of on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet financial instruments, before taking into account any collateral held, other credit enhancements and netting arrangements. For on-balance sheet financial assets, the maximum credit exposure is the carrying amounts. For contingent liabilities, the maximum exposure to credit risk is the amount the Group would have to pay if the instrument is called upon. For undrawn facilities, the maximum exposure to credit risk is the full amount of the undrawn credit facilities granted to customers.\n\n|                                                               | The Group   | The Group   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| In $ millions                                                 | 2020        | 2019        |\n| On-balance sheet                                              |             |             |\n| Cash and balances with central banks (excluding cash on hand) | 48,207      | 24,059      |\n| Government securities and treasury bills                      | 51,700      | 49,729      |\n| Due from banks                                                | 50,867      | 39,336      |\n| Derivatives                                                   | 31,108      | 17,235      |\n| Bank and corporate debt securities                            | 54,109      | 53,826      |\n| Loans and advances to customers                               | 371,171     | 357,884     |\n| Other assets (excluding deferred tax assets)                  | 18,871      | 15,111      |\n|                                                               | 626,033     | 557,180     |\n\n## Off-balance sheet\n\n| Contingent liabilities and commitments (excluding capital commitments)   | 336,151   | 326,168   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Total                                                                    | 962,184   | 883,348   |\n\nThe Group's exposures to credit risk, measured using the expected gross credit exposures that will arise upon a default of the end obligor are as shown in the Group's Pillar 3 Disclosures. These exposures, which include both on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet financial instruments, are shown without taking into account any collateral held or netting arrangements.\n\n## Analysis of Collateral\n\nWhilst the Group's maximum exposure to credit risk is the carrying amount of the assets or, in the case of off-balance sheet instruments, the amount guaranteed, committed, accepted or endorsed, the likely exposure may be lower due to offsetting collateral, credit guarantees and other actions taken to mitigate the Group's exposure.\n\nThe description of collateral for each class of financial asset is set out below.\n\nBalances with central banks, government securities and treasury bills, due from banks and bank and corporate debt securities Collateral is generally not sought for these assets.\n\n## Derivatives\n\nThe Group maintains collateral agreements and enters into master netting agreements with most of the counterparties for derivative transactions. Please refer to Note 37 for the impact of netting arrangements recognised for the computation of Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR).\n\n## Loans and advances to customers, contingent liabilities and commitments\n\nCertain loans and advances to customers, contingent liabilities and commitments are typically collateralised to a substantial extent. In particular, residential mortgage exposures are generally fully secured by residential properties. Income-producing real estate, which is a sub-set of the Specialised Lending exposure, is fully secured by the underlying assets financed.\n\nThe extent to which credit exposures are covered by Basel eligible collateral, besides real estate, after the application of the requisite regulatory hair-cuts, is shown in the Group's Pillar 3 Disclosures. The amounts are a sub-set of the actual collateral arrangements entered by the Group as Basel imposes strict legal and operational standards before collateral can be admitted as credit risk mitigants. As a result, certain collateral arrangements which do not meet its criteria will not be included. Certain collateral types which are not permitted as credit risk mitigants for credit exposures under the Standardised Approach are also excluded.",

Capital Management\n\nThe Board is responsible for setting the Group's capital management objective, which is to maintain a strong capital position consistent with regulatory requirements under the MAS Notice 637 and the expectations of various stakeholders, including customers, investors and rating agencies. The Board articulates this objective in the form of capital targets. This objective is pursued while delivering returns to shareholders and ensuring that adequate capital resources are available for business growth and investment opportunities as well as adverse situations, taking into consideration the Group's strategic plans and risk appetite.\n\nThe Group's capital management objective is implemented via a capital management and planning process that is overseen by the Capital Committee. The Chief Financial Officer chairs the Capital Committee. The Capital Committee receives regular updates on the Group's current and projected capital position. A key tool for capital planning is the annual Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) through which the Group assesses its forecast capital supply and demand relative to regulatory requirements and internal capital targets. The ICAAP generally has a three-year horizon and covers various scenarios, including stress scenarios of differing scope and severity.\n\nThe Group is subject to and has complied with the capital adequacy requirements set out in the MAS Notice 637, which effects the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision's capital adequacy framework in Singapore, throughout the year. The Group's capital adequacy ratios as at 31 December 2020 and 2019 have been subject to an external limited assurance review, pursuant to the MAS Notice 609 'Auditor's Report and Additional Information to be submitted with Annual Accounts'.\n\nFor more information, please refer to Pillar 3 disclosures at the Group's website (https://www.dbs.com/investors/default.page).",

Segment Reporting\n\n## 45.1 Business segment reporting\n\nThe business segment results are prepared based on the Group's internal management reporting which reflects the organisation management structure. As the activities of the Group are highly integrated, internal allocation has been made in preparing the segment information. Amounts for each business segment are shown after the allocation of certain centralised costs, funding income and the application of transfer pricing, where appropriate. Transactions between segments are recorded within the segment as if they are third party transactions and are eliminated on consolidation.\n\nThe Group's various business segments are described below.\n\n## Consumer Banking/ Wealth Management\n\nConsumer Banking/ Wealth Management provides individual customers with a diverse range of banking and related financial services. The products and services available to customers include current and savings accounts, fixed deposits, loans and home finance, cards, payments, investment and insurance products.\n\n## Institutional Banking\n\nInstitutional Banking provides financial services and products to institutional clients including bank and non-bank financial institutions, government-linked companies, large corporates and small and medium-sized businesses. The business focuses on broadening and deepening customer relationships. Products and services comprise the full range of credit facilities from short-term working capital financing to specialised lending. It also provides global transactional services such as cash management, trade finance and securities and fiduciary services, treasury and markets products, corporate finance and advisory banking as well as capital markets solutions.\n\n## Treasury Markets\n\nTreasury Markets' activities primarily include structuring, market-making and trading across a broad range of treasury products.\n\nIncome from sale of treasury products offered to customers of Consumer Banking/ Wealth Management and Institutional Banking is not reflected in the Treasury Markets segment, but in the respective customer segments.\n\n## Others\n\nThe Others segment encompasses the results of corporate decisions that are not attributed to business segments as well as the contribution of LVB as its activities have not been aligned with the Group's segment definitions. It includes earnings on capital deployed into high quality assets, earnings from non-core asset sales and certain other head office items such as centrally raised allowances. DBS Vickers Securities and The Islamic Bank of Asia are also included in this segment.",

Please refer to page 95 of the Capital Management and Planning section in the 2020 Annual Report for an explanation of DBSH's dividend policy.\n\n## Ordinary Resolution 3: Directors' remuneration for 2020\n\nResolution 3 is to approve the payment of an aggregate amount of SGD 4,101,074 as Directors' remuneration for the nonexecutive Directors of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2020 ('FY2020'). In a show of solidarity with the nation and our stakeholders during the Covid-19 pandemic, all the non-executive Directors who are currently in office have volunteered to take a 10% reduction in their basic retainer fees of SGD100,000 for FY2020. On top of the 10% reduction in his basic retainer fees, the Board Chairman has also volunteered to take an additional 10% reduction in his Board Chairman's fees for FY2020. Accordingly, although the non-executive Directors' fee structure for FY2020 remains unchanged from that for the year ended 31 December 2019 ('FY2019'), the amount of Directors' remuneration for FY2020 is approximately 13% lower than that for FY2019, after factoring in the aforesaid voluntary 10% reductions, as well as lower attendance fees from the holding of various Board and Board committee meetings via video-conference in 2020 due to Covid-19 restrictions.\n\nupon re-election as a Director of the Company, will also be appointed as the Chairman of the Compensation and Management Development Committee with effect from 31 March 2021.\n\n## Special Business\n\n## Ordinary Resolution 8: DBSH Share Plan\n\nResolution 8 is to empower the Directors to offer and grant awards and to allot and issue ordinary shares of the Company pursuant to the DBSH Share Plan, provided that (a) the maximum number of ordinary shares which may be issued under the DBSH Share Plan (including the California sub-plan to the DBSH Share Plan) is limited to 5% of the total number of issued shares of the Company (excluding treasury shares and subsidiary holdings) from time to time; and (b) the aggregate number of new ordinary shares under awards which may be granted pursuant to the DBSH Share Plan (including the California sub-plan to the DBSH Share Plan) from this Annual General Meeting to the next Annual General Meeting shall not exceed 1% of the total number of issued shares of the Company (excluding treasury shares and subsidiary holdings) from time to time.\n\n## Ordinary Resolution 9: California Sub-Plan to DBSH Share Plan\n\nResolution 9 is to empower the Directors to offer and grant awards and to allot and issue ordinary shares of the Company pursuant to the DBSH Share Plan to participants who are residents of the state of California in the United States of America, subject to the terms of the California sub-plan (the 'California Sub-Plan') to the DBSH Share Plan, provided that (a) the maximum aggregate number of ordinary shares which may be issued under the California SubPlan is limited to 1,000,000 ordinary shares, subject to any lower limitations required under the DBSH Share Plan; (b) the California Sub-Plan will terminate on, and no further awards will be granted under the California Sub-Plan after, the tenth anniversary of its approval by the Board of Directors of the Company on 15 February 2019; and (c) the awards granted under the California Sub-Plan will be subject to adjustment upon certain changes in the capitalisation of the Company. In addition, the California Sub-Plan imposes additional restrictions on participants residing in California other than those contemplated under the DBSH Share Plan.\n\n## Ordinary Resolution 10: Share Issue Mandate\n\nResolution 10 is to empower the Directors to issue shares of the Company and to make or grant instruments (such as warrants or debentures) convertible into shares, and to issue shares in pursuance of such\n\nIf approved, each of the non-executive Directors (with the exception of Ms Euleen Goh Yiu Kiang, Mr Andre Sekulic and Mrs Ow Foong Pheng) will receive 70% of his or her Directors' fees in cash and 30% of his or her Directors' fees in the form of share awards granted pursuant to the DBSH Share Plan. The share awards will not be subject to a vesting period, but will be subject to a selling moratorium whereby each non-executive Director will be required to hold the equivalent of one year's basic retainer for the duration of his or her tenure as a Director, and for one year after the date he or she steps down as a Director. The actual number of shares to be awarded will be determined by reference to the volume-weighted average price of a share on the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited (\"SGX-ST\") over the 10 trading days immediately prior to (and excluding) the date of the forthcoming Annual General Meeting, rounded down to the nearest share, and any residual balance will be paid in cash. Ms Euleen Goh Yiu Kiang and Mr Andre Sekulic, both of whom will be retiring from office by rotation at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting and will not be offering themselves for re-election, will receive all of their Directors' fees in cash. The Director's fees for Mrs Ow Foong Pheng will be paid in cash to a government agency, the Directorship & Consultancy Appointments Council.\n\nPlease refer to pages 44, 46, 47, 55 and 56 of the Corporate Governance Report in the 2020 Annual Report for more details on the non-executive Directors' remuneration for FY2020.\n\n## Ordinary Resolutions 5: Re-election of Director retiring under article 99\n\nMr Piyush Gupta, upon re-election as a Director of the Company, will remain as an executive Director of the Company.\n\n## Ordinary Resolutions 6 and 7: Re-election of Directors retiring under article 105\n\n- (a) Ms Punita Lal, upon re-election as a Director of the Company, will remain as a member of each of the Compensation and Management Development Committee and Nominating Committee, and will be considered independent.

For the purpose of determining the aggregate number of shares that may be issued, the percentage of issued shares shall be based on the total number of issued shares (excluding treasury shares and subsidiary holdings) of the Company at the time that Resolution 10 is passed, after adjusting for (a) new shares arising from the conversion or exercise of any convertible securities or share options or vesting of share awards which were issued and are outstanding or subsisting at the time that Resolution 10 is passed; and (b) any subsequent bonus issue, consolidation or subdivision of shares. As at 9 February 2021 (the 'Latest Practicable Date'), the Company had 24,795,662 treasury shares and no subsidiary holdings.\n\n## Ordinary Resolution 11: DBSH Scrip Dividend Scheme\n\nResolution 11 is to empower the Directors, should they choose to apply the DBSH Scrip Dividend Scheme (the 'Scheme') to a qualifying dividend, to issue such number of new ordinary shares of the Company as may be required to be issued pursuant to the Scheme to members who, in respect of a qualifying dividend, have elected to receive scrip in lieu of the cash amount of that qualifying dividend. If the Directors should decide to apply the Scheme to a qualifying dividend, the current intention is that no discount will be given for the scrip shares.\n\n## Ordinary Resolution 12: Renewal of the Share Purchase Mandate\n\nResolution 12 is to renew the mandate to allow the Company to purchase or otherwise acquire its issued ordinary shares, on the terms and subject to the conditions set out in the Resolution.\n\nThe Company may use its internal or external sources of funds or a combination of both to finance its purchase or acquisition of the ordinary shares of the Company ('Ordinary Shares'). The amount of financing required for the Company to purchase or acquire its Ordinary Shares, and the impact on the Company's financial position, cannot be ascertained as at the date of this Notice as these will depend on whether the Ordinary Shares are purchased or acquired out of capital or profits, the number of Ordinary Shares purchased or acquired and the price at which such Ordinary Shares were purchased or acquired.\n\nBased on the existing issued and paid-up Ordinary Shares as at the Latest Practicable Date and excluding any Ordinary Shares held in treasury, the purchase by the Company of 2% of its issued Ordinary Shares will result in the purchase or acquisition of 51,021,360 Ordinary Shares.\n\nAssuming that the Company purchases or acquires 51,021,360 Ordinary Shares at the Maximum Price, in the case of both market and off-market purchases, of SGD 26.70 for one Ordinary Share (being the price equivalent to 5% above the average closing prices of the Ordinary Shares traded on the SGX-ST over the last five market days on which transactions were recorded immediately preceding the Latest Practicable Date), the maximum amount of funds required is approximately SGD 1.4 billion.\n\nThe financial effects of the purchase or acquisition of such Ordinary Shares by the Company pursuant to the proposed Share Purchase Mandate on the financial statements of the Group and the Company for the financial year ended 31 December 2020 based on these and other assumptions are set out in paragraph 2.7 of the Letter to Shareholders dated 8 March 2021 (the 'Letter').\n\nPlease refer to the Letter for further details.",
