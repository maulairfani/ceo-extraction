At the same time, SSAB is well equipped for 2021 and beyond. Our focus is on being the first in the world with fossil-free steel and SSAB will continue to lead the transition in the industry. We find ourselves very well placed to strengthen profitability and our market position.\n\n## Solid performance in a volatile market\n\nThe year was a/ffected by volatile demand with squeezed steel prices in the wake of Covid-19. SSAB's operating result for 2020 fell to SEK -325 (2,159) million. Our flexibility worked well, and enabled us to promptly introduce a raft of measures in the second and third quarters to adjust production and costs to greatly reduced demand. We pushed fixed costs down by a total of more than SEK 1.6 billion compared to the full-year 2019. The markets recovered during the autumn and order intake rose sharply. Thanks to our decision to bring forward annual planned maintenance to the summer and flexible sta/ffing, our steel mills were geared up for higher volumes and we were able to step up production rates to meet increased demand. This paved the way for a strong end to the year.\n\nNet cash flow for the full year was SEK 2.2 billion and net debt decreased to just over SEK 10 billion.\n\nSSAB has a strong financial position. Since we were a/ffected by weaker steel markets because of Covid-19, we decided to push back the timing of achieving our strategic targets from 2022 to 2023. Even though production levels during the year as a whole were relatively low, we achieved good production stability. Stable production is supportive of financial performance, but also leads to lower emissions per tonne of steel produced and positive impacts in safety work.\n\n## Safer workplace\n\nHealth and safety are top priorities and our e/fforts delivered good results in 2020. Lost-time injury frequency (LTIF) decreased to 3.7 (4.2). Work on preventing accidents took place alongside several measures to limit the spread of Covid-19. Production and maintenance could be carried out without any major negative impacts.\n\nBUSINESS SEGMENTS\n\n5\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## BUSINESS REVIEW\n\nHIGHLIGHTS\n\n## Customers driving development\n\nMany industries are highly interested in finding solutions to reduce their carbon footprint. The focus of product development in the automotive industry has long been on reducing emissions in the user phase. Here, SSAB has been able to provide high-strength steel which, among other things, lightens the weight of passenger cars and commercial vehicles.\n\nNow higher demands are being placed on how vehicles are made. We are seeing clear requests from customers about SSAB as a supplier of a broad range of fossil-free steel. This makes it important for SSAB to continuously evaluate the possibilities to invest and step up the pace of the transition. We will create the conditions to be a more comprehensive supplier of fossil-free steel to existing and new customers within key segments. SSAB will be the first to market, in 2026, with fossil-free products.\n\n## Fossil-free steel will be a premium segment\n\nImproving our product mix is key to SSAB's strategy. I am convinced that fossil-free steel will be an important step in continuing to improve the product mix going forward. This will create increased support for profitability and reduce sensitivity to fluctuations in economic cycles. Our growth focus has long been concentrated around high-strength steels. SSAB's world-leading steel contributes to improved\n\nSSAB AND 2020 IN BRIEF\n\nOPERATING ENVIRONMENT\n\nSTRATEGY\n\nproductivity and sustainability performance of the vehicles and machines our customers manufacture. We also want to grow our service-related business, SSAB Services, which addresses the relatively stable maintenance market in mining and recycling plants, for example. We will continue to invest in more advanced products to strengthen our leading position in profitable niche segments.\n\n## Sustainability targets scientifically based\n\nSSAB's updated sustainability strategy has two main themes: First in fossil-free steel and leading sustainability work. The strategy includes short- and long-term ambitions and goals. We have launched new environmental targets for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and circularity. The new GHG emissions target has been approved by the Science Based Targets initiative. SSAB commits to reducing GHG emissions by 35% by 2032 (compared to 2018 and measured as CO 2 e). The target applies to both direct and indirect emissions (Scope 1 and 2) and is line with the Paris Agreement and the objective of keeping global warming well below 2\u00b0C. SSAB's overarching goal is to be fossil free by 2045.\n\nSSAB has for many years been a signatory to the UN Global Compact. We also support UN global sustainable development goals. This makes clear our responsibility for the environments, people and communities a/ffected by our operations. This\n\nBUSINESS SEGMENTS\n\n'I am convinced that fossil-free steel will be an important step in continuing to improve the product mix going forward. This will create increased support for profitability and reduce sensitivity to fluctuations in economic cycles.'\n\nreport is part of our communication about how we work according to Global Compact principles. We will continue to support the UN Global Compact principles with regard to environment, human rights, labor and anti-corruption, and continue to work to integrate the principles into our operations, culture and value chain.\n\n## Leading the transition in the steel industry\n\nThe market recovered toward the end of last year and we expect good activity during the first quarter of 2021. We ended all temporary layo/ffs and short-time work at the turn of the year. The short-term focus is to maintain a high, stable level of production. Uncertainty remains as to the development of Covid-19 and how this can a/ffect our customers' operations and economic development in general. In 2020, we showed\n\nhow we can successfully manage a di/fficult situation and I would like to thank all employees for their excellent contributions. I would also like to thank all our suppliers and customers for their continued support.\n\nDuring 2021, we will increase the speed of the conversion in Oxel\u00f6sund and continue to develop the world unique HYBRIT pilot plant, introducing hydrogen gas based production. We have a strong balance sheet and generate good cash flow. My conviction has been strengthened of SSAB's important role in leading the industry's continued transition and regeneration. This will create value for all the company's stakeholders and not least for our shareholders.\n\n## Martin Lindqvist ,\n\nPresident and CEO\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

At the plant, HYBRIT will perform tests in several stages in the use of hydrogen in the direct reduction of iron ore. Preparations will now start on scaling up the tests further on an industrial scale in a demonstration plant. The plan is to start construction of the demonstration plant in 2023, with the goal of bringing the plant into operation in 2025 and to demonstrate full-scale production with a capacity of over one million tonnes of sponge iron per year. SSAB plans to be the first company in the world, already in 2026, to get fossil-free steel to market.\n\nRead more on page 63.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBUSINESS SEGMENTS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n7",

Through preventive measures with our suppliers, we also avoided the spread of the infection in conjunction with our maintenance outages.\n\nSSAB strives to be the safest steel company in the world, with an objective of having zero accidents, work-related injuries or illnesses. Positive development of the key metrics started in 2019 largely due to safety having the highest priority and the extensive e/fforts undertaken to improve safety and the company's safety culture. SSAB's lost time injury frequency (LTIF) in 2020 was 3.7 (4.2). The development was particularly good in SSAB Special Steels and Ruukki Construction.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## SSAB's climate goal was approved by the Science Based Targets initiative\n\nSSAB is committed to reducing its greenhouse gas (CO 2 e) emissions by 35% by 2032 (based on 2018 figures). The goal applies both to direct and indirect emissions (Scope 1 and 2) and is in line with the objective of keeping global warming well below 2\u00b0C. This goal has now been approved by the Science Based Targets initiative. The approval means that the objective is scientifically based and in line with the Paris Agreement.\n\nRead more on page 49.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSSAB AND 2020 IN BRIEF\n\nOPERATING ENVIRONMENT\n\nSTRATEGY\n\nManaging the downturn\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSSAB implemented several short-term actions across the business to mitigate the e/ffects of Covid-19 and the total annualized savings exceeded SEK 1.6 billion. These actions included short-time work allowances, temporary lay-o/ffs and other cost savings measures. Production levels had to be adjusted to lower steel demand and, for example, blast furnace 2 in Raahe was idled for part of the year.\n\nBUSINESS SEGMENTS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n8",

        "page_content": "HIGHLIGHTS\n\nSTRATEGY\n\n## Steel market and SSAB's position\n\nThe year 2020 was a turbulent one in the global steel industry. Steel industry dynamics are shaped by developments in steel demand, steel supply, steel trade flows and the raw material market. These were all affected by the global Covid-19 pandemic, as well as by longer-term underlying trends. SSAB is exposed to this overall steel industry context, but is a relatively small player in the global steel industry in terms of production capacity, and has specialized in certain segments within flat carbon steels.\n\n## Four fundamental  forces shaping steel industry dynamics\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1. STEEL DEMAND\n\n- \u00b7   Economic cycles a/ffect demand\n- \u00b7   Customer segment specific developments\n- \u00b7   New innovations in steel driven by sustainability requirements\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4. RAW MATERIALS\n\n- \u00b7  Continued risk of supply disruptions\n- \u00b7  Price volatility\n- \u00b7  Resource e/fficiency\n\n## 2. STEEL SUPPLY CAPACITY\n\n- \u00b7   Overcapacity regionalizing\n- \u00b7   More flexible steel capacity\n- \u00b7  Consolidation\n- \u00b7   Environmental issues driving capacity closures in China\n\n## 3. STEEL TRADE FLOWS\n\n- \u00b7   Increased protectionism and more trade barriers\n- \u00b7  Trade flows redirected\n- \u00b7  Currency fluctuations\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 1. Steel demand Global steel demand taking a severe hit due to Covid-19\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSteel demand started to show signs of improvement in early 2020 after a challenging second half of 2019, but soon faced severe headwinds due to the coronavirus outbreak. In general, apparent steel demand held up relatively well in the beginning of the outbreak as customers restocked to mitigate future supply disruptions, but demand then dropped sharply across most markets and segments. Key steel-using segments, such as the automotive sector, ceased production completely during parts of the year because of the lockdown measures introduced in multiple countries. Furthermore, weak end-user demand and supply chain disruptions continuously caused challenges in most segments throughout the year. Steel demand started to steadily pick up toward the end of the year, but a recovery to preCovid-19 levels is expected to take time. China has demonstrated the fastest pace of recovery, while Europe and the US, for example, have shown a more moderate pace by comparison.\n\n## Innovation toward productivity and sustainability continue to drive new steel demand\n\nGlobal megatrends and industry-specific trends shape customer demand across all industries, including the steel industry. For example, users in the construction and automotive industries are working at lower costs, improving safety and lightening the weight of their products, thereby\n\nBUSINESS SEGMENTS\n\nreducing their environmental impact. In the mining industry, customers are striving to increase the durability of equipment and reduce downtimes. The use of high-strength steels provides advantages in the form of stronger, lighter and more durable steel solutions. Use of these steels therefore continues to increase and has a higher growth potential than standard steels. Furthermore, multiple steel-using segments are showing a growing interest in low CO 2 steel, where steel companies are now investing to bring solutions to market to meet strong customer demand.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2. Steel supply trends Industry taking action to balance supply and demand after the drop in the market\n\nExcess steel production capacity, especially in China, but also in Europe, has been impacting steel industry dynamics since the financial crisis of 2008. However, apparent demand and e/ffective capacity have become more balanced in recent years. Going into 2020, market expectations looked favorable until the pandemic started to unfold.\n\nIn most of the world, the steel industry was forced to take short-term actions to cope with declining demand. This included idling a large number of blast furnaces, taking outages at EAF facilities, and part time layo/ffs of employees. In some cases, blast furnaces have been permanently closed. Notably, the Chinese authorities worked actively to improve their domestic situation by stimulating demand, with a variety of stimuluses\n\nSteel industry dynamics\n\n<!-- image -->",

In Europe, there is a strong push toward green technologies and more sustainable steelmaking processes. Despite talks of consolidation between steel companies, no large deals were announced. In the US, a number of greenfield initiatives to build new electric arc furnace mills continue. The US flat carbon steel market also saw the emergence of a new large steel company since the mining company Cleveland-Cli/ffs forward-integrated by acquiring AK Steel and most of the US assets from\n\nSSAB AND 2020 IN BRIEF\n\nSTRATEGY\n\nOPERATING ENVIRONMENT\n\nArcelorMittal. In Asia, consolidation continues and Baowu overtook ArcelorMittal as the world's largest steel company.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 3. Steel trade flows\n\n## Increasing trade tensions\n\nGlobal trade patterns have been scrutinized and debated in recent years, resulting in more and more countries installing protection mechanisms. The introduction of trade barriers was growing worldwide already before the coronavirus outbreak and the number of global trade cases has increased in recent years. Section 232 tari/ffs in the US may be the best-known measure, but several other regions have also introduced retaliatory measures. Additional measures were introduced during the coronavirus outbreak to\n\n## Apparent demand for finished steel products\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Worldsteel Short Range Outlook October 2020\n\nbetter control flows of imported steel. This can be seen for example in Europe, where countryspecific import quotas were used to a  greater extent than earlier. Substantial trade policies will likely be in force for a number of years, and more may be introduced if perceived necessary to curb predatory trade practices. As such, they may dampen economic growth prospects and/ or hinder exports of niche materials, but should, on the other hand, at least in the short term, be supportive of steel prices in home markets.\n\n## Market regionalization\n\nTrade policies combined with increasing steel demand locally have resulted in decreased trade, particularly between geographical regions. Extra-regional steel trade (i.e. excluding trade within the EU, NAFTA, CIS, etc.) has been on a downward path in recent years and accounted for 14% of global steel demand in 2019, down two percentage points from 2018. The US remains the largest net importer of steel, with a trade deficit of about 20 million tonnes in 2019, whereas Europe had a trade deficit of about 12 million tonnes. It is notable that China, which has historically been a major net exporter of steel, has been a net importer during parts of 2020 following a strong domestic demand recovery. The coronavirus outbreak could be a further catalyst of market regionalization as companies may consider localizing supply chains and further trade policies may be introduced to save local jobs and support a green re-start of the economy (e.g. through carbon border taxes).\n\nBUSINESS SEGMENTS\n\n## 4. Input materials\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## A sharp increase in iron prices\n\nDuring 2019, iron ore prices rose to recent record levels. However, during the first part of 2020 iron ore prices started to come down only to sharply reverse upward during the second half of 2020. The main drivers for the increase in iron prices were production disruptions from some of the major low-cost producers, coupled with high demand based on high Chinese steel output rates. The combination meant that producers higher up on the cost curve had more influence over global iron ore prices. High iron ore prices had a negative e/ffect on steel production profitability as producers were unable to pass on the increased costs to customers.\n\n## Steel prices\n\nSteel demand, steel supply capacity, steel trade flows and input materials all impact the sales prices of steel products globally. Steel prices have been increasingly volatile and unpredictable in recent years and the Covid-19 pandemic has not contributed to stabilize prices. Looking at the prices during 2020, hot-rolled coil spot steel prices fell about 10% in Europe from the start of the year until the end of summer, at which point they started to recover and ended up 40% higher than the starting point of the year. Standard plate prices were especially a/ffected, falling at the beginning of the year, but also recoiled and plate prices have increased by about 15% in Europe and close to 22% in the Americas.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The market for high-strength steels has to a large extent been driven by SSAB. Since 2000, SSAB's shipments have increased by an average of around 8% a year, outperforming the general steel market. Structural growth is generated by manufacturers' needs for higher productivity and better sustainability performance in machinery and equipment. Upgrading components to more advanced steel enables weight reduction and extended service life.\n\nDevelopment of new products and applications often takes place in close cooperation with customers. As early as possible in the development of a new product - be it a tipper, a chute or a crane - SSAB's engineers work together with the customer in developing solutions that best utilize the properties of each steel grade.\n\nWith an estimated global market share of 25%, SSAB is the largest producer of high-strength steels. There is a large number of competitors with relatively small market shares and SSAB sells roughly three times more in terms of volume than its closest competitor. Most competitors focus on sales to service centers and large OEMs in selected markets. Apart from those segments, SSAB's unique global sales network enables us also to reach small and mid-size customers in all corners\n\nSSAB AND 2020 IN BRIEF\n\nOPERATING ENVIRONMENT\n\nSTRATEGY\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMarket share, Special Steels, approximately\n\nof the world.

Hardox Wearparts is a network of mainly independent companies o/ffering wear parts and just-in-time repair services to end-users in the local aftermarket in the mining, quarrying, recycling and construction sectors. SSAB Services focuses on providing products and services to machine builders and the after-market business. This strategy allows SSAB to maintain a high service level in smaller and fragmented markets, and also to gain exposure to end-users' operating expenditures (OPEX), which has a stabilizing e/ffect over the business cycle.

Despite the fall in steel shipments, SSAB Europe managed to keep our share of Premium products stable from the previous year's level at around 40%. Furthermore, whereas steel-weighted industrial production\n\nSSAB AND 2020 IN BRIEF\n\nOPERATING ENVIRONMENT\n\nSTRATEGY\n\nin Automotive is estimated to have decreased 20.6%* year on year, SSAB Europe's AHSS sales to the automotive segment decreased just 7% year on year. Premium steel volumes were 719 thousand tonnes, which in principle was unchanged compared to 2019. SSAB Europe's market share in the Nordic home markets decreased slightly to 37%, due to increased competition. Operating result decreased to SEK -1,113 million, which was mainly due to the sharp drop in steel shipments and prices during Q2-Q3, and increased costs due to lower capacity utilization. Extensive cost savings and capacity adjustments were carried out to counteract the strong decrease in turnover. Fixed costs decreased by a total of around SEK 620 million compared to 2019.\n\nReduced work time in SSAB Europe during most of 2020, together with delayed car model launches, meant that some product development projects were also pushed back. However, we managed to grow our material approval basket by investing significant resources and finalized more than 10 Automotive OEM grade approvals. Product development in Automotive was focused on improving existing grades and also launching new ones (e.g. Docol HR800CP (improved) and Docol 800 HE).

We renewed our sustainability strategy during 2020. The new strategy has its basis in SSAB's 'Taking the lead' strategy, while it is also building on The SSAB Way, SSAB's core values and the First in fossil-free steel ambition. The strategy is called 'With the future in mind' and it has two main themes: First in fossil-free steel and Leading sustainability performance.\n\nWith the Future in Mind\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## First in fossil-free steel Use better steel\n\nSSAB is committed to minimizing any adverse environmental impacts from our operations. Therefore, SSAB focuses on continuous improvement to minimize emissions and improve productivity, as well as material and energy e/fficiency. SSAB's blast furnace-based production is among the most CO 2 e/fficient in the world. This gives a competitive advantage to SSAB and its customers. For example, our cold-rolled steel production emits approximately 6% less CO 2 e than the European average and as much as 17% less than the Chinese average.\n\n## Use steel better\n\nThe core of SSAB's business is to develop and produce Advanced High-Strength Steels (AHSS) and Quenched & Tempered (Q&T) steels that are stronger than ordinary steels. This in turn enables our customers to produce lighter and stronger products, thereby reducing their environmental footprint.\n\nBy using SSAB's high-strength steels, which results in lower weight and improved fuel\n\neconomy, customers can achieve significant CO 2 savings during their end products' use-phase. The objective is that, by the end of 2021 these annual customer CO 2 savings will reach 10 million tonnes, which equals SSAB's own direct CO 2 emissions.\n\n## Go fossil-free\n\nSSAB works toward a fossil-free steelmaking process through the HYBRIT initiative and by eliminating other fossil related emissions, with a goal to o/ffer fossil-free steel to the market in 2026. In cooperation with LKAB, our iron ore supplier, and Vattenfall our energy provider, we form a fossil-free value chain. In 2020, we started discussions to partner with key customers and stakeholders for future fossil-free steel shipments.\n\n## Leading sustainability performance Safety first\n\nSSAB is determined to be the world's safest steel company, with the objective of achieving zero accidents, work-related injuries and illnesses. Everyone has the right to a healthy, accident-\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

We will minimize, as far as possible, health and safety risks everywhere we operate.\n\n## E/fficiency and responsibility Resource e/fficient operations\n\nFor SSAB, circularity is a key factor in increasing e/fficiency to help mitigate environmental impact. We continuously work to optimize the value of our by-products, scrap and waste, with a focus on sustainability and value creation. SSAB is committed to the e/fficient use of raw materials and energy. To further improve energy e/fficiency, energy flows are recycled in the production process.\n\n## Responsible sourcing\n\nSSAB has approximately 20,000 active suppliers in more than 60 di/fferent countries. SSAB works actively with particularly high-risk suppliers to ensure sustainability throughout the supply chain. Suppliers must comply both with SSAB's standards and with international ethical, social and environmental guidelines in order to remain qualified suppliers for SSAB.\n\n## Respect and integrity Zero tolerance for bribery and corruption\n\nThe Code of Conduct is the way we act. It forms the basis for our ethical, environmental and social responsibility. The tone from the top is clearly communicated and all employees must take an e-learning in business ethics.\n\nFIRST IN FOSSIL-FREE STEEL\n\nLEADING SUSTAINABILITY PERFORMANCE\n\nGRI REPORT SUPPLEMENT\n\nAnti-corruption compliance in business is important. SSAB has implemented clear instructions for our employees in order to guide us through our daily operations and how we act in relation to business partners. These instructions will help our people to stay on sound ethical and legal ground when doing business. SSAB has implemented a whistle-blower system called the Ethics Line. Employees can file a report anonymously online or by calling a global hotline 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\n\n## Inclusion & diversity\n\nA key element of SSAB's business strategy is to build a high-performing organization with strong employee engagement globally. SSAB will continue to work with leadership and competence development, and strive to enhance inclusion and diversity in the workforce.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3.7\n\nLost Time Injury Frequency in 2020\n\nThe HYBRIT pilot plant for fossil-free iron production started operation in 2020 in Lule\u00e5.\n\n<!-- image -->",

SSAB has set an objective related to customers upgrading to high-strength steels; SSAB is aiming at 10 million tonnes in annual customer CO 2 savings by 2021 (earlier the target year was 2020, but it was pushed back due to Covid-19 impacts). The savings will be reached by two initiatives: 8.0 million tonnes savings from SSAB EcoUpgraded deliveries and 2.0 million tonnes savings from Automotive Premium Upgrade deliveries.\n\n## First in fossil-free steel\n\nSSAB is undertaking a strategic roadmap to revolutionize steelmaking, and to be the world's\n\nfirst steel company to deliver, in 2026, fossilfree steel to the market. This includes an active leadership role in the HYBRIT joint venture initiative with LKAB and Vattenfall. The target is to be fossil free as a company by 2045. Various milestones for SSAB and HYBRIT are outlined as targets for the coming years.\n\nRead more on p. 63.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n48",

Includes Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions.\n- 2) Home scrap, purchased scrap and H-DRI (Fossil-free Direct Reduced Iron) replacing BF (Blast Furnace) route iron ore pellets\n- 3) BF (Blast Furnace), BOF (Basic Oxygen Furnace) and EAF (Electric Arc Furnace) slag. The full annual production of slag is used. Later during the target period, also stored slag volumes are expected to be used.\n\nThe target follow-up will be done first time for 2021.\n\n## Greenhouse gas emissions reduction / Science Based Target\n\nSSAB's targets for greenhouse gas emissions including carbon dioxide have been approved by the Science Based Targets initiative. This means that the objective is scientifically based and in line with the Paris Agreement. SSAB is committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 35% by 2032 (based on 2018 figures and measured as CO 2 e). The goal applies to both direct and indirect emissions (Scope 1\n\nand Scope 2) and is in line with the objective of keeping global warming well below 2\u00b0C. Other indirect CO 2 e emissions (Scope 3) are not included. The target goes hand in hand with our overall roadmap for fossil-free steel and the timetable for the HYBRIT initiative.\n\n## Use of scrap/Fossil-free direct reduced iron\n\nFor SSAB in the Nordics, a transformation from the traditional blast furnace-based production route to the use of electric arc furnaces is under way.\n\nThis will use scrap metal and also increasingly use fossil-free direct reduced iron (H-DRI). There is a strong focus on the recycled content on today's market and so also for steel products. However, over time fossil-free H-DRI will have the potential to replace recycled content for steel and tH-DRI will contribute to even lower Global Warming Potential results in a lifecycle assessment (LCA). Therefore, it is relevant to include both the use of scrap and H-DRI when setting the target and following up progress on this issue.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Slag utilization\n\nRecirculating materials back into the steelmaking process reduces the need for virgin raw materials. Material that cannot be recirculated internally can be processed into by-products and sold externally, creating new revenue streams for the company. By-products such as blast furnace slag are used as input material in a number of industries, for example in road construction and as a substitute for cement.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n49",

Customer CO 2 savings are calculated by looking at SSAB shipments of high-strength steels to different customer segments and applications. The amount of steel that SSAB supplies above standard practice in the respective industry is calculated for each application (e.g. a truck). This allows determination of the weight saving achieved in the end product by using these higher-strength steels. The resulting fuel savings are estimated by using typical values for fuel consumption, driving distance, useful life, etc.  Finally, the CO 2 emissions saved are then calculated based on these fuel savings\n- 2) New suppliers with spend above 1 MSEK included\n- 3) Of which 13 were performed remotely\n\n<!-- image -->",

Strenx performance steel, Docol automotive steel and Hardox wear plate enable better energy and material efficiency, safety, as well as strength and durability for the applications in which they are used. Our GreenCoat color-coated steels are unique in using a substantial amount of Swedish rapeseed oil instead of fossil-based oils in the paint. GreenCoat products are the sustainable choice for color-coated steels on the market for roofs, fa\u00e7ades and rainwater systems.\n\n## Strenx performance steel reduces weight, increases payload, and lowers fuel consumption and CO 2 emissions\n\nThe environmental advantages of using high-strength steels are significant in heavy equipment such as trailers, trucks, agriculture and lifting equipment, and construction machinery. Used in these applications, Strenx performance steel reduces their weight by enabling minimum steel thickness through new structural designs. Structural redesign can also reduce production costs through less welding and improved usability. In lifting equipment, which requires high load-bearing capacity, the structural wall thickness can be reduced, resulting in material weight savings and reduced emissions. In earthmoving and transport vehicles, lower vehicle weight leads to increased payload capacity, and lower fuel consumption and CO 2 emissions. For example, the weight of trailer chassis made with SSAB's high-strength steels can be reduced by up to 30% compared to using lower-strength steel grades.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## CASE: FINNISH CRANE MANUFACTURER ACHIEVES BOTH WEIGHT AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAVINGS\n\nBesides providing substantial weight reductions in heavy industrial vehicles and equipment, Strenx also helps commercial vehicle manufacturers cut their products' weight. Finnish manufacturer Haulerman successfully used Strenx in a high strength-to-weight ratio of 700 MPa instead of a thicker, heavier grade of steel to lightweight the cranes it uses in its loading vans.\n\nA commercial van crane must be light so that it can carry as much load as possible. Still, it must be safe and meet all the standards for\n\nloading cranes. Haulerman can now o/ffer an innovative, versatile way to load goods, turning an ordinary commercial vehicle into a mobile crane that can load objects up to 300 kg (611 lbs.). Haulerman achieved an impressive 33% weight reduction in boom profiles.\n\n<!-- image -->",

With HYBRIT technology, SSAB aims to be the first steel company in the world to bring fossil-free steel to the market already in 2026. SSAB will be fossil free by 2045. Together with our partners and customers, SSAB aims to create a fossil-free value chain, from the mine to the end-product.\n\n## Why HYBRIT?\n\nThe steel industry is one of the highest CO 2 -emitting industries, accounting for 7% of CO 2 emissions globally. A growing global population, an increasingly higher standard of living and greater urbanization will trigger a rise in global steel demand. Recycled scrap will not su/fficiently meet the growing demand for new steel, and steel still needs to be produced also by using iron ore-based production. The carbon footprint in the steel industry is thus a challenge for Europe and the rest of the world. To align with a transition to a low-carbon economy, the steel industry will require a step-change in emissions reductions through alternative steelmaking processes.\n\nTherefore, in 2016, SSAB, LKAB (Europe's largest iron ore producer) and Vattenfall (one of Europe's largest energy companies) joined forces to create HYBRIT - an initiative that endeavors to revolutionize steelmaking. Using HYBRIT (Hydrogen Breakthrough Ironmaking Technology) technology, SSAB aims to replace coking coal, traditionally needed for ore-based steelmaking, with fossil-free electricity and\n\nhydrogen. The result will be the world's first fossilfree steelmaking technology, with virtually no carbon footprint.\n\nSSAB is already one of the world's most CO 2 -e/fficient steel companies. Yet, we want to do more. Sweden has unique conditions for this kind of project, with good access to fossil-free electricity, the highest-quality iron ore and a specialized, innovative steel industry. SSAB has also started to investigate the possibilities of broadening the initiative to include Finland.\n\nThe HYBRIT initiative will contribute to reaching the global climate goals under the Paris Agreement and the national climate goals in Sweden and Finland. SSAB shows leadership in contributing to the fulfilment of the Paris Agreement by having an approved Science Based Target.\n\nOur goal is to reduce Sweden's CO 2 emissions by 10% and Finland's by 7%. We believe that by taking the lead and showing that it is possible to decarbonize the steel industry, others will follow. The potential is enormous.\n\nHowever, to succeed, we need to collaborate with many parts of society. We need collaboration with universities and research institutes, we need rapid permit processes, access to large amounts of electricity, a regulatory framework that supports\n\nFossil-free steel produced with HYBRIT technology\n\n<!-- image -->\n\na future market for fossil-free products and we need financial support for the development and deployment of this breakthrough technology.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The pilot storage facility is expected to operate from 2022 to 2024.\n\nThe total cost committed to the initiative during the pilot phase is estimated to be SEK 2 billion. The Swedish Energy Agency has committed to contribute SEK 600 million and the three owners, SSAB, LKAB and Vattenfall, will contribute the remaining costs in equal shares.\n\n## Demonstration phase\n\nThe owners behind the HYBRIT initiative announced in 2020, that they will start e/fforts to prepare for the demonstration phase. The plan is to have a HYBRIT demonstration plant in place in 2025, at the same time as the conversion of SSAB's blast furnace site in Oxel\u00f6sund in Sweden. This will enable SSAB to produce iron ore-based, fossil-free steel for commercial use in 2026. There is a growing interest from customers to lower the CO 2 footprint in their value chain, which opens up great potential for fossil-free steel as a premium product. Consultations have begun for deciding on the location/site of the demonstration plant in Norrbotten, Sweden.\n\n## How is fossil-free steel produced?\n\n- \u00b7  Fossil-free steel is steel produced using HYBRIT technology using fossil-free hydrogen instead of coal and coke to reduce the oxygen in iron ore. This means the process will emit water instead of carbon dioxide.\n- \u00b7  Fossil-free steel is a premium product without a fossil CO 2 footprint. This means no fossil CO 2 emissions during production and that we use fossil-free sponge iron\n- \u00b7  Using fossil-free sponge iron as external input material, only internal scrap from fossilfree steel production, fossil-free electricity and no fossil fuels\n\nLEARN MORE ABOUT HYBRIT\n\n<!-- image -->",

Process safety is based on processes not causing a hazard to people or the environment at any stage. In addition, process safety protects employees and also includes protection of the environment, property and the surrounding community. A process that is as uninterrupted and well designed as possible reduces the risk of accident. At SSAB H\u00e4meenlinna, our goal is to prevent process safety accidents such as explosion, fire and emissions of toxic substances. Because the site involves process safety risks, it is very important that everyone working at the site knows what a state of emergency is and how to act in one.\n\n'For a few years now, we have been compiling all safety observations and near-miss\n\nincidents related to process safety at SSAB H\u00e4meenlinna to get an idea of the big picture.

SSAB also provides contractors with safety training sessions and discussion forums in order to increase their safety awareness. All contractor accidents are included in SSAB's safety statistics.\n\nThe safety of our products has been ensured by adhering closely to all legal requirements relevant to our products. If any non-compliance should arise, corrective actions would be defined and executed, and customers a/ffected by this non-conformity would be informed. No such cases occurred in 2020. SSAB also regularly informs customers regarding legislation like\n\nRoHS, REACH and Conflict Minerals, about SSAB's approach and actions to ensure compliance with the requirements. SSAB has also published Environmental Product Declarations for all its product categories with information about the chemical composition, lifecycle e/ffects and safe use of the products.\n\nSSAB's key performance indicator (KPI) for safety is lost time injury frequency (LTIF) and total recordable injury frequency (TRIF). All divisions have annual safety targets including both LTIF and TRIF, and report monthly on safety performance to the GEC.\n\nSSAB's lost time injury frequency resulting in an absence of more than one day (LTIF) in 2020 was 3.7 (4.2), with a total of 101 (126) injuries among SSAB's employees and contractors. SSAB's own employees' LTIF was 3.2 (4.0) and for contractors it was 6.1 (12.7). In 2020, a total of 73 (102) injuries (LTIs) were incurred by SSAB's employees and 28 (24) by contractors. Overall, the development in safety was positive, particularly in SSAB Special Steels and Ruukki Construction. SSAB Europe was experiencing challenges and therefore started a special program in order to improve the situation, with good results as the number of accidents decreased strongly during the last part of the year.\n\nThe most general types of accident at SSAB are injuries to fingers and eyes, and musculoskeletal injuries such as knee, ankle or back injuries. The commonest injuries sustained are wounds or other superficial injuries, sprains, strains, bone fractures or concussion.\n\n## Focus areas and key safety actions in 2020\n\nThe long-term work to improve safety continued throughout 2020 with many activities. In addition to continuous safety management procedures, the work includes the following:\n\n- \u00b7  New Group-level safety targets were defined and set as part of the new sustainability strategy\n- \u00b7  Preparation of a new two-week safety training program in SSAB Europe continued, but due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the program had to be postponed and several planned pilots were cancelled.

Therefore, SSAB focuses on continuous improvement to minimize emissions and improve productivity, as well as material and energy efficiency. SSAB is also working toward a fossil-free steelmaking process through the HYBRIT initiative, and by eliminating other fossil related emissions, with a goal to offering fossil-free steel in 2026 and fossil-free operations by 2045.\n\n## CO 2 e/fficient steel production\n\nAt SSAB, steelmaking processes have been continuously advanced and improved. As a result, SSAB's blast furnaces today are among the most e/fficient in the world in terms of minimizing emissions from steel production. Still, SSAB's operations account for 10% of Sweden's and 7% of Finland's CO2 emissions. In the US, our scrapbased EAF steel mills use close to 100% recycled steel as a raw material, thereby resulting in much lower direct CO2 emissions compared to blast furnace-based steel making.\n\n## Direct CO 2 emission reductions through further improvements in resource e/fficiency\n\nSteel production is resource intensive and generates carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions. In 2020, SSAB's total direct CO 2 emissions were 8,844 (9,582) thousand tonnes. Around 90% of SSAB's direct CO 2 emissions are generated by iron ore-based steel production at our sites in Lule\u00e5, Oxel\u00f6sund and Raahe, in particular our blast\n\nfurnaces. Approximately 98% of these emissions are related to metallurgical processes, i.e., to the use of coke and coal as reducing agents. In 2020, direct CO 2 emissions from Nordic steel production were 8,105 (8,873) thousand tonnes and emissions intensity (tonnes of CO 2 emissions/ tonne crude steel) was 1.64 (1.75). CO 2 emissions generated in Nordic steel production are within the scope of the European Emissions Trading System.\n\nOur iron ore-based steel production in the Nordics is among the most CO 2 e/fficient in the world owing to the use of high-grade iron-ore pellet and, high-quality coke, as well as e/fficient and uninterrupted processes. The possibilities to further reduce CO 2 emissions from current steelmaking processes are limited, but emissions can be controlled and to some extent further reduced by continuously striving to improve material and energy e/fficiency (read more on p. 76 and 78). SSAB's target was to achieve\n\na lasting reduction of 300,000 tonnes in CO 2 emissions (Scope 1) by the end of 2020, compared to the 2014 baseline. By the end of 2020, we achieved 310,000 tonnes or 103% of this target. We have taken several measures to reach the targeted reductions, such as the following:\n\n- \u00b7  Switching from heavy fuel oil to LNG in Borl\u00e4nge\n- \u00b7  Increasing yield within the production of prime slabs in Lule\u00e5. This is based on an overall better yield improvement of prime slab production, improved raw material utilization for prime productions\n\nIn 2020, direct CO 2 emissions from the scrapbased steel production in the US were 722 (697) thousand tonnes and emissions intensity (tonnes of CO 2 emissions/ tonne crude steel) was 0.68 (0.68).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Carbon dioxide emissions\n\nThousand tonnes\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDirect emissions from production (Scope 1)\n\n- Indirect emissions from the generation of purchased electricity and heat (Scope 2)\n\n<!-- image -->",

In this prefeasibility study, SSAB investigated the use of fossil-free energy sources, primarily biomaterial sidestreams, to replace fossil fuels in certain steelmaking processes, for example rolling processes. The prefeasibility study indicates that it would be possible to replace a significant amount of fossil fuel consumption with felling and other bio-based sidestream components at the Raahe mill. Ironmaking accounts for around 90% of SSAB's carbon dioxide emissions. The University of Oulu and VTT studied and modelled all energy flows at the mill as part of the prefeasibility study. The prefeasibility study was carried out by SSAB with Gasum, Neste and St1 and was supported by Business Finland. The energy companies were studying the use and availability of alternative energy sources. The Energy4HYBRIT prefeasibility study and the planned followup projects based on it will focus on the 10% of carbon dioxide emissions remaining after the reduction of iron ore, originating in numerous other steelmaking processes than ironmaking.\n\n## SSAB'S CLIMATE GOALS ARE APPROVED BY THE SCIENCE BASED TARGETS INITIATIVE\n\nThe approved science based target means that SSAB commits to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 35 % by 2032 (compared to 2018 and measured as CO 2 e). The target applies to both direct and indirect emissions (Scope 1 and 2) and is in line with the Paris Agreement and the objective of keeping global warming well below 2\u00b0C. We have set annual targets leading up to a 35% reduction. SSAB's overarching goal is to be fossil-free by 2045. Read more on p. 63.\n\n## About the Science Based Targets Initiative\n\nThe Science Based Targets initiative is an organization that encourages companies to set science-based goals that increase their competitiveness in the transition to a low-emission society. The organization is a collaboration between CDP, the UN Global Compact, World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLEADING SUSTAINABILITY PERFORMANCE\n\n## Indirect CO 2 emissions\n\nIndirect CO 2 emissions (Scope 2) from energy occur from the generation of purchased electricity and heat. In 2020, SSAB's indirect CO 2 emissions were 1,145 (1,173) thousand tonnes. Energy indirect CO 2 emissions from the scrap-based steel production in US are larger than the direct CO 2 emissions, because electricity is used to melt the scrap metal in the electric arc furnaces.\n\nSSAB's other indirect (Scope 3) CO 2 emissions in 2019 were an estimated 5.6 million tonnes (Scope 3 emissions are calculated every other reporting year, last measured in 2019). The majority of Scope 3 emissions are generated in the processing of sold products, which account for 40% of the total Scope 3 emissions. Of the other Scope 3 emissions, 38% are production of purchased raw materials and services, 7% are upstream emissions of purchased fuels and electricity (not included in Scope 1 and 2 emissions) and 9% are generated in the downstream transportation and distribution. The share of Scope 3 emissions of SSAB's total CO 2 emissions was 34 % in 2019.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The EU-ETS is the largest mandatory international system for trading greenhouse gas emission allowances, and a major element of the EU's e/fforts to combat global warming. The greenhouse gases emitted in SSAB's Nordic steel production are within the scope of the EU ETS, currently in the third trading period of 2013-2020. Compared to previous trading periods, both the cap on total annual emissions in the EU and the amount of free emission rights allocated to the industry are being gradually reduced. Due to the foreseen revision of the system, especially changes in the free allocation of emission allowances, and the fact that the market price for allowances could rise, there will be increasing costs for the steel industry due to the need to purchase additional emission allowances. SSAB is among the most e/fficient steel producers in Europe and also has a smaller deficit of emission rights than the industry average, hence the cost increase will be less pronounced.\n\nThe European Steel Association (EUROFER) has estimated that the European steel industry\n\nwill see an average shortfall of 26% in free allocations during the period 2021-2030. This shortfall is likely to increase to around 37% by 2030. Using the same calculation method and based on current technology, SSAB's estimated shortfall will average 24% during the period and is likely to increase to 27% by 2030. Currently, SSAB has some saved allowances and has started to purchase ETS allowances to ensure a proper balance.\n\nIn addition to the direct costs, the steel industry is impacted by the indirect carbon costs passed on in electricity prices. The Finnish government has declared their willingness to compensate energy intensive industry for higher electricity costs by 37.5% in 2019 and 2020. No such statement has been made by the Swedish government.\n\n## Physical risks caused by climate change\n\nSSAB's operations are, to some extent, exposed to physical risks caused by climate change, and these risks are part of the risk matrix, however currently not with high likelihood nor high financial impact on SSAB as a company on a short-medium perspective. Physical risks caused by climate change include rising temperatures, rising sea levels and increased severity of extreme weather events, such as hurricanes and flooding, especially near our American mills where plans for mitigating impact of hurricanes are reviewed regularly. For example, higher temperatures of\n\nincoming water in rolling processes can lead to increased energy consumption due to the higher cooling water flow needed to obtain the same cooling capacity. Extreme weather can cause problems with transportation by rail or sea, which could lead to reduced revenue from decreased production and supply chain interruptions. Rising sea levels could cause instability in the foundations of buildings and facilities at sites that are directly connected to the sea, leading to increased capital expenditure.\n\nLEADING SUSTAINABILITY PERFORMANCE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn addition to climate change mitigation actions, we also aim to better adapt our operations to the changing climate and weather conditions, taking the physical climate change risks into consideration in new investments, process development and supply chain and production planning.\n\n## Other emissions to air\n\nIn addition to CO 2 , the most emissions generated are particulate matter (PM), sulfur oxides (SOx) and nitrogen oxides (NOx).

We recirculate much of the material generated from our production back into our own processes, thereby reducing the need for virgin raw materials, CO 2 emissions and waste. The use of recycled steel in the production of new steel has a big impact on lowering the environmental footprint of the product's lifecycle.\n\n## Materials used in steelmaking\n\nThe key raw materials needed in steelmaking include iron ore, coal, limestone, alloys and scrap steel. Iron ore and coal are the main raw materials required for SSAB's steel production operations in Sweden and Finland. Scrap metal is the most important raw material for SSAB's steel production operations in the US. In 2020, SSAB used a total of 14.1 (14.6) million tonnes of raw materials.\n\n## Maximizing the recirculation of materials\n\nThe production of iron and steel gives rise to a range of residuals (e.g. slag, sludge and dust). Recirculating materials back into the steelmaking process reduces the need for virgin raw materials. This in turn reduces CO 2 emissions and waste.

For example, blast furnace slag is used to replace cement, enabling the cement industry to significantly reduce their CO 2 emissions. In 2020, 3.6 (3.3) million tonnes of residuals from the iron ore-based steel production were utilized, internally or externally. This is about 92% (90%) of all residuals produced in the iron ore-based production. In 2020, 1.4 (1.3) million tonnes of byproducts were sold externally.\n\nOne of SSAB's environmental targets was to achieve a lasting improvement in residual\n\nutilization by 50,000 tonnes, reducing the amount of material being sent to a landfill by the end of 2020, compared to the 2014 baseline. By the end of 2020, SSAB achieved 62,000 tonnes or 124% of this target. Examples of measures taken to reach the target are the following:\n\n- \u00b7  Utilization of blast furnace sludge and basic oxygen steelmaking (BOF) sludge in briquettes for use as a raw material instead of being landfilled in Lule\u00e5\n- \u00b7  Utilization of ladle slag in the blast furnaces in the Nordics\n\n## Residuals from steel production, waste included\n\n| Thousand tonnes                             | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   | 2017   | 2016   |\n|---------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Residuals from ore-based steel production   |        |        |        |        |        |\n| Residuals, total                            | 3,897  | 3,648  | 3,659  | 4,054  | 4,045  |\n| Utilized internally or externally           | 3,578  | 3,300  | 3,271  | 3,836  | 3,648  |\n| Residuals from scrap-based steel production |        |        |        |        |        |\n| Residuals, total                            | 762    | 719    | 696    | 756    | 718    |\n| Utilized internally or externally           | 685    | 644    | 626    | 689    | 659    |\n\n## 306-2: Total weight of waste by type\n\n| Thousand tonnes              |   2020 |   2019 |   2018 |   2017 |   2016 |\n|------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Industrial waste to landfill |    331 |    366 |    356 |    441 |    399 |\n| Hazardous waste              |     51 |     52 |     53 |     50 |     48 |\n| Non-hazardous waste          |     63 |     69 |     66 |     70 |     54 |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n92%\n\n1.4\n\nof all residuals from iron-based production utilized\n\nmillion tonnes of by-products sold\n\nLEADING SUSTAINABILITY PERFORMANCE\n\n## Scrap used in steel production\n\nRecycled steel replaces the iron ore as input material in iron and steel-making increasing material e/fficiency and reducing CO 2 emissions. In 2020, SSAB used 2.8 (2.7) million tonnes of external scrap and 0.9 (0.9) million tonnes of internally recycled scrap, which equals an average of 46% of recycled steel used in all of SSAB's steel production. SSAB uses approximately 20% of scrap metal in conjunction with steel production in the Nordics, and nearly 100% in the US.\n\n## Minimizing waste\n\nSSAB focuses on reducing the volume of material sent to landfills. The key to waste reduction is the recirculation of materials described earlier. However, there are waste products from the production processes for which there is currently no environmentally or economically justifiable application and which therefore need to be removed from the processing cycle. Waste that originates from SSAB's operations and requires either being sent to la andfill or to an external waste recipient is processed in compliance with valid regulations. Focus is on hazardous waste, such as oily waste, including used oil, grease, sludge and emulsions, which are often disposed of through combustion. The management and monitoring of the company's landfill sites are strictly regulated by applicable laws and governmental authorities.\n\n<!-- image -->",

By the end of 2020, we achieved approximately 483 GWh or 121% of this target. During the target period, we have taken several measures to reach the targeted savings, such as the following:\n\n- \u00b7  A new, more e/fficient blast machine for the blast furnace in Lule\u00e5 reduces electricity consumption\n- \u00b7  Optimized media systems for compressed air and hydraulics, as well as furnace control systems at several SSAB sites\n- \u00b7  Oxygen lancing in a reheating furnace in Borl\u00e4nge\n\n- \u00b7  Replacement of old lighting fixtures with LED technology in Oxel\u00f6sund, Lule\u00e5, Borl\u00e4nge, Mobile and Montpelier\n- \u00b7  A new power plant with higher e/fficiency in Raahe\n\nIn 2020, SSAB's total energy consumption (including electricity, purchased fuels and purchased heat) was 9,083 (9,088) GWh and SSAB's energy intensity was 1,203 (1,188) kWh/ tonne crude steel (including electricity and purchased fuels). In 2020, SSAB's crude steel production was 7,535 (7,623) thousand tonnes. Also production stability impacts the e/fficiency of energy usage.\n\n## Energy sources - our long-term aim is to switch to fossil-free energy\n\nThe main fuels used at SSAB's production sites are process gases, natural gas, propane and, for the time being, heavy fuel oil. Process gases from SSAB's coke oven plants and blast furnaces are used primarily to replace external fuels in\n\n<!-- image -->\n\novens and secondarily to produce electricity in power plants.

Currently, SSAB does not consume renewable fuels in production processes, but as part of our long-term goal to become fossil-free in our operations by 2045, one important goal is to eliminate fuel-related emissions. This will be achieved through the electrification of processes and increased use of biofuels.\n\nToday, electricity is our largest energy source, accounting for ~50% of the total energy consumption.

The purpose of the policy is to ensure that SSAB collaborates with suppliers who share our sustainability values. The Supplier Sustainability Policy applies to all suppliers providing products and/or services to any SSAB Group company and includes requirements on labor and human rights, health and safety, anticorruption and the environment. Regarding the policy, SSAB also reserves the right to conduct reviews of our direct suppliers or onsite audits to ensure compliance with the policy. All new or updated contracts from 2017 and onward refer to the Supplier Sustainability Policy or similar, and the same reference is included in our purchase orders, for all main SSAB sites.\n\nFOLLOW-UP AND CORRECTIVE ACTIONS\n\nRISK ASSESSMENT\n\nSELF-ASSESSMENT\n\nLEADING SUSTAINABILITY PERFORMANCE\n\n## SSAB follows its suppliers' sustainability compliance through a systematic process\n\nSUSTAINABILITY CLAUSE IN CONTRACTS\n\nANNUAL SUSTAINABILITY AUDIT PLAN\n\nSITE VISITS/AUDITS\n\n<!-- image -->",

For sustainability assessments, we use Verisk Maplecroft's risk indices for human rights, political and environmental risks per specific region. Corruption assessments are based on Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions index.\n\nSuppliers identified as medium- or high-risk suppliers must complete a self-assessment questionnaire containing questions about governance, social conditions and environmental performance. SSAB investigates and follows up on identified areas of non-compliance. In 2020, 96% (93%) of SSAB's total spend was sustainability assessed (classified/identified in terms of sustainability risks and self-assessment done) and 93% of new suppliers were screened using social criteria.\n\n## Site visits and audits\n\nThe year 2020 was characterized by restrictions in traveling and possibilities to perform onsite visits due to Covid-19. This meant that a majority of the 2020 onsite visits and audits were performed remotely.\n\nIn 2020, SSAB conducted 16 onsite visits and 3 extensive audits to suppliers related to sustainability matters. Evaluation is based on SSAB's Sustainable Supplier Policy and conducted by a procurement commodity manager, an internal SSAB auditor or a thirdparty auditor. Suppliers selected for onsite visits and third-party audits are identified in the annual audit plan, and based on a number\n\nof criteria, including a pre-evaluation of the supplier's social and environmental risk profile, taking into consideration geographical location, product category and spend volume.\n\nThis year's onsite visits were conducted at suppliers located in Europe and North America covering di/fferent categories including raw materials, maintenance and production related material. The main improvement areas identified were linked to work environment and safety.\n\nSSAB also conducted three third-party sustainability audits during the year - one in Kazakhstan, one in Ukraine and a follow-up audit in Brazil. SSAB works with a leading audit company to conduct the audits. The audits revealed non-conformances primarily related to safety, work environment and governance. SSAB follows up with the respective suppliers regarding these observations. In the follow-up audit in Brazil, most of the earlier deviations could be closed.\n\n## Monitoring raw material traders\n\nSSAB also sources alloys, coal and refractories through agents and traders. SSAB requires these suppliers to monitor their sources for sustainability commitment and we have an adapted assessment process by which these suppliers must declare how they monitor social and environmental compliance in their supply chain.\n\n## HSEQ cluster for joint evaluations of contractors\n\nSSAB is member of an HSEQ (health, safety, environment and quality) cluster for common\n\n## Risk based approach\n\nLOW RISK\n\nMID LEVEL RISK\n\nHIGH RISK\n\n- \u00b7  Sustainability clause in contracts*\n- \u00b7  Sustainability clause in contracts*\n- \u00b7  Self-assessment questionnaire\n- \u00b7  Sustainability clause in contracts*\n- \u00b7  Self-assessment questionnaire\n- \u00b7   Site visit and third party sustainability audits (selected in annual audit plan, risk-based approach)\n- * Refers to SSABs Supplier Sustainability Policy\n\nevaluations of contractors. Several of SSAB's contractors working on SSAB's sites are audited annually by a third party through this cluster. In 2020, 5 HSEQ evaluations of contractors were conducted in Sweden and Finland. Also, this is an activity that Covid-19 has restricted.\n\n## Actions against modern slavery\n\nSSAB supports and respects internationally proclaimed human rights and has taken a variety of actions to verify the absence of child labor, forced labor, slavery and human tra/fficking in our supply chain. These actions include sustainability principles for our suppliers, sustainability risk\n\nassessments, onsite visits and audits and training of our employees.\n\n## No conflict minerals in SSAB's steel\n\n'Conflict minerals' is a term used for minerals derived from conflict-ridden regions or countries where the mining of certain minerals risks contributing to, or financing, continued conflict and violation of human rights. SSAB does not use conflict minerals (including gold, tin, tungsten and tantalum) and, upon request, provides customers with a certificate a/ffirming this\n\n<!-- image -->",

Training is based on SSAB's values and governing documents, and teaches participants what is meant by corruption and bribery, and how SSAB's ethics and compliance program is structured. This is followed by a discussion focused on practical, real-life examples and dilemma discussions. Training requirements are continuously monitored and evaluated based on business needs and the legal and ethical risk context. During 2020, several training sessions were held for Ruukki Construction's management and sales teams.\n\n## Review of integrity of business partners\n\nSSAB has an instruction document for business ethics reviews that mainly covers agents and distributors in high-risk areas.

The program aims to highlight and develop female engineers in the workforce in the belief that gender equality in the workplace contributes to a variety of relevant competences and inclusion in the workplaces. This year, the winner of Female Leader Engineer 2017 Cecilia Svennberg chose to take her traineeship at SSAB. After this, she was hired by SSAB's joint-venture company Hybrit Development. For SSAB, the Female Leader Engineer program is one of the diversity and talent acquisition initiatives that the company runs in di/fferent geographies to ensure continued success in recruiting diverse and skilled top talents to work with steel, now and in the future. Cecilia's choice to take the traineeship at SSAB also illustrates the growing interest among young professionals to be part of the implementation of SSAB's fossil-free steel agenda.\n\nLEADING SUSTAINABILITY PERFORMANCE\n\n13,974\n\n29%\n\n6.2\n\npermanent employees in more than 50 countries\n\nshare of women of top management positions\n\nemployee turnover in 2020\n\n(Finland) and the Association of Women in the Metal Industries (USA).

Employee turnover in 2020 was 6.2% (6.1%).\n\n## Diversity, inclusion and gender equality\n\nSSAB is diverse in many ways: we operate in more than 50 countries and the combination of di/fferent backgrounds, service years and ages ensures diverse capabilities. For SSAB, diversity means not only building a diverse workforce with a relevant competence base, but also creating an inclusive workplace. Inclusion, meaning equal opportunities and respectful treatment of all employees, is a ground rule for every part of SSAB's organization.\n\nDiversity is taken into account in all human resources processes and in every aspect of\n\n94%\n\nof white-collar employees conducted performance dialogs\n\nour business. We have zero tolerance for any kind of discrimination, whether it is based on ethnic origin, nationality, religion, political views, gender, sexual orientation or age. SSAB is taking numerous actions to enhance diversity, with most initiatives driven at the local level. For example, in recruitment, some divisions have developed processes related to ensuring diverse sets of candidates. Some sites have chosen to work with specific diversity projects, such as a 50-50 gender ratio among summer workers, or working with the local institutions to provide internships for immigrants.\n\nSSAB is aiming to increase the number of women in top management positions. At the end of 2020, women held 29% (27%) of SSAB's top management positions.

The talent pool is based on nominations by division and functional leaders.\n\nAnnual performance dialogs are the key process for ensuring that competence development plans are in place, setting performance goals, providing a basis for continuous performance feedback and for cascading the group level strategic targets down to divisional, team and individual targets. For o/ffice workers, the annual rate of performance dialogs conducted in 2020 was 94% (95%).\n\nTo support engagement and talent retention, the company has a pay-for-performance compensation approach, which means that compensation is to a certain extend, based on job requirements and employee performance. The di/fferent compensation and benefits programs are reviewed as needed.\n\n## Supporting local activities in Sweden and Finland\n\nIn the communities in which SSAB operates in Sweden and Finland, we contribute to creating a wide range of recreational activities in which SSAB's employees, their families and also the local community can participate.

SSAB also supports associations in which employees are involved, primarily within sports and culture.\n\n## Strong community involvement in SSAB Americas\n\nSSAB Americas has a long tradition of community involvement. This takes place not only in the form of financial contributions, but also through participation in various charity initiatives and projects. SSAB is an important partner for local educational institutions and research. SSAB Americas sponsors an annual scholarship at the University of South Alabama, which benefits fulltime junior and senior students in the University's College of Engineering. SSAB Americas also supports primary education through the SSAB Foundation for Education. Employees also participate in numerous activities throughout the year to benefit their communities, including food drives, fundraising events and volunteer opportunities.\n\n## Community: Be a responsible partner and enhance our reputation as a company and employer\n\nIn locations where SSAB operates, the company plays a significant role in the local and regional community as an employer, taxpayer, buyer of regional goods and services, and charitable benefactor. Contributing to the communities in which we operate is an integral part of the way we do business.\n\n## Active engagement in local communities\n\nSSAB strives to develop and maintain good relationships with various stakeholders in our society and actively engages with the communities in which we operate. Local community engagement is defined by each site at the local level. SSAB is also an important partner for local educational institutions and research. We o/ffer opportunities for internships and thesis projects to college students. SSAB also works with local environmental regulators on site-specific issues. In addition to ongoing collaboration with local authorities, SSAB works together with cities and associations to monitor environmental conditions such as air quality and waterways. Every year, SSAB hosts important visitors from the community, such as students, customers, subcontractors, government o/fficials, inspectors and regulators.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We have zero tolerance for forced or compulsory labor and child labor. We focus on providing a safe work environment where employees are free from harassment and discrimination\n\nAll SSAB's employees in Sweden and Finland are covered by collective bargaining agreements and approximately 70% of our employees in Sweden and Finland are represented by trade unions.\n\nOther countries have di/fferent arrangements according to country-specific practices, traditions and labor legislation. SSAB respects employee rights to, if they so choose, organize in accordance with the legislation and provisions in each respective country of residence. SSAB provides channels for employees to engage in the company's activities and express their opinions. Local management in each country is responsible for creating opportunities for employee engagement. The company also encourages direct interaction between supervisors and their teams.\n\nThe unions at SSAB in Europe have a European Works Council (EWC). The purpose of an EWC is to bring together employee representatives\n\nfrom the di/fferent European countries in which a multinational company has operations. During EWC meetings, these representatives are informed and consulted by central management on transnational issues of concern to the company's employees.\n\nTo mitigate human rights risks, we continuously work to ensure compliance with local law and international standards on human rights. We have conducted a human rights risk assessment where representatives from sales, procurement, health and safety, environment and HR participated. External human rights expertise facilitated two internal workshops to raise awareness of human rights and identify key human rights risks and mitigation actions for the involved functions and their processes. The overall conclusion is that SSAB performs well.\n\nHuman rights are important aspects when evaluating suppliers. Read more on p. 81.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Sustainability, including climate issues, is an integral part of SSAB's strategy. The Board of Directors has the highest decision-making authority in these matters. SSAB's Board of Directors is collectively responsible for strategically managing climate issues and SSAB's transformation to fossil-free company.\n\n## Organization of sustainability work\n\nSSAB's Board of Directors approves the Code of Conduct, as well as the sustainability strategy and monitors SSAB's sustainability performance, including climate-related issues. The Board of Directors approves Group performance targets, including sustainability and climate-related targets. SSAB's Group Executive Committee (GEC) is responsible for outlining the company's strategic approach to sustainability, including adopting material topics, and monitors how sustainability is implemented in the divisions, subsidiaries and support functions. Sustainability issues are frequently on SSAB's Group Executive Committee's agenda to ensure the close involvement of top management.\n\nThe Head of Sustainability is a member of the Group Executive Committee and is responsible for strategy development and coordination of sustainability at Group level as well as health and\n\nsafety and ethics and compliance for the Group. The Head of Sustainability leads a Sustainability management team, which is a network of people with expertise in di/fferent sustainability areas, including representation from the divisions and subsidiaries, with the responsibility to coordinate and drive SSAB's sustainability initiatives.\n\nIn the Group Executive Committee, there are several executives responsible for implementing di/fferent parts of SSAB's fossil-free transition. For example, the Executive Vice President (EVP) and Head of Technical Development manages the HYBRIT implementation and also has a seat on the Board of HYBRIT Development AB, a joint venture aiming for fossil-free steelmaking. The EVP and Head of Sustainability manages operational initiatives towards SSAB becoming fossil free, the EVP and Head of Strategy manages SSAB's Risk Enterprise Management process, which includes climate risks, and the EVP\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

In issues related to responsible sourcing, there is a procurement council, whose mission is to enhance global procurement processes and projects, and to collaborate on sustainability and continue our strong focus on responsible sourcing. In 2019, a health and safety council was established with representatives from the business, with the responsibility to coordinate, cooperate and propose policy and strategy initiatives and changes to the GEC.\n\nSSAB links sustainability issues to compensation. For example, internal safety and SSAB's transition to becoming fossil-free are part of incentive plans for selected employee groups and top management. Individual performance targets might also include targets for emissions reductions or other sustainability related topics for selected employee groups.\n\nAt SSAB, risk management is integrated in the annual strategy process and includes the involvement of the Group Executive Committee,\n\nthe Audit Committee and the Board of Directors. Sustainability risks, including climate change risks, are integrated into our Risk Enterprise Management process, which is presented to the Board annually. Read more on p. 149 in Financial Reports 2020. The management approaches of the material sustainability topics are described on p. 102-109.\n\n## Governing documents and principles for sustainability\n\nThe SSAB Way and company's core values define who we are and how we should act. The Code of Conduct, the sustainability strategy and the governing documents at Group-level regarding sustainability (e.g. environment and safety), are our most important documents. There are also local governing documents to further elaborate on internal rules. All these documents are regularly reviewed and updated. Our sustainability governing documents are available on ssab.com.\n\n## Management systems and risk management\n\nManagement systems and action plans ensure that SSAB systematically works on critical aspects of sustainability. Several di/fferent management systems and tools, both developed in-house and third-party certified, are used to e/ffectively control operations in accordance with SSAB's Code of Conduct and governing\n\ndocuments. Safety management systems for systematic health and safety work, according to OHSAS 18001 or ISO 45001:2018 (which will replace OHSAS in 2021), have been implemented at all production sites. Environmental and climate work take place primarily within the scope of the ISO 14001 environmental management standard and via local energy management systems.\n\n## Global Compact\n\nSSAB is a signatory to the UN Global Compact and we continually enhance our e/fforts to protect and respect its 10 principles, and promote its spirit within the areas of human rights, labor standards, the environment and anti-corruption. SSAB also supports the International Bill of Human Rights, ILO Core Conventions, the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n97",

Material topics were identified and prioritized in a process that involved external and internal stakeholders. The GRI principles - stakeholder inclusiveness, sustainability context, materiality and completeness - were taken into consideration throughout the process.\n\nAs a first step, SSAB conducted a background analysis to identify industry trends and global drivers. This analysis, as well as SSAB's previous materiality analysis (2014) and existing SSAB's sustainability strategy, served as a basis to identify relevant topics throughout SSAB's value chain.\n\nAs a second step, the topics identified in the background analysis were evaluated and ranked according to importance from the perspectives of both SSAB and external stakeholders. This was done through interviews with external stakeholders (customers, suppliers, investors, NGOs and industry associations) and an online survey with key external and internal stakeholders to further prioritize the topics. The results of the dialog with internal and external stakeholders were evaluated in workshops with\n\ninternal experts, and confirmed by SSAB's Group Executive Committee.\n\nThe material topics included in SSAB's 2020 reporting are based on this materiality analysis. The list of material topics, their boundaries, as well as management approaches are presented in the tables on the following pages. For a full list of reported GRI indicators see also GRI index on p. 110.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

With the current technology, it is impossible to produce steel without generating CO 2  emissions.   The process, has been continually developed and improved to become highly e/fficient, and the residual energy is recovered in the form of district heating and electricity production. SSAB's blast   furnace-based production is among the most CO 2  e/fficient in the world. This gives a competitive advantage to SSAB and its customers. Scrap-based steel production at SSAB's US mills emits significantly  less CO 2 . Since there is not enough scrap available to meet the demand for steel, ore-based steel production using blast furnaces is still needed. Today, scrap-based steel production meets 25% of   the global demand for steel. |\n| GRI material topics                             | GRI 305: Emissions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| SDG                                             | 7, 9, 12, 13 and 17                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| Reported GRI indicators                         | 305-1: Direct (Scope 1) GHG emissions, 305-2: Energy indirect (Scope 2) GHG emissions, 305-3: Other indirect (Scope 3) GHG emissions, 305-4: GHG emissions intensity, 305-5: Reduction of GHG  emissions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| SDG                                             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| Policies, management systems                    | Group's governing documents regarding environment establish the most important ambitions for SSAB's environmental work and cover those environmental topics, which play a key role in the sustainable  development of SSAB's business.

To align with a transition to a low-carbon economy, the steel industry will require a step-change in emissions reductions through alternative steelmaking processes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| How the topic is managed                        | SSAB's overall goal is to become fossil free by 2045. Our ambition is to be the first to o/ffer the market fossil-free steel as early as 2026, and over time to convert all production sites to become fossil  free. This transformation will be done through HYBRIT (Hydrogen Breakthrough Ironmaking Technology), a joint venture between SSAB, LKAB, and Vattenfall. We see HYBRIT and our transformation as  an opportunity to revolutionize steel production throughout the lifecycle - from steelmaking, to end use and 100% recyclability. By cooperating with LKAB, our iron ore pellets supplier, and Vattenfall our  electricity supplier, we also ensure a value chain perspective.                                                                                                                                            |\n| GRI material topics                             | GRI 305: Emissions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| SDG                                             | 7, 9, 12, 13 and 17                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| Reported GRI indicators                         | 305-1: Direct (Scope 1) GHG emissions, 305-2: Energy indirect (Scope 2) GHG emissions, 305-3: Other indirect (Scope 3) GHG emissions, 305-4: GHG emissions intensity, 305-5: Reduction of GHG  emissions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Goals and targets                               | SSAB is working toward a fossil-free steelmaking process through the HYBRIT initiative and by eliminating other fossil related emissions, with a goal to o/ffering fossil-free steel  in 2026 and fossil-free operations by 2045.

Recirculating ferrous material back into the steelmaking process reduces the need for virgin raw materials. This, in turn, reduces CO 2  emissions  and saves costs. Materials that cannot be recirculated internally can be processed and sold externally to create new revenue streams while reducing CO 2  emissions by substituting natural resources in other  industries. For example, the use of blast furnace slag enables the cement industry to significantly reduce their CO 2  emissions. Increasing internal recirculation of residuals and external sales of by-products  will lead to reduced waste and less material being sent to a landfill. A critical element in reducing carbon emissions originating in the steel lifecycle is to optimize steel recycling. Steel is unique in its capacity  to be infinitely recycled without loss of properties or performance. Steel is the most recycled material in the world today. |\n|                                                 | Energy e/fficiency is aimed at reducing the amount of energy required to produce products and provide services. Steel companies can reduce costs by finding alternative energy sources that create less  emissions, by using less purchased energy and by feeding surplus energy into the grid. From a lifecycle perspective, this also creates positive e/ffects and saves natural resources, thereby reducing CO 2 emissions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| How the topic is managed                        | SSAB works to optimize the value of its by-products, scrap and waste with a focus on sustainability and value creation. SSAB's recycling operations cover the entire value chain from R&D and production to  marketing and sales. The operations consist primarily of recirculation of materials to SSAB's own production, processing and selling products externally and managing waste that cannot be recirculated or  processed into new products in a sustainable way. This includes the handling of materials sent to a landfill in the Nordics. SSAB delivers by-products globally.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n|                                                 | Energy e/fficiency is improved through systematic energy management and energy recovery. To improve energy e/fficiency, energy flows are recycled in the production process. Process gases like blast  furnace gas, coke oven gas and converter gas are generated in the iron- and steelmaking processes. Steam and hot water are also produced. These energy flows can be fully recovered to generate  electricity and heat, thereby saving fuel resources and decreasing CO 2  emissions.

The scope of the Sustainability Report has been defined on p. 110-113. The Statutory Sustainability Report is defined on p. 113.\n\n## Responsibilities of the Board and Executive Management\n\nThe Board of Directors and Executive Management are responsible for the preparation of the Sustainability Report including the Statutory Sustainability Report in accordance with applicable criteria and the Annual Accounts Act respectively. The criteria are defined on page 95 in the Sustainability Report and are part of the Sustainability Reporting Guidelines published by GRI (The Global Reporting Initiative) that are applicable to the Sustainability Report, as well as the accounting and calculation principles that the Company has developed. This responsibility includes the internal control relevant to the preparation of a Sustainability Report that is free from material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error.\n\n## Responsibilities of the auditor\n\nOur responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Sustainability Report based on our limited assurance procedures and to express an opinion regarding the Statutory Sustainability Report. Our engagement is limited to historical information presented in this document and does therefore not include future oriented information.\n\nWe have conducted our engagement in accordance with ISAE 3000 Assurance engagements other than audits or reviews of historical financial information. A limited assurance engagement consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for the preparation of the Sustainability Report, and applying analytical and other limited assurance procedures. Our examination regarding the Statutory Sustainability Report has been conducted in accordance with FAR's accounting standard RevR 12 The auditor's opinion regarding the statutory sustainability report. A limited assurance engagement and an examination according to RevR 12 are di/fferent from and substantially less in scope than reasonable assurance conducted in accordance with IAASB's Standards on Auditing and other generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden.\n\nThe firm applies ISQC 1 (International Standard on Quality Control) and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. We are independent of SSAB AB (publ) in accordance with professional ethics for accountants in Sweden and have otherwise fulfilled our ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\n\nThe procedures performed in a limited review and an examination according to RevR 12 do not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in a reasonable assurance engagement. The conclusion based on limited assurance procedures and an examination according to RevR 12 does not provide the same level of assurance as a conclusion based on reasonable assurance.\n\nOur procedures are based on the criteria defined by the Board of Directors and the Executive Management as described above. We consider these criteria suitable for the preparation of the Sustainability Report.\n\nWe believe that the evidence we have obtained is su/fficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our conclusion below.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nBased on the limited assurance procedures we have performed, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Sustainability Report is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the criteria defined by the Board of Directors and Executive Management.\n\nA Statutory Sustainability Report has been prepared.\n\nStockholm, 1 March 2021\n\nErnst & Young AB\n\n## Rickard Andersson\n\nOuti Alestalo\n\nAuthorized Public Accountant\n\nExpert member of FAR\n\n<!-- image -->",

For the same reason the company's CEO was attending by phone. The principal auditor was present at the meeting. The minutes of the Annual General Meeting may be viewed at www.ssab.com.\n\n## Nomination committee\n\n## Duties of the Nomination Committee\n\nThe duties of the Nomination Committee include proposing to the Annual General Meeting a chairman of the Board of Directors, directors, auditors, a Chairman of the Annual General Meeting, Board fees and auditor fees.\n\n## Procedure for the appointment of the Nomination Committee\n\nThe 2012 Annual General Meeting adopted a procedure regarding the appointment of the Nomination Committee. The procedure applies until amended through a resolution adopted at a future Annual General Meeting. The procedure was adopted with some minor adjustments by the Annual General Meeting held on April 10, 2018. According to the procedure, the Chairman of the Board is tasked with requesting that no fewer than three and no more than five of the largest shareholders in terms of votes each appoint a member to constitute the Nomination Committee together with the Chairman of the Board.\n\nAt the 2020 Annual General Meeting, a new instruction was adopted for the Nomination Committee. The changes compared with the previous version mainly relate to how any conflicts of interest in the Nomination Committee are to be handled, and how the Nomination Committee is to act when a shareholder who has appointed a member has sold parts of his holding of SSAB shares and no longer constitutes one of the major shareholders.\n\nThere may be no more than six members in total. The member representing the largest shareholder in terms of votes shall be Chairman of the Nomination Committee. The composition of the Nomination Committee was announced on www.ssab.com on August 20, 2020. Shareholders were able to submit proposals to the Nomination Committee by, for example, email, until December 31, 2020. The Nomination Committee's proposals will be published no later than in conjunction with the notice of the Annual General Meeting.\n\nIn connection with the issuance of the notice of the Annual General Meeting, the Nomination Committee will publish a reasoned statement regarding its proposal for a Board on www.ssab.com.\n\n## Nomination committee ahead of the 2021 Annual General Meeting\n\n| Appointed by, name                                                     | Share (%) of votes at   31 december 2020   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| Lars Pettersson, Industriv\u00e4rden (Chairman of the Nomination Committee) | 11.8                                       |\n| Pierre Heeroma, LKAB                                                   | 10.5                                       |\n| Petter S\u00f6derstr\u00f6m, Solidium Oy                                         | 9.8                                        |\n| Charlotta Fax\u00e9n, Lannebo Funds                                         | 2.5                                        |\n| Bengt Kjell (Chairman of the Board of Directors)                       | -                                          |\n\n## Work of the Nomination Committee ahead of the 2021 Annual General Meeting\n\nThe Nomination Committee has convened three times in 2020 since it was appointed in August 2020. Additional meetings are planned before the Annual General Meeting.\n\nThe Board's evaluation process and the outcome of the evaluation was presented at the Nomination Committee's meeting in October. Further, the outcome of the evaluation of the Chairman of the Board was presented for the Nomination Committee.The Nomination Committee has discussed the composition of the Board, and agreed on the fundamental Board member requirements, including the requirements on independent members. The Nomination Committee particularly took into account in its Board proposal, the need for diversity and breadth, and the requirements to strive for gender balance on the Board.\n\nThe Nomination Committee engages in continuous work in identifying and evaluating potential new directors. In submitting proposals for fees to the Board of Directors and its committees, the Nomination Committee, among other things, conducted an overview of Board fees in similar companies. Prior to the election of an auditor at the Annual General Meeting 2021, the Audit Committee has conducted an evaluation of the audit performance presented to the Nomination Committee on its December meeting. At the same meeting, the committee's recommendation regarding both election of auditors and fees was presented. The Nomination Committee followed the Audit Committee's recommendation when presenting its proposals to the 2021 Annual General Meeting.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Board must regularly assess the group's financial position and evaluate the operative management. The Board decides, among other things, on matters concerning the group's strategic focus and organization, and decides on important capital expenditure (exceeding SEK 100 million).\n\nWhen applicable, the Board prepares proposals for guidelines regarding the determination of salary and other remuneration to the CEO and other members of the company's senior management for decision at the Annual General Meeting.\n\n## Rules of procedure of the Board\n\nEach year, the Board adopts the rules of procedure, including instructions to the CEO, which, among other things, govern the allocation of work between the Board and the CEO.\n\nThe rules of procedure further regulate the frequency of Board meetings and the allocation of work among the Board's committees. The rules of procedure state that there must be a Remuneration Committee and an Audit Committee. Ahead of each Board meeting, the directors receive a written agenda and full documentation to serve as the basis for decisions. Each Board meeting conducts a review of the group's accident statistics, the current state of the business, the group's results, financial position and prospects. Other issues addressed include competition and the market situation. The Board also regularly monitors health and safety work.\n\n## Chairman of the Board\n\nThe chairman of the Board of Directors presides over the Board's work, represents the company on ownership issues and is responsible for the evaluation of the work of the Board. In addition, the Chairman of the Board of Directors is responsible for regular contact with the CEO and for ensuring that the Board of Directors performs its duties.\n\n## Composition of the Board\n\nUnder the Articles of Association, the Board of Directors consists of a minimum of five and a maximum of ten members elected by the general meeting. The Board is quorate when more than half of the total number of directors is present. Taking into consideration the company's operations, phase of development and circumstances in general, the Board must have an appropriate composition which is characterized by diversity and breadth as regards the competence, experience and background of its members. New directors undergo an introduction course to rapidly acquire the knowledge expected in order to best promote the interests of the company and its shareholders.\n\n## The Board of Directors' diversity policy\n\nSSAB works actively to further diversity within the company. As a part of this work, the company, through the Nomination Committee, applies rule 4.1 in the Swedish Corporate Governance Code (the Corporate Code) as its diversity policy. In accordance with rule 4.1 in the Corporate Code, the Board is to have a composition appropriate\n\nGROUP EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE\n\nto the company's operations, phase of development and other relevant circumstances. The Board members elected by the shareholders' meeting are collectively to exhibit diversity and breadth of qualifications, experience and background. The company is also to strive for gender balance on the Board.\n\nThe Nomination Committee shall consider the diversity policy when preparing its proposals for the election of a Board member. In addition, the Board of Directors continuously discusses the question regarding diversity within the organization. The objective of the diversity policy is to cater the importance of su/fficient diversity within the Board in order to encourage independent opinions and a critical approach which will contribute to e/fficient Board work in the company.\n\nDuring the financial year 2020, the Board of Directors' diversity policy has mainly been implemented and applied in connection with the Nomination Committee's work ahead of the 2020 Annual General Meeting and the 2021 Annual General Meeting. This has resulted in a diversified and appropriate Board composition with Board members that possess the qualifications and experience required for SSAB's operations.\n\n## Work of the Board in 2020\n\nIn 2020, the Board of Directors held 14 meetings at which minutes were taken and at which the Board was quorate at all times. SSAB's General Counsel, who is not a director, served as secretary to the Board.\n\nSafety work has top priority across the group and at every meeting the Board keeps close track of the accident and injury frequency and the corrective actions implemented by the company. The Board also follows the company's sustainability performances with regular follow-ups of achievements of the targets set out. The first quarter of 2020 was marked by a slight recovery due to a weaker fourth quarter in 2019. The Covid-19 virus had significantly started to spread in Europe by the end of the first quarter, and the spread worsened dramatically during the second quarter when also the American continent got a/ffected. The e/ffects of the virus spread brought negative consequences for principle all SSAB's customer segments, where the standard steel segments were particularly exposed for volume- and downward pressure on prices. After a somewhat calmer summer, the virus spread increased once again during the fall bringing new uncertainty on the global steel market as a consequence. The Board's focus during the greater part of 2020 has therefore been to monitor the company's work with handling the stressed steel market with cost-saving measures, including production and sta/ff adjustments.\n\nAlongside the work to mitigate the e/ffects of Covid-19, the company's strategic development e/fforts has naturally continued, albeit to somewhat smaller format. The Board monitors the strategic work as well as the company's key operating challenges such as methods and ways of working for continuous improvement in productivity. In addition to this, the Board has also addressed matters concerning digitalization, IT security, R&D, control functions, corporate governance etc.\n\nAn external consultant was engaged to carry out the annual evaluation of the Board. As a first step in the evaluation, each Board Member responded to a relatively wide questionnaire. The Member's responses and comments where thereafter compiled, and constituted the basis for the evaluation discussion taking place on the Board meeting in October. The external consultant presented the evaluation process and the outcome of the evaluation on the Nomination committee meeting in October.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It was decided on the Annual General Meeting 2020 that Ernst & Young AB should be reelected auditor for the company until the Annual General Meeting in 2021. Rickard Andersson is the principal auditor.\n\nThe external audit of the financial statements of the parent company and those of the group, as well as management by the Board of Directors and the CEO, is conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing and Generally Accepted Auditing Practices in Sweden. The Company's principal auditor attends all meetings of the Audit Committee. The auditor attends at least one Board meeting a year, goes through the audit for the year and discusses the audit with the directors without the CEO and other members of the Company's management being present.\n\nSee Note 2 in Financial reports for information regarding the auditor's fees.\n\n## Audit committee\n\n## Duties\n\nThe Audit Committee elects a Chairman from among its members. Members of the Audit Committee are elected from Board members who are not employees of the company.

The Audit Committee also assists the company's Nomination Committee with preparing proposals for a general meeting resolution on the election of auditors.\n\nThe Committee regularly meets the company's auditors, evaluates the audit work and establishes guidelines as to which additional services the company may source from its external auditors. Such additional services, up to a maximum of SEK 100,000 per assignment, must be approved in advance by the company's Chief Financial O/fficer. Assignments exceeding SEK 100,000 must be approved in advance by the chairman of the Audit Committee. All additional services must be reported to the Audit Committee each quarter.\n\nThe company has an established risk management process based on the company's processes and flows. In this process, the Audit Committee reviews and takes into account the risk areas that have been identified (both commercial risks and risks of errors in financial reporting). Based on the outcome of the internal and external risk assessment, the Committee regularly analyzes the focus and scope of the audit with the company's external and internal auditors.\n\nEach year, the Audit Committee adopts an internal audit plan which, among other things, is based on the risks that have arisen in the risk management process described above. The audit plan is discussed with the external auditors in order to enhance the e/fficiency and quality of regular audit work. The head of Internal Audit presents conducted audits and any 'whistleblowers' that have been reported to the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee also analyzes and elucidates significant accounting issues a/ffecting the group.\n\n## Work in 2020\n\nDuring 2020 great focus for the Audit Committee has been the company's liquidity and funding matters, with respect to the uncertainty Covid-19 has caused to the financial markets. Also, IT-security and the company's tax position, including the ongoing tax audit in Sweden, are other matters which the Committee has placed great emphasis to during the year. The Audit Committee took part of, and analyzed together with the external auditors, the risk analysis and audit plan which the auditors had established constituting the basis for the statutory audit.\n\nThe Audit Committee's members were since the Annual General Meeting Petra Einarsson (Chairman), Marika Fredriksson, Marie Gr\u00f6nborg, Bengt Kjell and Annareetta Lumme-Timonen. In 2020, the Audit Committee held six meetings at which minutes were taken.\n\n## Remuneration committee\n\n## Duties\n\nIn addition to the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the Remuneration Committee comprises one or more directors, who must normally be independent both of the company and of the company's top management, elected by the general meeting. Members of the Remuneration Committee must possess the required knowledge and experience of remuneration matters relating to senior executives. The CEO attends the Committee meetings to report on matters. The Remuneration Committee's duties are stated in the Board's rules of procedure. The Remuneration Committee submits proposals to the Board of Directors regarding the CEO's salary and other employment terms and conditions, sets salaries and employment terms for other members of the Group Executive Committee, and sets limits regarding the salary and employment terms and conditions for other senior executives. The Remuneration Committee's duties otherwise include preparing resolutions for adoption by the Board on issues concerning remuneration principles, preparing the Board's proposal for guidelines to determine the salary and other remuneration of the CEO and other members of the company's senior management, as well as monitoring and evaluating the application thereof. The Remuneration Committee also monitors and evaluates programs regarding variable remuneration of the company's senior management.\n\n## Work in 2020\n\nDuring 2020, the Remuneration Committee held three meetings at which minutes were taken. The Remuneration Committee comprised of Bo Annvik, Petra Einarsson and Bengt Kjell (Chairman). The CEO is co-opted to the Committee but does not participate in discussions concerning his own salary and employment terms and conditions.\n\n<!-- image -->",

These matters, as well as major capital expenditures (in excess of SEK 100 million), are prepared by the Group Executive Committee for decision by the Board of Directors of the parent company.\n\nThe CEO is responsible for the day-to-day management of the company in accordance with the Board of Directors' instructions and guidelines. As at December 31, 2020, the Group Executive Committee comprised, in addition to the CEO, the heads of SSAB Europe, SSAB Americas and SSAB Special Steels, the Chief Financial O/fficer, the Head of Legal, M&A and Procurement, the Chief Technical O/fficer, the Head of People, Culture and Communication, the Head of Research and Innovation, the Head of Strategy and Digitalization and the Head of Sustainability.\n\nThe Group Executive Committee holds monthly meetings to monitor the results and financial position of the group and the divisions. Other matters addressed at Group Executive Committee meetings include strategy issues and follow-up on budget and forecasts.\n\nThe head of each division is responsible for the relevant income statement and balance sheet. Overall, operational control of the divisions takes place through quarterly performance reviews. In most cases, the CEO of the parent company is the Chairman of the Board of Directors of each of the directly owned major subsidiaries such as Tibnor and Ruukki Construction, and these boards also include other members of the Group Executive Committee as well as employee representatives. Parallel with the quarterly performance reviews, the boards of the subsidiaries monitor the ongoing operations and adopt their respective strategies and budgets.\n\n## Remuneration guidelines\n\nGuidelines for remuneration to the CEO and other senior executives were decided on the 2020 Annual General Meeting. For information of the content of the decided guidelines, see Note 2 in Financial reports.\n\n## Incentive program for senior executives\n\nIn 2011, a long-term incentive program was introduced for the entire Group. At the time the program covered a maximum of 100 (now 150) key employees, including the CEO and other senior executives. The program runs for\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nrolling three-year periods, is cash based, and linked to the total return on SSAB's share compared to a benchmark group of the company's competitors and SSAB's financial targets. The program was introduced to promote the company's ability to recruit and retain key employees. Reference is made to Note 2 in Financial reports for more information about current remuneration. The company has no share-related incentive programs.\n\n## Internal control\n\nThe overall objective of internal control is to ensure, to a reasonable degree, that the company's operational strategies and targets are monitored and that the owners' investments are protected. Internal control ensures, with reasonable certainty, that the internal and external reporting is reliable. It also ensures that the operation is carried out in accordance with applicable laws, regulations and the requirements imposed on listed companies. Internal control is the term collectively referring to the organization and its systems, processes and procedures contributing to the maintenance of control in these areas.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n127",

        "page_content": "## Risk management\n\nThe group is tasked with seeking to ensure that risks do not materialize and, through various measures, with mitigating the fallout of any loss that occurs. Risk mapping of the group's internal and external risks is carried out as an integrated part of the annual strategy process. The result of this work is reported to the Audit Committee and to the Board of Directors. The group's Risk Management oversees and follows up both work on actively preventing the occurrence of loss at all and work on minimizing the impact of such loss should it occur. Each division and subsidiary is responsible for working proactively to prevent loss and each division has appointed risk managers participating in this work. For information on the group's work and management of sustainability and sustainability risks, see the Sustainability report.\n\n## The Board's description of internal control and risk management regarding financial reporting\n\nUnder the Swedish Companies Act and the Swedish Corporate Governance Code, SSAB's Board of Directors is responsible for internal control. The description of internal control and risk management regarding financial reporting has been prepared in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act.\n\n## Framework for internal control as regards financial reporting\n\nSSAB's internal control is based on COSO, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ('COSO'). The framework is based on five components: control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and communication and monitoring.\n\n## Control environment\n\nThe control environment is characterized by the organizational structure, management's way of working and values, as well as other roles and responsibilities within the organization. The Audit Committee assists the Board of Directors with important accounting matters that the group applies and monitors internal control with respect to financial reporting. To maintain an e/fficient control environment and sound internal control, the Board has delegated practical responsibility to the CEO, who in turn has delegated responsibility to other members of the Group Executive Committee and to the CEOs of the subsidiaries.\n\nThe control environment for the financial reporting is ensured through di/fferent governing documents, such as directives and instructions. These include among others a group accounting directive. Other significant governing documents are the directives regarding financial risks and investments and authorization rules and the Code of Conduct. The governing documents are updated on a regular basis upon changes in legislation and in standards.\n\nGROUP EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE\n\nWork on communicating the group's Code of Conduct continued during 2020 and by the turn of 2020/2021, over 91% of the employees had completed the group's internal training module on business ethics.\n\n## Risk assessment\n\nRisks associated with the financial reporting mainly concern accounting errors at the valuation of assets and liabilities, income and expenses and derogations from disclosure obligations. Fraud, loss/misappropriation of assets and deficiencies in business ethics are further risks assessed and managed, to, by reasonable means, ensure sound internal control of the financial reporting. SSAB's operation is characterized by processes involving well-established procedures and systems.\n\nThe overall risk assessments on group level constitutes an integrated part of the ongoing reporting to the Group Executive Committee and the Board of Directors, and it constitutes the basis of the assessment of risks for errors in the financial reporting. Financial risks, such as exchange risks, refinancing risks, counterparty risks, interest risks and credit risks are mainly managed by the parent company's treasury function, in accordance with the group's Finance Policy (see Note 29 in the Financial reports).\n\n## Control activities\n\nThe primary purpose of control activities is to prevent and identify at an early stage significant financial reporting errors so that they can be addressed and rectified. Control activities, both manual and automated, take place both at general and more detailed levels within the group. Routines and activities have been designed to manage and mitigate significant risks associated with financial reporting as identified in the risk analysis. Corrective measures, implementation, documentation and quality assurance take place at group, subsidiary or process level, depending on the nature and a/ffiliation of the control activity. As with other processes, the relevant head is responsible for the completeness and accuracy of control activities.\n\nRecent years have seen an in-depth analysis carried out on the processes and control structures in group companies. This has resulted in a more systematic approach to identifying financial risks and financial reporting risks, as well as documentation of controls as to how such risks are to be prevented and identified. The controls are adapted to each unit's work processes and systems structure, and these are evaluated through self-assessment supplemented with monitoring and review by internal audit. This way of working has been implemented in a system covering the entire group which is used when verifying the reliability of financial reporting.\n\n<!-- image -->",

For example, there are in every division Controller functions which analyze and follow up deviations and forward reports in the company. Monitoring by the Group Executive Committee takes place, among other things, through regular meetings with heads of divisions and subsidiaries with regard to operations, their financial position and results, as well as financial and operational\n\nGROUP EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE\n\nkey performance indicators. The Board of Directors analyzes, on an ongoing basis, among other things, business reports in which the Group Executive Committee describes the most recent period and comments on the group's financial position and results. This is how major fluctuations and deviations are followed up to minimize the risk of errors in financial reporting.\n\n## Information and communication\n\nSSAB has well-established information and communication procedures to support the completeness and accuracy of the financial reporting. The parent company regularly communicates updates in financial directives and instructions to all personnel concerned. In addition to this are regular group finance meetings held where the central finance functions, together with the finance managers of the divisions, processes information regarding news and changes in accounting principles, information requirements and updates within internal control. The company's intranet constitutes another important information channel within the company, where information is updated continuously and it ensures that the latest directives and instructions are always available.\n\nThe subsidiaries and the divisions regularly submits reports with analysis and comments on the financial result and risks to the Board.\n\nThe company's 'whistleblower' function is another important channel of communication where accounting and internal control infringements, among other things, may be reported.\n\nFinancial information regarding the group may only be disclosed by the Chairman of the Board, CEO, CFO, Head of Group Communications and Head of Investor Relations. The divisions may disseminate financial information regarding their operations only after equivalent information has been published by the group.\n\n## Monitoring\n\nThe Board of Directors' monitoring of internal control with respect to financial reporting takes place primarily through the Audit Committee. The company's process for internal control include self-assessments and systematic follow-ups on risk analysis and control activities. In addition, the company's internal audit carry out yearly assessments of internal control. The monitoring of internal control also takes place within the framework of the statutory external audit. The Audit Committee monitors the financial reporting and takes part of reports from the internal and external auditors.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The internal auditor participates in the Audit Committee meetings.\n\nThe internal audit is organized at an overall group level, with an audit plan drawn up for the entire group. The group's audit activities are planned by the head of internal audit and are decided by the Audit Committee.\n\nThe major part of the work is carried out through audits in accordance with the audit plan. Other work largely consists of specific audits and of monitoring of self-assessments in the group regarding internal control.\n\nThe audits are performed in accordance with an established and adopted audit process which is constantly developed in order to optimize the way of working and delivery of reports with generated added value. These reports describe observations, recommendations and improvement areas, with the aim of strengthening and enhancing e/fficiency in risk management and internal control. The function also carry out reviews on behalf of the Board or as required for other reasons.\n\nDuring 2020, internal audit conducted regular, independent and objective audits of the group's corporate governance, internal control and risk management in accordance with the adopted audit plan. The reviews were conducted in accordance with an adopted audit process and formally completed with a report and a planned follow-up. The result has been regularly submitted to divisional heads and the Audit Committee as regards observations, measures taken and implementation status.\n\nDuring the year, internal audit also conducted a number of audits on subsidiaries where the company's manual for audits of risks concerning fraud and corruption was a part of the audit scope. The audits did not reveal any concrete irregularities; however, possibilities to reduce risks were identified. The identified improvement possibilities are implemented in accordance with established action plans. Due to Covid-19, and the accompanying traveling restrictions, a significant part of the audit of the subsidiaries was undertaken remotely.\n\nGROUP EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE\n\n<!-- image -->",

For 2019, these amounted to SEK -197 million. For description and amounts, see p. 139\n\nAccording to the World Steel Association, global crude steel production for 2020 amounted to 1,829 (1,846) million tonnes, down 0.9% compared to 2019. Chinese steel production increased by more than 5%. Steel production decreased in North America by 16% and in the EU-28 by 12%.\n\nIn North America, demand for heavy plate was relatively weak already in the first quarter, a situation made worse by Covid-19 during the second and third quarters. During the fourth quarter, demand improved in most customer segments, including distributors, whose inventory levels were at low during the second half of the year.\n\nIn Europe, market demand was good during the beginning of the year, but weakened sharply during the second and third quarters as a result of the pandemic. Most customer segments, such as Automotive and Heavy Transport, closed down all or parts of production. Also, steel producers around Europe cut capacity. Customer activity levels picked up again during the fourth quarter and this impacted demand positively. Imports into Europe were at a relatively low level throughout 2020.\n\nGlobal demand for high-strength steel was also negatively a/ffected by the pandemic. For some segments, primarily Materials Handling, there was good demand for most of the year. There were also geographical di/fferences in demand, with China being negatively a/ffected in the first quarter already but showing good demand for the rest of the year.\n\nIn North America, market prices for heavy plate decreased somewhat during the first half of the year, but then rose sharply, especially during the fourth quarter. In Europe, market prices for strip and heavy plate rose at the start of the year but fell during the second quarter with the sharp decline in demand. During the fourth quarter, prices increased substantially and closed the year at a significantly higher level at the end of the year than at the beginning. Market prices for strip and heavy plate in China showed the same trend as in Europe during 2020.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In 2019, items a/ffecting comparability amounted to SEK -186 million. In operating profit, these amounted to SEK -197 million, which was primarily related to the  restructuring program in Tibnor and write-down to net realizable value of assets and liabilities held for sale regarding the divestment of Ruukki Construction's project operations, Building Systems. Items a/ffecting comparability of SEK 11 million have been included in tax expenses 2019.\n\nNOTES\n\nAUDITOR'S REPORT\n\nSHAREHOLDER INFORMATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n134",

The decline was attributable to lower volumes and lower prices.\n\nThe operating result for 2020 was SEK 96 (30) million, up SEK 66 million compared with 2019. Higher earnings were primarily attributable to lower variable and fixed costs.\n\n## Market trend\n\nThe market improved during the start of 2020 compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. This was followed by a sharp weakening in demand during the second and third quarter, because of the pandemic. During the fourth quarter, demand recovered, especially in Sweden and Finland, and grew gradually stronger. The automotive and engineering industries drove the upswing. As far as the full-year 2020 was concerned, the markets in Finland and the Baltics were less a/ffected by the pandemic compared with the rest of the Nordics.\n\n## Cash flow and capital expenditure\n\nOperating cash flow for the full year of 2020 amounted to SEK 186 (348) million. Cash flow was impacted positively by a lower working capital and by the operating profit.\n\nCapital expenditure payments during the full year 2020 amounted to SEK 53 (108) million, of which SEK 7 (47) million were strategic investments. In 2019, Tibnor acquired Sanist\u00e5l for SEK 523 million.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The reported revenue was down 15% compared with 2019 and amounted to SEK 5,516 (6,510) million, due to the divestment of Building Systems, which is included in the figures until the end of April 2020.\n\nOperating result for 2020 amounted to SEK 314 (283) million. The improvement compared to 2019 was partly due to improved margins for the product business (Roofing and Building Envelopes).\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2020, the divestment of Building Systems was completed. Ruukki Construction's divested project business, Building Systems, had revenue of around SEK 1.5 billion in 2019 and a minor positive operating profit. During the first four months of 2020, Building Systems had revenue of SEK 0.6 billion and a minor positive operating profit. For more information, see note 26.\n\n## Market trend\n\nDuring the full year of 2020, demand was at a good level and in most geographical markets. Covid-19 had a certain negative impact, especially in the markets in central and east of Europe and the Baltics.\n\n## Cash flow and capital expenditure\n\nOperating cash flow for 2020 amounted to SEK 481 (348) million. Cash flow during the quarter was impacted positively by operating profit but a/ffected negatively by higher working capital.\n\nCapital expenditure payments during the full year amounted to SEK 88 (113) million, of which SEK 45 (41) million were strategic investments. During 2019, 67% of the shares in Piristeel was acquired for SEK 180 million.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Close collaboration with strategic customers and customer segments providing conditions for a market-driven product development that creates increased value also for the end-customers. This is particularly evident for SSAB's high-strength steels, where also technical customer support is an important part of research and development. Continuous work is also carried out with the development of the processes for increased cost e/fficiency, sustainable processes and energy conservation. During the year, research and development investments amounted to SEK 312 (336) million.\n\n## Environment\n\nSteel production is an energy intensive process that a/ffects the environment, including carbon dioxide emissions. In Sweden and Finland, SSAB's blast furnaces are among the largest sources of carbon dioxide emissions in each country. At the same time, SSAB's blast furnaces are among the most e/fficient in the world in terms of minimizing emissions from steel production. The impact on the local environment in the vicinity of SSAB's plants has decreased significantly in recent decades. Technical development and increasingly stringent external demands dictate constant improvements in the operations.\n\nThe most important environmental aspects for SSAB are:\n\n- \u00b7  Air emissions reductions of carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides and particulate matter\n- \u00b7  Water e/ffluent reductions of nitrogen and suspended substances\n- \u00b7  E/fficient use of raw materials and energy\n- \u00b7  Landfill waste minimization\n\nSSAB's operations are subject to environmental permits with hundreds of environmental conditions governing among other things production levels, emissions into the air and water, noise levels, and rules regarding landfill sites.\n\nNOTES\n\nAUDITOR'S REPORT\n\nSHAREHOLDER INFORMATION\n\n## Permitted production at the Swedish plants 1)\n\n| Thousand tonnes         | Location     | Permitted production   | Production  2020   | Production  2019   |\n|-------------------------|--------------|------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| Coke                    | Lule\u00e5        | 800                    | 668                | 710                |\n|                         | Oxel\u00f6sund    | 530                    | 349                | 357                |\n| Hot metal               | Lule\u00e5 2)     | -                      | 1,963              | 1,996              |\n|                         | Oxel\u00f6sund    | 2,000                  | 883                | 1,176              |\n| Steel slabs             | Lule\u00e5        | 2,500                  | 1,890              | 1,893              |\n|                         | Oxel\u00f6sund    | 1,900                  | 941                | 1,138              |\n| Hot-rolled steel        | Borl\u00e4nge     | 3,200                  | 1,932              | 2,032              |\n|                         | Oxel\u00f6sund 3) | 1,000                  | 486                | 518                |\n| Pickled steel           | Borl\u00e4nge     | 2,500                  | 1,133              | 1,169              |\n| Cold-rolled steel       | Borl\u00e4nge     | 1,400                  | 577                | 590                |\n| Annealed steel          | Borl\u00e4nge     | 900                    | 504                | 526                |\n| Organic-coated products | K\u00f6ping       | 30                     | 19                 | 14                 |\n|                         | Finsp\u00e5ng 4)  | 40                     | 31                 | 31                 |\n| Steel tubes             | Virsbo       | 125                    | 16                 | 16                 |\n\n- 1) In North America, the permitted production levels are determined through maximum permitted hourly production volumes and not applicable for Finnish sites.\n- 2) Not regulated\n- 3) Delivery of plate\n- 4) Unit million m 2\n\n## Sustainability report\n\nIn accordance with the Swedish Annual Accounts Act, Chapter 6, Section 11, SSAB AB has chosen to establish the statutory sustainability report as a separate report.

SSAB's stated objective is to become the safest steel company in the world to work in, and shall in addition adhere to high environmental standards and be a responsible partner to all stakeholders. A more detailed description of the business strategy can be found on the company's website. A successful implementation of the company's business strategy and the safeguarding of the company's long-term interests require that the company can recruit and retain qualified employees. For this, the company must be able to o/ffer competitive remuneration in the labor market on which the executive operates. These guidelines\n\nNOTES\n\nAUDITOR'S REPORT\n\nSHAREHOLDER INFORMATION\n\nare intended to o/ffer senior executives a competitive total remuneration, which in turn promotes the company's business strategy, long-term interests and sustainability.\n\n## Types of remuneration, etc.\n\nThe remuneration shall be on market terms and may consist of the following components: fixed cash salary, variable cash remuneration consisting of a short-term variable component ('STI') and a long-term variable component ('LTI'), pension benefits and other benefits. Additionally, the general meeting may - irrespective of these guidelines - resolve on, among other things, share-related or share price-related remuneration.\n\nThe satisfaction of criteria for variable cash remuneration shall be measured over a period of one year for STI and three years for LTI. STI may amount to not more than 75 percent of the fixed annual cash salary for the CEO and not more than 50 per cent for other senior executives. LTI may amount to not more than 30 per cent of the fixed annual cash salary for the CEO and other senior executives.\n\nFor the CEO and other senior executives pension benefits shall be contribution-based except in those cases where so provided in the rules of a general pension plan (e.g. the Swedish ITP2 plan).

In the event the employment terminates prior to the retirement age, the executive shall receive a paid-up policy for earned pension. Variable cash remuneration shall not qualify for pension benefits, except in those cases where so provided in the rules of a general pension plan. The pension premiums shall amount to not more than 50 per cent of the annual pensionable salary.\n\nOther benefits may include, for example, health insurance, medical insurance and company cars. Premiums and other costs relating to such benefits may amount to not more than 10 per cent of the fixed annual cash salary.\n\nRemuneration under employment subject to other rules than Swedish may be duly adjusted to comply with mandatory rules or established local practice, taking into account, to the extent possible, the overall purpose of these guidelines.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The period of notice may not exceed six months without any right to severance pay when termination is made by the executive.\n\nFor senior executives outside Sweden, the termination period and severance pay may deviate from the above stated due to legislation or local market practice.\n\n## Criteria for variable cash remuneration, etc.\n\nThe variable cash remuneration shall be linked to predetermined and measurable criteria. The criteria shall be designed to contribute to the company's business strategy and long-term interests, including sustainability.\n\nThe criteria for STI are set annually and shall consist of group objectives, of unit objectives (i.e. objectives related to a particular division, a certain subsidiary or a certain function) and of individual objectives, with distribution as follows.\n\nGroup objectives may be financial and non-financial. The financial objectives shall comprise at least 60 per cent of the group objectives and shall be linked to EBITDA margins in relation to a comparison group of the company's competitors, own EBITDA level or margin, return on capital employed, the company's cash flow or the company's stock turnover.

However, for employees in division Americas, 20-40 per cent of LTI shall be linked to SSAB Americas own earnings and return on capital employed.\n\nThe objectives of LTI are to create a common interest for the company management and shareholders to drive the business towards long-term good return on the SSAB-shares and to promote the company's ability to recruit and retain key employees.\n\nThe variable cash compensation programs shall be structured such that the board of directors has the possibility, should exceptional circumstances prevail, to restrict the payment of variable cash compensations, or to decline to make such payment, where such a measure is deemed reasonable and compatible with the company's responsibilities to its shareholders, employees and other stakeholders.\n\nTo which extent the objectives for variable cash remuneration has been satisfied shall be evaluated when the measurement period has ended. Following a proposal from the remuneration committee, the board of directors is responsible for the evaluation so far as it concerns variable remuneration to the CEO. For variable cash remuneration to other senior executives, the remuneration committee is responsible for the evaluation in consultation with the CEO. When the board of directors assesses how the financial objectives have been met, this should be done against the latest published financial information with any adjustments that the board of directors considers necessary or appropriate.\n\nBefore the payment of variable cash compensation is e/ffected, the board of directors must verify that the objectives linked to the remuneration have been met and that the remuneration has been calculated correctly.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n147",

These include: general political, sustainability and economic conditions. Many of these factors can impact SSAB positively or negatively. Risk management supports the achievement of strategic objectives and targets. It ensures the continuity of operations also in changing circumstances.\n\n## Risk governance and management process\n\nResponsibility for the long-term, overall management of strategic risks is dictated by the company's delegation policy, namely from the Board of Directors to the CEO and from the CEO to the heads of each division and subsidiary. SSAB's decentralized organization means that divisions and subsidiaries are primarily responsible for managing the operational risks in the Group. Risk mapping of the Group's internal and external risks is carried out as an integrated part of the annual strategy process. The divisional and subsidiary managers conduct an annual risk assessment as part of their strategy process, and the results of this work are combined into a group-level risk map and reported to the Audit Committee and to the Board of Directors.\n\nSSAB's insurance function is tasked with procuring group-wide protection for the insurable risks. The management of financial risks is centralized on the Group's treasury function. SSAB has an internal control function that supports operations in identifying risk areas and, based on a risk analysis, establishes control processes to mitigate identified risk areas. Also, SSAB has an internal audit unit which, among other tasks, based on a risk analysis conducts audits of internal controls and processes followed by recommendations for improvements within these areas. The internal audit unit reports directly to the Audit Committee. For full information about the Group's internal audit function, see the Corporate Governance Report.\n\nSustainability risks are integrated into the strategy and risk management processes. All SSAB production sites are certified according to ISO 14001, in which risks are addressed. Certification also means that all our sites have been audited by a third party.\n\nNOTES\n\nAUDITOR'S REPORT\n\nSHAREHOLDER INFORMATION\n\n## Risk assessment\n\nThe enterprise risk assessment is embedded in SSAB's yearly strategy process with the purpose of achieving SSAB's strategies and targets and ensuring business continuity, even in the event of turbulence in the global steel market. In the risk assessment, two types of risks are assessed.\n\n- 1.  Internal risks: originate from activities and situations that SSAB has influence over. Risk areas cover: Sales/ Customer, Operational, People, Sustainability and own Financial risks.\n- 2. External risks: based on external developments over which SSAB has no or limited control. Risk areas cover: Market, Industry, Regulatory, Financial risks and Other risks, including climate change related risks.\n\nThe risk level of a certain risk is calculated based on the estimated impact (financial/reputational) and likelihood (probability of occurrence) based on a specific classification system.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n149",

Each class A share carries one vote and each class B share carries one tenth of one vote. SSAB's share capital is SEK 9,063 million. The quotient value per share is SEK 8.80.\n\n## Ownership structure\n\nAt year-end 2020, SSAB had 121,136 shareholders.\n\nSSAB's three largest owners in terms of voting rights at year-end 2020 were:\n\n- \u00b7  Industriv\u00e4rden 11.8%\n- \u00b7  LKAB 10.5%\n- \u00b7  Solidium 9.8%\n\nThe ten largest identified owners together owned approximately 41.9% of the voting capital and 34.9% of the share capital at the end of December 2020. Owners outside Sweden and Finland accounted for 29.6% of voting rights and 21.5% of the total number of shares. More information on page 243.\n\n## Corporate Governance Report\n\nThe Corporate Governance Report is not part of the Board of Director's Report. The Corporate Governance Report and the related auditor's report are available on page 116 in Annual Report 2020.\n\n## Outlook\n\nDemand for steel during the first quarter of 2021 is estimated to be good, driven both by underlying demand and by customer restocking. Nevertheless, there is still uncertainty as to how the development of Covid-19 will a/ffect demand. Global demand for high-strength steel is estimated to be good during the first quarter.\n\nSpecial Steels' shipments are expected to increase during the first quarter of 2021, compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, whereas SSAB Europe's shipments are also expected to increase, but to a somewhat lesser\n\nNOTES\n\nAUDITOR'S REPORT\n\nSHAREHOLDER INFORMATION\n\nextent. SSAB Americas' shipments are expected to continue at a good level during the first quarter of 2021, but to be somewhat lower than in the fourth quarter of 2020, mainly due to low opening balance of slab inventories in the first quarter of 2021.\n\nPrices realized by SSAB Americas and SSAB Europe are expected to increase significantly on average compared with the fourth quarter of 2020. For SSAB Special Steels, prices are expected to increase in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. At the same time, costs for raw material will be higher in the first quarter of 2021, compared to the fourth quarter of 2020.\n\n## Major planned maintenance outages 2021\n\nThe Group's total maintenance costs for 2021 are expected to be SEK 1,200 million, compared to SEK 805 million in 2020. The increase can partly be explained by the fact that costs in 2020 were lower than normal, because maintenance could to a larger extent be carried out using our own resources due to a lower level of production. In addition, 2021 will see maintenance take place at SSAB's mill in Mobile, where among other things, the quenching and tempering (Q&T) lines will make this more comprehensive than the maintenance at Montpellier in 2020. The table below shows the major planned maintenance outages for 2021 and the costs of outages completed during 2020 and 2019. The figures include the impact of the direct maintenance cost and the cost of lower capacity utilization (underabsorption), but exclude lost margins.\n\n## Major planned maintenance outages in 2021\n\n| SEK millions        | 2021  Q1   | 2021  Q2   | 2021  Q3   | 2021  Q4   | 2021  Full year   |   2020  Full year | 2019  Full year   |\n|---------------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| SSAB Special Steels | -          | -          | 320        | -          | 320               |               250 | 300               |\n| SSAB Europe         | -          | -          | 300        | 145        | 445               |               335 | 420               |\n| SSAB Americas       | -          | -          | -          | 435        | 435               |               220 | 415               |\n| Total               | -          | -          | 620        | 580        | 1,200             |               805 | 1,135             |\n\n## Subsequent events after the financial year\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, SSAB announced that it was in discussions with Tata Steel concerning a possible acquisition of the IJmuiden steel mill and related downstream assets. After deeper analysis and discussions, it became clear that there were limited possibilities to integrate IJmuiden into the SSAB strategic framework. Discussions with Tata Steel were therefore concluded in the end of January 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "STATEMENTS\n\n5-YEAR SUMMARY\n\nPRINCIPLES\n\n## Accounting and valuation principles\n\nThe significant accounting principles applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set forth below. Unless otherwise stated, these principles have been applied consistently with respect to all presented years.\n\n## General information\n\nSSAB AB is a limited liability company with its registered o/ffice in Stockholm, Sweden. The Parent Company is listed on Nasdaq Stockholm with a secondary listing on Nasdaq Helsinki.\n\n## Principles for preparation of the report\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Swedish Annual accounts act (1995:1554) as well as International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) with interpretation statements issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC), as such have been adopted by the EU. In addition, the Swedish Financial Reporting Board's recommendation RFR 1 Supplementary Accounting Rules for the Group, has been applied.\n\nAccounting standards and applications introduced during the year have had no material impact on the Group's earnings and financial position.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the acquisition value method, other than with respect to certain financial assets and liabilities (including derivative instruments) which have been valued at fair value through profit and loss.\n\nThe preparation of reports in accordance with IFRS requires the use of a number of important estimations for accounting purposes. In addition, management must make certain assessments in conjunction with the application of the Group's accounting principles. Those areas that include a high degree of assessment, which are complex, or in which assumptions and estimations are of material significance for the consolidated financial statements are stated in Note 32.\n\nThe Parent Company applies the same accounting principles as the Group, except where stated below in a particular section. The di/fferences that exist between the principles applied by the Parent Company and the Group are due to limitations on the possibilities to apply IFRS to the Parent Company as a consequence of the provisions of the Swedish Annual Reports Act and the Swedish Pension Obligations (Security) Act and also, in\n\nNOTES\n\nAUDITOR'S REPORT\n\nSHAREHOLDER INFORMATION\n\ncertain cases, for tax reasons. In addition, the Swedish Financial Reporting Board's recommendation RFR 2, Accounting for Legal Entities, has been applied.\n\n## Standards, changes and interpretations that entered into force in 2020 and\n\n## are relevant to the Group\n\n- \u00b7  IFRS 3 (AMENDMENT), BUSINESS COMBINATIONS: DEFINITION OF A BUSINESS. The e/ffective date of the Amendment is January 1, 2020. The Amendment to IFRS 3 refers to a changed definition of a business. The amended definition of a business requires an acquisition to include an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs. The definition of the term 'outputs' is amended to focus on goods and services provided to customers, generating investment income and other income. The definition 'returns in the form of lower costs and other economic benefits' is excluded. The Group has applied this Amendment from January 1 2020 and the Amendment has not had any impact on the Group's financial statements of 2020 but will possibly result in more future acquisitions being accounted for as asset acquisitions.\n- \u00b7  AMENDMENTS: IFRS 7, FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS; DISCLOSURES AND IFRS 9, FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS; 'INTEREST RATE BENCHMARK REFORM'. The e/ffective date of the Amendments is January 1, 2020. The Amendments in IFRS 9 and IFRS 7 provide certain reliefs in relation to interest rate benchmark reforms. The reliefs relate to hedge accounting and have the e/ffect that the reforms should not generally cause hedge accounting to terminate. Any hedge ine/ffectiveness should continue to be recorded in the statement of profit or loss. The amendment will a/ffect future financial reports as SSAB's hedges involve IBOR-based contracts.\n\n## Standards, changes and interpretations relevant to the group that have been adopted by the EY but have not yet entered into force and have not been applied by the group prematurely\n\n- \u00b7  AMENDMENTS: IFRS 7, FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS; DISCLOSURES, IFRS 9, FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, IFRS 16, LEASING AND IAS 39, FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS: RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT AND, 'INTEREST RATE BENCHMARK REFORM - PHASE 2'. The e/ffective date of the Amendment is January 1, 2021. The Amendment makes it possible to update the hedging documentation for existing hedging relationships to adapt it to the new reference interest rates. The Group will apply this Amendment from January 1, 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Group companies are consolidated from the time when the Group gains control or a controlling interest over the company. Controlling interest is defined as when the Parent Company has control over the investment object, is exposed to or is entitled to a variable return from its involvement in the investment object and can use its influence over the investment object to influence its return. Divested companies are included in the consolidated financial statements up to the time when the Group don't have the control or a controlling interest over the company. In the SSAB's consolidated financial statements, any intra-group transactions have been eliminated.\n\n## Subsidiaries\n\nThe Group's annual accounts are prepared in accordance with the acquisition method, entailing that the equity of subsidiaries at the time of acquisition defined as the di/fference between the fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities - is eliminated in its entirety against the acquisition price. Those surpluses that comprise the di/fference between the acquisition value and the fair value of the Group's share of identifiable acquired assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are reported as goodwill. If the acquisition price is lower than the fair value of the net assets of the acquired subsidiary, the di/fference is reported directly in the report of profit or loss. With respect to each acquisition, the Group determines whether all non-controlling interests in the acquired company shall be reported at fair value or at the proportion of the net assets of the acquired company represented by the holding. Acquisition costs are reported as an expense when they occur.\n\n- \u00b7  Goodwill is initially valued as the amount by which the total purchase price and fair value of non-controlling interests exceeds the fair value of identifiable acquired assets and assumed liabilities. Acquired companies are included in the consolidated financial statements commencing the date on which a controlling influence is obtained, while divested companies are reported up to the date on which the controlling influence ceases.\n- \u00b7  Intra-group transactions and unrealized internal profits are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. Unrealized losses are also eliminated unless the transaction constitutes evidence of impairment of the transferred asset. Where appropriate, the accounting principles for subsidiaries have been changed in order to ensure a consistent application of the Group's accounting principles.\n\n- \u00b7  In the consolidated cash flow statement, the purchase price with respect to acquired or divested operations is reported under the headings 'Acquisition of shares and operations' and 'Divested shares and operations'. Thus, the assets and liabilities of the acquired/divested companies at the time of the acquisition/divesture are not included in the cash flow statement.\n\n## Non-controlling interest\n\nNon-controlling interest is reported as a separate item in the equity of the Group. Acquisition from noncontrolling interest is reported as a transaction within equity, between the Parent Company's shareholders and non-controlling interest. Therefore, goodwill does not arise in those transactions. Profit from divestment to noncontrolling interest is also reported in equity.\n\n## A/ffiliated companies and joint arrangements\n\n## A/ffiliated companies\n\nSSAB's a/ffiliated companies are all companies in which the Group has significant but not controlling interest, which usually applies to shareholdings comprising between 20% and 50% of the votes. Shares in a/ffiliated companies are reported according to the equity method.\n\n## Joint arrangements\n\nA joint arrangement is classified either as joint operation or a joint venture, depending on the contractual rights and obligations of each investor. SSAB's joint arrangements are classified as joint ventures, which means that SSAB and one or several parties have joint controlling interest and are entitled to the net assts. Joint ventures are reported according to the equity method.\n\n## Equity method\n\nA/ffiliated companies and joint operations ventures in the form of joint ventures are reported in accordance with the equity method and valued initially at acquisition value in the Group's statement of financial position. The equity method entails that the Group's book value of the shares in a/ffiliated companies and joint ventures corresponds to the Group's share in the equity of the a/ffiliated companies and joint ventures and, where appropriate, the residual value of surplus values or under-values from a Group perspective, including goodwill. The Group's share in the earnings of a/ffiliated companies and joint ventures which, arises after the acquisition, is reported in the report of profit or loss and the Group's share of other comprehensive income is included in the other comprehensive income for the Group.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "BOARD OF DIRECTORS' REPORT\n\nSTATEMENTS\n\n5-YEAR SUMMARY\n\nPRINCIPLES\n\nIn the consolidated statement of profit or loss, 'Shares in earnings of a/ffiliated companies and joint ventures after tax' comprise the Group's shares in earnings of a/ffiliated companies and joint ventures, after tax. Dividend from a/ffiliated companies and joint ventures are reported as a decrease of the carrying amount of the investment. Shares in the earnings of a/ffiliated companies and joint ventures are reported in the operating profit when operations in a/ffiliated companies and joint ventures are related to SSAB's operations and considered to be of a business nature. Any intra-group profits are eliminated in relation to the share of equity held.\n\nIn the Parent Company, a/ffiliated companies and joint ventures are reported in accordance with the acquisition value method.\n\n## Transactions in foreign currencies\n\nItems included in the financial statements for the various units in the Group are valued in the currency used in the economic environment in which the company in question primarily operates (functional currency). Swedish kronor are used in the consolidated financial statements. This the functional currency and reporting currency of the Parent Company. Transactions in foreign currency are reported at the exchange rate prevailing on the transaction date. In certain cases, the actual rate is approximated to the average rate during a month. At the end of the month, receivables and liabilities in foreign currency are translated in accordance with the closing day rate at that time. Exchange rate di/fferences relating to the business are reported in the operating profit, while di/fferences attributable to financial assets and liabilities are reported as a net sum among financial items.\n\nThe statements of profit or losses of foreign subsidiaries are translated into Swedish kronor at the average exchange rates for the year, while their statements of financial position are translated into Swedish kronor at the closing day rates. Any translation di/fferences that arise are transferred directly to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income and reported in the item 'Translation reserve'.\n\nLoans or other financial instruments taken up in order to hedge net assets in foreign subsidiaries are reported in the consolidated financial statements at the closing day rate. Any exchange rate di/fferences less deferred taxes are transferred directly to other comprehensive income and thereby set o/ff against the translation di/fferences which, arise in conjunction with the translation of these subsidiaries' statements of financial position into Swedish kronor.\n\nNOTES\n\nAUDITOR'S REPORT\n\nSHAREHOLDER INFORMATION\n\nUpon sales of foreign subsidiaries, the total translation di/fferences that relate to the foreign subsidiary are reported as a part of capital gains/ losses in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.\n\nGoodwill and adjustments of assets and liabilities to fair value in connection with the acquisition of foreign subsidiaries are treated as assets and liabilities in the foreign operations and thus translated in accordance with the same principles as the foreign subsidiaries.\n\n## Revenue recognition\n\nRevenues are recognized when the control of the goods has been transferred to the customer. Revenue is recognized at the transaction price, taking into account any estimated variable amount that the Group is entitled to (expected proceed). The amount corresponds to amounts received for sold goods less value added tax and taking into account discounts and returns. In Revenue, in the consolidated statement of profit or loss, exchange rate di/fferences from forward contracts, which are entered into in order to hedge sales in foreign currency, are included. For information regarding hedge accounting, see Note 29.\n\nThe Group recognizes revenue at the point in time when the distinct performance obligation is satisfied and when the customer has obtained the control over the sold good. This can be done at a point in time or over time. The specific criteria for revenue recognition for each of the Group's operations are described below.\n\n## Sales of steel\n\nRevenues from sales of steel are recognized after the control has been transferred to the customer, which occurs when the goods sold are transferred to the customer and no disposition right or opportunity to actual control over the goods remains for the Group and when there are no unsatisfied performance obligations outstanding that might a/ffect the customers approval of the goods. In most cases, this means that revenues are reported upon delivery of the goods to the customer in accordance with agreed delivery terms and conditions.\n\n## Revenue recognition of projects within Ruukki Construction\n\nThe Group applies percentage of completion method when reporting fixed price agreements for projects. When the result of the project and the completion can be reasonably calculated, revenues are reported over the term of the agreement based on the degree of completion. At the end of the project, project\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n171",

The degree of completion is calculated in accordance to the Input method, where revenue is based on the entity's e/fforts or input to satisfy the performance obligation (e.g. costs for resources consumed, labor hours expended and other costs incurred) in relation to total expected input for the satisfaction of the performance obligation. When it is likely that the total expenditures on the project will exceed the total revenues, the anticipated loss is reported immediately as an expense. When the result of the project work cannot reasonably be calculated, revenues are recognized only in an amount corresponding to the accrued project expenditures, which are likely to be compensated. During 2020, SSAB divested the project business of Ruukki Construction.\n\n## Sales of services\n\nRevenues from sales of services are recognized in the period in which the services are performed.\n\nAll intra-group sales are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Interest income and dividends\n\nInterest income is reported in accordance with the e/ffective rate/yield (e/ffective interest rate method). Dividends are reported when the right to receive the dividend has been established.\n\nRegarding dividends from subsidiaries see the section entitled Dividends, the Parent Company.\n\n## Pricing between Group companies\n\nArm's length pricing is applied to deliveries of goods and services between companies in the Group.\n\n## Government support\n\nGovernment support and grants are reported at fair value when there is reasonable certainty that the grant will be received and that the Group will fulfill the conditions attached to the grant. Government support and grants related to cost recovery are accrued and reported in the statement of profit or loss over the same period as the expenses which the grants are intended to reimburse. Grants related to assets are recognized in the statement of financial position through a reduction in the reported value of the assets.\n\nNOTES\n\nAUDITOR'S REPORT\n\nSHAREHOLDER INFORMATION\n\n## Research and development expenses\n\nResearch and development expenses are booked as they are incurred. Development expenses may be capitalized under certain strict conditions. However, this requires, among other things, that future economic benefits can be demonstrated at the time the expenses are incurred. The projects that take place are short-term in nature and do not involve significant amounts, and thus development expenditures are also booked as costs.\n\n## Tangible fixed assets\n\nTangible fixed assets are reported at acquisition value less deduction for accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment. Depreciation is based on the acquisition value of the assets and estimated useful life. If major investments include components, an assessment must always be made as to whether the useful life of the component di/ffers from that of the entire facility. The acquisition value includes expenditures directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. Any borrowing costs in conjunction with the construction and design of fixed assets, a significant portion of which is required for completion for use or sale, are added as a part of the acquisition cost of the asset. Restoration expenses in connection with disposals of fixed assets are included in the acquisition value only where the criteria for making a provision for such restoration expenses may be deemed fulfilled. Additional expenditures for acquiring replacement components are added to the reported value of the fixed asset or recognized as a separate asset only where it is likely that the Group will enjoy the future economic benefits associated with the asset and the acquisition value of the asset can be measured in a reliable manner. The reported value for the replaced part is removed from the statement of financial position. All other forms of repairs and maintenance are recognized as expenses in the statement of profit or loss during the period in which they occur. Land is assumed to have a perpetual period of use and thus is not depreciated. Other tangible fixed assets are classified into groups for calculation of depreciation based on their estimated useful life, in accordance with the following table.\n\n| Examples of items                           | estimated use, years   |\n|---------------------------------------------|------------------------|\n| Vehicles, o/ffice equipment and computers   | 3-5                    |\n| Light machinery                             | 5-12                   |\n| Heavy machinery:                            |                        |\n| \u00b7  Relining of blast furnaces               | 12-15                  |\n| \u00b7  Steel furnaces, rolling mills and cranes | 15-20                  |\n| \u00b7  Blast furnaces and coke ovens            | 15-20                  |\n| Land improvement                            | 20                     |\n| Buildings                                   | 25-50                  |\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "BOARD OF DIRECTORS' REPORT\n\nSTATEMENTS\n\n5-YEAR SUMMARY\n\nPRINCIPLES\n\nThe useful life of the assets is reviewed annually and adjusted where required. The assets are normally depreciated to zero without any remaining residual value. The straight-line depreciation method is used for all types of tangible non-current assets with a limited useful life. Where the book value of an asset exceeds the expected recovery value, the asset is written down to such value.\n\nCapital gains and capital losses upon the sale of tangible non-current assets are determined by comparing the revenue from the sale with the reported value. This is reported in the statement of profit or loss as 'Other operating income' or 'Other operating expenses'.\n\n## Intangible assets\n\nSimilarly, intangible assets are classified in two groups, with assets with a determinable useful life being amortized over a determined useful life, while assets with an undeterminable useful life are not amortized at all.\n\n## Intangible assets with an undeterminable useful life\n\n## Goodwill\n\nThe compensation transferred in conjunction with a business acquisition is valued at fair value. Goodwill comprises the amount by which the acquisition value (the compensation) exceeds the fair value of the Group's share of the identifiable net assets of the acquired subsidiary at the time of the acquisition. Goodwill upon the acquisition of a subsidiary is reported as an intangible asset. Goodwill is tested annually to identify any impairment and reported at acquisition value less accumulated impairment. Testing for impairment is also carried out in those cases where there are indications that the asset may have diminished in value. Impairment of goodwill is reported as an expense and not reversed. Profits or losses upon the sale of a unit include the remaining reported value of the goodwill which relates to the sold unit. When testing for any impairment, goodwill is allocated over cash-generating units. The allocation is made on the cash-generating units or groups of cash generating units which are expected to benefit from the business acquisition which gave rise to the goodwill item. Goodwill is monitored on a divisional level.\n\n## Trademarks\n\nAcquired trademarks are reported at cost. Trademarks that don't have a determinable useful life are tested annually to identify any impairment and are reported at cost less accumulated impairment. Testing for\n\nNOTES\n\nAUDITOR'S REPORT\n\nSHAREHOLDER INFORMATION\n\nimpairment is also carried out in those cases where there are indications that the assets may have diminished in value. Impairment of trademark is reported as an expense and not reversed.\n\n## Emission rights\n\nEmission rights are reported at cost. Emission rights received for free are reported at nominal value ( i.e. at zero). Emission rights with an undeterminable useful life are tested for impairment on a quarterly basis and are report at cost deducted with accumulated amortization. The need for impairment is also tested in cases where there are indications that the assets may have decreased in value.\n\n## Intangible assets with a determinable useful life\n\n## Customer relations\n\nAcquired customer relations are reported at cost. Customer relations have a determinable useful life and are reported at cost less accumulated amortization. Straight line amortization is applied to allocate the costs for customer relations over their assessed useful life (six to twelve years).\n\n## Trademarks and licenses\n\nAcquired trademarks and licenses are reported at cost. Trademarks and licenses that have a determinable useful life are reported at cost less accumulated amortization. Straight line amortization is applied to allocate the costs for trademarks over their assessed useful life and licenses are amortized over the term of the agreement (five to ten years).\n\n## Software\n\nAcquired software licenses are capitalized on the basis of the costs incurred upon acquisition and placement into operation of the relevant software. These capitalized costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the assessed useful life (three to five years).\n\nExpenses for development and acquisition of new software are capitalized and reported as an intangible asset provided they have a significant value for the Company in the future and they can be deemed to have a useful life in excess of three years. These capitalized expenses are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the assessed useful life (three to five years). Expenses for training and software maintenance are, however, booked directly as costs.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n173",

Straight line amortization is applied to allocate the costs over their assessed useful life (five to fifteen years).\n\n## Impairment of non-financial assets\n\nIntangible assets with an undeterminable useful life (including goodwill) are not amortized but, rather, tested annually for any impairment or otherwise where signs indicate a decline in value. Other non-financial assets with an undeterminable useful life are tested when signs indicate a decline in value. Amortized assets are tested for impairment when signs indicate a decline in value. Where the estimated recovery value is less than the reported value, the asset is written down to the recovery value. The asset's period of use is then calculated and amortization commences. The recovery value is the asset's fair value reduced by selling expenses, or its useful value, whichever is higher. When testing for impairment, assets are grouped on the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units). With respect to assets other than financial assets and goodwill which have previously been impaired, an annual test is conducted as to whether a reversal should be made.\n\n## Leasing - Lessee\n\nThe right-of-use asset and lease liability are recognized at the start of the lease term. The lease liability is initially recognized at the present value of future lease payments discounted at the rate implicit in the lease agreement, or where this cannot be determined, the Group's incremental borrowing rate. Subsequent measurement of the lease liability is done by increasing the value to reflect the interest rate and the decrease the value due to payments. In addition, any remeasurements of the lease liability are taken into account.\n\nThe acquisition value of the right-of-use asset consists of the initial value of the lease liability plus any advance payments and other initial direct costs. Subsequent measurement of the right-of-use asset is at acquisition value less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment, and taking into account any remeasurements. Depreciation is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term or over the economic life of the asset if it is reasonably certain that title will transfer to the Group, for example, through exercising an option to purchase at the end of the lease term.\n\nAn exception to the principles that the Group is applying is applicable to low value leases, where no right-of-use asset or lease liability is recognized. These are recognized as a straight-line cost over the lease term. The Group\n\nNOTES\n\nAUDITOR'S REPORT\n\nSHAREHOLDER INFORMATION\n\ndefines low value leases as, for example, o/ffice equipment such as printers, copying machines, co/ffee machines and other assets having a value of less than around SEK 50 thousand in new condition.\n\nIn the Parent Company, all leasing agreements are recognized as a straight-line cost over the lease.\n\n## Financial assets\n\nFinancial assets include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, shares and participations, loan claims and derivative instruments. They are reported initially at an acquisition value corresponding to the fair value of the asset plus a supplement for transaction costs, with the exception of assets that are valued at fair value through profit or loss. Reporting thereafter is dependent on the classification of the asset. Financial assets are removed from the statement of financial position when the debt/instrument is finally paid or ceases to apply or is transferred through all risks and benefits being assigned to an external party.\n\nSpot purchases and sales of financial assets are reported on the Settlement day (i.e. the day on which the asset is delivered). Accounts receivable are reported in the statement of financial position when an invoice has been issued. The fair value of listed financial assets corresponds to the asset's listed transaction price on the balance sheet date. The fair value of unlisted financial assets is determined through use of valuation techniques, for example, recently conducted transactions, prices of similar instruments and discounted cash flows.\n\nFinancial assets are classified in three valuation categories: 'Fair value through profit or loss', 'amortized cost' and 'fair value through other comprehensive income'.\n\n- \u00b7  FAIR VALUE THROUGH PROFIT OR LOSS: Assets included in this category are financial assets that do not meet the requirements for valuation at amortized cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income. Financial assets and liabilities held for trading are always classified as 'Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss' as well as financial assets that are managed and evaluated based on fair values. Holdings in this category are reported as short-term investments if their term to maturity on the acquisition date is less than three months and as 'Other interest-bearing current receivables' if the term to maturity is between three and twelve months. Derivative instruments, except where used for cash flow hedge accounting, are included in this category as well. Assets in this category are valued regularly at fair value and changes in value are reported in the statement of profit or loss. Derivative instruments taken up in respect of business-related items are reported in the operating profit, while derivative instruments of a financial nature are reported in financial\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n174",

Assets in this category are included in current assets, with the exception of items with maturity dates more than twelve months after the balance sheet date, which are classified as non-current assets.\n\n- \u00b7  AMORTIZED COST: Financial assets found in this category have a business model to receive contractual cash flows and the contractual cash flows are payments only of principal and interest. Loans and receivables, investments and accounts receivable are financial assets that can be found in this category. The claims arise when cash, goods or services are provided directly to the debtor without an intention of trading in the receivables. Assets in this category are valued at amortized cost, less write-downs for expected credit losses. The amortized cost is determined based on the e/ffective interest rate, which is calculated on the acquisition date. Accounts receivable with a maturity of less than 12 months are not recognized at amortized cost, but at the amount that are expected to be received, net after deduction of expected credit losses. They are included in Current assets, except for items with a maturity in excess of 12 months after the closing date, which are reported as fixed assets.\n- \u00b7  FAIR VALUE THROUGH OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME: Financial assets (debt instruments) found in this category have a business model to both receive contractual cash flows and sell the asset and the contractual cash flows are payments only of principal and interest. Derivative instruments to which cash flow hedge accounting is applied are included in this category as well. Assets in this category are valued regularly at fair value with changes in value reported in other comprehensive income, except for foreign exchange gains and losses and write-downs of expected credit losses, which are recognized in the statement of profit or loss. Interest income based on the e/ffective interest method is reported in the statement of profit or loss. Upon removal of the investments from the statement of financial position, any accumulated profit or loss previously reported in comprehensive income is reversed to the statement of profit or loss. The accumulated results from the derivatives in equity are reversed to the statement of profit or loss in those periods in which the hedged item a/ffects earnings. The assets in this category are included in current assets, with the exception of items with maturity dates more than twelve months after the balance sheet date, which are classified as noncurrent assets.\n\nAt initial recognition, it is allowed to irrevocably classify equity instruments (shares) that are not held for trading purposes, at fair value through other comprehensive income. The subsequent changes in fair value, both unrealized and realized, are reported in other comprehensive income. The Group applies this for unlisted shares.\n\n## Other shares and participations\n\nConsist primarily of investments in equity instruments which do not have a listed market price.\n\n## Non-current receivables\n\nNon-current receivables are receivables held without any intention of Trading in the claim. Parts where the outstanding holding period is less than one year are reported among 'Other current interest-bearing receivables'.\n\n## Accounts receivable\n\nAccounts receivable are reported initially at transaction price and accounts receivable in excess of twelve months are reported at amortized cost applying the e/ffective interest rate method, less any provisions for expected credit losses. Accounts receivable are reported at the amount that is expected to be received (i.e. after deductions for bad debts). The Company has had no accounts receivable with a due date in excess of twelve months. Any impairment of accounts receivable takes place in selling expenses in the statement of profit or loss.\n\nThe reported accounts receivable include receivables that are subject to a factoring agreement. According to the agreement the Group has sold part of the accounts receivables and received liquid funds. The receivables cannot therefore be sold or pledged. These receivables are included in a pre-determined, defined customer group. The accounts receivables remain in the consolidated accounts with the remaining credit risk that is not transferred to the factoring company. When the accounts receivable is fully paid and no credit risk remains, the balance is derecognized in the consolidated accounts.\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents include cash, immediately accessible bank balances as well as other short-term deposits with an original term to maturity of less than three months (short-term investments). Investments with an original term to maturity of between three and twelve months are reported under 'Other current interestbearing receivables' and classified as assets valued at the fair value via the statement of profit or loss. Overdraft facilities are reported in the statement of financial position as borrowing among 'Current interestbearing liabilities'.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "BOARD OF DIRECTORS' REPORT\n\nSTATEMENTS\n\n5-YEAR SUMMARY\n\nPRINCIPLES\n\n## Impairment loss model for expected credit losses\n\nThe Group applies the simplified approach, that is, the provision will correspond to the expected loss over the entire life of the trade receivable. For other items subject to expected loan losses, a three-stage write-down model is applied. Initially, as well as on each balance sheet date, a loss provision is reported for the next 12 months or for a shorter period of time depending on the remaining maturity (stage 1). If there has been a significant increase in credit risk since the first accounting date, a loss reserve for the remaining maturity of the asset is reported (stage 2). For assets that are deemed to be impaired, credit is still reserved for expected credit losses for the remaining term (stage 3). The Group has defined a receivable as credit impaired if the receivable is delayed for more than 90 days or if other factors indicate that the receivable is credit impaired. Substantial increase in credit risk is defined as delayed payment by more than 30 days, or a significant deterioration in credit rating that does not result in a continued investment grade rating. The valuation of expected credit losses is based on di/fferent methods for di/fferent credit risk exposures. Provisions for expected credit losses have been made for accounts receivable. In addition, provision requirements for other financial assets are monitored and provision is made if necessary. The Group writes o/ff assets and receivables when there is no longer a probable expectation of receiving additional compensation for the asset or receivable.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories are valued at the lower of acquisition cost and net realizable value.\n\nThe Group applies the FIFO method (first in, first out) or weighted average value method to estimate the acquisition cost. The FIFO method is based on the assumption that goods that are purchased or produced first are sold first and that the units that remain in the warehouse at the end of a period are the ones that are bought or produced most recently. When calculating the acquisition value, a weighted average value is normally used to approximate FIFO.\n\nThe method based on weighted average prices means that the cost of each unit is determined from a weighted average of the cost values of similar units at the beginning of the period and of the cost values of the units purchased or produced during the period. The average figures can be calculated periodically or at each additional delivery, depending on the conditions of the individual company.\n\nThe net realizable value is normally calculated as the sales price less Production and selling expenses. With respect to products in the trading operations, the replacement cost with an added estimated gross margin is\n\nNOTES\n\nAUDITOR'S REPORT\n\nSHAREHOLDER INFORMATION\n\nused as the best gauge of the net realizable value. In respect of raw materials, the replacement cost is used as the best gauge of the net realizable value. However, raw materials are not written down below the acquisition value where the end product in which they are included is expected to be sold at a price which exceeds the manufacturing cost.\n\nWork in progress and finished inventories are valued at the manufacturing cost or the net realizable value, whichever is lower. Necessary provision is made for obsolescence.\n\nThe acquisition value of inventories includes all costs for purchasing, Production and other expenses incurred in bringing the goods to their current location and condition.\n\n## Employee benefits\n\n## Pensions\n\nWithin the Group there are both contribution-based and benefit-based Pension plans. Generally, the plans are financed through payments to insurance companies or manager-administered funds.\n\nIn the contribution-based plans, fixed fees are paid to a separate legal entity and there is no obligation, legal or informal, to pay any additional fees. In the contribution-based plans, payments are recognized as an expense during the period when the employees have performed the services to which the fees relate. Blue collar employees in Sweden are covered by such a contribution-based plan.\n\nIn the benefit-based plans, compensation is payable to employees and former employees based on salary at the time of retirement and upon termination of employment and the number of years in service. The Group bears the risk that the costs for the promised payments will be higher than estimated.\n\nIn the consolidated statement of financial position, the net of the estimated present value of the obligations and fair value of the managed assets is reported either as a long-term provision or as a long-term financial claim. In those cases where a surplus in a plan cannot be utilized in full, only that part of the surplus which can be recovered through reduced future fees or refunds is reported. Set-o/ff of a surplus in one plan against a deficit in another plan takes place only where a right of set-of exists.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "BOARD OF DIRECTORS' REPORT\n\nSTATEMENTS\n\n5-YEAR SUMMARY\n\nPRINCIPLES\n\nPension expenses and pension obligations for benefit-based plans are calculated in accordance with the Projected Unit Credit Method. The method allocates pension expenses as the employees perform the services that increase their entitlement to future compensation. The obligation is calculated by independent actuaries and constitutes the present value of the anticipated future disbursements. The discount rate that is applied corresponds to the rate of interest on high-quality corporate bonds with a term to maturity which corresponds to the average term for the obligations. The most important actuarial assumptions are stated in Note 13.\n\nActuarial profits or losses may arise upon determination of the present value of the obligations and the fair value of the managed assets. These arise either as a consequence of the actual result di/ffering from previously-made assumptions, or due to changes in the assumptions. Such actuarial profits and losses are recognized in their entirety in the Group's other comprehensive income when they arise. Net interest on defined benefit plan obligations and managed assets are reported as interest income or interest expense in the profit or loss.\n\nWhite-collar personnel in Sweden are covered by a collective benefit-based plan, the ITP (supplementary pensions for salaried employees) plan. The ITP plan has been financed through the purchase of pension insurance with the mutual insurance company, Alecta. However, at present no information is available which makes it possible to report this plan as a benefit-based plan. Accordingly, the plan is reported as a contributionbased plan, and thus premiums paid to Alecta during the year are reported as pension expenses.\n\nThe Parent Company and other legal entities within the Group report benefit-based pension plans in accordance with the local rules in each country.\n\n## Profit shares and variable salary\n\nSSAB employees are covered by a profit-sharing system which entitles them to a share in the profit above a minimum level. The Group Executive Committee and a number of other senior executives have instead salaries which contain a variable element related to the profit level and individually set targets. The costs for these systems are booked as accrued expenses regularly during the year as soon as it is likely that the targets will be met. In 2011, a long-term incentive program was introduced for the Company's senior executives, including the President, which is capped at 25% of fixed salary. The program runs for rolling three-year periods, is cashbased, and is linked to the total return on the SSAB share relative to a comparison group comprised of the\n\nNOTES\n\nAUDITOR'S REPORT\n\nSHAREHOLDER INFORMATION\n\nCompany's competitors. A percentage of the costs for the program are booked each year, based on a continuous assessment of the outcome for the three-year period.\n\n## Compensation upon termination of employment\n\nCompensation upon termination of employment is paid when employment is terminated prior to the normal retirement age or where an employee accepts voluntary retirement in exchange for such compensation. The Group reports severance compensation when the Group is demonstrably obliged either to terminate an employee in accordance with a detailed formal plan without the possibility of recall, or to provide compensation upon termination as a result of an o/ffer made in order to encourage voluntary retirement. Benefits which fall due more than twelve months from the balance sheet date are discounted to present value.\n\n## Provisions\n\nProvisions are reported when the Group has an obligation as a result of an event that has occurred and it is likely that payments will be demanded for fulfillment of the obligation. A further requirement is that it is possible to make a reliable estimation of the amount to be paid out. Provisions for restructuring measures are made when a detailed, formal plan for the measures is in place and well-founded expectations have been created among the parties that will be a/ffected by the measure, and this takes place prior to the balance sheet date.\n\n## Emission rights\n\nSSAB participates in the EU's emission rights trading system. Provision is made if a shortfall in emission rights is identified between owned rights and those rights which will have to be delivered due to emissions having taken place. The value of any surplus emission rights is reported only when it is realized as an external sale. Emission rights are reported as intangible assets and are booked at acquisition value.\n\n## Environmental restoration expenses\n\nExpenses for environmental measures associated with previous operations and which do not contribute to current or future revenue are booked as a cost when incurred. The environmental undertaking is calculated based on interpretations of applicable environmental legislation and regulations and reported when it is likely that payment liability will be incurred and a reasonable estimation can be made of such amount. Provisions have not been made for land clean-up to prepare the industrial areas for other use in the future, since it is not possible to make a reasonable estimation of when such cleanup will take place.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n177",

Reporting thereafter takes place depending on how the liabilities are classified. Financial liabilities are removed from the statement of financial position when the debt/instrument is paid in full or ceases to apply or is transferred through all risks and benefits being assigned to an external party.\n\n## Accounts payable\n\nAccounts payable are valued initially at fair value and thereafter at accrued acquisition value.\n\n## Loan debts\n\nLoan debts are valued initially at net fair value after transaction costs, and thereafter at amortized cost. The amortized cost is determined based on the e/ffective interest rate which was calculated when the loan was raised. Accordingly, premiums and discounts as well as direct issuance costs are allocated over the loan period. Fees paid for loan facilities are reported as transaction costs for borrowing to the extent that it is probable that part or all of the credit facility will be utilized. In such cases, the charge is recognized during the term when the credit facility is utilized. To the extent there is no evidence that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be utilized, the fee is capitalized as a prepayment for liquidity services and amortized over the period of the facility to which it relates.\n\nBorrowings are removed from the statement of financial position when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expired. The di/fference between the carrying amounts of a financial liability (or part of a financial liability) that has been extinguished or transferred to another party and the consideration paid, including any noncash assets transferred or liabilities assumed, is recognized in profit or loss. Where the terms of a financial liability are renegotiated and the entity issues equity instruments to a creditor to extinguish all or part of the liability (debt for equity swap), a gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss, which is measured as the di/fference between the carrying amount of the financial liability and the fair value of the equity instruments issued.\n\nLoans which constitute the hedged object in fair value hedging are valued and booked at fair value.\n\nNOTES\n\nAUDITOR'S REPORT\n\nSHAREHOLDER INFORMATION\n\n## Derivate instruments and hedging\n\nCurrency derivatives in the form of forward contracts and swaps are used to hedge the e/ffect of exchange rates on reported accounts payables and receivables in major currencies,  in conjunction with major projects and investments in non-current assets made in foreign currency, to hedge net investments in foreign subsidiaries, and to hedge Swedish kronor payment flows on foreign loans. Derivative instruments in the form of interest swaps are used to hedge exposure to interest rate risks.\n\n- \u00b7  All derivative instruments are reported in the statement of financial position at fair value. The method for reporting accrued profit/loss di/ffers, however, depending on the purpose of the derivative instrument. When a derivative contract is entered into, it is characterized as hedging of the fair value of a reported asset/ liability or of a signed delivery order ('fair value hedging'), hedging of a planned transaction ('cash flow hedging'), hedging of a net investment in a foreign company, or as a derivative instrument which does not meet the requirements for hedging accounting.\n- \u00b7  When the transaction is entered into, the Group documents the relationship between the hedge instrument and the hedged item, as well as the Group's risk management objectives and risk management strategy as regards the hedging. The Group also documents its assessment, both when hedging is entered into and on a regular basis, of whether the derivative instruments used in hedge transactions are e/ffective in counteracting changes in fair value or cash flows that relate to the hedged items. Assessment of the e/fficiency is prospective and if possible, it is done on a qualitative basis.\n- \u00b7  Information regarding fair value of various derivative instruments used for hedging purposes is set forth in Note 29. Changes in the hedging reserve in equity are set forth in Note 12. The entire fair value of a derivative instrument which constitutes a hedge instrument is classified as a non-current asset or noncurrent liability when the outstanding term of the hedged item exceeds twelve months and as a current asset or current liability when the outstanding term of the hedged item is less than twelve months.\n- \u00b7  Fair value hedging: Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments which are categorized as, and meet the requirements for, 'fair value hedging' are reported in the statement of profit or loss together with changes in the fair value of the asset/liability or the delivery order to which the hedging relates.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The profit or loss attributable to the ine/ffective part is reported immediately in financial items in the statement of profit or loss. Accumulated amounts in equity are reversed to the statement of profit or loss in those periods in which the hedged item a/ffects earnings. When a hedge instrument lapses or is sold, or when the hedging no longer fulfills the criteria for hedge accounting and there are accumulated profits or losses in equity regarding the hedging, such profits or losses remain in equity and are reported as income at the same time as the forecast transaction is finally reported in the statement of profit or loss. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the accumulated profit or loss which is reported in equity is transferred immediately to the statement of profit or loss. Where the transfer relates to cash flow hedging of financial items, it is reported in the statement of profit or loss among financial items.\n- \u00b7  Net investment hedging: Hedging of net investments in foreign companies is reported in the same manner as cash flow hedging. The e/ffective part of changes in value of derivative instruments and liabilities, which are used as hedge instruments, is reported in other comprehensive income. The ine/ffective part of changes in value is reported immediately in financial items in the statement of profit or loss. Accumulated profits and losses in equity are reported in the statement of profit or loss when the foreign operations are divested, in whole or in part.\n- \u00b7  Sources of hedge ine/ffectiveness that may arise during the term of the hedging relationship are a significant changes in credit risk of one of the parties and, in case of cash flow hedge, change in timing of the payment of the hedged item, or that secured volume based on highly probably forecasts would exceed actual outcomes.\n- \u00b7  Certain derivative transactions do not meet the formal criteria for hedge accounting, these are reported in the  profit or loss. Derivatives for operating items are reported in operating profit/loss, while derivatives of a financial nature are reported among financial items.\n\nDerivative instruments which are reported in hedge accounting and executed in respect of business-related items are reported in operating profit, while derivative instruments of a financial nature are reported in financial items. The fair value of currency forward contracts and currency swaps is calculated based on forward contract\n\nNOTES\n\nAUDITOR'S REPORT\n\nSHAREHOLDER INFORMATION\n\nprices on the balance sheet date, while interest rate swaps are valued calculated on the basis of future discounted cash flows.\n\n## Taxes\n\nThe Group's reported tax expenses consist of tax on the taxable earnings of Group companies for the period as well as any adjustments with respect to tax for previous periods and changes in deferred tax.\n\n## Deferred tax\n\nDeferred tax is calculated in order to correspond to the tax e/ffect which arises when final tax is triggered. It corresponds to the net e/ffect of tax on all di/fferences between the tax value of assets and liabilities and their value for accounting purposes (temporary di/fferences), applying the future tax rates already decided upon or announced which will apply when the tax is expected to be realized.\n\n- \u00b7  Temporary di/fferences arise primarily through accelerated depreciation of non-current assets, profits from intra-group inventory transactions, untaxed reserves in the form of tax allocation reserves, non-utilized losses carried forward, as well as fair value adjustments in conjunction with business combinations. A deferred tax receivable due to losses carried forward is, however, recognized as an asset only to the extent that it is likely that the deduction can be set o/ff against future surpluses.\n- \u00b7  In the Parent Company's statement of financial position, the accumulated values of Accelerated depreciation and other untaxed reserves are reported in the item 'Untaxed reserves' without deduction of the deferred tax. In the Parent Company's statement of profit or loss, changes in the untaxed reserves are reported on a separate line.\n\n## Dividends\n\nDividends proposed by the Board of Directors do not reduce equity until the annual general meeting has adopted a resolution regarding payment of the dividend.\n\n## Dividends, the Parent Company\n\nAn anticipated dividend is reported in those cases where the Parent Company is exclusively entitled to decide on the amount of the dividend and the Parent Company, prior to the date on which its financial statements are\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Cash and cash equivalents in the cash flow statement consist of cash and bank balances as well as short-term investments with a term to maturity of less than three months from the acquisition date, which are exposed to only an insignificant risk of change in value.\n\n## Segment reporting\n\n## Operating segments\n\nThe Group is organized in five reportable operating segments with clear profit responsibility. The operating segments are the three steel divisions: SSAB Special Steels, SSAB Europe, SSAB Americas and the subsidiaries Tibnor and Ruukki Construction. Tibnor and Ruukki Construction are operated as independent subsidiaries by their respective Boards. In addition, there are other operating segments which are not reportable since they do not reach the threshold values in IFRS 8 and they are not monitored separately by the Group Executive Committee. The segment reporting takes place in such a manner that it corresponds to the internal reporting which is submitted to the Group Executive Committee. The Group Executive Committee is the highest Executive decision-making body which is responsible for the allocation of resources and assessment of the results of operating segments, and takes strategic decisions. A more detailed description of the reportable segments and their operations is provided on p. 138-144 in Note 28.\n\n## Assets and liabilities held for sale\n\nSignificant non-current assets (or divestments groups) are classified as Non-current assets held for sale when their reported value will primarily be recovered through a sales transaction and a sale is deemed to be very likely. They are reported at reported value or fair value less selling expenses, whichever is lower, if their book value is primarily recovered through a sales transaction and not through permanent use.\n\nPRINCIPLES\n\nNOTES\n\nAUDITOR'S REPORT\n\nSHAREHOLDER INFORMATION\n\n## Earnings per share\n\nEarnings per share before dilution are calculated based on the year's earnings in the Group attributable to the Parent Company's ordinary shareholders, and on a weighted average number of shares. When calculating earnings per share after dilution, earnings and the average numbers of shares are adjusted to take into account the e/ffects of dilutive potential ordinary shares.

'Other members of the Company's senior management' mean members of the Group Executive Committee. The total compensation package shall be at market terms and conditions and competitive in the employment market in which the executive works. Fixed salary and variable compensations shall be related to the executive's responsibilities and authority. The variable compensations shall be based on results as compared with defined and measurable targets and shall be subject to a ceiling in relation to the fixed salary. The variable compensations shall not be included in the basis for computation of pension, except in those cases where so provided in the rules of a general pension plan, e.g. in the Swedish ITP plan. For senior executives outside Sweden, all or parts of the variable compensations may be included in the basis for pension computation due to legislation or competitive practice in the local market.\n\nThe variable compensation programs should be structured such that the Board of Directors has the possibility, should exceptional circumstances prevail, to restrict the payment of variable compensations, or to decline to make such payment, where such a measure is deemed reasonable and compatible with the company's responsibilities to its shareholders, employees and other stakeholders.\n\nConsultant fees in line with prevailing market conditions may be payable insofar as any director performs work on behalf of the company, in addition to the Board work.\n\nThe period of notice of termination of employment for senior executives in Sweden shall be six months in the event of termination by the executive. In the event of termination by the company, the total of the period of notice of termination and the period during which severance compensation is payable shall not exceed 24 months. For senior executives outside Sweden, the termination period and severance compensation may vary due to legislation or practice on the local market.\n\nPension benefits shall be contribution-based with individual retirement ages, in no case earlier than the age of 62. In the event the employment terminates prior to the retirement age, the executive shall receive a paid-up policy for earned pension.\n\nThe Board of Directors shall be entitled to deviate from the guidelines where special reasons exist in an individual case.\n\nWithin the Board of Directors there is a Remuneration Committee, which makes proposals to the Board regarding the President's salary and other employment terms and conditions, and determines the salary and other employment terms and conditions for the Group Executive Committee in accordance with guidelines decided upon by the AGM. The Committee consists of Bengt Kjell (Chairman), Petra Einarsson and Bo Annvik. The President is a co-opted member of the Committee but does not participate in discussions concerning his own salary and employment terms and conditions.\n\n## Compensation in 2020\n\nCompensation to the President and other members of the Group Executive Committee consisted of a fixed salary component, a short-term variable salary component, and a long-term variable salary component. There is no share-related compensation.\n\nThe short-term variable salary component is related to: A) three Group objectives, 1. EBITDA margin relative to other comparable steel companies (Arcelor Mittal, AK Steel, Nucor, Salzgitter, ThyssenKrupp, US Steel and Tata Steel Europe), 2. net cash flow objective and 3. a sustainability objective established by the Board, measuring injury frequency, combined with B) divisional financial and operational objectives as well as C) one or more individual objectives. The individual objectives account for 15% of the total short-term variable pay. The other 85% relate to SSAB Group objectives and divisional objectives. SSAB Group objectives account for 85% of the President's short-term variable salary. For Executive Vice Presidents of Group functions, SSAB Group objectives account for 70% of short-term variable salary and for divisional Executive Vice Presidents 30-40%. Financial or operational divisional or functional objectives account for the remaining part.\n\nThis short-term variable salary component is capped at 75% of fixed salary for the President and at 50% for others. The divisional head of SSAB Americas receives variable compensation which is considered to be competitive in the local market. The target result is 60% of fixed salary but may amount to a maximum of 180% in the event of extremely high performance.\n\nIn 2011, a long-term incentive program was introduced covering at the time a maximum of 100 (now 150) key persons throughout the Group, including the company's President and other senior executives. The purpose of the program is to promote the company's ability to recruit and retain key contributors. The program applies for rolling three-year periods, is cash-based and linked to the total return on the SSAB share compared with a comparison group comprising the company's competitors (Arcelor Mittal, AK Steel, Nucor, Salzgitter, ThyssenKrupp and US Steel) and return on capital employed. For participants in the program outside North America, the result is capped at between 18% and 30% of fixed salary. The outcome for participants in North America is capped at between 30% and\n\n<!-- image -->",

The total annual cost for the program is SEK 35 million in the event of target realization, and SEK 80 million in the event of maximum realization, of which approximately 41% constitutes the cost for participants in North America.\n\nPayments under the long-term incentive program take place in cash and on condition that the employment remains.\n\n## President and Chief Executive O/fficer\n\nThe total paid compensation package, excluding pension, amounted to SEK 18.5 (15.2) million out of which the shortterm variable pay amounts to SEK 5.2 (2.3) million, which is 61% of the maximum outcome of the program or 46% of the annual base pay. The retirement age is 62. The pension is based on contributions and is covered by insurance. The cost amounted to  49 (42)% of fixed salary. Earned pension is inviolable but premium payments cease upon termination of employment. There is a 12-month notice period in the event of dismissal by the company. In addition, in such situation, severance compensation is payable equal to 12 months' salary. In the event of the President's resignation, the termination period is 6 months and, in such a situation, there is no entitlement to severance compensation. Variable salary components are earned during the termination period only on condition that the President remains in active service.\n\n## Other Group Executive Committee members\n\nApart from the President, the Group Executive Committee comprised 10 (10) persons. The Group Executive Committee is presented in the Corporate Governance Report.\n\nThe total paid compensation package, excluding pension, amounted to SEK 49.7 (47.6) million out of which the short-term variable pay amounts to SEK 13.5 (9.8) million, which is 61% of the maximum outcome of the program.\n\nThe minimum retirement age for members of the Group Executive Committee is 62. Pensions are based on contributions, exceptions from this are Olavi Huhtala. He continues to be covered by the benefit-based pension scheme with a retirement age of 60 via Rautaruukin El\u00e4kes\u00e4\u00e4ti\u00f6, of which he has long been covered through his employment at Rautaruukki, as well as Charles Schmitt, whose pension scheme is in accordance with US legislation and practice.\n\nThe other members of the Group Executive Committee are entitled to 12 months' notice in the event of dismissal by the company. In addition, in such a situation, severance compensation is payable equivalent to 6 months' salary. Members of the Group Executive committee must give 6 months' notice of resignation, whereupon there is no entitlement to severance compensation.\n\nAUDITOR'S REPORT\n\nSHAREHOLDER INFORMATION\n\nNOTES\n\nNo change of control clause is applied.\n\nTotal compensation and benefits are shown in the adjacent table:\n\n| Compensation and benefits for the President and other members of the Group Executive Committee 1)   |   President |   President |   Other Group Executive Committee |   Other Group Executive Committee |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| SEK millions                                                                                        |      2020   |      2019   |                            2020   |                            2019   |\n| Fixed salary 2)                                                                                     |        11.6 |        12   |                              31.3 |                              32   |\n| Other benefits 3)                                                                                   |         0.4 |         0.5 |                               1.6 |                               4.1 |\n| Short-term variable salary 4)                                                                       |         5.2 |         2.3 |                              13.5 |                               9.8 |\n| Long-term variable salary 4)                                                                        |         1.3 |         0.4 |                               2.3 |                               1.7 |\n| Total compensation                                                                                  |        18.5 |        15.2 |                              48.8 |                              47.6 |\n| Pension expenses                                                                                    |         5.6 |         5.1 |                              12.1 |                              10.7 |\n| Total                                                                                               |        24.1 |        20.3 |                              60.9 |                              58.3 |\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Group's most significant assets with an undeterminable useful life is allocated to the Group's cash-generating units below:\n\n## Assets with an undeterminable useful life\n\n| SEK millions                                       | 2020   | 2019   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Goodwill                                           |        |        |\n| SSAB North America (in Division SSAB Americas)     | 22,325 | 25,388 |\n| SSAB Special Steels                                | 2,813  | 3,046  |\n| SSAB Europe                                        | 2,085  | 2,171  |\n| Tibnor                                             | 512    | 533    |\n| Ruukki Construction                                | 140    | 140    |\n| Total goodwill                                     | 27,872 | 31,279 |\n| Ruukki Construction (Trademark Rautaruukki)        | 397    | 467    |\n| Total assets with an undeterminable useful life 1) | 28,269 | 31,746 |\n\nSSAB North America is included in the SSAB Americas division. For more information about SSAB Americas and the other divisions, see Note 28. Recoverable amounts for cash-generating units are based on value in used calculations. The calculations are based on the company's budget and forecasts regularly produced by the management team. Cash flow beyond a five-year period have been extrapolated applying an assessed rate of growth in accordance with the information below. The rate growth does not exceed the long-term rate of growth for the market in which these cash-generating units operate.\n\n## FINANCIAL REPORTS 2020\n\nAUDITOR'S REPORT\n\nSHAREHOLDER INFORMATION\n\nNOTES\n\nSignificant assumptions used in calculations of use value are shown in the table below:\n\n| 2020                                          |   SSAB  North America |   SSAB   Special Steels |   SSAB  Europe |   Tibnor |   Ruukki  Construction |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|----------------|----------|------------------------|\n| Assessed long-term rate of growth, %          |                   2   |                     2   |            2   |      2   |                    2   |\n| Weighted average discount rate, before tax, % |                   9.9 |                     7.8 |            7.7 |      7.9 |                    7.5 |\n\n| 2019                                          |   SSAB  North America |   SSAB  Special Steels |   SSAB  Europe |   Tibnor |   Ruukki  Construction |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|----------------|----------|------------------------|\n| Assessed long-term rate of growth, %          |                   2   |                    2   |            2   |      2   |                    2   |\n| Weighted average discount rate, before tax, % |                  11.2 |                    7.8 |            7.7 |      7.9 |                    7.6 |\n\nThe assumptions above have been used to analyze the cash-generating unit.\n\nThe management has established the budgeted and forecast gross margin based on historical results and expectations regarding market trends and each specific cash-generating unit. The rate of growth used for the margin before depreciation, EBITDA, corresponds to the forecasts available in industry and analyst reports. The discount rate used is stated before tax and reflects specific risks applicable locally for each specific cashgenerating unit.\n\nCalculations conducted using the above assumptions have demonstrated that no impairment of goodwill exists at December 31. For a sensitivity analysis, see Note 32.\n\n## Emission rights\n\nThe estimated consumption of emission rights in 2020 was 8.19 (8.75) million tons. No emission rights were sold in 2020 or 2019. The allocated rights were su/fficient for consumption in 2020. The emission rights are reported as intangible assets, with granted emission rights being booked at an acquisition value of SEK 0. At year-end SSAB owned emission rights were valued at SEK 135 (141) million, which are reported as an intangible asset.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n191",

The defined benefit plans cover retirement pension and survivors' pensions. For the defined contributions plans, continuous payments to authority and to independent bodies is done and therefor they take over the obligations towards the employees.\n\nThe obligation reported in the balance sheet is derived from the defined benefit plans.\n\nWithin the Group, there are both defined contribution and defined benefit pension plans. For defined contribution plans and for pension plans for salaried employees in Sweden who are subscribed to Alecta, the premiums are reported as the year's expense for the past period. The Group's major pension plans are Rautaruukki's Finnish pension scheme (A-s\u00e4\u00e4ti\u00f6), Finnish defined benefit plans and the Norwegian pension scheme (CCB Pensionskasse) but there are also smaller pension plans in Sweden and in the US.\n\nActuarial gains / losses for defined benefit plans are reported in Other comprehensive income. The actuarial gains on pension liabilities net have arisen mainly due to higher return on plan assets, o/ffset by lower discount rates.\n\nThe plans are covered by a re-insured provision in the balance sheet and by pension benefit plans and funds. The calculations are based on the Projected Unit Credit Method using the assumptions shown in the table on p. 205. The method distributes the cost of pensions as employees perform services that increase their entitlement to future benefits.\n\nThe obligation is calculated by independent actuaries and is the present value of the expected future payments.\n\nSSAB's forecast payment of pensions in relation to defined benefit plans, both funded and unfunded, amounts to SEK 27 million for 2021.\n\n## Sweden\n\nLabourers are included in the SAF / LO plan which is a defined contribution pension plan based on collective agreements and that include several employers within several branches. White-collar workers are included in the ITP plan, which also is based on collective agreements and comprises several employers within several branches. The ITP plan has two parts, the ITP1, a defined contribution pension plan which is valid for employees born 1979 or later, as well as ITP2, a defined contribution pension plan which is valid for employees born before 1979. The major part of the ITP2 plan is managed by SSAB within the FPG / PRI system. Financing takes place through a provision which is safe gurarded by a credit insurance in F\u00f6rs\u00e4kringsbolaget PRI Pension guarantee. One part of the ITP2 plan is safe guarded through an insurance within Alecta. In SSAB AB, there is in excess of above obligations other defined benefit obligations applied to individual pension agreements to earlier employees and pensions to senior executives.\n\nSome of the white-collar workers in Sweden are safeguarded by the ITP2 plan defined benefit pension obligations for age- and family pension (alternative family pension) through an insurance by Alecta. According to a statement from Swedish Financial Reporting Board, UFR 10 the classification for ITP plans, which is financed by insurance by Alecta, this is a defined benefit that comprises several employers. For the financial year 2020 (as in 2019) the company did not have access to all information to be able to disclose their proportional share of the obligation of the plan, the plan assets and the cost of administration, which means that is has not been possible to account for the plans as a defined benefit plan. The pension plan ITP2 which is safeguarded through an insurance by Alecta is therefore accounted as a defined contribution plan. The premium for the defined benefit ageand family pension is individual and calculated based on salary, earlier earned pension and expected remaining period of service. The expected fee for the next reporting period for ITP2 insurances that are with Alecta amount to SEK 52 million.\n\nThe collective consolidation level consists of the market value of the assets in Alecta, in percent of insurance obligations calculated in accordance with the insurance technical methods and assumptions by Alecta, which do not correspond with IAS 19. The collective consolidation level shall normally be allowed to vary between 125 and 155 percent. If the collective consolidation level in Alecta is below 125 percent or exceeds 155 percent, action shall be taken in order to make assumptions so the consolidation level will revert to the normal interval. At a low consolidation level, one action can be to increase the agreed fee for new take out and/or increase of existing benefits. At a high consolidation level, one action can be to implement premium reductions. At the end of the year, Alecta's surplus, in the form of a collective consolidation level, was 148 (148) percent.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

A decrease in the bond loan interest rate increases pension liabilities, although this is partly o/ffset by an increase in the value of plan assets.\n\n## Inflation risk\n\nPension liabilities are subject to inflation and an increase in inflation increases pension liabilities.\n\nAUDITOR'S REPORT\n\nSHAREHOLDER INFORMATION\n\nNOTES\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Furthermore, it is likely that changes to the assumptions occurs. Estimations have been done by analyzing every change separately. If there should be any relation between the assumptions, the estimations have not taken this into consideration. The assumptions of a decrease in life expectancy is seen as limited and therefore it has not been estimated in the sensitivity analysis.\n\n## FINANCIAL REPORTS 2020\n\nAUDITOR'S REPORT\n\nSHAREHOLDER INFORMATION\n\nNOTES\n\n<!-- image -->",

To the extent such a transfer is not exempt from taxation, the Parent Company determines the date of such transfer and such transfer will not take place within the foreseeable future.\n\n## Changes in deferred tax (receivables +/liabilities -), Group\n\n|                                                  | 2020                                     | 2020              | 2020               | 2020                      | 2020                           | 2020   | 2020   | 2019                                     | 2019              | 2019               | 2019                      | 2019                           | 2019   | 2019   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------|--------|--------|------------------------------------------|-------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| SEK millions                                     | Accelerated depreciation of fixed assets | Unused tax losses | Pension provisions | Long-term deferred income | Deferred tax on surplus values | Other  | Total  | Accelerated depreciation of fixed assets | Unused tax losses | Pension provisions | Long-term deferred income | Deferred tax on surplus values | Other  | Total  |\n| Opening balance, January 1                       | 1,553                                    | 259               | 111                | 106                       | -325                           | 1,075  | -327   | -1,607                                   | 8                 | 81                 | 125                       | -407                           | 1,263  | -537   |\n| Changes against earnings                         | -115                                     | 80                | 46                 | 3                         | 69                             | 355    | 438    | 61                                       | 173               | -14                | -47                       | 142                            | 19     | 335    |\n| Changes against other comprehensive income       | -                                        | -                 | 2                  | -                         | -                              | -181   | -179   | -                                        | -                 | 5                  | -                         | -                              | -61    | -56    |\n| Changes against   investment grant               | -                                        | -                 | -                  | -70                       | -                              | -      | -70    | -                                        | -                 | -                  | 23                        | -                              | -      | 23     |\n| Increase due to acquisition of shares/operations | -                                        | -                 | -                  | -                         | -2                             | -      | -2     | -                                        | -                 | -                  | -                         | -47                            | -      | -47    |\n| Decrease due to disposal of shares/operations    | -                                        | -                 | -                  | -                         | 7                              | -      | 7      | -                                        | -                 | -                  | -                         | -                              | -      | -      |\n| Translation di/fference                          | 112                                      | -9                | -8                 | -6                        | 21                             | -120   | -10    | -8                                       | 78                | 38                 | 5                         | -13                            | -146   | -45    |\n| Closing balance,  December 31, net               | -1,556                                   | 329               | 151                | 33                        | -230                           | 1,128  | -143   | -1,553                                   | 259               | 111                | 106                       | -325                           | 1,075  | -327   |\n\nAUDITOR'S REPORT\n\nSHAREHOLDER INFORMATION\n\nNOTES\n\n<!-- image -->",

The business segments consist of the three steel divisions: SSAB Special Steels, SSAB Europe and SSAB Americas, as well as the fully owned subsidiaries: Tibnor and Ruukki Construction.\n\nSegment information provided is as follows;\n\n## Revenue and results per business segment\n\n|                                                 | Total revenue   | Total revenue   | of which internal sales   | of which internal sales   | Operating profit/loss   | Operating profit/loss   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| SEK millions                                    | 2020            | 2019            | 2020                      | 2019                      | 2020                    | 2019                    |\n| Business segment:                               |                 |                 |                           |                           |                         |                         |\n| SSAB Special Steels                             | 16,143          | 18,495          | 437                       | 557                       | 1,506                   | 1,454                   |\n| SSAB Europe                                     | 27,954          | 31,730          | 5,031                     | 5,915                     | -1,113                  | -677                    |\n| SSAB Americas                                   | 13,266          | 17,460          | 108                       | 198                       | -293                    | 2,128                   |\n| Tibnor                                          | 8,241           | 9,149           | 120                       | 150                       | 96                      | 30                      |\n| Ruukki Construction                             | 5,516           | 6,510           | 26                        | 40                        | 314                     | 283                     |\n| Other                                           | -               | -               | -                         | -                         | -489                    | -233                    |\n| Depreciation/amortization on  surplus values 1) | -               | -               | -                         | -                         | -346                    | -827                    |\n| Items a/ffecting comparability 2)               | -               | -               | -                         | -                         | -                       | -197                    |\n| Group adjustments                               | -5,722          | -6,859          | -5,722                    | -6,859                    | -                       | -                       |\n| Total                                           | 65,396          | 76,485          | -                         | -                         | -325                    | 1,961                   |\n\nAUDITOR'S REPORT\n\nSHAREHOLDER INFORMATION\n\nNOTES\n\nTibnor and Ruukki Construction are operated as independent subsidiaries by their respective Boards and act at arm's length in relation to SSAB. For more information about each business segment, see p. 138. In addition, there are other business segments that are not reportable since they do not reach the threshold values set forth in IFRS 8 and they are not monitored separately by the Group Executive Committee. They are included in 'Other'.\n\nSegment reporting takes place in a manner which corresponds to the internal reporting provided to the Group Executive Committee. The Group Executive Committee is the highest executive decision-maker responsible for the allocation of resources, assessment of the business segments' results, and making strategic decisions.\n\n| Balance and   cash flow information  per business segment   | Depreciation and  amortization   | Depreciation and  amortization   | Maintenance  expenditures   | Maintenance  expenditures   | Strategic expenditures   | Strategic expenditures   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n| SEK millions                                                | 2020                             | 2019                             | 2020                        | 2019                        | 2020                     | 2019                     |\n| Business segment:                                           |                                  |                                  |                             |                             |                          |                          |\n| SSAB Special Steels                                         | 619                              | 627                              | 347                         | 435                         | 111                      | 66                       |\n| SSAB Europe                                                 | 1,667                            | 1,622                            | 1,049                       | 1,066                       | 230                      | 518                      |\n| SSAB Americas                                               | 708                              | 724                              | 115                         | 283                         | 189                      | 363                      |\n| Tibnor                                                      | 144                              | 176                              | 47                          | 60                          | 7                        | 47                       |\n| Ruukki Construction                                         | 170                              | 183                              | 43                          | 72                          | 45                       | 41                       |\n| Other                                                       | 34                               | 58                               | 21                          | -40                         | -                        | -                        |\n| Depreciation/amortization on  surplus values 1)             | 346                              | 827                              | -                           | -                           | -                        | -                        |\n| Total                                                       | 3,689                            | 4,216                            | 1,622                       | 1,875                       | 582                      | 1,035                    |\n\n<!-- image -->",

Most financial transactions take place through the Parent Company's finance function in Stockholm and through SSAB Finance Ireland in Ireland. For a detailed description of the Group's financial risks, see p. 156.\n\n## Refinancing risks (liquidity risks)\n\nAt year-end, long-term borrowing amounted to SEK 9,031 (9,853) million. Borrowing takes place primarily through the bank market and through existing note programs. For long-term borrowing up to ten years, a European Medium Term Note program (EMTN) is used, while Swedish and Finnish commercial paper programs are used for borrowing for short terms (< 1 year). The program limit of the EMTN program is EUR 2,000 million, while the Swedish commercial paper program has a limit of SEK 5,000 million and the Finnish commercial paper program has a limit of EUR 500 million.\n\nAUDITOR'S REPORT\n\nSHAREHOLDER INFORMATION\n\nNOTES\n\nAt year-end, long-term borrowing within the EMTN program amounted to SEK 4,505 (4,567) million, while borrowing within the Swedish commercial paper program amounted to SEK 1,365 (500) million and borrowing within the Finnish commercial paper program amounted to EUR 93 (30) million.\n\nAt year-end, the Group's liquidity bu/ffer, consisting of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and non-utilized binding credit facilities, amounted to SEK 21,522 (10,318) million, equal to 33% (13%) of revenue.\n\nTo the extent surplus liquidity arises, the first priority is to repay loans. If that is not possible, the funds are invested in government securities or deposited with approved banks.\n\nThe total loan portfolio at year-end was SEK 14,991 (12,609) million, with an average term to maturity of 4.7 (7.1) years. The maturity structure during the coming years is presented in Note 16.\n\nThe contractual payments on the outstanding loan debt, including interest payments and derivative instruments, are shown in the following table:\n\n## December 31, 2020\n\n| SEK millions                                      | Book value   | Contractual  cash flow   | 2021   | 2022   | 2023   | 2024   | 2025   | Later   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|---------|\n| Loans                                             |              |                          |        |        |        |        |        |         |\n| Capital market loans                              | 7,982        | 8,439                    | 151    | 1,119  | 1,600  | 2,036  | 71     | 3,462   |\n| Bank loans                                        | 1,681        | 1,716                    | 668    | 976    | 73     | -      | -      | -       |\n| Other                                             | 5,328        | 5,339                    | 5,339  | -      | -      | -      | -      | -       |\n| Total, loans                                      | 14,991       | 15,494                   | 6,157  | 2,095  | 1,672  | 2,036  | 71     | 3,462   |\n| Accounts payable                                  | 11,068       | 11,068                   | 11,068 | -      | -      | -      | -      | -       |\n| Derivatives, outflow                              | 860          | 860                      | 805    | 26     | 12     | 12     | 5      | -       |\n| Derivatives, inflow                               | 227          | 227                      | 224    | 2      | 1      | 0      | 0      | -       |\n| Total, including accounts payable and derivatives | 26,692       | 27,195                   | 17,807 | 2,118  | 1,683  | 2,048  | 76     | 3,462   |\n\nInterest flows are calculated based on interest rates and exchange rates at year-end.

        "page_content": "STATEMENTS\n\n5-YEAR SUMMARY\n\nPRINCIPLES\n\n## 29 Financial risk management cont.\n\n## Market risks\n\nMarket risks are the risk of changes in market prices, such as interest rates and exchange rates, which can a/ffect the Group's earnings or financial position.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nAt year-end, the total interest-bearing loan amounted to SEK 14,991 (12,609) million, of which SEK 6,523 (4,796) million carry is fixed interest or is swapped to fixed interest. Including the interest rate swaps, the average fixed interest term was 0.9 (1.1) years. Given the same net debt as at the end of the year, including interest hedging, a change in market interest rates of 100 basis points (1 percentage point), would change earnings after tax by approximately SEK 48 (37) million. Loans which are subject to rate negotiation in the coming years are shown in Note 16.\n\nAt year-end, the value of interest rate swaps converting floating to fixed interest (entered into to secure cash flow in conjunction with interest payments) was SEK -9 (-4) million, which is reported in Other comprehensive income. No ine/fficiency was identified during the year.\n\nThe Group's interest-bearing assets amounted to SEK 8,289 (4,189) million and consisted almost exclusively of cash and cash equivalents at variable interest rates.\n\n## Currency risk\n\nAccording to the finance policy, currency hedging takes place mainly to minimize the translation risk associated with the impact of changes in exchange rates on the net debt/equity ratio. Reported accounts payable and receivables in major currencies (currently EUR, USD and GBP) are hedged in order to minimize the e/ffect of exchange rates to the Group's income statement.\n\nMajor investments and projects decided upon in foreign currency are hedged in their entirety. Other commercial currency flows that arise in connection with purchases and sales in foreign currency are short-term in nature and thus no hedging takes place. Instead, they are exchanged on the spot market.\n\nAUDITOR'S REPORT\n\nSHAREHOLDER INFORMATION\n\nNOTES\n\nThe Group had a total net inflow of foreign currency. The net foreign currency inflow in 2020 was SEK -0.5 (3.7) billion. The Group's most important currency flows are shown in the diagram on p. 157.\n\nA five percentage point devaluation including hedges of the Swedish krona against the Group's two most important currencies, USD and EUR, would have a negative impact on earnings after tax of approximately SEK -30 (-130) million with respect to USD and a positive impact of just over SEK 13 (145) million with respect to EUR. Additionally, Equity would be positively a/ffected by the translation e/ffect of foreign subsidiaries, net of equity hedges, with about SEK 1,886 (2,285) million.\n\nIn 2020, net exchange rate di/fferences were reported in the amount of SEK -112 (-176) million in operating profit and SEK 10 (3) million in financial items.\n\nAs per December 31, the breakdown per currency of account receivables, other current receivables and derivative instruments was as follows:\n\n| Breakdown per currency    | Group   | Group   | Parent Company   | Parent Company   |\n|---------------------------|---------|---------|------------------|------------------|\n| SEK millions              | 2020    | 2019    | 2020             | 2019             |\n| SEK                       | 1,133   | 1,165   | 10               | 16               |\n| USD                       | 1,867   | 1,793   | 188              | 26               |\n| EUR                       | 2,631   | 2,740   | 26               | 3                |\n| Other currencies          | 1,883   | 2,007   | 6                | 12               |\n| Total                     | 7,513   | 7,705   | 230              | 58               |\n| Of which:                 |         |         |                  |                  |\n| Accounts receivable       | 6,905   | 6,945   | 3                | 1                |\n| Other current receivables | 385     | 501     | 8                | 12               |\n| Derivative instruments 1) | 224     | 259     | 219              | 45               |\n| Total                     | 7,513   | 7,705   | 230              | 58               |\n\n- 1) Derivative instruments are included in the balance sheet item 'Prepaid expenses and accrued income' with the amount of SEK 224 (259) million and, for the Parent Company, SEK 219 (45) million\n\n<!-- image -->",

At year-end, the total counterparty risk was SEK 7,081 (3,799) million, of which derivative instruments accounted for SEK 30 (208) million and investments in cash and cash equivalents amounted to SEK 7,051 (3,591) million.\n\nIn addition to the above, there are credit risks associated with accounts receivable and other receivables, which are managed in each subsidiary. Prior to write down in respect of impairment, these receivables had a gross value of SEK 7,464 (7,655) million. There is no concentration of credit risk since the risk is allocated over a large number of customers spread throughout the world. In addition, individual credit rating tests are conducted and limits imposed for each customer.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The impairment test is carried out by the respective subsidiary in accordance with the credit risk management process. For receivables with objective evidence of impairment, write-down calculations are made on an individual level, taking into account both historical, prevailing and forward-looking factors. For other receivables, which have a higher credit quality, and receivables of lesser value, a collective calculation is made of expected credit losses based on historical loss level, taking into account current and prospective factors. Expected credit losses in relation to gross amounts of outstanding claims amount to 2.5%. Liquid funds are also subject to the requirement for impairment, but expected credit losses for these holdings are considered immaterial.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n223",

The translation exposure is hedged primarily through loans in the same currency, in the absence of which currency derivatives may be used instead. At year-end, these net investments amounted to EUR 872 (861) million and USD 4,617 (4,615) million. Loans and derivatives which were hedged, amounted to EUR 153 (110) million and USD 887 (545) million at year-end. The accumulated change in fair value of hedging reserve for loans and derivatives which has been identified as hedging instruments, amounted to SEK -5,087 (-5,865) million at year end. No ine/fficiency was identified during 2020.\n\nAt year-end, the net investment in USD was hedged with loans amounting to USD 587 (679) million and derivative instruments amounting to USD 300 (134) million. Net investment in EUR at year end was hedged with loans amounting to EUR 185 (205) million and derivative instruments amounting to EUR -32 (-95) million.\n\nCurrency derivatives are valued at fair value in the balance sheet. As regards the currency hedging which meets the requirements for hedge accounting pursuant to IFRS 9 and comprises fair value hedging, changes in value of the currency derivatives do not impact on earnings. They are set o/ff in the income statement against corresponding changes in the value of the hedged order. In connection with the delivery of such purchases, the hedged part of the acquired asset is reported at the hedged rate. At year-end, purchase orders for which currency forwards had been contracted had a total value of SEK -0.2 (0.2) billion. At year-end, derivative instruments for 'fair value hedging' had a reported net fair value of SEK -8 (-4) million, while purchase orders subject to hedge accounting and accounts payables related to hedged purchase orders were reported at SEK 8 (4) million. Thus, there was no ine/fficiency at the end of the accounting year. At year-end, 'fair value hedging' was only applied for major investments in foreign currencies.\n\nDerivative instruments which are not reported in hedge accounting are valued at fair value in the income statement. Hedges related to accounts receivable, accounts payable and major projects are recognized in Other operating profit or loss. Hedges related to financial items are recognized in the financial net. At year-end, these\n\nAUDITOR'S REPORT\n\nSHAREHOLDER INFORMATION\n\nNOTES\n\nnon-realized derivative instruments amounted to net SEK -723 (12) million, of which SEK -124 (80) million was reported in other operating income and SEK -599 (89) million was reported in financial items.\n\nThe Group's total outstanding FX derivatives had an average maturity of 2 (3) months at year end.\n\n## Hedging of commodity price risk\n\nCash flow hedging is applied when hedging price risk of electricity. The electricity derivatives employed by the Group have been defined as cash flow hedges. The relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item is documented when the hedging contract is made. Hedge e/ffectiveness is measured both at the start of the hedging relationship and quarterly throughout the duration of the relationship. The e/ffective part of changes in the fair value of the derivatives that are designated as, and qualify for, cash flow hedging is recognized in Other comprehensive income. The ine/ffective part of changes in the fair value of the derivatives is booked directly to Other operating expenses. The realized result of the e/ffective part of hedges is recognized as an adjustment to the cost for electricity in costs of goods sold, in the period during which the hedged items a/ffect the result.\n\nElectricity price risk relating to forecasted electricity consumption at the mills is partly hedged through standard derivative products listed on the market, partly by physical delivery contracts. At year-end, the amount of forecast purchases in respect of which electricity derivatives had been contracted was 2,232 (1,973) GWh.\n\nAt year-end, derivative instruments which relate to forecasted electricity purchases and which meet the requirements for hedge accounting amounted to net SEK -66 (57) million, of which SEK -66 (57) million was reported in Other comprehensive income. There was no ine/fficiency at the end of the accounting year.\n\nThe Group's total outstanding commodity derivatives had an average maturity of 33 (41) months at year end.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

For interest rate derivatives which meet the requirements for hedge accounting pursuant to IFRS 9, changes in the value of the interest rate derivatives do not impact earnings. They are reported in Other comprehensive income.

On level 1, listed prices on an active market are used, such as stock exchange prices. On level 2, observable market data regarding assets and liabilities, other than listed prices, is used, such as interest rates and return curves. On level 3, the fair value is determined based on an assessment technique which is based on assumptions that are not based on prices or data that are directly observable. The fair value assessment of the financial instruments in SSAB is based on data in accordance with level 2 except electricity derivatives, which fair values are based on listed market values and thus classified on level 1.\n\nFinancial assets consist largely of other non-current receivables and are valued at the amount which is expected to be received following an assessment of expected credit losses.\n\nDerivative instruments are valued at fair value, calculated with established valuation models based on observable market data. The fair value on a derivative is defined as the amount to which an instrument would be exchanged to in an orderly financial transaction at reporting date. The fair value of currency derivatives is calculated based on current forward prices at the reporting date. Fair value on commodity price derivatives is calculated based on market prices on applicable exchanges. Fair value of interest rate derivatives is calculated based on the discounted cash flow method. At year-end, the derivatives were valued at SEK 227 (302) million as financial assets and SEK -860 (-268) million as financial liabilities. If full netting had been applied the derivatives had been booked at SEK 30 (208) million as financial assets and SEK -576 (-187) million as financial liabilities.\n\nAccounts receivable are reported in the amount which is expected to be received following an individual and collective assessment of expected credit losses as well as possible provisions for credit losses.\n\nOther current interest-bearing receivables consist of restricted cash with a term to maturity of less than 12 months.  Fair value is estimated to be substantially consistent with the acquisition value.\n\nAUDITOR'S REPORT\n\nSHAREHOLDER INFORMATION\n\nNOTES\n\nCash and cash equivalents consist of bank balances and bank deposits with short terms to maturity, and  the fair value is estimated to be substantially consistent with the acquisition value.\n\nLong-term interest-bearing liabilities consist primarily of loans that are not subject to hedge accounting and are valued at amortized cost. Fair value has been calculated based on the interest rate for outstanding terms to maturity as applicable at the end of the year.\n\nShort-term interest-bearing liabilities are valued at amortized cost. Fair value has been calculated based on the rate of interest for outstanding terms to maturity as applicable at the end of the year.\n\nAccounts payable are reported in the amount which is expected to be paid and are valued at acquisition value.\n\n## Management of capital\n\nThe Group's capital management is aimed at ensuring that the operations can continue to be conducted and generate good return for the shareholders. Since the Group's operations are dependent on the business cycle, the target is that the net debt/equity ratio will not normally exceed 35%.\n\nIn order to maintain or adapt the capital structure, dividends may be adjusted, share buybacks or redemption may take place, or new issues or divestments of assets may take place in order to reduce liabilities. The dividend target is 30 - 50% of profit after tax.\n\nAt year-end, the net debt/equity ratio was 19% (19%).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n229",

This note explains the e/ffects in the Group's financial statements on the transition to IFRS 16. In accordance with the transitional rules in IFRS 16, the comparative figures for 2018 was not restated. The reclassifications and adjustments arising from the new leasing rules was reported in the opening balance as of January 1, 2019.\n\nAn exception to the new principles that the Group is applying is applicable to low value assets, where not rightof-use asset or lease liability is recognized. These are recognized as a straight-line cost over the lease term. The Group defines low value leases as, for example, o/ffice equipment such as printers, copying machines, co/ffee machines and other assets having a value of less than around SEK 50 thousand in new condition.\n\nFor more information about leasing, see Note 21.\n\n## Transition to IFRS 16\n\nThe Group applied the simplified transition approach and did not restate any comparable figures for earlier periods. This means that the right-of-use asset was recognized at the same amount as the lease liability plus the advance payments made immediately prior to transition. Lease liability was calculated by applying the incremental borrowing rate on transition. The Group elected to apply the practical expedient of not reconsidering whether or not a lease exists. The exception regarding recognition of low value leases was also applied at transition. This is an exception which has continued to be applied after the transition.\n\nAs at December 31, 2018, the Group's non-cancellable lease commitments (undiscounted) amounted to SEK 2,964 million, of which SEK 656 million were financial leases. In addition, SEK 121 million in lease commitments was attributable to assets of low value. These were recognized as a straight-line cost over the lease term. Regarding the remaining lease commitments, rights of use amounting to SEK 1,961 million and lease liabilities of SEK 1,946 million were recognized as at January 1, 2019. The transition did not a/ffect shareholders' equity since under the transition approach all earlier finance leases was continued to be recognized as leases in accordance with IFRS 16.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This is due to the fact that the new standard results in a front-loaded recognition of the costs at the beginning of a contract, which is due to the recognition of the interest expenses. EBITDA increases since the costs for the operating leases were included in EBITDA when applying previous principles, but the depreciation on the right-of use asset and the interest expense on the lease liability are excluded from EBITDA. Operational cash flow increases, while the cash flow from financial activities decreases, but the total cash flow is not a/ffected. However, working capital decreases as net debt while the net debt/equity ratio rises.\n\nThe Parent Company applies the exemption rules under RFR 2 and does therefore not apply IFRS 16. The Parent Company continues to recognize all leasing agreements as a straight-line cost over the lease.\n\nNOTES\n\nAdjusted opening balance as at January 1, 2019:\n\n## Transition e/ffect of IFRS 16, Leasing\n\n| SEK millions                                                    | 2018 Dec 31   | Adjustment IFRS 16   | 2019 Jan 1   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|----------------------|--------------|\n| Assets                                                          |               |                      |              |\n| Intangible assets                                               | 31,438        | -                    | 31,438       |\n| Tangible fixed assets                                           | 23,953        | 1,961                | 25,914       |\n| Other fixed assets                                              | 1,811         | -                    | 1,811        |\n| Total fixed assets                                              | 57,202        | 1,961                | 59,163       |\n| Other current receivables                                       | 3,894         | -15                  | 3,879        |\n| Other current assets                                            | 31,390        | -                    | 31,390       |\n| Total current assets                                            | 35,284        | -15                  | 35,269       |\n| Total assets                                                    | 92,487        | 1,946                | 94,432       |\n| Equity and liabilities                                          |               |                      |              |\n| Equity for shareholders in the Company                          | 59,437        | -                    | 59,437       |\n| Non-controlling interest                                        | 78            | -                    | 78           |\n| Total equity                                                    | 59,514        | -                    | 59,514       |\n| Long-term interest-bearing liabilities                          | 9,693         | 1,307                | 11,000       |\n| Other provisions and long-term non-interest-bearing liabilities | 1,973         | -                    | 1,973        |\n| Total long-term liabilities                                     | 11,666        | 1,307                | 12,973       |\n| Short-term interest-bearing liabilities                         | 3,523         | 638                  | 4,161        |\n| Other current liabilities                                       | 17,783        | -                    | 17,783       |\n| Total current liabilities                                       | 21,306        | 638                  | 21,945       |\n| Total equity and liabilities                                    | 92,487        | 1,946                | 94,432       |\n\nAUDITOR'S REPORT\n\nSHAREHOLDER INFORMATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n231",

Actual results may di/ffer from the resulting accounting assumptions. The conditions for SSAB's operations are constantly changing, which means that these assumptions change. Management also makes assumptions on the application of the Group's accounting principles.\n\nThe assumptions and assessments set out in this note relate to those areas, which involve a higher degree of complexity in assumptions and of items where the risk of inappropriate assumptions and estimates can result in material adjustment.\n\n## Important assumptions on the application of the accounting principles\n\n## Future restoration of the environment\n\nIn the steel operations' industrial areas, there is a need for future land cleanup. In accordance with applicable rules, such cleanup will become relevant only when SSAB ceases to conduct operations in the area. At present, it is not possible to assess if and when operations will cease and, accordingly, no provision has been made for such land cleanup.\n\n## Important sources of uncertainty in assessments\n\n## Assessment impairment test for goodwill and other intangible assets with undeterminable useful lives\n\nWhen calculating the recovery amount of cash-generating units to assess any need for impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets with undeterminable useful lives, a number of assumptions about future conditions and estimates of parameters have been made.\n\nAt year-end 2020, the annual impairment test was carried out of the goodwill and other intangible assets with undeterminable useful lives. The test showed no need for impairment. The valuation was carried out at a time when the global economy remains characterized by major uncertainty, primarily because of the Covid-19 pandemic, which a/ffected the world outside and demand for steel. Under these circumstances, it is extraordinarily di/fficult to make an assessment as regards future earning capacity and thereby an assessment of the fair value of assets with undeterminable useful lives.\n\nNorth American operations reported lower earnings for 2020 compared to prior years. Lower earnings were primarily due to lower prices. However, the negative price impact was somewhat o/ffset by lower variable and fixed costs. European operations, primarily SSAB Europe, were also hit hard by the fallout from Covid-19. Lower prices\n\n## FINANCIAL REPORTS 2020\n\nAUDITOR'S REPORT\n\nSHAREHOLDER INFORMATION\n\nNOTES\n\nand volumes were the main reasons for weaker earnings compared to previous years although the impact of these was partly o/ffset by lower variable and fixed costs.\n\nThe calculation of the discount rate is based on the average long-term interest rates during the two-month period November-December. In total, the development in the market and the discount rate meant that the room for deterioration in the estimates concerning the cash-generating unit SSAB North America decreased to around SEK 3.5 (5.5) billion. For other cash-generating units, it is estimated that there is an adequate room for deterioration in the estimates without this leading to any need for impairment. For further information on the impairment test, see Note 6.\n\n## Assumptions per cash-generating unit\n\n## SSAB North America\n\nA need to start writing down goodwill would arise if the estimated discount rate before tax, which was applied to the discounted cash flows, was more than 1.0 (1.6) percentage points higher than the assessment made in the calculation or if the long-term forecasted margins before depreciation/amortization (EBITDA) were to be 0.9 (2.7) percentage points lower than the assessment made in the forecast. The impairment test was conducted based on the average risk-free long-term rate in the USA for the period of November-December 2020. In other respects, the cash flow valuation has been based on the assumption that the market for heavy plate in the USA remains at a normalized level, where, among other things, the relationship between steel prices and scrap prices would stabilize at a level where it has been over a longer period of time and import volumes on average historical levels.\n\n## SSAB Special Steels\n\nA need to start writing down goodwill would arise only if the estimated discount rate before tax, which was applied to the discounted cash flows, was more than 1.9 (5.8) percentage points higher than the assessment made in the calculation or if the long-term forecasted margins before depreciation/amortization (EBITDA) were to be 1.8 (5.2) percentage points lower than the assessment made in the forecast.\n\n## SSAB Europe\n\nA need to start writing down goodwill would arise only if the estimated discount rate before tax, which was applied to the discounted cash flows, was more than 2.9 (10.9) percentage points higher than the assessment made in the calculation or if the long-term forecasted margins before depreciation/amortization (EBITDA) were to be 1.9 (6.5) percentage points lower than the assessment made in the forecast.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This requires that assessments and assumptions are made to determine the value of the deferred tax asset and deferred tax liability on the balance sheet date. The company must assess the probability that the deferred tax assets will be utilized to o/ffset future taxable profits. Future changes to taxation legislation and trends in the business climate will impact the company's future taxable profits and thus a/ffect the possibility to utilize deferred tax assets on loss carryforwards and other temporary di/fferences. As at December 31, 2020, SEK -143 (-327) million net was recognized as deferred tax based on best assessment of future taxable profits in the Group. At year-end 2020, the Group also had tax loss carryforwards of SEK 1,433 (2,679) million, for which no deferred tax asset had been recognized. Accordingly, a changed assessment of the probability of future taxable profits could have a positive or negative e/ffect. Key assessments and assumptions are also made regarding recognition of provisions and contingent liabilities relating to tax risks. For further information regarding deferred taxes, see Note 14.\n\nSSAB provides pension solutions and other benefits to Group employees after termination of their employment. In some countries defined benefit plans exist and the accounting of such plans is complex since i.e. actuarial assumptions such as life expectancy, inflation and discount rates are used to determine the size and cost of the commitment. A large part of the group's pension obligations with respect to white collar sta/ff are benefit-based and insured on a collective basis with Alecta. Since it is not possible at present to obtain information from Alecta regarding the group's share of the obligations and managed assets, the pension plan taken out with Alecta is reported as a contribution-based plan. The funding level reported by Alecta at the end of the year does not indicate the existence of a deficit. However, it is not possible to obtain any detailed information from Alecta regarding the amount of the pension liabilities.\n\nThe group's benefit-based plans at the end of the year amounted to SEK 1,630 (1,725) million. The most significant actuarial assumptions applied and a sensitivity analysis can be found in Note 13.\n\n## Inventory\n\nInventory value is a/ffected by assumptions and estimates regarding product costing, application of the Lower of Cost or Market method and estimates of obsolescence. Complex assumptions, such as first-in-first-out (FIFO), are applied in the valuation of inventory. The quantity of certain input materials is complex in size and require assumptions and estimates in the form of volume/weight. SSAB's inventories at year-end amounted to SEK 17,444 (20,391) million, where SEK 302 (358) million were valued at net realizable value. For further information, see Note 9.\n\n## Accounts receivable\n\nExpected credit loss is based on assessments of the customers' future payment ability, which by its nature, is di/fficult to estimate. The group applies the simplified method for calculating expected credit losses. The method involves expected credit losses throughout the term of the receivable being used as the basis for accounts receivable. The item has been the subject of special assessment and, compared with the preceding year, the expected credit losses decreased by SEK 35 million to SEK 174 (209) million, thereby representing 2.5% (2.9%) of outstanding accounts receivable. Despite the major impact of Covid-19 on the global economy, realized credit losses have not increased during the year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

As of December 31, 2020, the retained earnings of the Group were SEK 20,655 (21,202) million and the Parent Company's unrestricted equity was SEK 53,947 (54,467) million.

Since the Group's operations are dependent on the business cycle, the target is that the net debt/equity ratio will not normally exceed 35%. The Group reported a negative result after tax of SEK -490 (1,093) million. The Group's policy is to distribute 30-50% of the profit after tax.\n\nDue to the negative result, and the fact that the company received governmental support related to Covid-19 during the fourth quarter, the Board proposes to the Annual General Meeting that no dividend be paid.\n\nAUDITOR'S REPORT\n\nSHAREHOLDER INFORMATION\n\nNOTES\n\n<!-- image -->",

The remuneration report for financial year 2020 also constitutes other information. The Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible for this other information.\n\nOur opinion on the annual accounts and consolidated accounts does not cover this other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion regarding this other information.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts, our responsibility is to read the information identified above and consider whether the information is materially inconsistent with the annual accounts and consolidated accounts. In this procedure we also take into account our knowledge otherwise obtained in the audit and assess whether the information otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nIf we, based on the work performed concerning this information, conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and the Managing Director\n\nThe Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible for the preparation of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts and that they give a fair presentation in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act and, concerning the consolidated accounts, in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU. The Board of Directors and the Managing Director are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of annual accounts and consolidated accounts that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or mistakes.\n\nIn preparing the annual accounts and consolidated accounts, The Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible for the assessment of the company's and the group's ability to continue as a going concern. They disclose, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting. The going concern basis of accounting is however not applied if the Board of Directors and the Managing Director intends to liquidate the company, to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThe Audit Committee shall, without prejudice to the Board of Director's responsibilities and tasks in general, among other things oversee the company's financial reporting process.\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the annual accounts and consolidated accounts as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or mistakes, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinions. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs and generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or mistakes and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these annual accounts and consolidated accounts.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7  Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts, whether due to fraud or mistakes, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is su/fficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from mistakes, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7  Obtain an understanding of the company's internal control relevant to our audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the e/ffectiveness of the company's internal control.\n- \u00b7  Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Board of Directors and the Managing Director.\n- \u00b7  Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors' and the Managing Director's use of the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual accounts and consolidated accounts. We also draw a conclusion, based on the audit evidence obtained, as to whether any material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the company's and the group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the annual accounts and consolidated accounts or, if such\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n240",

Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause a company and a group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n\n- \u00b7  Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts, including the disclosures, and whether the annual accounts and consolidated accounts represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- \u00b7  Obtain su/fficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the group to express an opinion on the consolidated accounts. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our opinions.\n\nWe must inform the Board of Directors of, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit. We must also inform of significant audit findings during our audit, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identified.\n\nWe must also provide the Board of Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Board of Directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts, including the most important assessed risks for material misstatement, and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in the auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes disclosure about the matter.\n\nNOTES\n\nSHAREHOLDER INFORMATION\n\nAUDITOR'S REPORT\n\n## Report on other legal and regulatory requirements\n\n## Opinions\n\nIn addition to our audit of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts, we have also audited the administration of the Board of Directors and the Managing Director of SSAB AB (publ) for the year 2020 and the proposed appropriations of the company's profit or loss.\n\nWe recommend to the general meeting of shareholders that the profit be appropriated in accordance with the proposal in the statutory administration report and that the members of the Board of Directors and the Managing Director be discharged from liability for the financial year.\n\n## Basis for opinions\n\nWe conducted the audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities section. We are independent of the parent company and the group in accordance with professional ethics for accountants in Sweden and have otherwise fulfilled our ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is su/fficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions.\n\n## Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and the Managing Director\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for the proposal for appropriations of the company's profit or loss. At the proposal of a dividend, this includes an assessment of whether the dividend is justifiable considering the requirements which the company's and the group's type of operations, size and risks place on the size of the parent company's and the group's equity, consolidation requirements, liquidity and position in general.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n241",

This includes among other things continuous assessment of the company's and the group's financial situation and ensuring that the company's organization is designed so that the accounting, management of assets and the company's financial a/ffairs otherwise are controlled in a reassuring manner. The Managing Director shall manage the ongoing administration according to the Board of Directors' guidelines and instructions and among other matters take measures that are necessary to fulfill the company's accounting in accordance with law and handle the management of assets in a reassuring manner.\n\n## Auditor's responsibility\n\nOur objective concerning the audit of the administration, and thereby our opinion about discharge from liability, is to obtain audit evidence to assess with a reasonable degree of assurance whether any member of the Board of Directors or the Managing Director in any material respect:\n\n- \u00b7  has undertaken any action or been guilty of any omission which can give rise to liability to the company, or\n- \u00b7  in any other way has acted in contravention of the Companies Act, the Annual Accounts Act or the Articles of Association.\n\nOur objective concerning the audit of the proposed appropriations of the company's profit or loss, and thereby our opinion about this, is to assess with reasonable degree of assurance whether the proposal is in accordance with the Companies Act.\n\nReasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden will always detect actions or omissions that can give rise to liability to the company, or that the proposed appropriations of the company's profit or loss are not in accordance with the Companies Act.\n\nNOTES\n\nSHAREHOLDER INFORMATION\n\n## FINANCIAL REPORTS 2020\n\nAUDITOR'S REPORT\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. The examination of the administration and the proposed appropriations of the company's profit or loss is based primarily on the audit of the accounts. Additional audit procedures performed are based on our professional judgment with starting point in risk and materiality. This means that we focus the examination on such actions, areas and relationships that are material for the operations and where deviations and violations would have particular importance for the company's situation. We examine and test decisions undertaken, support for decisions, actions taken and other circumstances that are relevant to our opinion concerning discharge from liability. As a basis for our opinion on the Board of Directors' proposed appropriations of the company's loss we examined whether the proposal is in accordance with the Companies Act.\n\nErnst & Young AB, Box 7850, 103 99 Stockholm, was appointed auditor of SSAB AB by the general meeting of the shareholders on the 1 April 2020.\n\nStockholm 1 March, 2021 Ernst & Young AB\n\n## Rickard Andersson\n\nAuthorized Public Accountant\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n242",

Information on the resolutions passed at the Annual General Meeting will be disclosed on April 14, 2021, as soon as the outcome of the postal voting has been confirmed.\n\n## Participation\n\nA person who wishes to participate in the Annual General Meeting must be listed as a shareholder in the presentation of the share register prepared by Euroclear Sweden AB concerning the circumstances as per the recording date on Tuesday, April 6, 2021, and give notice of participation by casting its postal vote in accordance with the instructions under the heading 'Postal voting' below so that the postal voting form is received by SSAB no later than on Tuesday, April 13, 2021.\n\nThe name, personal identification number (or company registration number), address and telephone number of the shareholder must be provided in the notice.\n\n## Nominee-registered shares\n\nIn order to be entitled to attend the Annual General Meeting, shareholders whose shares are registered in the name of a nominee (including Finnish shareholders that are registered within the Finnish book-entry system at Euroclear Finland Oy) must, in addition to giving notice of participation in the Annual General Meeting by submitting its postal vote, register its shares in its own name so that the shareholder is listed in the presentation of the share register as of the record date Tuesday, April 6, 2021. Such registration may be temporary (socalled voting rights registration), and request for such voting rights registration shall be made to the nominee in accordance with the nominee's routines at such a time in advance as decided by the nominee. Voting rights registrations that have been made by the nominee by April 8, 2021 will be taken into account in the presentation of the share register.\n\n## Proxies\n\nIf the shareholder submits its postal vote by proxy, a power of attorney must be issued for the proxy.
