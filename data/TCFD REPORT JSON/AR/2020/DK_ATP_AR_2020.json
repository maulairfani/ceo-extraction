        "page_content": "## Management's review\n\n## An unusual year also for ATP\n\n2020 was a year unlike anything we have experienced before. This is true for ATP, for Denmark - indeed, for the whole world. After a year with the new virus as a constant companion, we are left with the feeling that the world as we knew it before 2020 has fundamentally changed.\n\nCovid-19 affected ATP in many ways. This could be seen during spring of 2020 when the financial markets realised historic downturns as the virus spread from Asia to the rest of the world, causing sudden lock-downs of large parts of the world economy. The ATP business model once more showed its strength with the lifelong guarantees staying intact in spite of financial disruptions of historic proportions. Conversely, our investment result, after a strong start to 2020, took a significant downturn to the negative in Q1 in common with many other portfolios. The Covid-19 effect of shutting down several of the world's largest economies really became apparent during Q2, although we managed to regain some of the losses from the start of the year. Early in Q3, we managed to regain all the lost ground - and then some. At the end of 2020, the return was at DKK 29.9bn before expenses and tax. This is a remarkable result, particularly in light of the situation after Q1.\n\nOn the basis of ambition to secure the real value of pensions, the Supervisory Board had set a target for the result after expenses and tax for Investments and Hedging Activities which in isolation for 2020 was DKK 13.9bn. The result of DKK 17.6bn for Investments and Hedging Activities means that the target result was achieved and exceeded. We consider this to be highly satisfactory.\n\nCovid-19 also affected ATP as a workplace, and within just a few days we arranged for 3,000 colleagues to work from home.\n\nIn terms of the investment area, our investment team and others, individually working from home, were navigating financial markets marked by significant turmoil. Initially, there were extreme downturns in the equity markets - even harsher and deeper than during the 2008-2009 financial crisis. Investor losses were substantial, and the same applied to ATP's investment portfolio. This made 2020 an unusual stress test of the durability of our investment strategy. Our results for 2020 as a whole show that in spite of even the most extreme financial market fluctuations, ATP is still able to safely navigate and secure the pensions of Danish citizens.\n\nCovid-19 was also a call for all hands on deck for our administration business, where you can find a large number of our employees. After all, in a situation where no one could predict how bad things could get - whether in terms of the pandemic or the economy - it was important that Danes could count on receiving, for example, their pensions, maternity/paternity benefits and rent subsidies as usual. In parallel, a new pension solution was launched.\n\nIt has been a positive experience to find out that we have been able to maintain productivity and delivery of services across the group, while surrounded by a new reality.This is reassuring when considering that the extensive use of working from home may become a necessity beyond 2020. This also reflects well on our many employees who once more made a difference for ATP and for Denmark.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## DKK This year, ATP once again exceeded the Supervisory Board's target for Investments and Hedging Activities with a result of\n\nThe financial fall-out of Covid-19 to Danish society resulted in political decisions to assist those financially affected by the new reality. This resulted in urgent tasks for ATP. One outcome was that ATP was tasked with paying out frozen holiday funds and the DKK 1,000 politically agreed for all benefits recipients. When the Danish Parliament decided to create a Covid-19 related recovery fund for suffering Danish export companies, ATP was elected to manage it. ATP was also entrusted with the task of realising the tripartite agreement regarding the Employer's Reimbursement System, aimed at providing extraordinary assistance to trainees and apprentices. Meanwhile, we have made the preparations for being able to manage and assign senior pension for qualifying workers.\n\nATP is proud to be entrusted with tasks of such significant societal importance. As the communal pension fund for all Danish citizens, the manager of one of Europe's largest pension funds and the administrator of a substantial proportion of public benefits in Denmark, ATP holds great responsibility. We aim to make balanced and long-term decisions. Sustainable choices which create value for our members and our other stakeholders, because we believe that this is how to live up to that responsibility and to maintain the trust that others have in us.\n\nI am often asked if sustainability and solid returns are not opposites. The response is no; to me, the two are insolubly linked. ATP's returns have to contribute to pensions in the long term. In order to deliver, our investment decisions must be sustainable - that is, they must have long-term durability. This makes sustainability a central and integral guideline\n\nbn.\n\nfor ATP. To us, sustainability means thinking long-term, holistically, and that we create a balance between various considerations.\n\n17.6\n\nWe wish to take ATP in an even more sustainable direction and to do so at four levels: as an organisation; via our investments; via our active ownerships, and via relations to our external partners.\n\nATP's primary task is to ensure basic financial security for all of Denmark, whether the financial markets go up or down. Danish citizens must be able to trust that ATP will steer safely through hard times in order for its assets and guarantees to remain intact. We are tasked with securing a life-long supplement to the state pension - ATP is the only supplement to public pensions for 40 per cent of the population - and we manage and pay out two-thirds of all Danish welfare benefits.\n\nBo Foged, CEO (Chief Executive Officer), ATP\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Strategic focal points\n\nWith Strategy 2023 'A sustainable ATP', the Supervisory Board has defined six strategic focal points aimed at ensuring that ATP remains a relevant and trusted business partner for our stakeholders.

Our customers are all Danish. We work every day to create basic financial security for the Danish population - simply and efficiently. And we strive to always be a trusted and relevant enterprise for all Danes.\n\nOur core task is to create good, stable returns on our investments which will ensure that both current and future pensioners receive a lifelong supplement to their state pension in the form of ATP Livslang Pension (Lifelong Pension), to manage a wide range of central benefits payments and to ensure that state pension, family benefits, and holiday pay, among other things, are paid correctly and on time.\n\nATP Livslang Pension (Lifelong Pension) is a collective pension scheme covering more than 5 million Danes. You will receive a monthly payment from the day you retire and for the rest of your life. And this is not affected by how old you get.\n\nATP also consists of a large Processing Business which annually manages the payments of welfare and social security benefits for citizens in Denmark in the order of DKK 300bn. The Processing Business also provides technical and administrative support services and procures and develops IT systems. The tasks are performed for labour and management parties, the Danish state and the municipalities. This takes place on a cost-recovery basis. Read more:\n\n- www.atp.dk/en/processing-welfare-benefits\n\n## Results and dialogue create support\n\nAt ATP, we are in touch with most of the Danish society. Our primary customers can be divided into two groups: One consists of members, citizens and corporations, which includes all the Danes saving up for a pension and receiving one or more benefits from us, and corporate entities which pay contributions to us and receive reimbursement. The\n\nother group is our clients - labour and management, the Danish state and the municipalities, for which ATP performs tasks based on legislation or agreements.\n\nThe societal role played by ATP and the tasks performed result in a large and wide range of stakeholders. ATP works to ensure that all our stakeholders are knowledgeable about ATP, about our business areas and about our tasks. These include:\n\n- \u25a0 securing stable pensions with a lifelong guarantee for our members;\n- \u25a0 striving for real value safeguarding of ATP Livslang Pension (Lifelong Pension);\n- \u25a0 creating sustainable returns with a focus on responsibility and risks;\n- \u25a0 ensuring simple, functional and digitised solutions and benefits for citizens and corporations;\n- \u25a0 ensuring cost-effective administration;\n- \u25a0 ensuring uniform case handling, correct and timely payments and decisions inside fixed budgets and with a high degree of customer satisfaction.\n\nIt is also central to our task performance that we receive feedback and inputs from our clients, customers and from the wider society in general. This is why we are actively involved in creating an on-going and open dialogue with our stakeholders in order to be close to those that we exist to serve. This applies to contacts with politicians, associations, corporations, NGOs - and to Danish and international collaboration in the pension industry, professional networks and at conferences and general meetings.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## With trust comes obligations\n\nATP was introduced by the Danish Parliament in 1964 with the purpose of providing Danes with a state pension supplement. Today, ATP covers most of the Danish population who put money aside for their pension via ATP Livslang Pension (Lifelong Pension). As a statutory and mandatory scheme, ATP has acquired a special role and status in relation to a part of the pension savings of Danes, and this puts us under a healthy pressure to deliver. Since our members cannot deselect our service, we must and will do our utmost to earn the trust shown us by society. This applies both to our role as pension investor/manager and as a processing business.\n\nHowever, the statutory origin of ATP's existence must never result in that we take our tasks and responsibility for granted. Instead, we apply this to motivate ourselves to perform our tasks in ways that are second to none - inter nationally speaking - in the areas of pension investment\n\nand administration. We constantly seek to perform our tasks even better; to stay relevant to our customers and attractive to other stakeholders.\n\nThe role as a trusted partner is central to us. Profession alism and credibility are required from us to function as a sparring partner for the listed companies that we invest in. We also have to provide inspiration, create standards and help set the agenda for our areas of interest, such as the taxation area.\n\nWe also ensure uniform case handling, secure and stable operations and compliance in the use of ATP's registers and data as well as on-going development of IT systems. Given our size, we make extensive use of new technol ogies (robots and machine learning), thus saving costs and providing citizens with more digital services.\n\n## A good reputation and satisfied customers\n\nThat is why we produce on-going measurements on how our customers, our clients and the wider population - members and citizens - view us.\n\nWe continuously test how the many citizens to whom we make payments and have direct contact rate this contact and the treatment and decisions they receive from ATP. Our ambition is a satisfaction rate between 70 and 80 per cent. We have met this target in 2020, also. As we set very high standards for ourselves, we often proactively contact respondents who have expressed their dissatisfaction. We do so to understand where and how we can raise our level.\n\nThe ATP Group also performs on-going reputation analyses among the population. The purpose is to gain knowledge and insights into how society views us generally and what people think about us in selected areas which are central to us and our clients. The result of our reputation analysis was once again positive for 2020; indeed, we have improved in a number of areas. The population assessment confirms that ATP is very much considered to be 'professional, solid, well-run and credible', while 'pension security' and 'ATP's economic importance' are assigned a high weighting in the positive assessment of ATP.\n\n## Fast response when needed\n\nCovid-19 was very much front and centre in Denmark and at the top of the political agenda in 2020, and many decisions in the Danish Parliament resulted in new tasks for ATP. Some of these were directly related to the pandemic, of which the following are a selection.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## DKK 52.3bn in holiday allowance paid out\n\nIn June 2020, a Danish Parliamentary majority decided to release three weeks' frozen holiday pay in order to kick-start the Danish economy. The payments were to commence at the end of September, and ATP was tasked with developing and operating a payment solution to pay out the roughly DKK 60bn involved. A brand new and fast IT solution was created on the basis of our existing platform, enabling the Danes to request their frozen holiday allowance without delay. The pay-out become a huge success: A total of 2.3 million wage earners requested a payment, totalling just over DKK 52.3bn.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2.2 million people on benefits received DKK 1,000\n\nAs a part of the recovery package for the Danish economy in relation to Covid-19, a Danish Parliamentary majority decided in the summer of 2020 to give DKK 1,000 to all benefits recipients. ATP was tasked with solving this task inside just a few months. The challenge was that payments had to be made to more than 2 million citizens during October and they were.\n\n## Ready for Seniorpension\n\nAs of 1 January 2021, the ATP Group will be managing Seniorpension. This intends to ensure uniform allocation of senior pension across the nation. In 2020, Seniorpension was managed by the municipalities, but the task is being transferred to a new authority under ATP in early 2021. In 2020, therefore, ATP collaborated with the Ministry of Employment on the legislative material setting out the technical, administrative and legal framework for the authority. At the same time, ATP established and developed a fully functional set-up, ready to process and make decisions in cases of citizens applying for Seniorpension.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## ATP assumes responsibility for Danish recovery fund\n\nThe global shutting down of economies across the globe during 2020 also resulted in the creation of a state 'fund' of DKK 10bn. The fund purpose is to recapitalise large, Danish corporations that have been affected by an extraordinary financial shock as a consequence of Covid-19. ATP has been appointed to operate and manage the fund. In 2020, this resulted in the incorporation of a separate subsidiary that will assist the fund.",

One task area deals with the pension product ATP Livslang Pension (Lifelong Pension) and the other is responsible for a range of central insurance and social benefits for labour and management, state entities and municipalities.\n\nThe two business areas and models are fundamentally different, but shared features are that the tasks are critical for the wider society and complex.\n\n## The Processing Business task\n\nThe ATP Processing Business rests on three legs: Pension & Erhvervssikring, Udbetaling Danmark - Public Benefits Administration and Seniorpension\n\nPension & Erhvervssikring performs tasks for labour and management - such as payment of holiday allowance, the industrial injuries area, and reimbursement schemes for, e.g., trainees and maternity/paternity leave.\n\nUdbetaling Danmark - Public Benefits Administration performs tasks for municipalities and state entities, such as payment of state pension, maternity/paternity benefits, children's and family benefits, rent subsidies and international pension, etc.\n\nThe Seniorpension unit manages and awards senior pension for worn-out workers.\n\nThe ATP Processing Business has locations nationwide. All told, the Processing Business manages annual insurance and welfare benefits payments of some DKK 300bn - equal\n\nto more than two-thirds of all welfare benefits. Managing these benefits in Denmark, which is the specialty of the ATP Processing Business, is generally characterised by large volumes, objective case handling and tasks for which the case handling takes place under one authority from end to end.\n\nOver time, the Processing Business has developed documented expertise in supplying and developing large and complex IT systems, and it has digitalised and developed systems to support legislation, benefit from economies of scale, such as via shared functions, and robust and reliable risk and operations management. The target is positive customer experiences based on cost-effective administration, secure and stable operations and strong compliance.\n\nIn recent years, the Processing Business has experienced growth in new tasks and areas, including, for example, more complex tasks and subjective case handling. In order to be able to continue to ensure cost-effective and simple administration with secure and stable operations, ATP focuses on strengthening the business model in this regard and to clarify what it is that ATP does well and where ATP can create value.\n\n## ATP Livslang Pension (Lifelong Pension)\n\nThe basis for the introduction of ATP by the Danish Parliament was the wish to create a supplement to the state pension for Danish pensioners, regardless of their income level and their life progression. Since ATP covers practically all Danish citizens and since it is a statutory scheme, ATP, together with the state pension, is considered the principal\n\npillar of the Danish pension system. This position is fundamentally important to the way in which ATP invests its assets. Assets which are generated via monthly payments from practically all working Danes.\n\nDanes need to know what they will receive as pensioners. When we project a specific pension amount to the Danes, this creates an expectation of income level after retirement. For this reason, ATP has a strong need to invest in safe assets in order to honour our guaranteed obligations.\n\nATP is paid out as a lifelong benefit - ATP Livslang Pension (Lifelong Pension) - from state pension age. The precondition for receiving ATP is to have made contributions to the scheme during one's adult life. How much one receives depends on how long and to what extent one has worked.\n\nIn 2020, ATP Livslang Pension (Lifelong Pension) in combination with public pensions was the only pension income for 40 per cent of Danish pensioners.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nof Danes aged between 25 and 65 paid ATP contributions in 2020, thereby accruing pension rights. This clearly makes ATP the most widely covering pension scheme in the country.\n\n## 94 per cent\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Facts about ATP Livslang Pension\n\n- \u25a0 In 2020, 5.3 million Danish citizens were covered by the ATP scheme\n- \u25a0 3.4 million citizens made contributions to ATP Livslang Pension (Lifelong Pension) in 2020 - just over 1 million received payments from the scheme\n- \u25a0 ATP Livslang Pension (Lifelong Pension) includes survivor benefits for your family\n- \u25a0 For a 66-year-old, full ATP pension is DKK 25,200 per year. On average, a 66-year-old will receive DKK 17,000 from ATP Livslang Pension (Lifelong Pension) per year.\n- \u25a0 ATP Livslang Pension (Lifelong Pension) also contains an inexpensive insurance component: Payments continue for life from the state pension age, thereby ensuring a fixed supplement to the state pension for all members\n- \u25a0 Today, any Dane can go to www.pensionsinfo.dk and view the size of their expected ATP pension\n- \u25a0 Value added for members in 2020 totals 5.5 per cent.

        "page_content": "## How we invest\n\nFor a typical wage earner, DKK 3,408 is paid into ATP per year, of which the employer pays two-thirds.\n\nMost of the amount - 80 per cent - is placed in the pool designed to guarantee future pension payments: the hedging portfolio. It is essential to ATP to be able to provide the pensions that members have been promised, since ATP is a statutory and guaranteed scheme. And exactly\n\nbecause ATP is mandatory, members have to be certain that they will receive the guaranteed pension when they retire.\n\nThe rest of the payments to ATP - 20 per cent - is placed in the other pool: the investment portfolio, which is used either to increase life expectancy or to increase pensions for ATP Lifelong Pension.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 80%\n\n## The hedging portfolio\n\nIn order to ensure always having the funds required to pay out the amount guaranteed, we invest the majority of members' payments in securities such as bonds and interest swaps. In this way, we hedge the interest risk and ensure that we can keep our promise to members to pay them a specific pension, both now and many years into the future.\n\nThe value of the guaranteed pensions rose by DKK 56.8bn in 2020 (before interest yield curve effect), mainly due to falling interest rates. At the same time, the hedging portfolio realised positive returns after tax of DKK 56.3bn. The value of the hedging portfolio therefore increased in step with the pension guarantees, and the hedging once more worked as intended, namely, as a protection for the guarantees.\n\n## 20%\n\n## The investment portfolio\n\nThis involves riskier investments, such as in equities, real estate and other alternatives to create high returns. Historically speaking, it is the investment portfolio returns which have been high enough to enable ATP to build financial reserves to cover unforeseen expenses and pension increases. These reserves will also be used in future to cover unforeseen expenses and, for example, to ensure that ATP has sufficient funds if members live even longer than we already expect, and to allow the possibility of increasing payments to keep up with inflation.\n\nIn 2020, the portfolio realised a return of 23.3 per cent relative to the bonus potential. Especially Danish equities and government and mortgage bonds contributed to the positive investment result. The market value of the investment portfolio at the end of 2020 was DKK 390.8bn.\n\n<!-- image -->",

And everything suggests that the very low interest rate level will be a reality for several years to come.\n\nLow interest rates are a challenge for the pension industry, including ATP. Low interest rates means that it is harder to create good pensions, both because the rate of return that ATP can guarantee is low and because the low interest rates affect the yield on riskier assets, meaning that expected future returns will be lower. We still need, however, to be able to honour lifelong guarantees and to keep our promise of specific payments.\n\nThe current business model ensures a very high degree of security that ATP can honour the guaranteed pension. However, using the current model makes it very difficult to live up to our target of ensuring that ATP Livslang Pension (Lifelong Pension) can also be adjusted for inflation on an on-going basis such that payments retain their real value. This creates a need to adjust the risk-taking framework in a way that does not jeopardise security.\n\nATP must always be able to honour the guarantees such that the Danish population can count on their future payments from us.\n\nFor the management of ATP, the top priority is to contin uously ensure that business models are up-to-date relative to the objective: to ensure the best possible basic pensions. Since 2018, ATP has been undertaking careful analyses with a view to uncovering the opportunities for optimising ATP's pension product. The objective is to create a basis for attractive returns without compromising on guarantees, and for this to also work in the low interest rate universe of the future. At the end of 2020, based on these analyses, ATP's Supervisory Board decided on a number of measures to contribute to this long-term safeguarding. It is the view of the Supervisory Board that the changes can be implemented such that the future ATP can both satisfy the need for high returns for members and at the same time guaranteeing ATP's obligations. Implementing the proposed changes requires amendments to the ATP Act. It was expected at the end of 2020 that the Danish Parliament would consider amending the Act before the summer of 2021.\n\nSince adjusting the ATP business model will not result in changes to existing guarantees, the adjustment will gradually come into effect over a number of years.",

        "page_content": "## March 2020 - a perfect storm\n\nThe ATP business model and investment strategy has proven its value for decades. One of the reasons is that ATP has been adjusting the model in step with societal developments. To ensure that the business model remains robust at all times, ATP performs continuous contingency exercises with a variety of risk scenarios. Over the years, the model has also been tested by reality, and each time it has proven to be very robust. This was also the case in March of 2020 when Covid-19 caused one of the worst historical storms in the financial markets.\n\nMikkel Svenstrup relates the unusual experience of taking up the position of Chief Investment Officer on 1 March 2020, just 11 days before the shutting down of most of Denmark - including most of ATP.\n\n'We had seen quite positive returns in ATP after the first two months of the year. Then the virus spread from Asia and the prices dropped fast, both in Denmark, in Europe, in the USA, and in Asia. Many billion were lost in just a few weeks. It was hectic; not even during the 2008 financial crisis or the 1929 Depression did the markets drop that much and that quickly.\n\nTo us, one of Europe's biggest investors, a lot of money is at stake in a situation like that. We had days when we left work to go home in the knowledge that we had lost many billion. Or, rather - we did not go home, since in addition to the falling equity prices we also faced the new situation that our workplace was shut down and we were instead placed in children's rooms, home offices, or at a desk in the basement, talking via the computer to execute the strategy\n\nwhich the investment team believed would be best suited to meet this challenge, including in the longer term.\n\nI will remember the month of March 2020 for a very long time. It was an extremely difficult market to navigate - not made easier by the fact that we did not have a physical war room to run things from and me being all new at ATP. But I have to say, also, that those days confirmed to me exactly why I chose ATP. ATP was just so prepared and ready for a sudden onset crisis, and the strong focus on contingency plans and management exercises proved to be extremely valuable. The storm in the financial markets was hurricane strength, communicating with employees was no longer at the workplace, and in certain ways counterparty banks and clearing houses had to be dealt with differently. It was not a simple task to operate in this altered reality. But it has been said that practice makes perfect, and this was proven to me. ATP's investment muscle has been trained to handle all imaginable scenarios and can withstand very strong forces. The same can be said for the hedging strategy, which once more showed its worth.\n\nThings looked dark during those days in the spring. But extremely swift financial and fiscal policy measures eradicated most of the market panic and equity prices went up significantly during April. We regained what we had lost already during the summer, and after that things really took off in the right direction. There is a sense of security in knowing that ATP was able to steer through bad weather like that. I am impressed and proud - also of the handsome investment results delivered in 2020, which was truly a challenging year.'\n\n<!-- image -->",

It sets the course for how we run our business and for maintaining the support and trust that we need from the world around us.\n\nSustainability is about solving our tasks in the best possible way without leaving a bill to pay by future generations\n\nOver time, we must balance the consideration of customers and clients with acting responsibly in a society moving in an increasingly more sustainable direction, both financially, socially and environmentally. It is also important to consider the responsible use of resources, capacity, and competencies.\n\nAt ATP, we are proud of having been entrusted with a task important to society at large. This motivates and inspires us to take care to reach the right decisions, even if they are not always popular. This is how we can best live up to our responsibility and maintain society's trust in us.\n\nATP has a long tradition for taking responsibility for the society that we are a part of.

This is illustrated above.\n\nEven though ATP does not have a large environmental footprint, it is important that we show the way and take responsibility. Both in terms of environment and climate, in terms of the people for whom we are responsible, and in terms of the way we run our business.\n\nAs a company, therefore, we work on reducing our CO2 emissions. We do this by focusing on the use of raw materials in the canteen, by increased waste sorting and optimised consumption of water, heating, and electricity.\n\nAs an investor, we work on integrating considerations related to climate, environment, and social and management elements into our investment portfolio.\n\nAs active owners, we make a difference via constructive dialogue with the companies we invest in, and we make use of our voting rights at general meetings.\n\nLast, but not least, we take an active part both in participating in and establishing collaboration about important agendas such as, for example, responsible tax payment.\n\nATP's responsibility is like rings in the water - the bigger the rings, the bigger the effect.",

The old light fittings had to be replaced for work environment reasons, and there was a good business case for changing to energy-saving LED fittings. After a one-off investment of DKKm 3.2 for the new fittings, we have realised a reduction from 2019 to 2020 of DKKm 0.5 and a reduction in electricity consumption for lighting of approx. 250 MWh per year. This equates to a saving of approx. 50 tons of CO2, equal to approx. 73 per cent of the total CO2 emissions related to electric lighting. The investment will have paid for itself after approx. five years, meaning that we have made permanent cost reductions. Since the expected lifetime of the new LED bulbs is expected to be up to 15 years, future operating expenses related to replacement will be minimal.\n\n## Committed employees\n\nA decisive element in ATP's work with CSR and climate improving initiatives is the support and commitment from employees.\n\nThis was most clearly expressed when the canteen decided to phase out disposable packaging in 2020. The initiative was launched on our internal employee site, where we also requested good ideas for environment and climate improving measures. They came flowing in immediately, and one of the suggestions was about waste sorting. In the past, we each had our own waste bin with only two sorting options.

The point being that green bonds are used to finance projects that contribute to the green transition.\n\nThe green bonds market is rapidly developing, and based on in-depth analyses over the past few years that has both given us more insight into this new investment opportunity and allowed us to develop competencies in working actively with the area, the conclusion is that green bonds are a good fit for ATP both in terms of creating returns and as a contribution to the green transition.\n\nFrom having no investments in green bonds in 2017, we had nearly DKK 30bn invested in the area by the end of 2020, making us one of the leading actors in Europe. One of the reasons, is that we were among the first investors in the world to start demanding closer communication with green bond issuers to ensure the greatest possible transparency about the projects they would be used for. Our experience has motivated us to do more, and the expectation is to reach approx. DKK 50bn in sustainable bonds in 2021. At the same time, we are looking at the so-called Social Bonds. For this new segment, a similar process of clarification is required before any investment decisions are made.\n\namount of waste going to recycling. And rather than paying extra to have unsorted waste collected, we are now getting paid to sort into plastics, paper, etc. The result is that ATP has reduced its waste amount from 396 tons in 2019 to 281 tons in 2020. CO2 emissions for the waste removed was also reduced by approx. 33 per cent. Working from home due to Covid-19 has also had an effect on the year's result, and the same reduction or level is not expected in the future.\n\n## Even boring things make a difference\n\nSustainable solutions do not always equal fancy initiatives that look great in annual report illustrations. But that does not mean that they are not worth doing. As an example, the old ventilation system from 1964 was overhauled in 2020. New, energy-friendly ventilators have not only provided an annual CO2 reduction of approx. 49 tons. The finances look good, too, as the DKKm 2.2 investment will have paid for itself within approx. 5 years, since this is another area where we will be saving electricity. Implementation has also resulted in greater air change in certain areas, which has improved the indoor climate.\n\nIn order to further reduce our CO2 emissions, we have had our electricity consumption certified and now contribution to the erection of new wind turbines in Denmark. And finally, ATP's car policy has also been updated in 2020. The number of cars in ATP is not high, but it has none the less been decided that as of 2023 ATP's company cars will be electrical and hybrid-powered.\n\n## We aim for the greatest returns and climate effect\n\nWhen balancing returns and responsibility, dilemmas often occur. One of those relates to how real improvements can be created.\n\nIn 2020, after months of calculations and analyses, we decided to change our approach to investing in utility companies. These are typical stable equities, even during times of market fluctuations. This makes them a good fit for our international equities portfolio. There is, however, the problem to consider that utility companies emit large quantities of CO2. Even though utility companies only represent approx. 6 per cent of the market value of our international portfolio, they represent approx. 70 per cent of the CO2 emissions.\n\nThe objective was to investigate what we could do to reduce CO2 emissions. If the intention was to look 'green', all we had to do would be to sell our equities in those companies. That would result in a significant reduction in ATP's overall CO2 footprint. But if we sold our equities, this would make no difference to global emissions. It would be the same. ATP just would not own the equities. Some other investor would, instead.\n\nOur ambition is to make an actual difference. So we have made a targeted effort to identify the group of utility companies that recognise that the green transition is a necessity and that work actively on reducing their emission of greenhouse gases.",

Therefore, we also have a shared responsibility for moving both ourselves and the world around us in a more sustainable direction.\n\nBo Foged, CEO (Chief Executive Officer), ATP\n\nBut why not invest in companies that are already green? Such as the Danish company \u00d8rsted, for example? Why invest in companies that look black when measured on their CO2 footprint? We combined data for individual utility companies' greenhouse gas emissions with data for the companies' focus and plans to reduce their emissions. Based on this, we have been able to conclude that the companies with the greatest focus on moving in a greener direction are also the companies that manage to create significantly greater effect relative to reducing global greenhouse gas emissions. This means that it is the will to change a significant CO2 footprint that will be the determining factor for our investments - since that is where we can make the biggest difference.\n\nOur analyses demonstrated that it produces a lower return to only invest in companies that are already green rather than investing in companies that have the greatest focus on the green transition - even if they have only just started on the journey towards a greener business model.\n\nSo this means that our investing in companies entering a transformation, such as DONG Energy did before it changed its name to \u00d8rsted, makes a significant contribution to the green transition at the same time as which ATP's members realise greater returns, as opposed to our merely investing in companies that are already green.\n\nThere will be companies in our investment portfolio that do not only make ATP's CO2 books look better. That is the short-term price. In the longer term, it can help reduce the total global emissions. This means that Danish pension funds are actively helping to drive the green transition.\n\nOur new approach has been met with both appreciation and criticism when communicating with our stakeholders. Critics thing that we should sell everything 'black' and move the pension assets to the green. At ATP, however, we are convinced that our approach is the most effective one, while at the same time we create a return, if we want to make a real difference relative to reducing global greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Active ownership\n\n## We use our voice and voting rights\n\nATP is actively involved in the companies we invest in how they act and develop. We seek out knowledge and insights and make our influence felt and, especially in Denmark, work as a sparring partner with both the boards of directors and executive managements of the large, Danish companies, just as we vote at annual general meetings. This is what we call stewardship.\n\nDialogue is the key tool in our stewardship activities. Dialogue with listed companies can relate to all the topics that may be of importance to the investment, such as strategy, results, risk, capital structure, corporate governance, corporate culture, management remuneration and responsibility generally speaking.\n\nATP's continuous screening and fact-finding activities ensure that the investment portfolio is investigated on an ongoing basis with a view to identifying the companies which involve the greatest risk of violations of the Supervisory Board's policy of responsibility in investments. This also helps ensure that ATP complies with international guidelines for good corporate conduct.\n\nIf a screening indicates that a company may have violated ATP's policy, the investigation will change to fact-finding. Fact-finding is a flexible investigative process in which we can include a variety of different sources. The purpose of the fact-finding process is to enable ATP's Committee for Responsibility to determine whether ATP's policy has been violated. If ATP's Committee for Responsibility finds that a portfolio company is in breach of ATP's Policy of Respon-\n\nsibility, ATP will either exclude or engage in a targeted dialogue with the company.\n\n## Better ESG data creates better companies\n\nATP focuses on ensuring that our ESG efforts are effective and create value both for us and for the companies we invest in. That is why in 2020 we have worked on increasing the collection of ESG data from our portfolio of illiquid investments. The purpose of collecting ESG data has been to acquire enough relevant data from the companies to enable us on the one hand to analyse the portfolio across industries and on the other hand to use the information in our dialogue with the individual companies about their ESG efforts. This enables us to identify the companies that have come a long way and those companies that need a nudge in the right direction. The increased data collection also illustrates our ambition to be active owners who use our influence.\n\nData collection has been focused on three themes: Policies, processes and performance. Policies are a precondition for having processes, and processes are a precondition for performance. This structure creates a natural data collection hierarchy that ensures that companies work at the right levels relative to their stage of development and are focused on the potential of ESG in their efforts to create value. The purpose of data collection is therefore not to create a beauty contest between the companies - on the contrary. Regardless of the level that each individual company is at, the purpose of the new ESG data is to create better and more valuable companies for the benefit of ATP's investment, which ultimately benefits our members.",

Both in relation to specifically strengthening our work with responsible tax payment and to focusing on themes which an investor must consider. What matters to ATP is not to pay more or less tax, but to pay the right tax, and that the structures are sufficiently transparent and make sense.\n\nThe first tax policy was adopted in 2016, and in the following year ATP's management raised the ambition level with an updated tax policy with the clear purpose of countering aggressive tax planning in unlisted investments. The policy covers both own investments and investments with others. A progressive tax policy that is more restrictive than the legislation is currently used by a wide range of Danish pension companies which have adopted the tax code in 2019 and 2020. And most recently six of Denmark's largest private funds and associations have adopted the common principles with effect from 2021.\n\nAnd finally, ATP entered into focused dialogue in 2020 with the largest listed Danish companies about their tax management, as some of the companies have room for improvement in the tax reporting area. Discussions with the tax managers of the companies have been positive and beneficial for both parties, and have in part resulted in some companies adopting new tax policies while others have strengthened their tax reporting. ATP pays Danish tax on pension savings returns regardless of the source of the return. Over the past 10 years, ATP has paid DKK 94bn in tax on returns as a contribution to the Treasury.\n\n## Active on many fronts\n\nWhen you are a pension fund for the whole population and manage significant welfare benefits, as ATP is and does, it is absolutely essential to be able to cooperate and participate in fora where ideas are exchanged, new knowledge is gained and where everybody contributes.\n\nThis applies to our daily work which involves continuous dialogue with relevant ministries, agencies and municipalities and labour and management parties about the tasks that we perform for the various parties. We also cooperate with organisations representing the citizens who receive the benefits - e.g. \u00c6ldre Sagen (Dane age Association) and housing associations - a cooperation which also creates value in ATP's Processing Business. This happens, for example, when ATP participates in the common public digitalisation work.\n\nATP is also, as an investor, an active part of a number of international bodies. Climate Action 100 Plus, for example, an initiative among global investors aimed to ensure that the world's largest greenhouse gas emitters commit to reducing climate changes. There are now more than 500 investors taking part in Climate Action 100 Plus, representing a total of DKKt 319bn.\n\nATP is also a member of the non-profit organisation SASB, which develops standards for how companies report on sustainability. Via our subsidiary ATP Ejendomme, we are also a member of GRESB, an organisation specialising in assessing and comparing corporate efforts and results relative to sustainability. ATP Ejendomme works with the purpose of optimising both existing and new properties relative to sustainability and in 2020 achieved a rating of four stars out of five.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## ESG and CSR\n\nATP works with responsibility inside the framework of both international and Danish legislation and conventions. We support the Paris Accord and Denmark's target of a 70 per cent reduction in CO2 emissions by 2030. In addition, the UN's 17 Global Goals are also important relative to the work with responsibility. As an employer, we focus on objectives such as health and welfare, gender equality, sustainable energy and climate initiatives. In our investment business, it is the companies in which we invest that work with the Global Goals, and all the goals are represented.\n\nWe work with responsibility on the basis of two concepts. CSR and ESG. CSR is about what we do as a company and an employer, and ESG is about what we do as an investor.\n\nCSR stands for Corporate Social Responsibility and ESG for Environmental, Social and Governance. Both concepts cover the elements included in ESG. E for environmental; S for Social - i.e. people, and; G for governance.",

This does not mean we are not ambitious in the area, but that we place expenses in perspective relative to quality and risk. It is relatively simple to reduce expenses in the short term, but significantly more difficult to do so in the longer term.\n\nIn a world in which returns expectations keep falling, expenses become increasingly more important to being able to create good pensions. In the Danish pension industry, there are very big differences in the costs of management and investment of pension savings. Some of the reasons are that there are differences between the companies' business models, customer groups and products\n\nThe level of expenses directly affects future pensions. Even small differences in expenses can, over longer\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nInternational comparison 1 of administration activity and investment expenses\n\nsavings periods, result in significant differences in pension payments.\n\nIt is absolutely crucial for ATP to be cost-effective, which makes it important to have some of the very lowest expenses in the industry. Since it is a statutory and mandatory scheme, Danes cannot decide whether they want to be part of the ATP universe. The collective scheme is intended to ensure financial security, but at the same it forces us at ATP to be able to justify our expenses. We have been entrusted with the role as all of Denmark's pension company, and our members have to be able to trust that we manage that trust in the best way possible, such as by keeping a constant focus on expenses.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRisk\n\nWe work with balanced cost efficiency in all areas:\n\n- \u25a0 Low administration expenses for effective operation of ATP Livslang Pension (Lifelong Pension) (low expenses per member and APR)\n- \u25a0 On the investment side - with a view to the return potential which can be created with each Danish krone spent (focus on return after expenses and APR)\n\nATP is able to keep its administration activity expenses low because we have one single mandatory product on our shelves: ATP Livslang Pension (Lifelong Pension), which enables economies of scale. A large proportion of communication with ATP's members is also now digitalised, payment processes in and out are automated and the IT platform is stable. This all contributes to keeping the expense level down.\n\nAdministration activity expenses in ATP Livslang Pension (Lifelong Pension) are below\n\n1/10th of the average for comparable,\n\nglobal pension funds.\n\n40\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn line with ATP's long-term development strategy, we are making continuing investments in the IT platform to ensure that it remains up-to-date and supports appropriate IT security and that it ensures a stable data basis and operational risk management. As expected, expenses rose slightly in 2020, primarily due to increased focus on IT security, operational risk and compliance in general, while at the same time ATP has participated in a number of common public digitalisation initiatives.\n\nThe most recent international comparison of expenses in the investment area which ATP has participated in shows that the total investment expenses of ATP Livslang Pension (Lifelong Pension), adjusted for indirect return-related fees, are among the very lowest in the industry, including global pension funds. ATP's total investment expenses are on average 32 per cent lower than for comparable companies with roughly similar net assets to ATP.\n\nBalanced cost\n\nefficiency",

Mandatory Pension Scheme (MPS) came into effect on 1 January 2020, and is being managed together with ATP Livslang Pension (Lifelong Pension), and efficiency enhancement has made it possible to retain the same expense level even after implementing MPS.\n\nATP can maintain very low administration activity expenses because in terms of being a pension provider, ATP offers only one product\n\nATP's administration activity expenses in 2020 were DKK 210m, equal to just under DKK 40 per member. This, as in previous years, is very low in an international context, according to the benchmark analysis on the preceding page. ATP's administration activity expenses form part of ATP's total, annual expenses in per cent (APR). APR is the pension industry's standard method of collating and measuring all expenses related to a pension product\n\nwith the purpose of providing members with the greatest possible degree of transparency.\n\nOn the investment side of things, there is also a continuous focus on how we get the greatest benefit from the funds. In 2020, as in previous years, ATP has been looking at which investments can be better managed in-house by our own portfolio managers and in which specialised areas it makes more sense to involve external managers. This has also resulted in savings this year. It is typically much more expensive to place mandates with an external manager, which is why it must constantly be checked whether an additional return is created which justifies the extra expense. When ATP assesses the most appropriate placing of funds, we consider factors such as risk-adjusted returns, cost efficiency, tax issues, social responsibility and ownership. All of those things combine to determine whether a potential\n\nreturn potential should be pursued. The cost base composition is a result of what, in the long term, is expected to contribute additional returns for the benefit of ATP's members.\n\nATP's APR for 2020 was 0.30 per cent of aggregate assets, which relative to the industry is right at the lowest end of the spectrum. Administration activity expenses contribute 0.02 per cent and investment expenses 0.28 per cent. When managing investment expenses, our primary focus is on optimising returns after expenses. This does not, however, change the fact that APR is a central key figure for ATP, and the objective is clear: We must be among the cheapest in the industry. External managers' fees represent by far the majority of the APR base, which is why an assessment of performance in relation to costs is made on an ongoing basis.\n\nStatement of annual expenses in 2020\n\n|                                               | DKKm   |   DKK per  member | APR   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|--------|-------------------|-------|\n| Administration activity expenses ATP          | 210    |                40 | 0.02% |\n| Investment expenses ATP                       | 552    |               104 | 0.06% |\n| Investment expenses subsidiaries              | 332    |                63 | 0.03% |\n| Investment expenses, external mandates        | 639    |               120 | 0.07% |\n| Total investment expenses ex performance fees | 1,522  |               287 | 0.16% |\n| Performance fees, external managers           | 1,146  |               216 | 0.12% |\n| Total annual expenses                         | 2,879  |               543 | 0.30% |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor a protracted period we have witnessed falling interest rates and lower expectations for future investment returns.

ATP has also developed an expertise in developing and marketing large and complex IT systems and ensuring efficient system implementation. One of the objectives of the processing business is to ensure the lowest possible total expenses across several years, which is achieved via large-scale IT systems and a well-developed community of competencies in IT operations and development.\n\nThe low expenses, including in the longer term, realised by ATP as a processing business, are therefore achieved via a focus on stable, secure and cost-effective operation at the right quality and risk level.\n\nBusiness processing, external parties is subject to ambitious demands for annual efficiency enhancements of 2 to 5 per cent in the underlying operations. In addition, increased group level expenses related to compliance, IT security, operational risk management, etc. are absorbed. This takes place in parallel with a high degree of development activity in recent years.\n\n## ATP administration takes place on a cost-recovery basis.\n\nCost-recovery based administration means that ATP invoices expenses to the schemes managed without profit margin. The basis for the schemes managed at ATP is that they are handled with the ambition that each year can and must show reduced operating costs. This is agreed with the respective clients in the annual budgets. The reason for the actual total expenses to still increase is that ATP is given new tasks to perform.\n\nIn 2020, all agreed expense budgets for the schemes managed were complied with.\n\n## Udbetaling Danmark - Public Benefits Administration's IT success saves millions for municipalities every year\n\nUdbetaling Danmark - Public Benefits Administration is a publicly regulated independent institution with regulatory responsibility. The authority was established when, in June 2010, the National Association of Local Authorities and the then government entered into an agreement to consolidate elements of municipal case handling functions under one authority, effective from the autumn of 2012.\n\nThe ATP Group was selected to manage Udbetaling Danmark - Public Benefits Administration based on many years' experience with similar tasks.\n\nAccording to the political agreement Udbetaling Danmark - Public Benefits Administration would, after a two-year implementation period, save the municipalities DKKm 300 per year on administration expenses. Udbetaling Danmark - Public Benefits Administration reached this target as planned at the start of 2015.\n\nPart of the political agreement also involved that Udbetaling Danmark - Public Benefits Administration would offer by tender the large IT contracts which Udbetaling Danmark - Public Benefits Administration took over from the municipalities, thereby seeking to create savings for the state and municipal finances. The business case for putting contracts up for tender was the realisation of at least 25 per cent savings when all IT contracts were put up for tender and new systems implemented. This target was reached in 2020 with savings of 30 per cent.\n\nAll of Udbetaling Danmark - Public Benefits Administration's IT support has been replaced since 2014 and future-secured during the years until 2020, and the task of finding the best and least expensive IT solution was solved in 2020 with the implementation of the IT system to handle payments of state and disability\n\npensions. The complete implementation of all the new systems has been completed in parallel with paying out DKK 230bn to 2.4 million beneficiaries each year without any significant disruptions.\n\nImplementing large, public IT systems is a very complex exercise involving both financial risks and risks relative to the many citizens who receive benefits every month. This makes it a major achievement that Udbetaling Danmark - Public Benefits Administration - in collaboration with a number of IT suppliers - successfully launched new IT systems for areas such as child benefits, maternity/paternity benefits, rent subsidies and state pension/disability pension. Udbetaling Danmark - Public Benefits Administration's IT systems will also be put up for tendering in future in order to guarantee competitive pricing.\n\nThe outcome is that IT costs have been significantly reduced, to the benefit of the state and the municipalities who fund Udbetaling Danmark - Public Benefits Administration.\n\nTotal annual IT operations expenses have decreased by DKKm 264, and the realised IT savings of 30 per cent exceed the original target (25 per cent).",

This makes it important to ensure a reliable level of risk management and governance in everything that we do.\n\n## Controlling the risk\n\nIt is crucial for ATP to have a safe and high level of risk management and governance. This is why ATP is focused on identifying risks, being ready to manage unforeseen events and to ensure that roles and responsibilities are clear.\n\n## Why is this so important?\n\nSafe governance and risk management are some of the preconditions for ATP to be able to ensure the basic financial security and to be a trusted company. This assists in securing a good, risk-adjusted return and the trust of the world around us and ATP's members.\n\nSafe governance must be an integral component of the company and be included in the value chain from board level and to all employees and business partners. ATP's governance ambition must reflect that the demands that the\n\n## Governance\n\nATP was established by legislative Act by the Danish Parliament, is self-governing and has its own decision-making processes and Supervisory Board. The arms-length principle that was a result of the establishment is both fundamental and crucial to ATP's success.\n\nATP continuously focuses on ensuring that the role and responsibility division at board level and other governance relations are clear, accepted, and communicated to relevant stakeholders.\n\nsurroundings make on ATP and that ATP makes on others are handled responsibly.\n\nRisk management concerns all risks that might affect ATP, which means both investment, pension, operational and regulatory risks. ATP has established a risk management system which via policies, processes and reporting ensures that a total overview is created of ATP's risks. This involves measure such as identification, measurement, handling, monitoring, control and reporting of risks - both known risks and risks that could potentially affect ATP.\n\nATP strives, within the framework of balanced cost effectiveness, to achieve a safe and high level of management of ATP's risks. The world changes quickly, and the same applies to the risks that could potentially affect ATP. This could, for example, involve cyber attacks or the development in stock markets during varying financial cycles. But it is also about being able to handle the increasing number of complex public administration tasks.\n\nThis is why it is important that ATP, in line with ATP's risk policy, stays up-to-date with the risk potential and that APT is prepared for a critical event. This means, among other things, performing the necessary risk assessments with a long-term, holistically oriented perspective when developing new solutions, just as contingency plans are continuously updated and tested.\n\nIn the following pages you can read more about how ATP handled, in particular, the investment and operation risks during the Covid-19 crisis.\n\n## = operational risks\n\nOperational risks link to the risk of financial, reputational, compliance and personal data effects as the result of inappropriate or insufficient internal procedures, human error, system error or as a result of ATP's collaboration with external business partners and suppliers. Operational risks include, for example, the potential for errors or delays in mass payments or cyber attacks. ATP aims for ambitious, cost-based, balanced, and sustainable risk management.\n\nGovernance\n\n& Risk\n\n## = investment risks\n\nInvestment risks are primarily market risks assumed by ATP in relation to investment and hedging activities. Market risks are risks related to market value changes of assets or liabilities as a result of changes in capital markets.\n\n## Most significant risks\n\n## = regulatory risks\n\n## = pension risk\n\nATP's operations extensively relate to schemes and tasks established and governed by statute. Activities may be set up, changed or discontinued by political decision sometimes at relatively short notice. In the same way, ATP's operations or parts thereof are affected when significant regulatory conditions change and new, tighter financial, administrative or other requirements are imposed on ATP.\n\nATP disburses a monthly pension for as long as the members are alive. This makes life expectancy trends the greatest single risk for ATP. In addition to including the observed life expectancy development in calculations, ATP also considers expected future life expectancy improvements when measuring the pension liability relative to members. ATP's method and model for this are based on information about its just over 5 million members supplemented by data regarding some 340 million inhabitants in 18 OECD countries.\n\nRead more about ATP's work on life expectancy predictions:\n\n- www.atp.dk/en/our-tasks/atp-livslangpension-lifelong-pension/life-expectancymodel-intended-predict-future",

        "page_content": "## Investment risks\n\n## How did ATP manage investment risks during the strong financial market fluctuations?\n\nFollowing many years of ever-growing equities markets combined with long-lasting interest rate drops, Covid-19 has reminded us all that financial markets can also realise substantial losses. Seen from a historic perspective, the market fluctuations were very substantial during Covid-19, and we have to go back to the time around the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy to find similar levels.\n\nATP continuously works on contingency plans for handling our investments during a crisis situation, which contributed to it being possible to navigate the crisis and retain the margin required to create a return when markets starting going up again.\n\nTo maintain a robust investment portfolio with a stable return and the greatest possible independence from cyclical variations, the investment portfolio is managed on the basis of a risk diversification strategy. Relative to actual diversification for ATP's portfolio in 2020, government and mortgage bonds made DKK 15.0bn, and listed Danish equities made DKK 11.9bn. During the same period, infrastructure lost DKK 1.7bn and credit lost DKK 0.4bn. Also, listed international equities created a small positive return of DKK 0.2bn. This demonstrates how both bonds and geography help spread the portfolio risk in spite of great market pressures.\n\n## The 2020 investment return of DKK 29.9bn consists of\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Listed Danish equities DKK +11.9bn Government and mortgage bonds DKK +15.0bn   | Real estate DKK +1.2bn Private equities DKK +2.8bn   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| Infrastructure DKK (1.7bn)                                                     | Credit DKK (0.4bn)                                   |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPct.\n\n## A risk balanced investment portfolio\n\nATP manages the invested capital with a risk focus. The overall principle for ATP's risk management is that total risk (the risk consumption) must be aligned with the bonus potential. The terminology is that there must be 'an appropriate level of risk'.\n\nThe bonus potential, which constitutes ATP's free reserves, expresses the difference between the value of ATP's total assets and the value of the members' guaranteed pensions. The larger the bonus potential, the larger capacity ATP has to assume risks, including financial risks. Conversely, a smaller bonus potential will reduce the capacity to assume risk. ATP has designed its investment portfolio such that it is possible to significantly reduce the risk level and thereby protect the bonus potential optimally in case of financial unrest. This means that measures are implemented when the risk becomes too large relative to the size of the bonus potential. This partly mitigates the effect of losses.\n\nA source of expected higher return is systematic utilisation of risk diversification. The best possible utilisation of the risk budget is obtained via a widely invested investment portfolio.\n\nThe dynamic risk level management combined with risk diversification enables ATP to utilise the risk budget efficiently. Dynamic adjustment of ATP's risk level has been a fixed part of the investment approach at ATP for many years.\n\n## Risk consumption development throughout 2020\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more about ATP's business model and risk management in the background article 'ATP's investment approach' (ATP's investeringstilgang) and ATP's SFCR report.\n\nRead more:\n\nwww.atp.dk/en/dokument/atps-investment\n\n-approach-2020\n\nwww.atp.dk/en/dokument/risk-and-financial\n\n-condition-report-2020",

We continuously keep track of all identified top risks and implement contingency plans during 'peacetime' in order to be prepared for 'wartime'.\n\n## ATP has long been working with in -formation and cyber security\n\nOur information security work is based on continuous identification, control, monitoring and risk management of current risks and on determining appropriate mitigating control and security measures. This ensures that ATP does not assume greater risk than is acceptable.\n\nSince March 2020, the Covid-19 situation has caused changes in employee working situations, and the number of active home workplaces has been increased to cover almost all 3,000 ATP employees. This presents some new requirements related to information and cyber security, and we focus on measures that provide increased protection against the threats specific to this situation. Security measures include data encryption such that data is secure in case of theft or attempted wire tapping, increased awareness of phishing, handling confidential, print-based information, and information about handling their work computer at home. These initiatives, together with existing measures, contribute to ATP being\n\nwell prepared for this new working situation in terms of security, regardless of its duration.\n\nBased on the desire for continued strengthening of ATP's maturity and work with information and cyber security, external maturity assessments are performed on an on-going basis, and the results from recent years show a strengthening of organisational maturity which contributes to a stronger security level.\n\nBased on internal as well as external assessments and tests combined with contingency exercises and ATP's work with assessing and monitoring the security environment, initiative areas continue to be identified that help to ensure that the security level aligns with the risk profile desired by the Supervisory Board.\n\nEstablishing home workplaces for 3,000 employees presented extra information and cyber security needs\n\n<!-- image -->",

They are a diverse lot, with everything from investment experts to customer advisors and canteen staff to graduates, lawyers, economists and vulnerable citizens being reintroduced to the labour market.\n\nNo matter if one just started as a trainee or holds a PhD in Quantum Physics and regardless of whether one is in a business area or a staff function, we all share one thing; ATP's purpose: To ensure basic financial security for Danes. This is what weach of us iscontributing to.\n\n## There is a meaning\n\nATP's special role in society means that as a company, a place of work and as employees we have been given a very clear purpose and great responsibility. Having such a clear purpose is both a gift and a great obligation to a company, as it motivates and commits us at the same time. Both in relation to the company and the individual employee, in relation to the decisions that we make, the tasks that we perform and how we act in the society that we are a part of. And finally how, as a place of work, we take responsibility.\n\n## Ambitions\n\nATP's ambition is to be a professional beacon in the fields of pension, investment and management. This requires that we are able to maintain and develop ATP as an attractive place to work, retaining and attracting competent, responsible and committed employees. For ATP, being an attractive place to work involves a high level of professionalism, interesting tasks and community spirit. The same applies to good working conditions, which supports commitment and positive results, good recruiting options and low staff turnover.\n\nAn attractive place to work is where you create the results together. We do this by creating frameworks that allow everyone to apply their competencies. Clear career paths and relevant development opportunities for both employees and managers are also preconditions for ATP being and remaining an active option for talented and ambitious employees who seek a working life with meaning.\n\n## Balance\n\nThe same applies to flexibility and space of the ambitions and overall state of life of the individual. Without compromising on productivity results, or deadlines, there has to be a place for the employee whose ambition is to fully commit to their career and who seeks greater challenges and responsibility. Just as there is a place for the employee who uses their commitment and professionalism to perform their tasks with quality and efficiency without being wedded to the job 24/7.\n\nAs an employer, ATP wishes to create the space and opportunity for employees to pursue their professional ambitions and to create results for the benefit of ATP and the individual employee. And no matter who you are or what life-stage you are at, there are plenty of opportunities at ATP. Whether you want to try your hand at management or concentrate on becoming a specialist. Or whether you want to be a part of large, complex development projects - perhaps as a young graduate looking for a steep learning curve. Or whether you already have many years' experience and perhaps think that now is the time to slow things down a little.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Diversity and diversity of working life are central elements for ATP's committed and professionally competent employees who put in a lot of effort and make a difference. But responsibility also extends to special efforts which benefits our employees, our company and society in general.\n\n## 10th anniversary and still a success\n\nIn 2010, ATP's diversity effort led to the establishing of Fase+. This is a department in which the precondition for recruitment is that the employee needs extra help to enter or return to the labour market. Employees participating in this scheme are men and women of a non-western background, vulnerable young people and people with mental illness. The aim of Fase+ is to help the employees to manage a job or an education on normal or special conditions and thus becoming self-supporting. This is achieved via Fase+ performing a number of service and administration tasks. In return, ATP releases resources with other employees, who can then focus completely on their core tasks.\n\n## ATP sabbatical\n\nOn the face of it, this does not sound efficient. But it is - our very special service team consisting of young people taking a sabbatical year. The service team helps with answering telephone calls and performing administrative tasks across all benefits, primarily in Udbetaling Danmark - Public Benefits Administration. This part of customer service has approximately 130 full-time employees, 120 of whom are students on a sabbatical year. The average age is around 20 and the young people are typically employed for one to two years. They are quickly trained to be able to perform the less complex tasks. The young team contributes to a high level of productivity and low costs, benefitting ATP. This also provides ATP with a useful window display relative to attracting new talents - and perhaps to welcome them back when they finish their education. For the young people, the benefit lies in having an interesting, developing job and a study break before deciding on their future plans. As the employment cannot extend beyond two years, we ensure that the young people continue their education. The concept, which has developed from 20 to now more than 100 young employees, is in its fifth year and is an example of creatively satisfying company requirements and showing responsibility by giving the young people a good start on a hopefully long and positive working life.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Diversity does not just happen\n\nIt has to be as attractive for women as for men to work at ATP and to develop their talents and pursuing, for example, their management ambitions. Generally speaking, there is a reasonable gender split at ATP, but the challenges of the financial industry related to attracting, retaining and developing female talents are also reflected in ATP's Pensions & Investments activities. This applies both in respect of employees generally and at management level.\n\nATP would like to change this. That is why in September 2020 we launched a tailor-made, women-only scheme. The purpose is to provide talented women the opportunity and support to realise their ambition and potential. The purpose is also to highlight female role models in the organisation and thereby inspire others to assume a management role. And finally it allows ATP to access talents of both genders\n\n## Accelerate objectives\n\n- \u00b7 More equal distribution between female and male managers in Pensions & Investments. The current distribution is 12 per cent women and 88 per cent men. The general distribution of women and men for the business area is 26 per cent women and 74 per cent men.\n- \u00b7 More female applicants\n- \u00b7 More women with management ambitions\n- \u00b7 Visible female role models\n\nand thereby unleash the untapped potential in this part of the business. The scheme is at the same time intended to ensure that workplace is competitive and attractive to our talented colleagues, now and in the future.\n\nThe internal training and development program is called Accelerate and focuses on all female talents in ATP who are willing to take their next career step. The program gives participants the opportunity to develop their skills together with other, likeminded women. Each of the women will be followed by a member of the Executive Board of the Pension & Investments business and will have access to other relevant key individuals who can make a positive difference in the women's development.\n\nManagement will be selecting the participants based on their results and potential. The target group differs from the ATP talent program by the fact that participants are further along in their working life and exclusively women.\n\nGroup 1, starting in 2020 and finishing in 2021, is a pilot project that will be evaluated both by participants and managers. There is a total of eight participants in the program that will last for six months and include tests, individual coaching and group training sessions.\n\nTo ATP, it is not about quotas or special treatment. It is about being ambitious on behalf of all our employees across genders and competencies and across the group. But since we have much too few women in one part of the business, there is a strong need to highlight the impact they can make.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEight women participate in the Accelerate pilot project aimed at supporting women's career ambitions in the financial sector - and at ATP.

Participants in the scheme are men and women of a non-western background, vulnerable young people and mentally ill persons who are all associated with the scheme for two years. From its gentle beginnings in 2010 until 2020, a total of 230 people have been employed under Fase+, and of all those participants 65 per cent have either moved on to employment or education in or outside of ATP.\n\n## = young at ATP\n\nIt is important to ATP to also have an eye out for young talents and for the responsibility involved in training and developing them. One of the entry points to ATP is the traineeship. In 2020, ATP had a total of 33 trainees employed. Another way is to spend a sabbatical year at ATP. For this purpose, we have set up a special service team as part of our customer service, consisting of young people who have completed their secondary education and need a break before progressing in the education system. We have had a total of 120 employed this year.\n\n## = manager and employee development\n\nThere has been focus on manager and employee development in 2020. Due to Covid-19, ATP's HR department has focused on creating a relevant online program. They have succeeded, and throughout the year all managers have completed two online modules with the focus on their roles and responsibilities relative to developing their employees. The program focus has been development centred on the employees' core tasks. This is to ensure relevant development that directly contributes to creating value.\n\n## = young professionals\n\nIn 2020, we set up Young Professionals - a professional and social community for young employees in group functions. Everyone is below the age of 35. In total, 70 people take part in the professional and social community which holds 3-4 annual events with relevant internal and external topics. A similar community was established in Pensions & Investments in 2017. This has 45 participants.\n\n## = graduates\n\nIn 2020, 27 new graduates started working at ATP. This is the biggest group since we established our graduate education in 2014. This year's group come from seven different universities, covering the study areas medicine, physics and nanotechnology, communication, law and political science, financing, innovation, and business intelligence.\n\n## = ambassadors\n\nWhen you want to call attention to yourself, but have no marketing budget, it is good to have committed employees who are happy to act as ambassadors for their place of work. Our ambassador network was established this year. It consists of colleagues from all parts of the business who take the time to spread the ATP message. Thanks to them, our stories about results, our social responsibility and our good place to work have reached all corners of LinkedIn and Facebook.\n\n## = satisfaction\n\nIn 2020, we had reason to be delighted about the annual employee satisfaction survey. We believe that happy employees create value, but in light of the many Covid-19 related challenges, the result was anticipated with some apprehension. In spite of all the working from home, online meetings, the lack of social contact with colleagues, very few social and professional highlights and shared experiences, satisfaction among ATP employees is very high. With a response rate of 93 per cent, the conclusion is that both the joy at work and loyalty have increased among employees. This year, employees were also asked whether management has shown appropriate care and attention in relation to Covid-19 and whether management has handled the Covid-19 situation well, and whether they have received sufficient, timely, and relevant information about Covid-19. All three questions have been answered with a very clear 'Yes'.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## = senior scheme\n\nIn 2020, approximately 400 employees made use of the option of 5 annual days off for seniors paid for by the company. Days off for seniors are reserved for colleagues who have turned 59.\n\n## = certification\n\nCustomer focus is important to ATP. And in order to ensure that our Customer Advisors have a common approach to the good customer experience, ATP implementing Customer Advisor certification in 2019. To begin with, the ambition is that all Customer Advisors in Udbetaling Danmark - Public Benefits Administration are certified. This affects 900 employees distributed across ATP's centres nationwide. The target is to have 50 per cent certified before the end of 2021.",

Reserves - the bonus potential - stood at DKK 146.2bn at the end of 2020, and guaranteed pensions totalled DKK 813.6bn. Net assets thus totalled DKK 959.8bn.\n\nFor 2020, ATP has reserved DKK 14.6bn for tax on pension savings returns.\n\nBased on an ambition of the best possible safeguarding of the long-term real value of pensions, the Supervisory Board has set a long-term performance target for investment and hedging activities after tax. For 2020, seen separately, the target was DKK 13.9bn, and with profit on investment and hedging activities of DKK 17.6bn, this target for the year was more than achieved. The result is considered to be very satisfactory, particularly in the light of a very turbulent year. Considered across the latest 5-year period, we also exceeded our target result.\n\nIn order to maintain an appropriate margin for investment activities to hedge the real value of future pensions, particularly in the light of the strong increase in the value of guaranteed pensions and continued uncertainty related to Covid-19, the Supervisory Board has decided to not increase pensions in 2020.\n\n## Events after the reporting date\n\nFrom the reporting date until the date of the presentation of this annual report, no events have occurred that would materially affect the assessment of the annual report.\n\n## Outlook for 2021\n\nATP's investment strategy is to ensure that ATP generates the best possible returns, while always being able to meet the guarantees issued to members.\n\nBased on this ambition, the Supervisory Board has also for 2021 maintained the long-term result target for Investment and Hedging Activities after tax. This is an absolute return objective, which does not necessarily have to be achieved every year, which in isolation is set for 2021 at DKK 14.6bn after expenses and tax.\n\nThe objective is based on the principles that members' interests must be a central consideration, that it is the aim to secure the real value of life-long pensions in the long\n\nterm, and that the objective is an ambitious one. It has also been designed to be realistic given the size of the bonus potential and the risk budget, as well as the longterm risk-adjusted return expectations.\n\nOn the basis of extensive analyses, ATP's Supervisory Board decided at the end of 2020 to adjust the business model in order to improve the ability to hedge the real value of pensions, while ensuring that ATP can maintain its guarantees. The adjustment will require legislative changes, which the Danish Parliament is expected to consider before the summer of 2021, while the effect of the adjustment will not be evident for some years to come.\n\n## Corporate Social Responsibility\n\nATP's statutory statement and progress report for the UN Global Compact can be found at\n\nwww.atp.dk/en/responsibility-reports-and-publications\n\n## Corporate governance\n\nATP's corporate governance framework is set out in the Danish ATP Act.

The total ATP Group investment activity result after expenses and tax was DKK 24.6bn in 2020.\n\nInvestment portfolio losses as a result of the heavy fall in the financial markets during the first part of the Covid-19 crisis were more than regained during the remaining part of the year. Looking at the year as a whole, the largest positive contribution came from the returns on investments in government and mortgage bonds and listed Danish equities, while infrastructure investments generated the largest negative return.\n\n## The government and mortgage bonds portfolio,\n\nwhich also includes exposure via financial derivatives, generated returns of DKK 15.0bn, primarily due to positive contributions from United States and European bonds as a result of decreasing interest rates in the United States and Europe.\n\nThe total equities holding , consisting of listed Danish and international equities and private equities, generated a return of DKK 14.9bn. Listed Danish equities generated a return of DKK 11.9bn. Especially the holdings in \u00d8rsted A/S and Vestas Wind Systems A/S generated positive return contributions, while especially the holdings in Danske Bank A/S and Carlsberg A/S generated negative contributions.\n\nListed international equities generated a return of DKK 0.2bn. Listed Emerging Markets gave the largest positive return contribution, while investments in listed European equities generated the largest negative contribution.\n\nThe private equities portfolio includes ATP Private Equity Partners, which primarily invests in international capital funds, and of other private equity investments. The total portfolio of private equities generated a return of DKK 2.8bn.\n\nReal estate investments generated a return of DKK 1.2bn. The investments are made via direct ownership of properties, via joint ventures, or indirectly via invest ments in private real estate funds. Direct as well as indirect investments are made both in Denmark and abroad.\n\nThe infrastructure investments portfolio generated a return of DKK (1.7bn.) The largest negative contribution comes from ATP's investment in Copenhagen Airport. The infrastructure investments portfolio also includes investments in forestry in North America and Australia as well as sustainable energy investments.\n\nInvestments in credit generated a return of DKK (0.4bn.) These investments consist partly of bonds issued by companies with low credit ratings or developing nations, partly of financial derivatives, which generated a return of DKK (1.1bn.) Also included are loans to credit institutions and funds that invest, among other things, in bank loans and corporate loans, which generated a return of DKK 0.7bn.\n\nInflation-related instruments , consisting of commodities-related financial contracts, index-linked bonds, and inflation swaps generated a total return of DKK 0.6bn. Investments in commodities-related financial contracts generated a return of DKK 1.4bn. Index-linked bonds and inflation swaps generated a return of DKK (0.8bn.)\n\nOther items generated DKK 0.2bn. The holding primarily consists of externally managed portfolios. The portfolio also includes interest payments to the hedging portfolio.\n\n## Investment return 2020 and 2019\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMio. kr.\n\n45.000\n\n40.000\n\n35.000\n\n30.000\n\nATP and the ATP Group recognise and measure all investment assets at fair value with value adjustment in the income statement.

        "page_content": "## Note 2: Hedging activity results\n\nThe hedging portfolio consists of bonds and interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate risk on guaranteed benefits up to 40 years, and an internal loan to the investment portfolio equivalent to the value of the guaranteed benefits extending beyond 40 years. For this loan, the hedging portfolio receives interest of 3 per cent which is also the fixed rate of interest used for discounting the guaranteed benefits beyond 40 years.\n\nHedging portfolio interest rate swaps do not tie up liquidity to the same extent that bonds do. Funds not tied up in the hedging portfolio can be allocated to loans for investing in the investment portfolio. A market rate is paid to the hedging portfolio on the funds borrowed by the investment portfolio.\n\nHedging is planned to ensure that the market value of the hedging portfolio after tax is expected to fluctuate in line with the guaranteed benefits when interest rates change.\n\nChanges to the calculation rate of interest, yield curve break, and maturity reduction increased the guaranteed benefits, generating a result of DKK (63.3bn), while the hedging portfolio increased in value and generated a positive return after tax of DKK 56.3bn. These movements were primarily due to the continued drop in interest rates.\n\nHedging generated total returns of DKK (7.0bn), equivalent to (0.9) per cent of the guaranteed benefits. The loss was primarily due to the break in the yield curve at 40 years, as the market rate has been significantly below 3 per cent. The yield curve break has generated a loss of DKK (6.5bn). The yield curve break at 40 years means that guarantees which during the year go from being valued at a fixed rate of 3 per cent to a market rate will generate a loss or a gain for hedging activities depending on whether the market rate is above or below 3 per cent. In 2020, the market based proportion of the interest rate curve was significantly below 3 per cent.\n\nThe loss means that funds were transferred from the bonus potential to the guaranteed benefits, but this does not affect ATP's aggregate assets. In case of unchanged market interest rates, the break in the yield curve at 40 years will also result in future hedging activity losses. The losses will, however, decrease, as over time, ATP will have fewer guarantees with a 40 year maturity. This is due to the change in the product in 2015, when the guaranteed return on new ATP contribution payments will be fixed for 15-year periods.\n\nThe hedging portfolio value without the effect of the yield curve break increased in step with the guaranteed benefits and the hedging thus once more worked as intended to protect the guarantees.\n\n## ATP yield curve at year-end 2020\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Hedging activity results and change to guaranteed benefits, accumulated 2016-2020\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(0.9)\n\nresult relative to guaranteed benefits\n\nGuaranteed benefits are calculated at fair value and the proportion of the year's fair value hedging which can be attributed to changes in the calculation interest rate and maturity reduction are recognised under 'Hedging activity results'. Other changes to guaranteed benefits are recognised in 'Pension activity results'.\n\nFinancial assets in the hedging portfolio are also recognised and measured at fair value and value adjustments are recognised under 'Hedging activity results'.",

        "page_content": "## Note 3: Expenses\n\nExpenses in the ATP Group are distributed among the business areas Investments, Pension, and Business Processing, external parties.\n\nDistribution of expenses between the different areas is based on time registration and expense allocation based on the Activity Based Costing model. Distribution of expenses intends to ensure that there is no cross-subsidisation between the different areas.\n\nGroup investment expenses amount to DKKm 886. This is a reduction relative to last year of DKKm 51, equal to 5 per cent. The reduced level is primarily due to reduced external mandates and that funds are instead included directly in ATP's statement of financial position. To this is added the indirect investment expenses and indirect performance fees which are deducted from ATP's investment return in private equity investments. The statement of annual expenses in per cent stated in the chapter 'Balanced cost efficiency' in the management's review includes the indirect investment expenses and performance fees.\n\nExpenses related to Pension, which include administration activity expenses for the management of ATP Livslang Pension (Lifelong Pension), was DKKm 210 in 2020, which is at the same level as 2019. Expenses related to Pensions represent 0.02 per cent relative to net assets. Pension expenses have been significantly reduced over several years, primarily due to ATP harvesting the benefits of stable IT support.\n\nPension expenses are expected to increase slightly in the years to come, primarily as the result of participating in shared public digitalisation initiatives during the investment phase.\n\nThe Group's business processing for external parties include work for state bodies, municipalities and labour and management.\n\nIn 2020, expenses of DKK 2.3bn were paid in relation to business processing for external parties, which are off-set by equal income. Continued efficient operations have continuously absorbed additional expenses for compliance, IT security, operational risk management, etc., while, there has been a high level of development activity with the addition of new administration tasks in recent years. 2020 saw implementation of the last subject area system for running tenders for Udbetaling Danmark - Public Benefits Administration IT systems, which taken as a whole is expected to result in reduced IT expenses for municipalities. Seniorpension has been prepared for managing, with operations set up with ATP as administrator and allocator of pensions from 1 January 2021.\n\nIn addition, there has been focus on handling Covid-19 related tasks such as paying out holiday allowances, paying DKK 1,000 to citizens on benefits, implementing the tripartite ERS (AUB) agreement on assistance for apprentices and trainees, etc.\n\nATP is once again able to keep its administration activity expenses low, as ATP Livslang Pension (Lifelong Pension) is a collective scheme and a relatively simple product.\n\n|                                                              | Group   | Group   | ATP   | ATP   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|-------|-------|\n| DKKm                                                         | 2020    | 2019    | 2020  | 2019  |\n| Investment activity expenses                                 | 886     | 937     | 552   | 462   |\n| Pension activity expenses                                    | 210     | 201     | 210   | 201   |\n| Business processing expenses, external parties               | 2,297   | 2,435   | 2,306 | 2,449 |\n| Total expenses                                               | 3,393   | 3,573   | 3,068 | 3,112 |\n| The aforementioned expenses include staff expenses totalling |         |         |       |       |\n| Remuneration                                                 | 1,469   | 1,429   | 1,375 | 1,347 |\n| Pension contributions                                        | 247     | 236     | 231   | 223   |\n| Other social security expenses                               | 28      | 22      | 27    | 21    |\n| Total staff expenses                                         | 1,744   | 1,686   | 1,633 | 1,591 |\n| Average number of full-time staff                            | 2,729   | 2,747   | 2,609 | 2,567 |\n\n## Full-time staff distributed across Denmark\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2020, ATP and the ATP Group only had employees in Denmark, distributed across locations in Vordingborg, Holstebro, Haderslev, Aller\u00f8d, Frederikshavn, Aarhus, Copenhagen and the head office in Hiller\u00f8d.\n\nManagement remuneration details can be seen in Note 18.\n\nFor further information regarding ATP employees, see ATP's responsibility report, available at:\n\n- www.atp.dk/en/responsibility-reports-and-publications\n\nATP's responsibility report is not an audit subject.",

Danish pension savings investment returns were DKK 14.5bn for 2020, and the total for the past 5 years is DKK 50.9bn.\n\nATP is taxed in Denmark pursuant to the Pension Returns Tax Act. The tax on pension savings returns is calculated on the basis of ATP's total return on assets. The rate of tax is 15.3%. The taxation basis is calculated on the accrual basis, and therefore includes both realised and non-realised returns, but exclusive of deductible interest and asset management costs.\n\nThe calculated tax on pension savings returns is partially reduced by an amount equal to ATP's international tax payments so that double taxation of ATP's returns is minimised.

As a consequence of its investment activities, ATP also has tax return obligations in Germany, Canada and the USA.\n\nIn addition to tax on pension savings returns, payments to the Danish state also include corporation tax, VAT and labour market contributions paid on behalf of members of their ATP contribution payments and personal taxes withheld and paid on behalf of own employees. As a global investor, ATP also pays taxes in several places abroad. In 2020, ATP's total tax contribution was DKK 22.8bn.\n\nRead about ATP's tax policy and the work performed by ATP to implement its tax policy in investments and in establishing national and international collaboration in the tax area.\n\n## www.atp.dk/en/tax-policy\n\nATP's tax policy is not an audit subject.\n\n|                                                                                                                                                                  | Group   | Group   | ATP    | ATP     |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|--------|---------|\n| DKKm                                                                                                                                                             | 2020    | 2019    | 2020   | 2019    |\n| Investment activity results before tax on pension savings returns                                                                                                | 28,975  | 39,725  | 28,879 | 39,570  |\n| Hedging activity results before tax on pension savings returns and change in guaranteed  benefits                                                                | 66,484  | 86,710  | 66,484 | 86,710  |\n| Interest income and interest expenses, pension activities                                                                                                        | 8       | 8       | 8      | 8       |\n| Value adjustments of owner-occupied properties                                                                                                                   | (13)    | 0       | (13)   | 0       |\n| Total PAL-taxable returns                                                                                                                                        | 95,454  | 126,443 | 95,358 | 126,288 |\n| Of which 15.3 per cent                                                                                                                                           | 14,604  | 19,346  | 14,590 | 19,322  |\n| Tax effect of different methods of calculating accounting and tax returns on transparent  entities etc.                                                          | (104)   | (138)   | (89)   | (114)   |\n| Tax effect of reduction under section 10 of the Danish Pension Savings Returns Tax Act  (reduction regarding life and pension insurance policies, year-end 1982) | (103)   | (160)   | (103)  | (160)   |\n| Tax on pension savings returns for the year                                                                                                                      | 14,398  | 19,048  | 14,398 | 19,048  |\n| Prior year adjustments                                                                                                                                           | 112     | (100)   | 112    | (100)   |\n| Total tax on pension savings returns                                                                                                                             | 14,509  | 18,948  | 14,509 | 18,948  |\n| Tax on pension savings returns is recognised in the following items:                                                                                             |         |         |        |         |\n| Tax on pension savings returns in respect of investment activities                                                                                               | 4,338   | 5,680   | 4,338  | 5,680   |\n| Tax on pension savings returns in respect of hedging activities                                                                                                  | 10,172  | 13,267  | 10,172 | 13,267  |\n| Tax on pension savings returns in respect of pension activities                                                                                                  | 1       | 1       | 1      | 1       |\n| Tax on pension savings returns, Other comprehensive income                                                                                                       | (2)     | 0       | (2)    | 0       |\n| Total tax on pension savings returns                                                                                                                             | 14,509  | 18,948  | 14,509 | 18,948  |\n\n## During the past 10 years, ATP has set aside DKK 94.4bn for PAL tax in the financial statements",

Where all investors hold proportionally identical shares of both loans and equity investment and where the company has no significant debt financing, the risk of the loan is considered to be identical to the risk of the equity investment. Such loans are presented as an integral\n\nThe private equities portfolio primarily consists of infrastructure investments, property investments, and private equity in the form of capital funds which are primarily invested via ATP Private Equity Partners.\n\n2020 saw net disposals of DKK 3bn, while the value adjustment for the year was DKK 1bn.\n\n## Private equity investments and associates, distributed by type\n\n<!-- image -->\n\npart of the investment in the associate or joint venture - both in internal management reporting and in external reporting.

The parent company ATP has invested in equity in group subsidiaries which consists primarily of investment entities that measure all material assets and liabilities at fair value using the methods described in notes 5-9. Since all material assets and liabilities in the group subsidiaries are recognised at fair value, the fair value of group subsidiaries is equivalent to ATP's share of the reported Net Asset Value1\n\nIn 2020, ATP has put DKKm 600 into Northvolt which aims to set up a factory for the production of lithium batteries. The factory will be run by hydro power, and the vision is to manufacture the most sustainable electric vehicle batteries in the world.\n\n## Significant accounting estimates\n\nSignificant accounting estimates are associated primarily with the measurement of private equity investments when the valuation is based on unobservable inputs.\n\nEstimates are applied when selecting the valuation model and assessment of the most important unobservable input parameters, including multiples\n\nand discounting factors.\n\nThe majority of the Group's private equity investments have been valued on the basis of reported fair value. In case of reported fair value, the management assesses whether the valuation methods and inputs applied by the external managers are relevant, but also whether adjustments are to be made to the reported fair value due to events after the reporting period.",

Positive price adjustments are due to the continuously falling interest rate level.\n\nOf the bond holdings, Danish and German government bonds represent DKK 480bn, and these are primarily used in the hedging activities.\n\nHedging activities also include a portfolio of 'green bonds' which at the end of 2020 stood at almost DKK 30bn. 'Green bonds' are characterised by the bond issuer using the loan to finance climate-friendly investments. A climate-friendly investment might be an investment in e.g. increased energy efficiency, hydro power and wind turbines.\n\nBond holdings also include Danish mortgage bonds, credit bonds and government bonds from the USA and other countries, which are primarily used in the investment portfolio.\n\nLoans consist of loans to credit institutions and funds which invest in bank loans, property related loans and corporate loans, and are included in the investment\n\nportfolio. Loan holdings at the end of 2020 decreased by DKK 1.6bn, which is due to negative value adjustments and a reduction in corporate loans among other things.\n\n## Green bonds\n\nATP has ESG requirements for green bonds, and we have therefore developed our own standards and requirements for issuers which exceed the 'Green Bond Principles' recommendations. ATP requires transparency related to the projects that the bonds help to finance and we also have requirements for the quality of the reporting.\n\nThe reliability report contains an in-depth discussion of ATP's investments in 'green bonds'.\n\nwww.atp.dk/en/responsibility-reports-and-publications\n\nATP's responsibility report is not an audit subject.\n\n| ATP Group                  | Fair value  31/12/2020   | Fair value  31/12/2019   | Fair value  hierarchy   | Valuation   method used                                                                                                                         | Applied observable/ unobservable inputs                                    | Fair value sensitivity to changes  in unobservable inputs                                                                  |\n|----------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                            | DKKm                     | DKKm                     |                         |                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                            |                                                                                                                            |\n| Bonds, listed              | 625,671                  | 600,224                  | 1                       | Listed price or price quote.                                                                                                                    | -                                                                          | -                                                                                                                          |\n| Bonds, observable  inputs  | 14,370                   | 13,109                   | 2                       | Discounting to net present  value using a relevant yield  curve with the addition of a  spread.                                                 | Yield curves, spreads                                                      | -                                                                                                                          |\n| Bonds, unobservable inputs | 17,919                   | 16,996                   | 3                       | Discounting of expected  future cash flows to  net present value using  relevant yield curves and  investment-specific credit  spread premiums. | Investment-specific  credit spread premiums  used on yield curves          | If investment-specific credit  spread premiums increase by 1  percentage point, the fair value is  altered by DKKm (314).  |\n| Loans, observable inputs   | 67                       | 74                       | 2                       | Discounting to net present  value using a relevant yield  curve with the addition of a  spread.                                                 | Yield curves, spreads                                                      | -                                                                                                                          |\n| Loans, unobservable inputs | 7,222                    | 8,793                    | 3                       | Discounting of expected  future cash flows using  relevant yield curves and  investment-specific credit  spread premiums                        | Applied investment- specific credit spread  premiums used on yield  curves | If investment-specific credit  spread premiums increase by  1 percentage point, the market  value is altered by DKKm (50). |\n\n## Significant accounting estimates\n\nSignificant accounting estimates are associated primarily with the measurement of bonds and loans where the valuation is based on unobservable inputs.\n\nBonds for which the valuation is based on observable inputs include bonds for which there have been no updated external prices inside\n\nthe previous two trading days prior to the balance sheet date. A theoretical price is calculated for such bonds.\n\nLoans are valued by discounting the future cash flows from the loans. The future cash flows are adjusted for changes in credit risk. The determination of the discount rate and the credit risk involves a degree of estimation, which affects the determination of the fair value.",

The ATP Group uses external estate agents and their valuation of the market level to determine the required rate of return and the market rent. The determination of operating income is affected by estimates to a lesser extent, the determination of vacancy rent being the most significant one.",

Using financial derivatives makes it possible to increase or reduce the exposure to market risks, currency and interest risks.\n\nThe most commonly used financial derivatives are interest rate swaps in Danish kroner and Euro, which are primarily used to hedge interest rate sensitivity related to guaranteed benefits, while forward contracts are used to hedge currency risks related to foreign currency\n\ninvestments. The investment portfolio uses stock index futures and equity-indexed options to achieve exposure to various stock indices, while sold Credit Default Swaps (CDS) are used to obtain credit exposure.\n\nA characteristic of financial derivatives is that their value depends on developments in the value of an underlying instrument, index or the like. As the values change, security is provided to or from the counterparties. An increasing proportion of interest rate swaps and CDS' are settled via central clearing houses such as London Clearing House.\n\n## ATP Group\n\n| 2020                        | Market value, net

The market price may be in the form of a quoted price or price quotation.\n\nLevel 2 - observable inputs: If a financial instrument is listed on a non-active market, the valuation is based on the most recent transaction price. Adjustments are made for subsequent changes\n\nin market conditions. For some financial assets and liabilities, no actual market exists. The valuation of these assets and liabilities is made using an estimated value based on recent transactions in similar instruments. For financial derivatives, valuation techniques based on market conditions, e.g. yield curves and exchange rates, are widely used.\n\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs: The valuation of certain financial assets and liabilities is based substantially on unobservable inputs. For a significant portion of the Group's equity investments and a small portion of the Group's bond portfolio, the valuation is based on unobservable inputs. Note 21 describes the individual valuation methods used to determine the fair value of these financial assets.\n\nFor assets and liabilities measured at fair value using unobservable input data (level 3), the movements for the year are as follows:\n\n## ATP Group\n\nInvestments in\n\n| DKKm                                                                         | Bonds   | Bonds   | Equity investments   | Equity investments   | Loans    | Loans    | associates   | associates   | properties   | properties   | Total    | Total    |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|----------------------|----------------------|----------|----------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|----------|----------|\n|                                                                              | 2020    | 2019    | 2020                 | 2019                 | 2020     | 2019     | 2020         | 2019         | 2020         | 2019         | 2020     | 2019     |\n| Statement of financial  position as of 01  January                           | 16,996  | 10,703  | 61,941               | 55,367               | 8,793    | 7,666    | 51,445       | 42,407       | 24,069       | 22,950       | 163,244  | 139,093  |\n| Realised/unrealised  gains or losses for the  period, recognised in  results | 160     | 594     | 174                  | 7,676                | (713)    | 592      | (3,485)      | 2,260        | 1,139        | 334          | (2,725)  | 11,456   |\n| Purchase/deposit                                                             | 2,806   | 7,674   | 21,448               | 13,894               | 17,911   | 13,448   | 862          | 4,840        | 763          | 1,107        | 43,790   | 40,963   |\n| Sale/distribution                                                            | (2,043) | (1,975) | (24,971)             | (16,937)             | (18,769) | (12,913) | (3,453)      | (1,227)      | (65)         | (322)        | (49,301) | (33,374) |\n| Reclassification                                                             | -       | -       | -                    | (1,532)              | -        | -        | -            | 1,532        | -            | -            | -        | -        |\n| Transfer into level 3                                                        | -       | -       | -                    | 3,473                | -        | -        | -            | 1,633        | -            | -            | -        | 5,106    |\n| Transfer out of level 3                                                      | -       | -       | (14)                 | -                    | -        | -        | -            | -            | -            | -            | (14)     | -        |\n| Statement of financial  position as of 31                                    | 17,919  | 16,996  | 58,579               | 61,941               | 7,222    | 8,793    | 45,369       | 51,445       | 25,906       | 24,069       | 154,995  | 163,244  |\n| December Losses/gains on assets  held                                        | (322)   | 135     | 250                  | 7,133                | (448)    | 341      | (3,624)      | 2,250        | 1,140        | 290          | (3,004)  | 10,149   |\n\nInvestment\n\nTransfer out of level 3 in 2020 consists of equity investments which became listed during 2020.

The assets included in the estimation basis reflect the relevant currency denomination, maturity and liquidity. The percentage breakdown of the assets included in the estimation basis is as follows:\n\n|                                                  | 2020   | 2019   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Interest rate swaps denominated in Danish kroner | 15%    | 15%    |\n| Interest rate swaps denominated in Euros         | 35%    | 35%    |\n| Danish government bonds                          | 25%    | 25%    |\n| German government bonds                          | 25%    | 25%    |\n\nFor interest rate swaps denominated in Danish kroner (DKK), Danish CIBOR fixings and Danish swap rates are used. For interest rate swaps denominated in euros, EURIBOR fixings, euro forward rate agreements and euro swap rates against EURIBOR and EONIA are used. For Danish government bonds, yields on Danish government bonds with a term to maturity of more than two months are used. For German government bonds, yields on German government bonds with a term to maturity of more than two months are used. From 40 years onwards, the required rate of return of 3 per cent is used.\n\nThe table below shows selected points on the zero-coupon yield curve in 2020 and 2019.\n\n| Yield curve points   | 2020    | 2019    |\n|----------------------|---------|---------|\n| 1 year               | (0.53)% | (0.54)% |\n| 5 years              | (0.53)% | (0.30)% |\n| 10 years             | (0.36)% | 0.01%   |\n| 15 years             | (0.19)% | 0.24%   |\n| 20 years             | (0.11)% | 0.38%   |\n| 30 years             | (0.09)% | 0.44%   |\n| Inflation            | (0.4)%  | 0.8%    |\n\nThe ATP Group's guaranteed benefits, calculated using the discount rates applied by ATP and EIOPA at year-end 2020, are available at ATP's website (www.atp.dk/en/dokument/pension-provisions-2020).\n\n## Life expectancy\n\nATP guarantees lifelong pensions. Thus, increases in life expectancy have a major impact on the size of the guaranteed benefits. ATP uses the SAINT life expectancy model. SAINT is based on comparable data from 18 OECD countries. In addition to factoring in already observed increases in life expectancy, SAINT allows for projected future life expectancy increases. Projections of future increases in life expectancy involve a degree of estimation and uncertainty.\n\nGuaranteed benefits are calculated at the fair value of the Group's pension liabilities, i.e. the capital value of guaranteed benefits and rights (the pension commitment) assessed as a function of the current discount rate at the statement of financial position date. Guaranteed benefits include unpaid pension benefits due in respect of events having occurred during the financial year or earlier (provisions for claims outstanding).\n\nThe discount rate is calculated in accordance with the provision basis reported to the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority, based on the zero coupon yield curve at the statement of financial position date, reflecting the term of the guaranteed benefits. The interest rate thus calculated is reduced by the tax rate in accordance with the Danish Pension Returns Tax Act, currently 15.3 per cent. The guaranteed rate of return on new ATP payments\n\nis determined for 15 years at a time, valid from 1 January 2015 onwards. So far, the rate of return has been fixed for life at the time of the contribution payment. The change only applies to members with more than 15 years until pension age. The pension guarantees issued before 2015 are not affected. At the end of each 15-year guarantee period, a new rate is fixed for a future period, based on the current market rate. This practice continues until the individual member is less than 15 years from pensionable age. At this point, a guaranteed return is fixed to apply for the rest of the member's life.\n\nRead more about ATP's pension product:\n\n- www.atp.dk/en/further-information-2020\n\nBackground about ATP Livslang Pension (Lifelong Pension) is not included in the audit.",

Group. 'Revaluation reserves' in ATP are DKKm 20 less than in the Group accounts and 'Retained earnings' are correspondingly larger.\n\nThe bonus potential as a proportion of the value of ATP's guaranteed benefits is called the bonus rate. Developing and maintaining the bonus rate is very important for ATP's future ability to generate returns and thereby delivering future bonus. Despite the increase in the bonus potential\n\nof DKK 76.2bn over the past 10 years, the bonus rate is at the same level as in 2010, as the interest rate reductions across the period have also doubled the value of the guaranteed benefits.\n\n## Development in the bonus potential and the guaranteed benefits 2010-2020\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nATP's and the Group's bonus potential are reserves that are not distributed to ATP's members.  The bonus potential is equivalent to the carrying amount of total assets related to ATP less guaranteed benefits and the sum of the carrying amount of ATP's other liabilities. The reserves can be distributed as bonus, and bonus is transferred to the guaranteed benefits via the result.\n\n## Bonus policy\n\nThe framework for ATP's bonus policy is defined in section 18(3) of the Danish Consolidated Act on Arbejdsmarkedets Till\u00e6gspension ( Bekendtg\u00f8relse af lov om Arbejdsmarkedets Till\u00e6gspension ), stipulating that the aim is to pursue a long-term bonus policy to\n\nensure that the real value of pensions is preserved. In 2017, ATP changed its bonus policy to the effect that the annual bonus decision is made on the basis of an overall assessment of a number of aspects based on the bonus rate. The bonus rate is defined as bonus potential relative to guaranteed benefits.\n\nIn order to maintain an appropriate margin for investment activities to hedge the real value of future pensions, particularly in the light of the strong increase in the value of guaranteed benefits and continued uncertainty related to Covid-19, the Supervisory Board has decided to not increase pensions in 2020.",

        "page_content": "## Note 11: Risk management\n\n## ATP's overall risks\n\nThe overall principle for ATP's risk management is that total risk (the risk consumption) must be aligned with the bonus potential. The bonus potential, which constitutes ATP's reserves, expresses the difference between the value of ATP's total assets and ATP's guaranteed benefits. The greater the bonus potential, the greater capacity ATP has to assume risks.\n\nATP's Supervisory Board has defined a risk budget which is the upper limit for the risk consumption. The risk budget for 2020 is defined as 50 per cent of the bonus potential and therefore changes dynamically in line with the bonus potential.\n\nAt the end of 2020, ATP's bonus potential was DKK 146.2bn, meaning that the risk budget was DKK 73.1bn.\n\nATP calculates risk consumption on a daily basis in an in-house developed model which includes risk across risk areas and indicates the average of the 1 per cent largest losses of bonus potential over a 3 month period (Expected Shortfall). ATP's Supervisory Board has determined calculating principles for the model for calculating risk consumption in Risk Policy for ATP.\n\n## Market risk\n\nInvestment risks are primarily market risks assumed by ATP in relation to investment and hedging activities. Market risks are risks related to market value changes of assets or liabilities as a result of changes in capital markets, including interest, equities, currency and credit markets.\n\nReturn on the investment portfolio is primarily seen as compensation for assuming market risk. In order for the investment portfolio to generate sufficiently high returns, ATP therefore actively assumes a certain degree of market risk which is aligned with the bonus potential to prevent the risk of losses becoming too high. This is done by assigning a risk budget and risk diversification framework to the investment portfolio.\n\nATP invests in infrastructure, private equity, real estate and certain types of credit, and these investments are termed alternative investments. Risks associated with these investments are, to some extent, comparable with investments in traditional liquid investment assets and are therefore included in the four factors in the investment portfolio. To this should be added a number of risks associated with managing such investments, including the contractual basis for transactions and low market liquidity. ATP has many years' experience with alternative investments and its procedures are continuously being developed and adjusted.\n\n## Counterparty risks\n\nThe use of financial derivatives, especially for hedging purposes, represents a separate risk to ATP. Changes in the value of these instruments will generate a liability or a receivable between ATP and its counterparties. ATP can therefore suffer a loss if a counterparty reneges on their obligations.\n\nIn order to reduce counterparty risk, both ATP and its counterparties require that an agreement be concluded on collateral for mutual receivables.\n\n## Longevity risk\n\nATP disburses a monthly pension for as long as the members are alive. Accordingly, increasing life expectancy (longevity risk) is the greatest pension risk facing ATP.\n\nWhen life expectancy increases more than predicted, the bonus potential is reduced, since ATP has to reserve a greater amount to cover the guaranteed benefits, as pensions have to be paid out for longer. ATP has elected not to hedge its longevity risk, and must therefore cover losses in case of increased life expectancy. ATP follows life expectancy statistics closely, based on an in-house developed life expectancy model.\n\nProvisions for longer life expectancy reduce ATP's bonus potential, but in contrast with, e.g., investment losses, they do not reduce the members' total assets. On the contrary, additional provisions as a result of longer life expectancy, reflect that ATP's members are expected to live longer and provisions will therefore benefit ATP's members.\n\nOther Danish pension companies apply a model based on life expectancy preconditions developed by the Danish FSA for the use of those insured via the life and pension companies.\n\nThe Danish FSA's life expectancy preconditions are a benchmark for current observed life expectancy, based\n\n## Expected future increases in life expectancy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\non information from a number of Danish life insurance companies and broad-spectrum pension funds with a total of 2.9 million customers, as well as a benchmark for life expectancy improvements based on population data from all of Denmark. ATP's model is based partly on information about its 5.3 million members and partly on information about approx. 340 million inhabitants in 18 OECD countries. This means that different data are used when modelling life expectancy preconditions, just as the models themselves differ\n\nThe model developed by ATP builds on the supposition that life expectancy in Denmark follows the same pattern as the 18 selected OECD nations and that the lag in Denmark relative to the selective countries will be caught up over time. Data across the last 100 years show that those countries, generally speaking, have undergone the same life expectancy development, although there are differences between the countries on when and how swiftly those life expectancy improvements take place. ATP includes international data in order to provide a stable prognosis for future life expectancy improvements.\n\nThe figure shows life expectancy for 65-year-old men and women using ATP's and the Danish FSA's model, respectively, for life expectancy presumptions, with the latter adjusted to the life expectancies observed by ATP. It can be seen that ATP's life expectancy model projects higher increases in life expectancy than those envisaged by the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority's (FSA) model.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nATP's liquidity management ensures that ATP will, at all times, be able to meet any requirement for provision of liquidity or pledging of collateral. This applies both in the short term and in the longer term.\n\n## Currency exposure\n\nATP's investments are usually hedged against currency fluctuations in Danish kroner and Euros. Thus, the exposure to currencies other than Danish kroner and Euros is limited. In light of the high degree of confidence in Denmark's fixed price policy, ATP tolerates a significant exposure to the Euro.",

Risk allocation has been determined as each risk factor's share of the sum of risk for the four risk factors. The ATP Supervisory Board has set a long-term guideline and upper and lower limits for each risk factor's share of the overall risk of the investment portfolio.\n\n## Relative risk allocation (per cent)\n\naries, the market risks of the Group are identical to those of ATP.\n\nA number of risk targets are used in the measurement of ATP's market risks, including Expected Shortfall, which is a generally used target for risk in worst-case scenarios. Expected Shortfall over a three-month timeframe and a 1 percent quantile (ES, three months, 99 per cent) expresses the average of the 1 per cent worst losses over a three-month timeframe.\n\n## Market risks in the hedging portfolio\n\nMarket risks in the hedging portfolio and the guaranteed benefits consist mainly of interest rate risks. The hedging ratio indicates the ability of the hedging portfolio to hedge the interest rate sensitivity of the guaranteed benefits.\n\nATP aims to ensure that the hedging ratio, measured by DKK duration after tax, remains in a narrow range of about 100 per cent. Accordingly, market risks associated with the hedging portfolio are very limited.\n\n## DKK duration and hedging ratio\n\n|                                                   | As of   31 December 2020   | As of   31 December 2019   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Guaranteed benefits' DKK duration after tax, DKKm | (122,955)                  | (111,646)                  |\n| Hedging portfolio's DKK duration after tax, DKKm  | 122,296                    | 111,211                    |\n| Hedging ratio in per cent                         | 99.5                       | 99.6                       |\n\nThe DKK duration indicates the market value impact of a marginal change in interest rates, scaled to take into account a 1 per cent decline in interest rates.\n\n## Currency risks\n\nATP's currency risks are, as a general rule, hedged in DKK and euros.

Bonds and loans provided as collateral continue to be recognised in the Group's statement of financial position.\n\nAssets provided and received as collateral are specified in the table below:\n\n|                                     | Group   | Group   | ATP    | ATP    |\n|-------------------------------------|---------|---------|--------|--------|\n| DKKm                                | 2020    | 2019    | 2020   | 2019   |\n| Assets provided as collateral:      |         |         |        |        |\n| Bonds                               | 66,987  | 46,207  | 66,987 | 46,028 |\n| Loans                               | 832     | 1,637   | 766    | 1,563  |\n| Cash and cash equivalents           | 2,155   | 1,019   | 1,918  | 651    |\n| Total assets provided as collateral | 69,974  | 48,863  | 69,671 | 48,242 |\n| Assets received as collateral:      |         |         |        |        |\n| Bonds                               | 59,962  | 66,799  | 59,832 | 66,714 |\n| Cash and cash equivalents           | 164     | 131     | -      | -      |\n| Total assets received as collateral | 60,126  | 66,930  | 59,832 | 66,714 |\n\nFinally, ATP's other portfolios of bonds involve a credit risk. As regards government bonds, excluding emerging markets, the credit risk is assessed as being close to zero, as 99 per cent of this portfolio consisted of German and Danish government bonds at year-end 2020. As\n\nregards mortgage bonds, bonds issued by international organisations (supranationals) and bonds issued by publicly guaranteed authorities (agencies), the credit risk is assessed as being moderate.\n\n## Market value as of 31 December\n\n| DKKbn.                                                               |   2020 |   2019 |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Credit investments                                                   |     38 |     40 |\n| Mortgage bonds                                                       |    124 |    125 |\n| Government bonds excluding emerging markets                          |    484 |    463 |\n| Bonds issued by supranationals or agencies                           |     24 |     14 |\n| Unlisted financial derivatives, net (before provision of collateral) |     34 |     24 |\n| Unlisted financial derivatives, net (after provision of collateral)  |      0 |      0 |\n| Cash                                                                 |     11 |      7 |\n| Other receivables                                                    |     14 |     17 |\n\nThe market value of credit investments includes CDS' with a market value at year-end 2020 of DKK 2.0bn (2019: DKK 1.8bn) and a principal amount at year-end 2020 of DKK 77bn (2019: DKK 58bn). In addition, at year-end 2020 ATP had guarantees issued of DKK 0.7bn (2019: DKK 1.0bn).\n\nOther receivables mainly consist of unsettled transactions, ATP contributions receivable and rents receivable. Provisions are made for expected losses on ATP contributions receivable and rent receivable based on a simplified provision matrix using a fixed provisions percentage depending on how many days the receivable remains overdue. The provision rate is based on historical data.\n\n## Note 11c: Liquidity risks\n\nLiquidity risks are risks associated with potential non-payment of payment demands or securities. ATP has developed a liquidity risk management model intended to ensure that ATP at all times remains able to comply with its contractual obligations regarding providing either liquidity or security.\n\nThis is done by ensuring that liquidity and liquidity requirements both in the short term (5 banking days) and the longer term (1 year) are mutually aligned. Liquidity can be obtained via the sale of assets, but also via the repo market. The net liquidity effect on contribution payments and pension benefits over the year is stable.\n\n## Maturity analysis\n\nIn the table below, the Group's financial liabilities are broken down by contractual maturity including interest.\n\n| 2020 ATP Group DKKm                                    | 0-1 year   |                      | 1-5 years 6-15 years   | 16-20  years   | Over 20  years   |

financial liabilities stated, the ATP Group have made a number of investment and loan commitments, see Note 14 'Contingent liabilities'.

The accounting methods include discounting to net present value of future cash flows and assessment of underlying market conditions. Assumptions of interest rates, risk premiums, volatility, default and prepayments and other information are included in the use of these methods. The fair value of financial assets and liabilities, including financial derivatives for which no quoted market prices exist, is based on the best information available under the circumstances.\n\nFinancial assets where the valuation is based on unobservable inputs include parts of the Group's bonds, equity investments, including investments in associates and joint ventures, investment properties and loans.\n\nBreakdown of the Group's financial assets measured under level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.\n\n|                                              | 2020    | 2020     | 2019    | 2019     |\n|----------------------------------------------|---------|----------|---------|----------|\n|                                              | DKKm    | Per cent | DKKm    | Per cent |\n| Bonds                                        | 17,919  | 12%      | 16,996  | 10%      |\n| Equity investments                           | 58,579  | 38%      | 61,941  | 38%      |\n| Loans                                        | 7,222   | 5%       | 8,793   | 5%       |\n| Investments in associates and joint ventures | 45,369  | 29%      | 51,445  | 32%      |\n| Investment properties                        | 25,906  | 17%      | 24,069  | 15%      |\n|                                              | 154,995 | 100%     | 163,244 | 100%     |\n\nS ee notes 5, 6, 7, and 8 for more information about valuation principles and sensitivities to change to the most significant unobservable input parameters.",

These subsidiaries are jointly and severally liable for the payment of VAT and payroll tax included in the joint registration for VAT.\n\nOwing to its size and business volume, the ATP Group is continually a party to various lawsuits and disputes. Cases are assessed on an ongoing basis, and pending lawsuits and disputes are not believed to have any significant impact on the financial position of the ATP Group.\n\n1 As of 2001 and under certain conditions, the ATP Group is not subject to income tax on the activities of its subsidiary ATP Ejendomme A/S. If the conditions for tax exemption are not met, provisions are made for both current and deferred tax in the company. In 2020, ATP Ejendomme A/S met the conditions for tax exemption.\n\nThe accounting treatment of contingent assets and liabilities is based on an assessment of the expected outcome of the applicable contingency. If it is almost certain that a future economic benefit will flow to the ATP Group, the asset and the related income are recognised. If, on the other hand, it is probable that a future economic benefit will flow from the ATP Group when discharging the liabili-\n\nty, the contingency is recognised as a liability. Where it is not possible to estimate an amount with sufficient certainty, or it is not possible to es -timate the outcome of a given matter, information to this effect will be provided. Decisions relating to such matters may generate realised profits or losses in future accounting periods that exceed the amounts recognised in the financial statements.\n\n## Note 15: Benefit payouts\n\n|                                  | Group   | Group   | ATP    | ATP    |\n|----------------------------------|---------|---------|--------|--------|\n| DKKm                             | 2020    | 2019    | 2020   | 2019   |\n| Personal pension (current)       | 16,082  | 16,008  | 16,082 | 16,008 |\n| Spouse pension (current)         | 7       | 9       | 7      | 9      |\n| Personal pension (capitalised)   | 71      | 70      | 71     | 70     |\n| Spouse pension (capitalised)     | 869     | 815     | 869    | 815    |\n| Child benefits (capitalised)     | 116     | 119     | 116    | 119    |\n| SUPP estate amount (capitalised) | 34      | 32      | 34     | 32     |\n| Total benefit payouts            | 17,180  | 17,054  | 17,180 | 17,054 |\n\nBenefit payouts comprise personal pensions paid, spouse pensions and capitalised benefits for the year.

Thus, there is no difference between the columns 'Recognised assets, gross' and 'Net amounts of financial assets presented in the statement of financial position'. The ATP Group extensively uses collateral provided to and from counterparties when entering into financial contracts. Net amounts thus indicate the exposure after provision of collateral. There are no disclosures specifically for the ATP Parent Company, as the disclosures in all material respects are identical to those provided for the Group.\n\n| 2020 ATP Group                       | Financial                 | Financial                                                       | Related amounts not offset in the  statement of financial position                      | Related amounts not offset in the  statement of financial position   | Related amounts not offset in the  statement of financial position   | Related amounts not offset in the  statement of financial position   |\n|--------------------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Financial assets DKKm                | Recognised  assets, gross | liabilities  offset   in the  statement  of financial  position | Net amounts of   financial assets  presented in   the statement of   financial position | Financial  instruments                                               | Financial collateral                                                 | Net amounts                                                          |\n| Financial derivatives                | 151,680                   | -

Consequently, the return on investment and the return ratios etc. deviate from ATP's format, which is IFRS-compliant.\n\nPlease refer to the description of ratios in Appendix 3 of ATP's executive order on accounting issued by the Danish FSA (Executive Order on Financial Reporting by the Danish Labour Market Supplementary\n\n## Pension Fund (ATP), Executive Order no. 570 of 2 June 2016).\n\n1 ATP does not apply the Danish FSA's return ratio. The return ratio tends to over-reflect market value changes in ATP's hedging portfolio, which will not notably affect the pensions promised. As the ratio does not allow for variance in the value creation of the guaranteed products, the ratio does not provide a complete picture of the value creation for ATP's members for the individual year. However, in the very long term, the ratio reflects to a greater extent the value creation.",

For this reason, the return ratio does not present an accurate view of the return.\n\nPlease refer to the description of ratios in Appendix 2 of ATP's executive order on accounting issued by the Danish FSA (Executive Order on Financial Reporting by the Danish Labour Market Supplementary Pension Fund (ATP), Executive Order no. 570 of 2 June 2016.\n\n1 The two asset classes 'Other investment assets' and 'Financial derivatives entered into for the purpose of hedging the net change of assets and liabilities' only contain derivatives and their primary purpose is to hedge investment currency risk and guaranteed benefits interest risk respectively. It therefore does not make sense to state separate returns figures for these asset classes.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Note 21: Accounting policies Note 21: Accounting policies\n\nThe  consolidated  financial  statements  and  the  annual report of ATP for 2020 have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU and in accordance with additional Danish disclosure requirements as set out in the 'Executive Order on Financial Reporting by the Danish Labour Market Supplementary  Pension  Scheme'  (Bekendtg\u00f8relse  om finansielle rapporter for Arbejdsmarkedets Till\u00e6gspension).\n\nWhen preparing the consolidated financial statements and the  parent  company  financial  statements,  Management assumes a number of estimates and preconditions which affect the accounting value of assets and liabilities as well as income and expenses. Note 22 details the accounting assessments  performed  by  Management  in  connection with the application of accounting policies and estimates which  are  considered  important  material  for  the  preparation  of  the  group  financial  statements  and  the  parent company financial  statements.  Accounting  estimates  for specific items are set out in the individual notes.\n\nWith  the  exception  of  the  implementation  of  new  and revised accounting standards as described in note 23, the accounting policies are unchanged from 2019.\n\nAll figures are stated in DKKm. the totals stated are calculated on the basis of actual figures and the rounding off to nearest DKKm may result in minor differences between the sum of individual figures and totals stated.\n\n## Materiality in presentation\n\nWhen preparing the consolidated financial statements and the  parent  company  financial  statements,  Management performs an assessment about their presentation. In this context,  it  is  taken  into  account  that  the  content  of  the Group and parent company financial statements is significant  to  the  reader.  In  the  presentation  of  the  Group's and ATP's assets, liabilities, financial position and performance,  it  is  assessed  whether  it  would  be  beneficial  to aggregate  less  significant  amounts.  In  the  preparation of the notes, the focus is on ensuring that the content is relevant  and  the  presentation  is  clear.  Assessments  are always  carried  out  in  relation  to  legislation,  international accounting standards and guidelines and to ensure that the annual report provides an overall true and fair view.\n\nThe  assessment  of  materiality  and  relevance  in  the presentation has resulted in changes to the presentation of several notes relative to the annual report for 2019. The altered presentation also includes the comparison figures in the relevant notes.\n\n## Consolidation\n\nThe  consolidated  financial  statements  comprise  the financial  statements  of  ATP,  the  Parent  Company,  and entities  controlled  by  ATP.  ATP  controls  an  entity  when ATP is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.\n\nThe consolidated financial  statements  are  based  on  the financial  statements  of  the  Parent  Company  and  the individual  subsidiaries,  prepared  in  accordance  with  the Group's  accounting  policies.  Upon  consolidation,  items of a uniform nature are added together and the following items are eliminated: intercompany income and expenses, equity holdings, intercompany balances and dividends, as well as realised and unrealised gains and losses on transactions between consolidated companies.\n\nA group overview is available on page 76.\n\n## Foreign currency translation:\n\n## Functional currency and presentation currency\n\nThe  consolidated  financial  statements  are  presented in  Danish  kroner  (DKK),  the  functional  currency  and presentation  currency  of  the  Parent  Company.  The functional  currency  is  the  currency  used  in  the  primary financial environment in which the reporting entity operates. A functional currency is determined for each of the Group's reporting  entities.  All  of  the  Group's  entities  use  Danish kroner (DKK) as their functional currency.\n\n## Conversion of transactions and amounts\n\nTransactions  in  currencies  other  than  the  functional currency  are  foreign  currency  transactions.  Foreign currency  transactions  are  converted  into  the  functional currency  at  the  exchange  rate  prevailing  at  the  transaction date. Investment assets, receivables and payables in  foreign  currencies  are  converted  into  the  functional currency at the exchange rate prevailing at the statement of financial position date. Realised and unrealised foreign exchange  gains  and  losses  are  included  in  the  income statement  under  'Investment  return'  and  'Return  from hedging activities'.\n\n## Income statement\n\n## Returns on investment and hedging activities\n\nReturns  on  investment  and  hedging  activities  include interest  income,  interest  expenses,  dividends  and  price adjustments on financial assets and liabilities included in the hedging portfolio and the investment portfolio, respec-\n\ntively.  Returns  on  investment  also  include  income  from investment properties.\n\n## Income from investment properties\n\nIncome from investment properties is comprised of the rental income from investment properties for the year and sale of timber from forestry properties less property management and operating expenses for forestry properties.\n\n## Expenses\n\nExpenses are allocated between the individual business units either as direct expenses or as an expense allocation based on ATP's internal model for allocation of other expenses.\n\nInvestment activity expenses comprise expenses incurred to achieve the investment return for the year. These expenses include direct and indirect expenses related, for example, to  pay  and  remuneration,  custody  expenses  and  transaction costs related to the purchase and sale of investment assets.  Expenses  incurred  in  investment  subsidiaries  are also included in these expenses for the Group.\n\nPension  activity  expenses  comprise  expenses  incurred in connection with the administration of the ATP pension scheme, including SUPP (Supplementary Labour Market Pension Scheme  for Disability Pensioners). These expenses include direct and indirect expenses related, for example, to pay and remuneration, IT operations, amortisation of internal development projects and depreciation on property, plant and equipment.\n\nAdministration activity expenses  comprise  expenses incurred in connection with the management of a number of  large  schemes.  These  expenses  include  direct  and indirect  expenses  related,  for  example,  to  wages  and remuneration,  IT  operations  and  amortisation  of  internal development projects.\n\n## Contribution\n\nContribution income is recognised as reporting is received. Contributions include the reported and claimed ATP contributions  less  labour  market  contribution  and  the  year's adjustment of amortisation on contributions receivable.\n\n## Payment of benefits\n\nPaid out benefits comprise personal pensions paid, spouse pensions  and  capitalised  benefits  for  the  year.  Benefits prepaid are accrued on the statement of financial position and presented under the item 'Other prepayments'.\n\n## Other income\n\nOther income includes income for the year from the sale\n\nof  administration  services  to  external  clients  as  well  as related parties. Also included is other customary income for  the  year  that  cannot  be  attributed  to  pension  and investment activities.\n\n## Other expenses\n\nOther expenses include expenses incurred for the sale of administration services. Also included are other customary expenses for the year that cannot be attributed to Pensions & Investments under the item 'Other expenses'.\n\n## Tax on pension savings returns\n\nTax on pension savings returns comprises current tax on pension savings returns for the year, changes in deferred tax  on  pension  savings  returns,  and  prior  year  adjustments, if any. Tax on pension savings returns is allocated between investment, hedging and pension activities based on the return allocated to investment, hedging and pension activities, respectively.\n\nCurrent tax liabilities in respect of pension savings returns and current tax receivable in respect of pension savings returns are recognised in the statement of financial position as calculated tax on pension savings returns adjusted for interim payment of tax on pension savings returns.\n\nDeferred tax assets in respect of pension savings returns, including  the  tax  value  of  tax  loss  carryforwards,  are included at the value at which the asset is expected to be realisable - either by elimination in pension savings returns  tax  on  future  earnings  or  by  set-off  against deferred tax liabilities.\n\nDeferred  tax  on  pension  savings  returns  is  measured  in accordance with current tax rules and at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the temporary differences reverse.\n\n## Corporate income tax\n\nTax on results for the year, comprising current tax for the year, changes in deferred tax and prior-year adjustments, if any, is recognised in the income statement. Tax payable and deferred tax are recognised under payables, while tax receivable and deferred tax assets are recognised under assets.\n\n## Statement of financial position\n\n## Financial assets and liabilities\n\nPurchase  and  sale  of  financial  assets  and  liabilities  are recognised on the trade date.",

        "page_content": "## Note 21: Accounting policies, continued\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are recognised at fair value on  the  trading  date.  Subsequent  to  initial  recognition, financial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value or amortised cost.\n\n## Financial assets\n\nThe following financial assets are measured after the initial recognition at fair value as a result of ATP's business model:\n\n- \u00b7 Bonds\n- \u00b7 Loans, including loans to group subsidiaries\n- \u00b7 Receivables from credit institutions (reverse transactions)\n\nThe  assets  and  liabilities  specified  above  are  managed and  assessed  based  on  fair  value  in  accordance  with the Group's risk management strategy, and are therefore measured  at  fair  value  with  value  adjustment  via  the income statement.\n\nThe financial assets below are not based on cash-flows consisting  of  payment  of  principal  and  interest,  and  are therefore measured at fair value after initial recognition:\n\n- \u00b7 Equity investments, including investments in subsidiaries and associates and joint ventures\n- \u00b7 Financial derivatives\n\nOther financial assets are measured after initial recognition at amortised cost price.\n\n## Financial liabilities\n\nFinancial  derivatives  with  a  negative  market  value  must be recognised at fair value, while it has been decided to recognise payables to credit institutions resulting from repo transactions  at  fair  value  with  value  adjustment  through the income statement as they are managed and assessed based on fair value in accordance with the Group's risk management strategy.\n\nOther  financial  liabilities  are  subsequently  measured  at amortised cost.\n\nAdjustment  of  the  fair  value  of  financial  assets  and liabilities  is  recognised  in  the  income  statement  under 'Investment returns' and 'Returns from hedging activities' on an ongoing basis. As regards payables to credit institutions resulting from repo transactions, the portion of the fair value changes that is attributable to changes in ATP's own  credit  risk  is  recognised  in  'Other  comprehensive income.'  Due  to  ATP's  strong  financial  position  and  the\n\nshort  maturity  of  the  repo  transactions,  the  impact  of ATP's credit risk is assessed as being insignificant.\n\n## Determination of fair value\n\nFor  financial  assets  and  liabilities  that  are  traded  in  a market, the official market price is used. Measuring listed equities  and  financial  assets  and  liabilities  is  based  on closing  prices  from  relevant  stock  exchanges  while  bid prices are used for listed bonds. If, in respect of bonds, there  have  been  no  updated  external  prices  inside  the previous two trading days prior to the balance sheet date, a theoretical price is calculated and the bonds are registered as 'observable input' in the fair value hierarchy.\n\nFor  other  financial  assets  and  liabilities,  the  fair  value determination  represents  ATP's  most  objective  estimate of the current fair value of financial assets and liabilities, based on the most unambiguous and uniform guidelines possible and, to some extent, supported by management estimates. When determining these estimates, the following methods are applied:\n\n## Bonds, interest-based investment assets and liabilities\n\nFor investments in bonds for which no active market exists, yield curves with the addition of yield spreads and investment-specific premiums are used.\n\n## Equity investments, including investments in subsidiaries and associates and joint venture.\n\nPrivate  equity  investments  consist  of  investments  in portfolio  funds,  direct  equity  investments,  direct  equity investments in portfolio companies and real estate funds.\n\n## Portfolio funds\n\nFor  a  significant  portion  of  the  investments  in  portfolio funds, the valuation is based on reporting received from portfolio  funds.  Equity  investments  in  portfolio  funds  are generally  measured  using  the  IPEV  Valuation  Guidelines under which equity investments are measured at fair value on the reporting date. Listed equity investments in portfolio funds  are  measured  at  the  closing  rate  of  the  relevant stock  exchange.  For  unlisted  equity  investments  for which no quoted price exists, the equity investments are measured on the basis of the latest market price - either in connection with a round of capital increases resulting in a change in ownership or in connection with a partial sale, based on the value of comparable companies.\n\n## Direct equity investments\n\nDirect  private  equity  investments  are  measured  using one of the following methods: a) multiple analysis where the  ratio  of  the  value  of  comparable  listed  companies to  relevant  key  figures  for  these  companies  is  used  in\n\nthe  valuation  of  the  company  in  question;  b)  if  sufficient comparable companies cannot be found, a 'sum-of-theparts' valuation is performed where each business unit of the  company  in  question  is  measured  separately;  c)  for new investments, the acquisition cost is used.\n\n## Direct equity investments in portfolio companies\n\nDirect  equity  investments  in  portfolio  companies  consist of  co-investments  together  with  portfolio  funds  and are  valued  using  traditional  valuation  methods  and  as described above for portfolio funds. The following factors are included in the determination of fair value:\n\n- \u00b7 Valuation and other significant conditions related to the latest round of financing\n- \u00b7 Significant events related to the company's business, product launches, new clients, changes to the management team\n- \u00b7 Compliance or non-compliance with significant predefined milestones and other conditions assessed to be capable of impacting the fair value, including general changes in market and competition conditions and new technology.\n\n## Real estate funds\n\nPrivate equity investments in real estate funds are measured primarily  on  the  basis  of  the  valuations  performed  by the  real  estate  funds.  The  measurement  is  based  on  a valuation model that measures the fair value of the equity where the fair value of the underlying properties is reflected on an ongoing basis. The fair value of the real estate is usually determined on the basis of valuations performed by external estate agents and market assessors. In addition, the  managers  of  the  funds  regularly  perform  an  internal valuation based on changes in market conditions, which is typically reflected in an adjustment of the required rate of return. Other factors such as the stability of the real estate cash flow, market rent level, location and tenant quality are included in the valuation.\n\n## Loans\n\nValuation  of  loans  is  based  on  discounting  of  expected future cash flows to net present value using relevant yield curves and investment-specific credit spread premiums.\n\n## Receivables from and payables to credit institutions\n\nInclude repo and reverse transactions, i.e. the purchase/ sale  of  securities  where,  an  agreement  is  concluded regarding  selling  back/buying  back  at  a  later  time.  In reverse  transactions,  the  securities  purchased  are  not included  in  the  statement  of  financial  position,  and  the\n\namount paid is recognised as a receivable. In repo transactions, securities sold are still included in the statement of financial position and the amount received is recognised as a liability.  On  initial  recognition,  receivables  from  and debts to credit institutions are recognised at fair value and subsequently  measured  at  fair  value.  Interest  received and paid is recognised across the duration of contracts. Valuation  of  repo  and  reverse  transactions  is  based  on discounting of expected future cash flows using relevant yield curves.\n\n## Financial assets and liabilities at amortised cost Other receivables\n\nOther  receivables,  which  primarily  comprise  incomplete transactions, contributions receivable and rent receivable, are measured at amortised cost. Amortised cost is usually equivalent to nominal value.\n\nProvisions are made for expected losses on ATP contributions receivable and rent receivable based on a simplified provision  matrix  using  a  fixed  provisions  percentage depending  on  how  many  days  the  receivable  remains overdue. The provision rate is based on historical data.\n\nProvisions for expected losses are deducted directly from the asset items to which the provisions relate, while period changes are recognised in the income statement.\n\n## Other liabilities\n\nIncludes  'Payables  to  group  subsidiaries'  and  'Other payables', measured at amortised cost, essentially equivalent to nominal value.\n\n## Financial derivatives\n\nOn initial recognition, i.e. the trade date, financial derivatives are recognised at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition, financial derivatives are also measured at fair value. For financial derivatives that are traded in a market, the  official  market  price  is  used.  For  financial  derivatives  that  are  not  traded  in  a  market,  various  generally accepted valuation methods are used, depending on the type of instrument involved. For interest rate instruments, valuation is based on the market rate expressed as the zero  coupon  yield  curve  at  the  statement  of  financial position date.\n\nChanges in the fair value of financial derivatives are recognised  in  the  income  statement  as  they  occur.  Financial derivatives with a positive fair value are recognised in the statement  of  financial  position  as  assets,  while  financial derivatives with a negative fair value are recognised in the statement of financial position as liabilities.

Securities which, as part of collateral  security,  have  only  been  formally  assigned  to ATP's ownership are not recognised in the statement of financial  position,  given  that  ATP  neither  bears  the  risk nor benefits from the return on these securities. Similarly, securities which ATP only has assigned formally to counterparties  as  part  of  collateral  security  are  still  recognised in  ATP's  statement  of  financial  position.  ATP  enters  into foreign  exchange  contracts  with  external  counterparties on behalf of several of the Group's subsidiaries.\n\n## Investments in group subsidiaries\n\nEquity investments in group subsidiaries are managed and assessed based on fair value in accordance with ATP's risk management and investment strategies. Reporting to the ATP Group Management is also based on this, for which reason ATP has selected the option in IAS 27 to recognise equity investments in group subsidiaries in accordance with the regulations of IFRS 9. Cash-flows from equity investments in group subsidiaries do not consist of payment of principal and interest, meaning that equity investments in group subsidiaries are recognised at fair value with value adjustment via the income statement.\n\nNo  minority  interests  are  deemed  to  own  a  significant share of the group subsidiaries.\n\n## Investments in associates and joint ventures\n\nAssociates are entities in which the Group has a significant but not controlling interest. Significant interest is typically achieved through direct or indirect ownership or disposal of more than 20 per cent of the voting rights, but less than 50 per cent. In the assessment of whether the Group has a  significant  interest,  potential  voting  rights  that  may  be exercised at the statement of financial position date are taken into account. Joint ventures include entities whose activities  are  jointly  controlled  by  the  Group,  which  is generally the case if the Group holds 50 per cent of the voting rights.\n\nIn  accordance  with  IAS  28,  ATP  and  the  ATP  Group have  decided  to  recognise  and  measure  investments  in associates and joint ventures under the provisions of IFRS 9. Cash-flows from equity investments in associates and joint ventures do not consist of payment of principal and interest, and investments in associates and joint ventures\n\nare therefore recognised and measured at fair value with value adjustment through the income statement.\n\nInvestments  in  associates  and  joint  ventures  are  often structured  as  a  combination  of  share  equity  investment and loans. Where all investors hold proportionally identical shares of both loans and equity investment and where the company has no significant debt financing, the risk of the loan is considered to be identical to the risk of the equity investment. Such loans are presented as an integral part of the investment in the associate or joint venture - both in internal management reporting and in external reporting. Loans that  are  an  integral  part  of  the  investment  in  the associate or joint venture are recognised and measured at fair value.\n\n## Investment properties\n\nInvestment properties are properties held by the ATP Group to  earn  rental  income  and/or  capital  gains.  Investment properties are properties which the ATP Group does not use for administration etc. as such properties are classified as owner-occupied properties. Properties with elements of owner-occupied properties and investment properties are allocated proportionately between the two asset types.\n\nOn  initial  recognition,  investment  properties  are  recognised  at  cost  including  transaction  expenses.  Subsequent  to  initial  recognition,  investment  properties  are measured at fair value. A return-based model is used to determine the fair value of the Danish properties.  These valuations are segmented on the locations and qualities of  the  properties.  The  valuation  of  the  Group's  international  properties  is  made  by  external  valuers,  since local  knowledge abroad requires external inputs. Determining the return in the return-based model for individual properties is based on the expected rental income at full occupancy of the properties. Expected operating, administration  and  maintenance  expenses  are  deducted.  The value subsequently calculated is adjusted for recognised vacancy  rent  loss  for  a  suitable  period  and  expected expenses  related  to  major  maintenance  work;  deposits and prepaid rent are also added. An external assessment has been obtained for the valuation of market rent, and required rates of return are determined based on external estate agents' assessment of the market level.\n\nExpenses incurred in the form of new or improved qualities which  result  in  an  increase  in  the  fair  value  determined immediately prior to the incurrence of the expenses, are added to the acquisition price as improvements.\n\n## Forestry investment properties\n\nForestry  investment  properties  include  land  planted  with\n\nwoodlands  that  are  held  for  the  purpose  of  generating income from the sale of timber and capital gains.\n\nOn initial recognition, investment properties are recognised at cost including transaction expenses, and subsequently at fair value. The measuring of forestry investment property fairly  is  based on a weighted average of fair values of a variety  of  models.  The  most  commonly  applied  models include  recent  sales  of  comparable  forestry  investment properties adjusted for size, location and types of timber and DCF models discounting expected future income from the sales of timber and land.\n\nThe fair value is determined by external valuing experts specialising in forestry investment properties.\n\n## Owner-occupied properties\n\nOwner-occupied  properties  are  properties  used  by the Group  for administration purposes. Properties with  elements  of  both  owner-occupied  properties  and investment properties are allocated proportionately between the two asset types by square metre.\n\nOwner-occupied  properties  are  recognised  at  cost  and subsequently  measured  at  fair  value  using  a  revaluation model. Revaluation is performed at the end of each quarter. The fair value of owner-occupied properties is assessed using the principles applied to the Group's investment properties.\n\nDepreciation of owner-occupied properties is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful economic lives of the assets. The depreciation periods have been determined at 50 years. No depreciation is provided for land.\n\nRevaluation of a property from cost to fair value is recognised  under  'Other  comprehensive  income'  and  is  tied to  a  special  provision  under  the  bonus  potential,  unless the  revaluation  is  offset  by  a  corresponding  decrease  in value  previously  recognised  in  the  income  statement.  A decrease in the fair  value  of  a  property  is  recognised  in the  income  statement,  unless  the  decrease  is  offset  by a  corresponding  increase  in  value  previously  recognised in  the  item  'Other  comprehensive  income'.  In  that  case, the decrease in value is recognised under 'Other comprehensive income'.\n\nIn  case  of  sale  of  an  owner-occupied  property,  previous years'  revaluations  are  not  recirculated  to  the  income statement.  Instead,  there  is  a  transfer  from  'Revaluation provisions' to 'Transferred profits' under the bonus potential.\n\nOn initial recognition, leasing assets are measured at cost, corresponding  to  the  discounted  value  of  the  expected\n\nrent payments. The leasing period, which forms the basis for calculating the rent liability, corresponds to the period for  which  ATP,  as  the  lessee,  is  entitled  and  expects  to make use of the underlying assets.\n\nSubsequently, the leasing asset is measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and depreciation. The leasing asset is amortised across the shorter period of the leasing period  and  the  working  life  of  the  leasing  asset  and amortisations  are  straight-line  recognised  in  the  income statement.\n\nOn  initial  recognition,  leasing  liabilities  are  measured  at amortised  cost  and  a  calculated  interest  cost  is  recognised in the income statement.\n\n## Operating equipment\n\nOperating equipment is measured at cost less accumulated  depreciation  and  impairment losses. Cost includes the acquisition price as well as expenses directly related to the acquisition until such a time as the asset is ready for use. Expenses incurred for repair and maintenance are taken directly to the income statement.\n\nDepreciation  of  operating  equipment  is  provided  on  a straight-line basis over the estimated useful economic lives of the assets. The depreciation periods have been determined at two to six years.\n\nLosses or gains on the sale or other disposal of property, plant  and  equipment  are  measured  as  the  difference between the selling price and the carrying amount.\n\nThe  residual  value  and  useful  economic  lives  of  the assets are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at each statement of financial position date. If the residual value of the asset exceeds the carrying amount, depreciation is discontinued. In case of changes in the depreciation period or the residual value, the prospective effect of depreciation is recognised as a change in accounting estimate.\n\n## Intangible assets\n\n## Goodwill\n\nOn  initial  recognition,  goodwill  is  recognised  in  the statement of financial position at cost. Subsequent to initial recognition,  goodwill  is  measured  at  cost  less  accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is not amortised.\n\n## Internal development projects\n\nClearly  defined  and  identifiable  development  projects,  for which  the  technical  rate  of  utilisation,  sufficient  resources and a potential future market or application in the company can be demonstrated, and where the intention is to produce,",

Other development costs are recognised in  the  income  statement  as  incurred.  Development  costs include  expenses,  remuneration  and  amortisation  attributable to the Group's development activities.\n\nInternal  development  projects  are  measured  at  cost less  accumulated  amortisation  and  impairment  losses. Amortisation is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated  useful  economic  lives  of  the  assets,  typically from three to ten years. The useful economic lives of the assets are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at each statement of financial position date.\n\n## Impairment test\n\nAn annual goodwill impairment test is performed, while other intangible fixed assets are assessed annually for indications of depreciation.\n\nIn  case of indications of depreciation, impairment test is performed for each asset or group of assets. The asset is  depreciated  to  the  recoverable  value  if  this  is  lower than  the  accounting  value.  The  recoverable  value  is  the highest value of the capital value and the sale value less expected sale expenses. The capital value is measured as the current value of expected net cashflows from the use of the asset or group of assets and expected net cashflows from the sale of the asset or group of assets after use.\n\n## Guaranteed benefits\n\nGuaranteed  benefits  are  calculated  at  the  fair  value  of the  Group's  pension  liabilities,  i.e.  the  capital  value  of guaranteed benefits and rights (the pension commitment) assessed as a function of the current discount rate at the statement of financial position date. Guaranteed benefits include unpaid pension benefits due in respect of events having occurred during the financial year or earlier (provisions for claims outstanding).\n\nThe  discount  rate  is  calculated  in  accordance  with  the provision  basis  reported  to  the  Danish  Financial  Supervisory Authority, based on the zero coupon yield curve at the statement of financial position date, reflecting the term of the guaranteed benefits. The rate thus calculated has been reduced by the tax rate under the Danish Pension Savings  Returns  Act  (Pensionsafkastbeskatningsloven), currently accounting for 15.3 per cent.\n\nChanges  related  to  changes  in  the  market  rate  and changes in maturity reduction are recognised in hedging\n\nactivities. Changes related to contribution payments for the year and pension benefit benefits for the year are recognised in pension activities. Other minor changes are also recognised in pension activities. In addition, changes due to life expectancy update are also recognised in pension activities. The life expectancy update comprises observed and expected future increases in life expectancy. Bonus is not allocated to the Group's business units.\n\n## Bonus potential\n\nATP's and the Group's bonus potential are reserves that are not distributed to ATP's members.  The bonus potential is equivalent to the carrying amount of total assets related to  ATP  less  guaranteed  benefits  and  the  sum  of  the carrying amount of ATP's other liabilities.\n\nThe reserves can be distributed as bonus. Bonus additions are  transferred  to  guaranteed  benefits  over  results  and comprehensive  income.  Comprehensive  income  for  the year  is  transferred  to  the  bonus  potential.    Revaluations and reversal of revaluations of owner-occupied properties are recognised directly in the bonus potential over other comprehensive income. The bonus potential thus rises and falls with the size of the net results for the year and other comprehensive income.\n\n## Cash flow statement\n\nThe Group's cash flow statement shows the cash flows for  the  year,  broken  down  by  operating,  investment and financing activities; changes for the year in cash and cash equivalents; and the Group's cash and cash equivalents at the beginning and end of the year.\n\nCash flows from operating activities are presented directly and  measured  as  pension  contributions  received  less pension benefit benefits.  Also  included  are  management fees  received,  payments  related  to  administration  activities,  payments  to  suppliers  and  staff,  and  direct  and indirect taxes.\n\nCash flows  from  investment  activities  include  purchases and  sales  for  the  financial  year  of  bonds,  equity  investments,  financial  derivatives,  loans  to/from  credit  institutions, investment properties, as well as intangible assets and operating equipment.\n\nCash flows from financing activities include minority interest transactions for the financial year.\n\nCash  and  cash  equivalents  include  cash  and  demand deposits, as well as time deposits with an original term to maturity of less than three months.\n\n## Note 22: Significant accounting estimates and assessments\n\nIn  the  preparation  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  and  parent  company  financial  statements,  the Management make estimates, set assumptions and make assessments that affect the reported accounting elements.\n\n## Accounting assessments\n\nManagement has conducted a range of assessments in connection with the application of the Group's accounting policies. The primary accounting assessments relate to the following areas:\n\n## Measurement of forestry investment properties\n\nForestry investment properties consist of biological assets (trees),  land  and  CO2  quotas.  ATP  considers  forestry investment  properties  as  an  aggregate  and  integrated investment asset, due to the fact that realisation of forestry investment properties usually happens via the sale of the total property including land and CO2 quotas and only to a small degree takes the form of harvesting and selling of the  biological  assets.  Forestry  investment  properties  are therefore  considered  an  aggregate  unit  which  is  recognised at fair value with value adjustments via the income statement  and  is  presented  as  a  part  of  'Investment properties'.\n\n## DKK is the functional currency of all subsidiaries\n\nThe ATP Group makes investments across the globe and therefore  also  holds  foreign  subsidiaries.  It  is  a  characteristic of foreign subsidiaries that they act as investment companies with no independent operating activities, since the purpose of these investments, and other Group investments generally,  is  to  invest  the  members'  contributions and to obtain a return that will safeguard stable pension benefits to the members in DKK. It is the assessment of the Management that the relevant currency for measuring and valuing these investments should also be DKK.\n\n## ATP's business model\n\nATP's business model is to manage and value assets and liabilities  based  on  changes  to  the  fair  value  in  keeping with  ATP's  risk  management  strategy.  For  this  reason, guaranteed  benefits  and  associated  investment  assets are  measured  at  fair  value  with  the  recognition  of  value adjustment  via  the  income  statement,  regardless  of  the fact  that  some  investment  assets  in  essence  satisfy  the conditions for measuring at amortised cost price, including bonds, loans and receivables from banks.\n\n## Capital assets held for sale\n\nThe  ATP  Group  makes  continuous  adjustments  to  the invested  capital, in which  connection  management decisions  are  continuously  made  regarding  the  sale  of\n\nassets. This also includes illiquid assets with a longer sale process.  The  Management may decide, for example, to sell one property rather than investing in other properties which are at a different developmental stage or in another location.  ATP  considers  this  to  be  continuous  portfolio management and does not consider the assets as 'assets held for sale' in accordance with IFRS 5.\n\n## Measuring associated companies, joint ventures and group subsidiaries at fair value\n\nAssociated  companies  and  joint  ventures  are  measured in  the  consolidated  financial  statements  and  the  parent company financial statements at fair value in accordance with  IFRS  9  with  reference  to  the  special  provisions  of IAS  28,  associated  companies,  applicable  to  certain investment  companies,  including  pension  companies. Capital  shares  in  group  subsidiaries  are  also  measured at fair value in ATP's annual accounts. The Management justifies this policy by these investments being considered equal  to  other  investments  in  ATP's  business  model  in which assets and liabilities are managed and assessed on the basis of changes to the fair value in accordance with ATP's risk management strategy in accordance with the above description of ATP's business model.\n\n## Presentation of loans forming an integral part of investments in equities\n\nInvestments in  associated  companies and joint ventures and  capital  shares  in  other  companies  are  often  structured  as  a  combination  of  equity  investment  and  loans to the companies in question. In such instances where all investors hold proportionally identical shares of both loans and  equity  investment  and  where  there  is  no  significant external financing in the company generally, the risk of the loan is considered to be identical with the risk of the equity investment. ATP considers such loans as an integral part of the equity investment and therefore presents both the loan and the equity investment as capital shares which are both measured at fair value with value adjustments via the income statement.\n\n## The bonus potential\n\nATP  and  the  ATP  Group  is  a  self-governing  institution, settled by legislative act, and therefore has no owners in the traditional sense of the word such as a public limited company  with  shareholders.  ATP  and  the  ATP  Group therefore do not have equity as such, but non-distributed bonus  potential  is  considered  equity  by  nature  as  this item  is  included  in  the  Group  capital  base  and  satisfies the  definition  of  equity  in  accordance  with  the  regula tions according to which the ATP Group files its financial statements.",

        "page_content": "## Note 22: Significant accounting estimates and assessments, continued\n\nFor  the  assessment  of  accounting  regulations  (IAS  32, Financial  instruments:  Presentation)  the  basis  used  is that the bonus potential does not constitute a contractual obligation, and that it is ATP's Supervisory Board which, within the framework of the ATP Act, assesses and determines  the  transfer  of  bonus  to  members'  guaranteed benefits.\n\nThe comprehensive income for the year is transferred to ATP's  and  the  Group's  bonus  potential.  The  comprehensive income for the year includes net results for the year plus revaluation or impairment losses for owner-occupied properties for the year.\n\nThe  bonus  potential  is  used  to  increase  the  future guaranteed benefits on an ongoing basis. If ATP's Supervisory Board elects to assign bonus and increase members' pensions, the bonus assignation will be presented as an expense in the income statement.\n\n## Accounting estimates\n\nMeasuring the accounting value of certain assets and liabilities requires estimations and assumptions regarding future events. The Management base their estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable and relevant under the circumstances. ATP's Management considers the following estimations to be central to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements:\n\n- \u00b7 Estimates related to determining fair value of equity investments, bonds and loans are described in notes 5 and 6.\n- \u00b7 Estimates related to the valuation of the Group's investment properties are described in note 7.\n- \u00b7 Estimates related to valuing financial derivatives is primarily concerned with whether adjustments are to be made to observable inputs used in the valuation models.\n- \u00b7 Estimates related to valuing guaranteed benefits are primarily concerned with discounting factor and future life expectancy for ATP's members. Note 10 states the primary assumptions applied in connection with valuing guaranteed benefits.\n\n## Note 23: New accounting regulations\n\nEffective from 1 January 2020, the ATP Group and ATP have implemented the following new or revised standards and interpretations:\n\n- \u00b7 Change to IAS 1 and IAS 8, Definition of materiality level\n- \u00b7 Change to IFRS 3, Corporate mergers\n- \u00b7 Change to IFRS 9 and IFRS 7, Reform of reference centre (IBOR reform)\n- \u00b7 Change to IFRS' conceptual framework.\n\nAll  standards  and interpretation contributions have been implemented  without  having  an  impact  on  the  annual report for the ATP Group and ATP.\n\n## Standards and interpretations that have not yet taken effect\n\n## IFRS 17, Insurance contracts\n\nIFRS  17  'Insurance  contracts'  has  been  postponed  to the  accounting  year  commencing  1  January  2023.  The analysis of the effect of the standard on ATP is still on-going, meaning it is not yet possible to quantify the effect.\n\nIn addition, a number of new and revised standards and interpretations have been issued that are not mandatory for the Group and ATP for the preparation of the annual report  for  2020.  None  of  these  standards  and  interpretations  are  expected  to  have  a  material  impact  on  the financial reporting of the Group and ATP.",

The consolidated financial statements and parent com -pany financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU and in accordance with additional Danish disclosure requirements as set out in the 'Executive Order on Financial Reporting by the Danish Labour Market Supplementary Pension Scheme' (available in Danish only).\n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements and par -ent company financial statements give a true and fair view of the Group's and the Parent Company's assets, liabilities and financial position as of 31 December 2020 and of the finan -cial performance and cash flows of the Group and the Par -ent Company for the financial year 1 January to 31 December 2020 in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU and in accordance with additional Danish disclosure requirements as set out in the 'Executive Order on Financial Reporting by the Danish Labour Market Supplementary Pension Scheme' (Bekendtg\u00f8relse om finansielle rapporter for Arbejdsmarkedets Till\u00e6g -spension -available in Danish only).\n\n## Basis of opinion\n\nWe have conducted our audit in accordance with the Financial Supervisory Authority's executive order on auditing of the Danish Labour Market Supplementary Pension Scheme, AES - the Labour Market Occupational Diseases Fund, LD - the Employees' Capital Pension Fund and in accordance with international auditing standards and any additional requirements applicable in Denmark. This requires that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform our audit with a view to obtaining reasonable assurance that the  consolidated financial  statements  and  parent  compa -ny financial statements are free from material misstatement. The audit is planned and executed in such a way that we have assessed the business processes and internal control procedures, including the risk management planned by the management that is directed towards the rendering of accounts and essential business risks.\n\nAn audit involves performing audit procedures to obtain au-\n\ndit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in consolidated financial statements and parent company financial statements. The audit procedures selected depend on the auditors' judgement, including an assessment of the risks of material misstatement in the consolidated financial state -ments and parent company financial statements, whether due to fraud or errors. In making these risk assessments, the auditors consider internal controls relevant to the Danish Labour Market Supplementary Pension Fund's preparation of consolidated financial statements and parent company fi -nancial statements that give a true and fair view. The aim is to develop auditing actions that are appropriate for the circumstances. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of the accounting policies applied by Management and the reasonableness of the accounting estimates made by Management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  and  parent company financial statements. Our audit has covered the significant aspects and areas of risk, and we believe that the auditory evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Statement on the Management's review\n\nThe management is responsible for the management's review.\n\nOur opinion on the consolidated financial statements and parent company financial statements does not include the management's review, and we do not express any kind of opinion on the management's review.\n\nIn  connection  with  our  audit  of  the  consolidated  financial statements  and  parent  company  financial  statements,  it is our responsibility to read the management's review and in this connection consider whether the management's review is materially inconsistent with the consolidated finan -cial statements, the parent company financial statements, the knowledge obtained during our audit or in any other way appears to contain material misstatements.\n\nIt is furthermore our responsibility to consider whether the management's review contains the information required pursuant to the 'Executive Order on Financial Reporting by the Danish Labour Market Supplementary Pension Fund (ATP)'.\n\nBased on the work performed, we believe that the management's review is in accordance with the consolidated finan -cial  statements  and  parent  company  financial  statements and has been prepared in accordance with the 'Executive Order on Financial Reporting by the Danish Labour Market Supplementary Pension Fund (ATP)'. We have not found any material misstatement in the management's review.\n\n## Independent auditors' report\n\n## To the Board of Representatives\n\n## Opinion\n\nWe have audited the consolidated financial statements and parent company financial statements of the Danish Labour Market Supplementary Pension Fund (ATP) for the finan -cial year 1 January to 31 December 2020, comprising the income statement, statement of comprehensive income, statement  of  financial  position,  cash  flow  statement  and notes, including the accounting policies for the Group as well  as  the  Parent  Company.  The  consolidated  financial statements and parent company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU and in accordance with additional Danish disclosure requirements as set out in the 'Executive Order on Financial Reporting by the Danish Labour Market Supplementary Pension Scheme' (available in Danish only).\n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements and parent company financial statements give a true and fair view of the Group's and the Parent Company's assets, liabilities and financial position as of 31 December 2020 and of the financial performance and cash flows of the Group and the Parent Company for the financial year 1 January to 31 December 2020 in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU and in accordance with additional Danish disclosure requirements as set out in the 'Executive Order on Financial Reporting by the Danish Labour Market Supplementary Pension Scheme' (Bekendtg\u00f8relse om finansielle rap -porter for Arbejdsmarkedets Till\u00e6gspension -available in Danish only).\n\nOur opinion is consistent with our audit statement to the Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board.\n\n## Basis for opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with international auditing standards and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark. Our responsibility according to these standards and requirements is described in detail in the section 'Auditors' responsibility for the audit of the consolidated financial statements and parent company financial statements' in the auditors' report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the international code of ethics for accountants (IESBA's 'Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants') and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark, and we have fulfilled our other ethical ob -ligations in accordance with these rules and requirements. We believe  that  the  audit  evidence  obtained  is  sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, no prohibited auditing services have been provided pursuant to Article 5(1) of EU Directive 537/2014.\n\nWe were initially selected as auditors for the Danish Labour Market Supplementary Pension Fund on 4 February 2009, and have been re-elected annually by representative vote for a total period of 12 years up to and including fiscal year 2020. We were re-elected on 6 February 2019 following a tender procedure.\n\n## Key audit elements\n\nKey audit elements are those elements which, in our professional opinion, were most important to our audit of the consolidated financial statements and parent company fi -nancial statements for the fiscal year 1 January - 31 De -cember 2020. These elements were processed as a part of our audit of the consolidated statements and parent company financial statements as a whole and the preparing of our opinion regarding this. We do not provide any separate opinion about these elements.\n\nMeasuring unlisted investments\n\nUnlisted investments account for DKK 155.0bn as of 31 December 2020 (2019: DKK 163.2bn) for the Group.\n\nK e y e l em en t\n\nA u d i t i n g t h e k e y e l e m e n t\n\nUnlisted investments consist of investment in real estate, capital funds, infrastructure funds, private equity and credit portfolios. Measuring  unlisted  investments  is  considered  a  key  element for the audit, as such measurement is affected by management estimates and assumptions regarding future events. It is our assessment that the primary risks relate to changes to assumptions and the methods and models applied. Changes to assumptions and the methods and models applied can significantly affect the measuring of unlisted investments.\n\n- Assumptions with the greatest degree of management estimation include:\n- \u00b7 Assessment of future cash-flows\n- \u00b7 Determination of return requirement\n- \u00b7 Determination of valuation multiples\n- \u00b7 Determination of yield curve and credit spread supplement\n\nManagement has provided details of measurement of unlisted investments in Note 12, Financial assets and liabilities and returns and in Note 9, Fair value disclosure.\n\nBased on our risk assessment, we have reviewed the valuation of unlisted investment performed by Management and assessed the determined assumptions and the methods and models applied.\n\nOur review included the following elements:\n\n\u00b7\n\n- Assessment of controls for valuation of unlisted investments, including procedures for determining assumptions.\n- \u00b7 Assessment of assumptions with the greatest degree of management estimation.\n- \u00b7 Assessment of the applied methods and models by applying our industry insight and experience focusing on such issues as changes compared with the previous year.",

Independent actuary assessment of applied data, methods, models and assumptions relative to accepted actuarial standards, the historic development and trends.\n\n- Assessment of changes to applied assumptions and applied methods and models relative to last year and developments in industry standards and practices.\n- \u00b7 Independent recalculation of Guaranteed Benefits in an inhouse developed model based on ATP's data.\n\n## Management's  responsibility  for  the  consolidated  financial statements and the parent company financial statements\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements and parent company financial state -ments that provide a true and fair representation in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU and with Danish disclosure requirements as set out in the 'Executive Order on Financial Reporting by the Danish Labour Market Supplementary Pension Scheme (Bekendtg\u00f8relse om finansielle rapporter  for  Arbe -jdsmarkedets Till\u00e6gspension). Management is also responsible for the internal controls considered necessary by Management to prepare consolidated  financial  statements  and parent company financial statements that are free from ma -terial misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn  the  preparation  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements and parent company financial statements, Management is re -sponsible for assessing the Group's and the Parent Company's ability to continue their operations; for providing informa-\n\ntion on matters relating to the continued operations, where relevant; and for preparing consolidated financial statements and parent company financial statements based on the go -ing concern basis of accounting, unless Management intends to either liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or cease operations or has no other realistic alternative than doing this.\n\n## Auditors' responsibility for the audit of the consolidat -ed financial statements and parent company financial statements\n\nOur goal is to obtain a high degree of assurance that the consolidated financial statements and parent company financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors' report with an opinion. A high degree of assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with international auditing standards and in accordance with additional Danish requirements will always identify material misstatement where such exists. Misstatements may arise as a result of fraud or error and may be deemed to be material if it could reasonably be expected that they, separately or collectively, affect the financial decisions made by the users on the basis of the consolidated financial statements and parent company financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit conducted in accordance with international auditing standards and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark, we make professional judgements and maintain professional scepticism during our audit. Moreover:\n\n- \u00b7 We identify and assess the risk of material misstatement in the consolidated financial statements and parent com -pany financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, we design and perform audit procedures in response to these risks and we obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. The risk of not identifying material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than in connection with material misstatement resulting from error as fraud may comprise conspiracy, forgery, deliberate omission, misrepresentation or override of internal controls.\n- \u00b7 We obtain an understanding of internal controls relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's and the company's internal control.\n- \u00b7 We determine whether the accounting policies applied by Management are appropriate and whether the accounting estimates and related information prepared by Management are reasonable.\n- \u00b7 We express an opinion on whether Management's preparation of the consolidated financial statements and par -ent  company  financial  statements  based  on  the  go -ing concern basis of accounting is appropriate and on\n\nwhether, based on the audit evidence obtained, material uncertainty is attached to events or conditions that may give rise to significant doubt about the Group's and the company's ability to continue their operations. If we express the opinion that there is material uncertainty, we must in our auditors' report draw attention to information thereon in the consolidated financial statements and par -ent company financial statements or, if such information is insufficient, we must modify our opinion. Our opinions are based on the audit evidence obtained until the date of our auditors' report. Future events or conditions may, however, result in the Group and the company becoming unable to continue operations.\n\n- \u00b7 We consider the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements and parent company financial  statements,  including  disclosures  in the notes, and whether the consolidated financial state -ments and parent company financial statements reflect the underlying transactions and events in such a way that they provide a true and fair view thereof.\n- \u00b7 We  obtain  sufficient  and  appropriate  audit  evidence about the financial information regarding the entities or business activities in the Group for use for the purpose of  expressing  an  opinion  on  the  consolidated  financial statements. We are responsible for directing, supervising and conducting the consolidated financial statements audit. We are solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with the senior management on, among other things, the planned scope and timing of the audit as well as significant audit observations, including any significant de -ficiencies in internal controls that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also submit a statement to the senior management to the effect that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence and notify it of all relations and other circumstances which can be reasonably considered to affect our independence and, where relevant, any associated security measures.\n\nconditions in the auditing of the consolidated financial state -ments and the parent company financial statements for the relevant period of time and which are therefore key auditing conditions. We describe these conditions in our auditor's statement except where legislation or other regulation prohibits the publishing of the matter or in the very rare instance where we determine that the matter should not be included in our auditor's statements because the negative consequences of this can be reasonably expected to be of greater significance than the public interest benefits of such a communication.\n\n## Statement on the Management's review\n\nThe management is responsible for the management's review.\n\nOur opinion on the consolidated financial statements and par -ent company financial statements does not include the man -agement's review, and we do not express any kind of opinion on the management's review.\n\nIn  connection  with  our  audit  of  the  consolidated  financial statements  and  parent  company  financial  statements,  it  is our responsibility to read the management's review and in this connection consider whether the management's review is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial state -ments  or  the  parent  company  financial  statements  or  the knowledge obtained during our audit or in any other way appears to contain material misstatement.\n\nIt is furthermore our responsibility to consider whether the management's review contains the information required pursuant to the 'Executive Order on Financial Reporting by the Danish Labour Market Supplementary Pension Fund (ATP)'.\n\nBased on the work performed, we believe that the management's review is in accordance with the consolidated financial statements  and  parent  company  financial  statements  and has been prepared in accordance with the 'Executive Order on Financial Reporting by the Danish Labour Market Supplementary Pension Fund (ATP)'. We have not found any material misstatement in the management's review.\n\nOn the basis of the conditions communicated to the senior management, we determine which were the most significant\n\nHiller\u00f8d, 10 February 2021\n\n## Deloitte\n\nStatsautoriseret Revisionspartnerselskab Central Business Registration (CVR) No. 33 96 35 56\n\nLars Kronow State Authorised Public Accountant MNE No. 19708",
