Over the past year, the Bank has accomplished one of the most significant balancing acts in Indian banking history - successfully forging the transformation from a very precarious situation in March 2020, into an organization truly motivated and ready to deliver value to all its stakeholders. This extraordinary journey of completely reinventing the Bank, was done in parallel to the continuance of unusual circumstances and unknown risks induced by COVID-19, which has left no portion of our shared existence unaffected.\n\n## The transformation journey\n\nThe Bank in its transformational journey has made significant changes - bringing in clear responsibility and accountability at multiple levels across the organization. Having committed to responsible banking and social engagement last year, your Bank has, as promised dealt with all legacy governance, compliance and risk issues with dexterity and alacrity. In addition, the Bank has focused on building and reinforcing the foundation for high quality sustainable growth.  It has successfully delivered a very robust liabilities momentum with 55% growth in deposits over previous year. This reflects very encouraging customer confidence across all segments.\n\nOver the last year, the Bank focused on creating a more granular franchise with balanced earnings mix between wholesale and retail, monetized new businesses through digital innovation - while conforming to the highest standards of risk management, compliance and governance.  I am delighted to share that in FY21, the Bank recorded 9.06 billion UPI transactions, a 102% growth over previous year, thereby positioning the Bank as a clear market leader in the banking industry.\n\nI especially feel proud of each and every YES BANKer, who stepped up, putting in their best through these very difficult times, to help the Bank cross various key milestones of success. At this critical hour, with the Black Swan event of COVID-19 extending into 2021, I express my unreserved regard and gratitude, for the immeasurable contribution of essential service providers and many other nameless heroes who are working tirelessly for the collective well-being of the nation.\n\nWith unflagging commitment, YES BANK has also paved its way through this daunting situation, steadily and surely. After a historic Reconstruction Scheme executed in March 2020 by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and a consortium of investing banks, YES BANK undertook a systemic overhaul, putting in place a significantly more robust corporate governance model with extensive changes across organization, processes",

Building on the three pillars of transparency, commitment and accountability, the Bank has laid a strong foundation for inclusive and sustainable growth.\n\n## Operating performance\n\nI am happy to report that over the past year we have witnessed a strong resurgence in our operating performance. The operating profit for FY21 increased by 42% over previous year. We have strengthened the Bank's position on our specific strategic priorities capital, cost, liquidity, stressed assets and governance. YES BANK saw its credit profile improve further this year with rating upgrades from multiple institutions. The upgrade from Moody's and other domestic rating agencies, following our successful FPO of INR 15,000 crore reflected the Bank's improving business fundamentals in 2020 itself.\n\nOn the asset quality front, our legacy stressed book has shrunk, and the Bank is well provided for with a provision coverage ratio (PCR) of 79%. The management, prudently accelerated the provisioning on incremental slippages in FY21, to prevent carrying forward provisioning requirements into FY22. On the back of this, the Bank posted an overall loss for FY2021, even as it maintained a profit run with sequential gains through the first three quarters of FY21. Importantly, capital ratios of the Bank remain\n\nhealthy, which will enable the Bank to tap into growth opportunities in FY22 in line with its stated objectives. The Bank's CRAR and CET1 ratios stand at 17.5% and 11.2% respectively as against 8.5% and 6.3% last year.\n\n## Economy and business: The road ahead\n\nThe Indian economy contracted by 7.3% in FY21 and was expected to clock a double-digit growth in FY22 before the second COVID-19 wave necessitated localized lockdowns once again. While this will push back the recovery to an extent, the economy is expected to return to a more normal and robust growth path with continued policy support from monetary authorities and the government. It would be equally prudent to prepare for possible weaker consumer sentiment in FY22. The economy will face some pressure to support adversely impacted unorganized, rural, MSME and contact intensive service sectors, amongst others. Given the consequent impact on jobs, rising input costs and supply side constraints, the Reserve Bank of India is expected to keep a watchful eye and monitor inflation trends on the back of domestic supply constraints and higher global oil prices.  For now, the RBI is expected to lean towards boosting growth and hence persist with easy monetary policy.\n\nDiscretionary consumption could be affected as consumers, wary of a possible third wave, would prefer to build up on precautionary savings. A possible saving grace for the economy for FY22, will be a large budgeted capital expenditure of the Central Government, expected to unleash a multiplier effect on the economy. This will ultimately crowd in private investments and help revive the job market.\n\nEven as challenges remain, the circumstances are likely to have created fresh opportunities for the banking sector. COVID-19 has no doubt enhanced the digital footprint in all areas of life - human interaction, e-commerce, education and also remote working. Businesses are encountering a shakeout.  I am confident they will adapt to a changed landscape and seize new opportunities that emerge out of this fast evolving technological and risk transformation, changes in social structure and consumer behavior, unpredictable market dynamics and volatile economic cycles. Given this backdrop, YES BANK continues to strengthen its strategic foresight and be future ready.\n\n## Poised for growth\n\nAt YES BANK, we continue to closely monitor the current macro-economic scenario and I believe that our coordinated efforts, together with stakeholders' support, will enable us to deliver our commitment\n\nOn the asset quality front, our legacy stressed book has shrunk.

We fully recognize new and challenging risks as they move from 'Known Unknowns' to 'Unknown Unknowns'.  The risk culture in the Bank will adapt accordingly.\n\nThe effort in the past year has been to build granular retail business and MSME advance book with customercentric product launches. A strong foundation has been laid for the Retail franchise over the last few years, and the Bank is future ready for growth, enabled by product and service differentiation, and a focus on quality customers, cross-sell, the right people skill sets, technology and compliance. New customer acquisition was strong in H2FY21 with the Bank opening 4,77,000 CASA accounts and lifetime best retail asset disbursals at INR 15,000 crore and this should continue into FY22. Even the SME business showed strong traction with H2FY21 disbursals in excess of INR 8,000 crore.\n\n## Business and digital transformation\n\nGranularized growth of our retail franchise continues to be a core part of our growth strategy, driven by our pan-India branch network and leveraging our digital capabilities. The Bank is focused on calibrated cash flow-based growth in high quality retail and select MSME sectors, developing viable ecosystems in these growth sectors. In the corporate segment, our aim would be to expand in select asset light sectors with differentiated offerings.\n\nAs we progress further on our transformational journey, the Bank is well placed to deal with turbulent events and technological disruptions to traditional banking business models by fintech players. Over the last twelve months, we have digitized our key asset and deposit journeys to build segmented and personalized 'digital first propositions'. With customers at the center of our actions, a major pillar of our retail strategy is to strengthen our customer service with greater empathy, care as well as imbibing technology led innovations to enhance our digital self-serve models. Our 'Loan in Seconds' platform, front-end automation initiatives viz. YES Robot, CRM platform YES Genie, have resulted in lower turnaround time along with higher productivity. We had 75%+ accounts digitally opened in Q4FY21. To provide our customers with a personalized banking experience, catering to their needs, we are looking at transforming our data and analytics thereby deepening our analytics expertise. The Bank has recruited ~300 profiles with technology, product, digital or analytics background to strengthen our digital leadership.\n\nIn the wholesale banking space, the focus would be on granular, cash flow backed business to leverage digital or transaction backed relationships with fintech and e-commerce partners. A crucial area of our growth strategy is to fortify our digital distribution capabilities in the transaction banking space through curated fintech partnerships. Transaction banking will\n\ndevelop digital distribution via partnership with fintech companies to reach out to new customers.\n\nKey pillars of the wholesale banking strategy would be around sector-specific lending opportunities with a focus on new customer onboarding, deepening product penetration and cross-sell, liability growth and focus on agency banking, digital investments and knowledge sector driven relationship management, while maintaining the highest standards of governance and risk management. YES BANK is also targeting selective presence in the infrastructure lending space such as roads, ports, renewables and transmission, cement and metals that are likely to get a boost from enhanced government expenditure.\n\nRural India will continue to be key in propelling the country's economic growth. The transformed YES BANK fully recognizes its role and business opportunities in serving Bharat. The Bank will place significant thrust on identifying emerging rural markets to increase value growth and drive profitability. It will fully serve its rural customers by deepening its branch presence in rural regions and strategically partnering with technology providers for co-origination and cross sell of retail and SME assets, insurance, securities and wealth offerings.\n\nThe Bank has already covered some distance towards its goal of a long-term frugal, sustainable cost culture,",

By strengthening its frameworks for addressing environmental and social risks & impacts of its lending activity, operations and supply chain, the Bank continues to align more closely with global Sustainable Development Goals. The Bank is also committed to aligning its business to the Paris Climate Agreement's goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius, starting with definitive actions towards measuring its financed emissions and aligning its electricity sector exposure, to the global 1.5-degree decarbonization pathway. The Bank also achieved a 5% reduction in the carbon emission intensity of its operations in FY21 as compared to the previous year. As it continues to work with stakeholders across the spectrum to share knowledge and accelerate action towards sustainable finance, biodiversity conservation, and climate resilience, the Bank will continue to make\n\ncomprehensive, voluntary disclosures on how it embeds sustainability into its operations and governance structures.\n\nHaving embraced a dynamic business model adaptable to external realities, I am hopeful that our endeavors to strengthen the Bank's technological architecture to better cater to our customers will enable value creation for all YES BANK stakeholders.

The Bank would not have reached here without the unwavering commitment and loyalty displayed to this institution by over 21,000 YES BANKers. The Bank is indebted to their families who also bore the brunt of the prevailing situation since last year.  I remain grateful for your unwavering support and continued confidence in YES BANK.

Over the past year, YES BANK's top priority has been to ensure the health and safety of all - our employees, customers, stakeholders and the society at large. We have moved forward cautiously and responsibly to minimize the impact of COVID-19 on our circle of connections to the extent possible. We were able to support our customers and communities through these trying times because of the untiring efforts of our staff, who have stood together as one team to ensure round-the-clock services. For this perseverance, which sometimes came at personal cost and sacrifice, I am grateful to our employees. The degree of resilience they have shown through the changing scenarios makes me proud and leaves me humbled at the same time.\n\n## Economy on the mend\n\nMuch of this came to pass amid a stringent lockdown to contain the spread of the virus last financial year. Restrictions in rural areas were less stringent and this\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOperating profit growth over the previous year, to INR 4,977 crore.\n\nCorporate Overview\n\nOur Integrated Approach                   Statutory Reports                   Financial Statements\n\nsegment continued relatively smoothly through most of the year. The worst hit were the manufacturing and the services sectors. Consequently, India registered a dismal annualized growth in Q1FY21 at -24.4% with the manufacturing sector de-growing by 36% in this quarter.\n\nWith the challenges of the lockdown evident, the government quickly took various fiscal measures to ease the burden on low-income groups of the population. The RBI, on the other hand, took up the mantle of providing much-needed help to the production sector. While it continued to ease the policy repo rate and promised to maintain surplus liquidity in the system, the RBI announced measures targeted at ensuring adequate flow of funds to MSMEs and NBFCs. The RBI also maintained orderly conditions in the interest rate markets in light of the large fund requirements of the government. This was mostly to ensure that interest rates do not rise to derail the recovery process. Despite the economic hardships, the government moved ahead to announce reform measures targeted at supporting investment activity. These included the AatmaNirbhar Bharat Abhiyaan and Productivity Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme among other initiatives.\n\nThe banking sector also bore the brunt. While deposit mobilization improved sharply, credit demand was lacking. Before the COVID-19 situation, the sector was\n\n## Prashant Kumar\n\nManaging Director & CEO\n\n<!-- image -->",

The RBI sought to ease the burden by announcing moratorium for borrowers and standstill on asset classification by the banks.\n\nAs the 'unlock' process started, amid optimism fueled by festive demand, GDP growth in Q3 FY21 bounced into a positive zone and recorded +0.4%. Official estimates highlighted an 8% contraction of the economy for FY21 while looking forward to a 10.5% growth in FY22. These expectations now face a risk as the country is engulfed by a second wave of infections.\n\nChallenges abound. But there is hope now as the vaccination drive is expected to get back on track as supplies stabilize with increased production. The Union Budget for FY22 has continued with the reforms process by announcing the setting up of a Development Financial Institution and creation of a National Asset Reconstruction Company, along with a sharp increase in the allocation for the healthcare sector. As the second wave of infections begins to ebb, it remains our collective responsibility to follow COVID-19 appropriate behavior and avert a third wave. Once this is managed, the reform measures of the government alongside easy financial market conditions should push India towards a sustained higher growth path during the year.\n\n## Continuing our transformational journey\n\nIncidentally, COVID-19 has been the unexpected backdrop of YES BANK's institutional transformation which began in March 2020. The Bank, steered by a new leadership and a reconstituted Board of Directors, set upon a forward-looking journey of positive change, guided by the principles of transparency and accountability. Over the past year, we laid the foundation for accelerated growth while maintaining a strong focus on corporate governance. Even as we tide over the challenges of COVID-19, we continue to work towards creating a robust, resilient and future-ready franchise, creating value for all our stakeholders.\n\nIn line with the strategic objectives set out at the start of FY21, the Bank has been able to demonstrate significant progress across all parameters:\n\n- Growth of deposit franchise by 55% to approximately INR 1.63 lakh crore with CASA ratio at 26%\n- Strong growth in Retail and MSME advances which now account for 51% of total advances - a first for the Bank and up 700 bps YoY\n- Successfully raised INR 15,000 crore of capital via an FPO in July, 2020 to recapitalise the Bank\n\n- Healthy operating profits growth of 42% YoY to INR 4,977 crore on back of increase in NII and reduction in operating expenses by 14 per cent\n- Strong track record of recovering INR 4,933 crore by the dedicated Stressed Asset Management team despite COVID-19 related disruptions and incidental process delays\n- Significantly stronger and robust governance model with changes across organization, processes and business strategy\n- Lastly, in FY21, the Bank prudently absorbed COVID-19 related impact by stepping up the bad loan buffers. Despite such accelerated provisioning, the Bank's CET1 remains healthy at 11.2 per cent and CRAR at 17.5 per cent\n\n## Customers at the heart of all we do\n\nAmid restrictions on mobility of goods and people, we reinforced our resolve to put the customer at the center of all our activities . In an environment of physical distancing, the Bank established an unbroken link with customers via proactive communication to retain and reinforce trust. Not only were we able to scale up our digital infrastructure across touchpoints, but we also made innovations that allowed people\n\neasy and continued access to finance through this time. We rolled out personalized products and solutions tailor-made to satisfy a range of banking needs. Solutions such as AI-backed customer support, contactless transactions, easy digital loans, startup funding and other online innovations allowed continuity and convenience to both micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and individual customers across segments.

Apart from the core support services, the Bank has also facilitated additional medical services including RT-PCR tests, home isolation programs, medical equipment rentals, home healthcare support, ambulance rental and so on.\n\nWhile no amount of such assistance can make up for the anguish faced by bereaved and affected families, the Bank, in its capacity, has endeavoured to alleviate the agony by providing basic support to community members.\n\nAdditionally, we are working to institute a phase-wise transition to the 'Work From Anywhere' (WFA) model to limit staff exposure on the premises of our offices and branches, even as we ensure there is no obstruction in continuing to provide round-the-clock support to our customers. The WFA model, backed by infrastructure support for secure and seamless workflows, will not only\n\nCorporate Overview\n\nOur Integrated Approach                   Statutory Reports                   Financial Statements\n\nallow more flexibility for our employees in planning their work routine, but also create employment opportunities for people who couldn't join a workplace due to restrictions on commuting and travelling.\n\n## Gratitude for past, hope for future\n\nThroughout the ups and downs of last year, I feel fortunate for the trust that you have placed in the Bank, which is the motivation driving the Bank forward on this new course.\n\nWe have a clear vision for the future with an action plan for FY22 and beyond. These revolve around:\n\n- Operating profitability on the back of cross-sell, cost efficiencies and expanding margins\n- Granular growth of deposit franchise: Retail push to focus on expanding pan-India presence; transaction banking to develop digital distribution via fintech partnerships to reach new customers\n- Strong recoveries: focused attention on resolution and recovery by a team of specialized professionals\n- Sustained growth of retail and MSME loan book: Calibrated cash flow-based growth and build ecosystems in key growth sectors; grow in select assetlight corporate sectors with differentiated capabilities\n- Highest standards of risk management, governance and compliance: Strengthen operating model on collections and risk management; streamline key decision-making processes\n- Maintain digital leadership: Invest in building analytics function; accelerate digital transformation; digitize asset and deposit journeys\n- Continue to strengthen responsible franchise: Promote sustainable finance opportunities and build resilience against ESG risks; invest in capability building of staff; enhance productivity through talent management\n\nI am happy to apprise you that the wheels are already in motion for the successful realization of the Bank's progress on the above lines. I am confident that this dynamic roadmap, framed keeping our country's swiftly evolving banking needs in mind, will aid our efforts towards inclusive growth, long-term sustainability and productivity.\n\nTo all of our stakeholders, thank you for placing your trust in YES BANK and for your continued support. Our commitment to you is unwavering as we increase the momentum of our transformation into a stronger institution.\n\n## Sincerely,\n\nPrashant Kumar Managing Director & CEO\n\nYES BANK",

Up until today, YES BANK continues to take - and appropriately revise - measures to ensure the safety and health of the YES BANK family as well as our larger community.\n\n## For Employees\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAware of the severity of the second wave of COVID-19 infections and the onslaught brought on by the Delta variant, YES BANK intensified its efforts\n\nto support employees in all possible manner. It commenced and continues to host an array of initiatives to help staff communities navigate these unprecedented times.\n\nYES BANK has ensured a safe and supportive working environment for employees and safe banking  spaces for customers, especially those at maximum risk of being affected by COVID-19, by:\n\n- stepping in to make key interventions at the right time\n- staying responsive to changes in safety guidelines and regulations, and\n- simultaneously evolving processes and systems to best suit the dynamic situation\n\n## Minimizing exposure with work flexibility:\n\nNecessary infrastructure support as well as IT and security support have been provided to ensure that the employees continue working from the safety of their homes. The Bank has worked with agility to operate its branches and call centers with minimal staff to minimize exposure. The Bank is also\n\nCorporate Overview                   Our Integrated Approach                   Statutory Reports                   Financial Statements\n\ntransitioning to a 'Work From Anywhere' model to support more employees. The Bank has organized training sessions to help employees adapt to a remote working set up. To ensure work efficiency, YES BANK continues to invest in strengthening IT infrastructure and digital platforms to complement its electronically linked physical branch network.\n\nSanitized spaces: The Bank has formulated a clear standard operating procedure (SOP) outlining the necessary behavioral changes along with interventions needed at various touch pointsmaintaining a safe physical distance, taking steps to avoid crowding on office premises, use of hand sanitizers and face masks, and so on.\n\nEnsuring holistic wellness with a taskforce, helpline and fitness sessions: The Bank partnered with healthcare providers to launch a dedicated COVID-19 helpdesk, with a hot line number, which can be reached at all hours of day and night by any YES BANKer. Under this key initiative, complimentary medical support services are available to YES BANKers and in some cases their families. The services range from complimentary online consultation with doctors as well as psychologists and counsellors for physical as well as mental well-being, to enrolment of family members for such support, ambulance booking and hospital coordination, quarantine aid with tie-ups\n\nto ensure hotel rooms at affordable tariffs, home isolation support, RT-PCR tests, medical equipment on rent, and so on. The Bank has also set up health centers across key locations so that trained paramedics, doctors and dieticians are accessible to employees at various offices of the Bank.

In the unfortunate event of an employee's demise, the Bank has extended an immediate ex gratia of two months' salary to their family, and also a job offer to a family member. This is in addition to all other financial support that will be extended to the deceased employee's family as part of insurance covers available to the employee.\n\nVaccination drive: Under an ongoing vaccination drive, the Bank, at key locations, is organizing and bearing the cost of vaccination of employees, on-site vendor staff and employees' families.\n\nRelief Program: Acknowledging that our COVID19-hit colleagues not only need comforting and encouragement, but also our generosity and aid, the Bank has put in place an internal contribution drive for employees to volunteer financial aid for impacted colleagues who may have exhausted their financial resources due to hospitalization expenses for themselves or their loved ones. The Bank matches the overall contribution received from employees, by pledging an equal amount towards this fund.\n\n## For Communities\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nYES BANK has responded to COVID-19 through partnerships and direct interventions across 15 states in India since March 2020, committing more than\n\nINR 25 crore towards immediate and long-term response to COVID-19.\n\nThe Bank remains committed to the needs of citizens and continues to work alongside the government and health authorities to work towards enhancing community care with impactful initiatives to benefit or assist people in dire need at a strained time. While continuing key initiatives launched last year to safeguard and support communities, new collaborative projects were embarked upon to achieve this end.\n\nChief among these was our collaboration with an NGO to enable our customers to contribute medical oxygen to patients struggling for life amid an acute shortage during the second wave of COVID-19 infections in 2021. Under the initiative, customers could redeem the reward points accumulated on their YES BANK debit and credit cards to donate oxygen cylinders to needy patients across several metro cities, using the online portal.\n\nThe Bank also launched a series of volunteering campaigns - Joy of Giving -- to virtually connect employees with senior citizens who were isolated and needed human companionship during the lockdown.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe same campaign was extended to orphaned children as well as young professionals, who were stranded in the aftermath of COVID-19.\n\nWith the intention of helping local businesses get back on their feet after the lockdown, the Bank launched YES for Local, an initiative to support\n\ndomestic homegrown businesses. Customers could benefit from online deals, offers and discounts while shopping online with merchants listed with the Bank.\n\nRaising awareness in rural areas: YES BANKers conducted multiple online awareness sessions for over 500 rural farmers on myths around COVID-19",

This is in addition to ensuring that all our customers have a platform to conduct their day-to-day banking activities digitally, from the safety of their homes, apart from online support and access to finances.\n\nA convenient digital solution launched by the Bank to make finance easily available to customers, safely and speedily, was 'Loan In Seconds', where YES BANK account holders could apply for a loan digitally, with the benefits of no documentation and instant disbursement.\n\nLast year, given the need for easy access to liquidity, the Bank enabled digital overdrafts on fixed deposits. Using agile digital innovation platforms, the Bank was also able to launch products and solutions enabling consumers to open accounts digitally and complete their KYC remotely via Video KYC.\n\nThe Bank further continues to sustain a ramped-up remote access capability to cover critical activities during partial lockdowns.\n\n<!-- image -->",

However, as reported by OECD, GDP growth for G-20 economies returned to pre-pandemic level in the March 2021 quarter, recording a growth of 3.4% on a year-on-year basis, following a contraction of 0.7% in the December 2020 quarter. With massive vaccination drives underway, risks to the recovery may further abate and economic activity is expected to gain further momentum in the second half of 2021. In its April 2021 update, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has revised upward its estimate of global growth for 2020 to (-)3.3% from (-)4.4% and increased the projection of global growth for 2021 to 6%. Barring some emerging market economies, inflation remains benign on weak aggregate demand, although rising commodity prices carry upside risks. Financial markets remain buoyant, supported by easy monetary conditions, abundant liquidity and optimism from the vaccine rollout. Global trade is also expected to rebound in 2021, with services trade on a slower recovery than merchandise trade.\n\nFor  India,  the  real  GDP  too  contracted  by  7.3%  for  FY21.  High  frequency  indicators  -  railway freight  traffic;  toll  collection;  e-way  bills;  and  steel  consumption  -  suggested  that  a  revival  was underway. In FY21, the agriculture sector remained resilient - borne out by the Government's 3 rd Advance Estimates of production of major crops during the year at 305.4 million tons, higher by nearly 8 million tons over the last year. After breaching the upper tolerance threshold of 6% for eight consecutive months (April-November 2020), CPI inflation fell to 4.1% in January 2021 before moving up again to 5.5% by March 2021. While the movement in food prices mostly led to the movement in the Headline CPI inflation, core inflation was firmer in FY21, averaging 5.3% compared to 4% in FY20. In the January 2021 round of the Reserve Bank's survey, inflation expectations of households softened over a three month ahead horizon in tandem with the moderation in food inflation; one year  ahead  inflation  expectations,  however,  remained  unchanged.  After  contracting  in  FY21,  real gross domestic product (GDP) is broadly expected to expand. However, with the second round of infections hitting the country and the economy, various research houses have started to mark down their real growth expectations from double digit levels to high single digits.\n\n## The COVID-19 impact\n\nCOVID-19, with its mutated contagious strains, has hit again in 2021 - with a rapid resurgence in global cases, notably in India and countries in Europe and Latin America. At this juncture, rapid vaccination lends a ray of hope. April 2021 saw a doubling of global vaccination rates and a concomitant lowering",

The second wave in India had seen new peaks in daily cases, daily deaths, active cases and positivity rates. The policy response, as has been the global experience, includes localized micro-containment measures, state-specific movement restrictions, mobilization of health supplies and ramping up of health infrastructure. Recognizing vaccination as the crucial pillar to the 'Test, Track, Treat and Covid appropriate behaviour' strategy, the access to vaccines has been deregulated and opened to all individuals above the age of 18 years. (Source: Monthly Economic Review, April 2021, Economic Division, Department of Economic Affairs, Government of India).\n\nIn March 2020, Government of India executed a strategy wherein it imposed lock-down to allow states to ramp-up their health and testing infrastructure while implementing 'Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana' to provide immediate cash support to the needy. More than 420 million poor people received financial assistance of ' 654.54 billion under the scheme. In May 2020, the Government adding to its past measures and that of RBI, announced a consolidated stimulus package of ' 20 trillion. The stimulus package was pivoted on 'Atma Nirbhar Bharat', wherein MSMEs received a huge financial package in terms of collateral free debt, guarantee for subordinate debt through Funds-of-Funds and interest subvention scheme. The government measures were aimed at a set of reforms that provided continuity to the initiative that commenced in 2014. Importantly, it sought to accelerate the reforms process at a time when the pandemic has constrained the fiscal envelope of the government and dampened the inclination of the people to spend, in view of economic uncertainty. To provide a boost to investments and manufacturing, the government also announced the Productivity Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for various sectors.\n\nOn the monetary policy front, the RBI slashed repo rate by a cumulative of 115 bps on Covid response to provide support to growth and economic sentiment. In addition, the central bank upped the policy response by introducing Targeted Long- Term Repurchase Operations (TLTRO) and increased the quantum of Long-Term Repo Operations (LTROs). It trimmed its CRR rate (by a cumulative of 50 bps), the first time since the Global Financial Crisis and allowed banks a higher dispensation under the MSF window. It also provided few forbearance measures for consumers and businesses.\n\nConsequent to the above measures money market liquidity switched into surplus territory in Q2 FY 2020-21 ( ' 1,326 billion), with the magnitude of surplus widening in Q4 FY 2020-21 ( ' 3,088 billion) on the back of unsterilized build-up of FX Reserves by the RBI, along with primary liquidity infusion through FX Swaps, Open Market Operations, etc.\n\nThe pressure of additional market borrowings by the Central (borrowings for the year was upped to ' 12 trillion from the budget announcement of ' 7.8 trillion) and the State Governments, low demand for dated securities and a rise in the fuel prices and higher inflation prints in the H1 of FY 2020-21\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nled to a hardening trend in the government securities yield. The pressure on the yields was largely mitigated by the RBI through special Open Market Operations (well known as 'Operation Twist'), increase in HTM limits, and liquidity infusion. This continued well into the second half of the year along with the Monetary Policy Committee's forward guidance on maintaining accommodative stance for as long as necessary to revive growth. Yields, however, failed to soften much as the market continued to remain worried of large supplies with the announcement of additional borrowings by the Central Government to meet GST compensation shortfall for States, announcement of additional borrowings of ' 80,000 crore (for FY 2020-21 itself) and another year's target of sizeable borrowings of the Central government for FY2021-22.\n\nThe Indian rupee had depreciated by 9.2% in FY 2019-20, closing the year at 75.45 to the US dollar and depreciated further to the lowest level of 76.81 on April 22, 2020. Weakness in rupee stemmed from global risk aversion that manifested in portfolio outflows and benefitted the US dollar at the expense of Emerging Markets (EM) currencies. Overall, there has been a gradual appreciation bias to the INR against the US dollar in FY21, with the return of risk appetite for EME assets that led to the return of FPI flows into the domestic equity markets. Further, on the back of growth revival domestically and a weakening US dollar, INR appreciated to 72.29 against the US dollar on February 24, 2021. Beyond this, INR has somewhat depreciated with volatility in the global financial market on rising US yields, fears of US Fed withdrawing monetary stimulus, firming global crude oil prices and a moderation in FPI flows.\n\n## Outlook\n\nTurning to the growth outlook, the second phase of infections has lent some uncertainties on the recovery and the normalization process. While, rural demand was buoyant and record agriculture production for 2020-21 helped buffer the GDP dip to an extent, this time around the spread of the virus into the rural areas has caused some worry. Urban demand could also stay muted for a period as precautionary savings are on the rise due to high healthcare expenditures, job losses and an overall uncertainty in the economic atmosphere. Against the negative news, there are some positives. First, the stringency of the restrictions this time around has been lesser in intensity than the first round. Unlike the first round of lockdowns, manufacturing activity has been allowed to continue with Covid-related protocols in place. The vaccination is gaining ground and supplies are likely to get eased soon. This should enable wider and faster vaccinations and can lead to an improvement in consumer sentiments. The fiscal stimulus from increased allocation for capital expenditure under the Union Budget 2021-22, expanded Production-Linked Incentives (PLI) scheme should provide support to investment demand and exports. Firms engaged in manufacturing, services and infrastructure polled  by  the  RBI  in  March  2021  were  optimistic  about  a  pick-up  in  demand  and  expansion  in",

It is also expected that the RBI will also continue with its monetary accommodation and ensure that interest rates remain lower for longer. The global economy has also showed signs of recovery and this should help EMEs too. Global growth is projected at 6% in 2021, moderating to 4.4% in 2022. The projections for 2021 and 2022 are stronger than in the October 2020 World Economic Outlook Update of the International Monetary Fund.

The IAD aids the Bank's Management through its assessments to monitor adequacy, effectiveness, and adherence to internal controls, processes and procedures instituted by the Management and extant regulations.\n\nIAD reports to the Audit Committee of the Board (ACB) for audit planning, reporting and review and, the Head of Internal Audit reports directly to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Bank. IAD has unlimited and unrestricted access to all relevant data, systems, personnel and information in order to achieve its objectives. The IAD is staffed with qualified team members with relevant  certifications.  Through  an  effective  training  program,  the  IAD  ensures  that  all  the  team members are upskilled at frequent intervals.\n\nThe function has adopted a risk-based approach of Internal Audit structured after considering the regulatory guidelines and internationally established best practices. A Risk Based Audit Plan (RBAP) is prepared annually and is duly approved by the ACB. The IAD undertakes, the audit of various businesses,  operations,  information  security/systems  and  support  units,  as  per  the  RBAPs.  The IAD prepares a report for each audit and recommends mitigation plans for the risks identified and ensures compliance with all the recommendations. The ACB monitors the progress of the RBAP, at least quarterly.\n\nAdditionally,  the  Bank  also  subjects  its  operations  to  Concurrent  Audit  by  reputed  audit  firms  to complement its Internal Audit function. The Concurrent Audit covers core activities such as the Operations (including credit), Financial Markets, Data Centre and Branches in compliance with the regulatory guidelines. All audit reports are circulated to the relevant management teams and the Audit Committee of the Board.\n\n## Compliance\n\nEnsuring compliance with regulatory requirements, furthering Compliance Culture amongst YES Bankers and building trust among all its stakeholders is an overarching consideration at YES BANK. The dedicated Compliance Department strives to be at the forefront of regulatory changes and continues to work closely with all businesses and operations at the Bank, in order to be compliant with all existing and new requirements. To further this objective, the Chief Compliance Officer of the Bank reports directly to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Bank. The key functions of this department in line with the various RBI guidelines including the RBI circular dated September 11, 2020 include identifying effective procedures and corresponding controls to support the Bank's\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nbusiness divisions as well as dissemination of key regulatory updates affecting the various businesses of the Bank.

The team works to integrate environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations into the Bank's core business, with a focus on building resilience against ESG risks and mainstreaming sustainable finance. The team aligns the Bank's business to global frameworks such as the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the Paris Climate Agreement, and the Principles for Responsible Banking (PRB). In FY21, YES BANK strengthened the Bank's governance structure for ESG practices by constituting an Executive level Sustainability Council chaired by the MD & CEO. The Sustainability Council oversees the implementation of the Bank's sustainability agenda, sets long, medium, short term sustainability targets in line with the Bank's business strategy and apprises the Board on the Bank's approach to sustainability.\n\nThe Sustainable Finance team works closely with the Risk Management function and business units across the Bank to identify, measure and build resilience against ESG risks. To safeguard its portfolio from environmental and social risks, the Bank has adopted an Environment and Social Policy (ESP) to assess and address potential environmental & social (E&S) risks associated with its lending activities.\n\nThe Bank has also accorded a high strategic priority to climate action and is developing a framework for measuring and mitigating climate related physical and transitional risks at the operational and portfolio levels. YES BANK was the first Indian Bank to align its sustainability disclosures to the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations and in FY 2021, supported a call to action led by 10 leading financial institutions, to publish more comprehensive and robust physical climate-related risk assessments and disclosures.\n\nYES BANK took several steps towards greening its internal operations and reducing its carbon footprint. The Bank eliminated single-use plastic at all its facilities and in a first for the Indian Banking sector, switched to procuring 100% recyled paper (A4) for all its internal operations and back-end processes, across India. The move to recyled copy and printing paper, will help the Bank reduce its enviromental footprint and lead to subtantial savings in trees, energy use, waste water, solid waste and GHG emissions. The Bank also successfully achieved the ISO 14001:2015 certification for its",

The Bank is the only Indian Bank to be a member of the SBTi Expert Advisory Group, tasked with providing inputs, expectations and needs on methodologies and approaches being developed by SBTi for target setting to align portfolio with global decarbonization pathways.

YES BANK is currently the only Indian Bank to be a member of the Informal Working Group (IWG) for the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD), a global effort to increase the resilience of the global economy and mainstream nature-related disclosures. As a member of the IWG, the BANK is involved in developing the TNFD governance structure and a robust & transparent process for selection of future TNFD members.\n\nYES BANK has long been a thought leader in ESG and climate action and continued its efforts to educate stakeholders on key sustainability issues, through the year. The Bank also organized a webinar with Carmignac, one of Europe's leading asset managers to educate its clientele in India, UK, Europe, UAE and Singapore on key global trends in ESG investing.

The Bank also continued its thought leadership in climate advocacy by launching a Knowledge Report on the 'Impact of Climate Change on Indian Economy' in partnership with the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi. The report analyzes the impact of climate change on five key sectors including agriculture, energy, tourism, insurance and infrastructure, and highlights the importance of developing an India-centric climate model. YES BANK also partnered the Institute of International Finance to organize the India Climate Finance Workshop to bring together a  targeted  group of leading financial institutions, investment community and policy makers for a focused discussion on the progressing India climate finance landscape. The workshop was attended by participants from over 10 countries. To leverage the power of the youth and mobilize the next generation of climate adaptation leaders around the world, YES BANK partnered the Global Center on Adaptation (GCA) for its Youth Leadership Program and committed to host a capacity-building internship at the Bank in association with GCA. The Bank continued to share its knowledge and experience in climate action at key global platforms such as the Climate Adaptation Summit 2021, Asia Pacific Carbon Pricing Series and forums curated by the Science Based Targets Initiative.\n\n## Corporate Social Responsibility\n\nThe Bank has developed and implemented various programs to enhance and create shared value through unique, scalable, and sustainable models to achieve its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). The Bank delivers internal and external positive socio-environmental impact by following a unique approach, which focuses on:\n\n- \u00bb Promoting principles of social responsibility and inclusive growth through awareness and support\n- \u00bb Investing in socially and environmentally responsible activities to create positive impact\n- \u00bb Engaging with stakeholders to further the sustainability agenda of the Bank and empower them with knowledge\n- \u00bb Collaborating  with  like-minded  institutions  and  forging  partnerships  towards  addressing  the needs of stakeholders\n- \u00bb Monitoring the environmental and social investments of YES BANK through structured governance and transparent performance indicators\n\nThis unique, multi-pronged approach has enabled the Bank to forge meaningful associations with its stakeholders, including community groups, non-profit organizations, governments, corporate peers, and civil society and deliver exponential impact.

As a consequence of the reconstruction, the Bank was deemed to be non-viable or approaching non-viability and both 'the pre-specified trigger' and 'the trigger at the point of non-viability' were activated. Accordingly, the Bank was constrained to write down Additional Tier 1 Bonds ('AT 1 Bonds') on March 14, 2020. The Axis Trustee Services Limited (Trustee on behalf of the bondholders of AT 1 Bonds) and other bondholders have filed various writ petition(s) and consumer complaint(s) across India challenging the decision of the Bank to write down AT 1 Bonds. A Transfer Petition has been preferred by the Bank to transfer all pending litigation(s) to Mumbai as per the jurisdictional clause in the Information Memorandum(s) for the issuance of AT 1 Bonds. The Bank based on the legal opinion of its external independent legal counsel is of the view that the Bank's decision to write down the AT 1 Bonds is in accordance with the contractual terms for issuance of AT 1 Bonds.\n\nOn October 26, 2020, Securities and Exchange Board of India ('SEBI') issued a Show Cause Notice, inter  alia,  alleging  mis-selling  of  AT-1  Bonds.  Though  the  Bank  filed  its  objections,  SEBI  vide  its Adjudication Order No. Order/SM/MG/2021-22/11306-11309 dated April 12, 2021 ('the Order') has imposed a penalty of ' 25 Crore against the Bank under Section 15 HA of SEBI Act, 1992 for the alleged mis-selling of AT-1 Bonds in the secondary market. Aggrieved by the Order, the Bank has preferred Appeal before the Securities Appellate Tribunal ('SAT'). SAT heard the Appeal(s) and was pleased to stay the effect and operation of the Impugned Order. The matter is fixed for final hearing on July 30, 2021.\n\n## Net interest income\n\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the net interest income and spread analysis:\n\n## ( ' in million)\n\n| Particulars         | FY 2020-21   | FY 2019-20   | % change   |\n|---------------------|--------------|--------------|------------|\n| Interest income     | 200,418.35   | 260,666.04   | -23.1%     |\n| Interest expense    | 126,132.34   | 192,613.73   | -34.5%     |\n| Net Interest Income | 74,286.02    | 68,052.31    | 9.2%       |\n| Net interest margin | 2.8%         | 2.2%         |            |\n\nNet Interest income (NII) of the Bank increased by 9.2% to ' 74,286.02 million during FY 2020-21 as compared to ' 68,052.31 million during FY 2019-20.

Subsequently, the national lockdown was lifted by the government, but regional lockdowns continue to be implemented in areas with a significant number of COVID-19 cases. The current second wave of Covid-19 pandemic, where the number of new cases has increased significantly in India, has resulted in re-imposition of localised/regional lockdown measures in various parts of the country. The extent to which the COVID- 19 pandemic will impact the Bank's results will depend on ongoing as well as future developments, which are highly uncertain.\n\nThe Supreme Court, in a public interest litigation (Gajendra Sharma Vs.

The Bank had embarked on a transformation journey to emerge as a re-energized, recapitalized and recalibrated organization, by leveraging on a unique opportunity to learn from past challenges and become stronger, while continuing to fulfill its unwavering commitment towards its customers and stakeholders. The steps the Bank took included constant dialogue and deliberations with the regulators to timely resolve outstanding issues (for e.g. Special Liquidity Facilities from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) as per requirement, de-classification of erstwhile Promoters with due regulatory approvals etc.), revamp of the Governance and Controls structure, identification and deepdiving into the quality of the loan book to recognize and provision for stress transparently and proactively, empowering and reinforcing trust and faith amongst the 21,000+ strong workforce to work as one team again to rebuild the Bank in the face of the full blown impact of a Global Pandemic. These initiatives and efforts were critical to win back the confidence of the Bank's stakeholders and investor community; and the resounding success of the FPO (one of the largest public capital raises in the history of Indian Capital markets) is a strong endorsement of stakeholder belief in the Bank's management, business plan and strategy. The confidence of stakeholders has not only been seen through  the  improving  financial  performance  of  the  Bank  during  the  last  year,  but  also  through external validation in the form of Credit Rating upgrades, successful client win-backs and acquisition strategy, re-inclusion of the stock in marquee indices and increase in FII shareholding amongst others.\n\nThe Bank also undertook multiple initiatives to stabilize the Bank's operations in the wake of COVID-19, while at the same slowly and selectively launching tailored propositions for its customers.\n\n- \u00bb Deepened customer relationship and wallet share for existing Bank customers, while focusing on attractive tailored  propositions for new customers such as the newly launched Yes Premia program and Loan in Seconds\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00bb Improved existing customer offering by re-vamping the Yes Online and Corporate Net banking platforms by making them more user friendly\n- \u00bb Enhanced  digital  customer  sales  and  servicing  model  and  enable  remote  interactions  for  key processes  such  as  the  launch  of  video  KYC  for  account  opening,  WhatsApp  Banking,  remote payment service for merchants\n- \u00bb Kickstarted and/or implemented many key initiatives in customer personalization using Chatbots, data analytics, innovation in Cloud platforms, intelligent automation through robotics etc.\n- \u00bb The Bank also launched a massive brand building campaign 'Zimmedari se Tayyari' which has gained significant digital traction and has been listed amongst the Top 10 ads on YouTube by ET Brand Equity.\n\nThe Bank continued its efforts towards building a stronger retail franchise with contribution of retail advances compared to total advances, increased to ~30 % in FY 2020-21 compared to 24% in FY 201920. Digitisation remains the Bank's key pillar to grow the Retail, MSME and the Transaction Banking business. The Corporate advances have also started to pick up with focus on working capital financing to high rated corporates. The Bank believes that the legacy corporate stress has been adequately provided for in FY 2020-21. The Bank has significant presence within the new-age payments space with the highest market share of ~40.6% in UPI transactions (by volume) in FY 2020-21.\n\n## STATE OF THE AFFAIRS OF THE BANK\n\nFY 2020-21 was a crucial milestone for the Bank in its onward journey, as the Bank battles the social and economic impact of COVID-19 on its operating model and simultaneously re-invents itself into a stronger, redefined organization. The Bank's fundamentals continue to be strong and the Bank has emerged from the crisis as a financially sound, well capitalized, well governed institution, with customer centricity and digital at the heart of its strategy. The Bank remains focused on its priorities and looks to continue this momentum onwards and upwards so that it is able to deliver on its strategic objectives while creating superior value for all its stakeholders.\n\nKey near term strategic objectives that the Bank has achieved and will further strengthen:\n\n- 1. Rebuild capital, liabilities and liquidity buffers\n- 2. Cost optimisation\n- 3. Stronger governance and underwriting frameworks\n- 4. Focused stressed assets resolution",

This  10  year  tenor  bond  witnessed  strong  demand  from  leading investors including Insurance companies, Pension & Provident Funds, Foreign Portfolio Investors, New Pension Schemes and Mutual Funds\n- \u00bb August 2015: The Bank raised INR 315 crore through the issue of Green Infrastructure Bonds to International Finance Corporation ('IFC') on a private placement basis which is the first investment by IFC in an Emerging Markets Green Bond issue in the world. The bonds are for a tenor of 10 years. IFC paid for the placement using the proceeds from the first Green Masala Bond program, that aimed at raising capital in the offshore rupee market\n- \u00bb December 2016: The  Bank  has  raised  INR  330  crore,  through  an  issue  of  a  7-year  Green Infrastructure Bonds to FMO, the Dutch Development Bank, on a private placement basis. This is FMO's 1 st investment in a Green Bond issued by a bank in India. FMO has paid for the placement using the proceeds from their sustainability bonds issued in 2015\n\nThe amount raised was used to finance Green Infrastructure Projects as per 'Eligible Projects' outlined in the Bank's internal guidelines that are in adherence to the Green Bond Principles (GBP). For FY 2020-21, KPMG, India has provided limited assurance on conformity of the use of proceeds, process for  evaluation  and  selection  of  projects,  management  of  proceeds  and  reporting  of  these  green bonds to GBP 2018.\n\nThe GBP are voluntary guidelines, developed by the International Capital Markets Association, for broad use by the market that recommend transparency and disclosure, and promote integrity in the development of the Green Bond market. They have the following four key components and the bank showcases its adoption below:\n\n- \u00bb Use of Proceeds: The proceeds raised by the bank are used in eligible project categories and include all projects funded in whole, or in part, in the fields of renewable and clean energy projects including Wind, Solar, Biomass, Hydropower and other such projects.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00bb Process for Evaluation and Selection of Eligible Projects: The Bank's process starts with interactions with potential borrowers to understand the overall aspects of the project and a preliminary confirmation against the eligibility criteria. The evaluation moves to risk assessment for confirmation of the eligibility, post which further documentation is sought as per the Bank's policies and GBP.\n- \u00bb Management of Proceeds: Green Bond allocations to eligible projects are tracked by the Bank through an MIS based asset tagging system. The unallocated proceeds, if any, are placed in liquid instruments.\n- \u00bb Reporting: The bank's communication to investors through an annual update includes:\n- \u00b7 List  of  projects  to  which  proceeds  have  been  allocated  to,  with  brief  description  including amounts disbursed, installed capacity\n- \u00b7 Summary of Environment and Social (E&S) impacts associated with projects, if any\n- \u00b7 Information on investment of unallocated proceeds in liquid instruments\n\n## Impacts\n\nThrough financing solar and wind power plants, these bonds strengthen India's energy security while reducing fossil fuel dependency. These bonds have been crucial in financing climate change mitigation with avoidance of emissions of CO 2 , SO 2 , NOx and other air pollutants associated with fossil fuel based energy generation. Estimated CO 2 emission reductions are shared along with project details.\n\nList of projects against which green bonds proceeds have been allocated as on 31 st March, 2021 is provided below:\n\n## Proceeds Utilization* Against Bond Issuance Size of INR 1,000 Cr (February 2015)\n\n|   Sr.  No. | Project  Location   | Description                  |   Total Fund  Based  Utilization,  INR Cr | Estimated**  positive E&S  impacts - CO 2 Emission Reduction  (tCO 2 e / yr)   | Known  significant  negative  E&S Impacts   |\n|------------|---------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n|          1 | Maharashtra         | 31.5 MW wind energy  project |                                     97.46 | 45,910.90                                                                      | None                                        |\n|          2 | Telangana           | 42 MW solar energy  project  |                                    120.23 | 66,312.86                                                                      | None                                        |\n|          3 | Karnataka           | 40 MW solar energy  project  |                                    141.31 | 79,736.44                                                                      | None                                        |",

Based on advanced OCR and Machine Learning (ML) processes, the solution envisaged, could enable us to automate the manual scrutiny of trade finance documentation at NOC. Trade finance transactions being paper intensive have various processing challenges. Heavy dependency on physical transfer of documents, and manual scrutiny thereafter result in a high turnaround time. This problem, if solved, could result in not only customer delight but also ensure operational efficiency.\n- \u00b7 Conversational Banking: From voice assistant to digital branch and digital RM.

For instance, if a customer wants information on Balance, FD, RD, Last 3 statement, interest rates etc, all they must do is say, 'Alexa, what is the interest rate on an FD?' and the app responds with the necessary information. These services powered by machine learning are powerful tools in the Digital age.

This is being created with full scale security protocols in mind and will be one of the most highly secured products to come.\n- \u00b7 Oracle  Financial  Services  Analytical  Applications  (OFSAA): The  bank  has  purchased OFSAA  application  to  automate  various  regulatory  liquidity  risk  and  IRRBB  reports.

BANK'S PHILOSOPHY ON CODE OF GOVERNANCE\n\nYES BANK, now re-build and backed by rich legacy of fair, ethical, and transparent governance practice  of  India's  best  public  sector  bank,  is  committed  to  achieve  higher  standards  of Corporate Governance and has successfully re-gained the trust and faith of the stakeholders by strengthening its governance and disclosure practices.\n\nEffective Corporate Governance is the interaction between various participants (Shareholders, Board of Directors, and Company's Management) in shaping Bank's performance. Transparency and  Accountability  are  the  fundamental  principles  to  sound  Corporate  Governance,  which ensures that the organization is managed and monitored in a responsible manner for 'creating and sharing value'.\n\nWith a view to bring in more transparency and accountability, the Bank upgrades its systems and policies regularly, to meet the challenges of dynamic and challenging business environment and to provide reasonable assurance with regards to maintaining of proper internal controls and monitoring of operations.

Taking a positive note of such observations, the Bank has worked effortlessly to strengthen its governance and disclosure practices and promises to continue to be on the progressive path to nourish Corporate Governance practices to make it more effective from regulatory and market perspective.\n\n## Environmental, Social & Governance Rating\n\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance (ESG) performance refers to the non-financial performance of an organization on crucial issues such as climate change, environmental sustainability, social responsibility, institutional frameworks, and transparency, amongst others.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGlobally, there is an emerging awareness that an organization's overall performance is linked to non-financial, yet financially material issues, which pose significant material risks to long term returns. This has led to the emergence of ESG, a set of non-financial metrics or parameters, which along with financial metrics, provide a holistic assessment of an organization's impact on three fronts - profits, people and planet.\n\nYES BANK views the emergence of ESG as an important development for the corporate sector both from an ethical and a financial perspective. The Bank has always endeavoured to integrate ESG principles into its core business strategy and adopt global best practices in ESG. The Bank continuously aligns its business to global frameworks on sustainability such as the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the Paris Climate Agreement, and the Principles for Responsible Banking (PRB). In FY 2020-21, YES BANK has strengthened its  governance structure for ESG practices by constituting an Executive level Sustainability Council chaired by the MD & CEO. The Sustainability Council oversees the implementation of the Bank's sustainability agenda, sets long, medium & short-term sustainability targets, evaluates performance and apprises the Bank's Board (Corporate Social Responsibility Committee) on the Bank's approach to sustainability.\n\nThe  Bank  continues  to  be  recognized  as  a  benchmark  financial  institution  for  its  robust sustainability disclosure which are aligned to the Global Reporting Initiative and the Integrated Reporting (IR) Framework of the International Integrated Reporting Council.  The Bank is also the first in India to align its annual disclosures to the Financial Stability Board's Taskforce on Climaterelated Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations and in FY 2020-21, supported a call to action led by 10 leading financial institutions, to publish more comprehensive and robust physical climaterelated risk assessments and disclosures. The Bank's 2020 Climate Change disclosures were rated of 'A-' (Leadership Band) by CDP, for the second year in a row, surpassing the average ratings for the Financial Services and the Asia Region, which stand at  'B' and 'D', respectively. YES BANK is the only Indian Bank to be a signatory to the Collective Commitment on Climate Action (CCCA), a pledge by 38 global banks to align their services and lending with the objectives of the Paris Climate Agreement. In FY 2020-21, the Bank published its first progress report under the CCCA highlighting its initiatives towards low-carbon transition. As the only Indian signatory to the Principles for Responsible Banking (PRB), YES BANK is piloting a tool for impact analysis of its portfolio, the assessments from which will continue to the strengthen the Bank's disclosures under the PRB framework. The Bank also continued to be rated 'C' 'Prime Status' by ISS ESG. YES BANK is also certified for ISO 27001:2013 information Security Management Systems for securing the Bank and its customer data.

Our responsibilities under those SAs are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Bank in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone  financial  statements  under  the  provisions  of  the  Act,  and  the  Rules  thereunder,  and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the standalone financial statements.\n\n## Emphasis of matter\n\n- a) We draw attention to Note 18.6.69 which describes the state of affairs pertaining to the whistle blower complaints received in prior years and the subsequent actions including the corrective steps  initiated  by  the  Bank.  The  Management  has  made  provisions  in  accordance  with  the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nrelevant prudential norms issued by the Reserve Bank of India in respect of income recognition, asset classification and provisioning and does not expect any further substantial impact on the financial position of the Bank. Our opinion is not modified of this matter.\n\n- b) We draw attention to Note 18.5.1 and 18.6.24 which describes the business uncertainties due to the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 virus (COVID-19). In view of these uncertainties, the impact on the Bank's financial statements is significantly dependent on future developments. Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.\n\n## Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the Standalone Financial Statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the Standalone Financial Statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

In particular:\n\n- \u00bb we have evaluated and understood the Bank's internal control system in adhering to the relevant RBI guidelines regarding income recognition, asset classification and provisioning pertaining to advances and investments;\n- \u00bb we have tested key IT systems/ applications used and their design and implementation as well as operational effectiveness of relevant controls, including involvement of manual process and manual controls in relation to income recognition, asset classification and provisioning pertaining to advances and investments;\n- \u00bb we have test checked advances to examine the validity of the recorded amounts, loan documentation, examined the statement of accounts, indicators of impairment, impairment provision for non-performing assets and compliance with income recognition, asset classification and provisioning pertaining to advances in terms of applicable RBI guidelines;\n- \u00bb we have evaluated the past trends of management judgement, governance process and review controls over impairment provision calculations and discussed the provisions made with the top and senior management of the Bank.\n\n## IT Systems and Controls over financial reporting\n\nThe Bank's key financial accounting and reporting processes are highly dependent on Core Banking and Treasury Solutions and other supporting software and hardware controls such that there exists a risk that gaps in the IT control environment could result in the financial accounting and reporting records being\n\n- \u00bb We have planned, designed and carried out the desired audit procedures and sample checks, taking into consideration the IT systems of the Bank.

Appropriate IT controls are required to ensure that the IT applications perform as planned and the changes made are properly controlled. Such controls contribute to risk mitigation of erroneous output data. The audit outcome is dependent on the extent of IT controls and systems.\n\n- \u00bb In addition, we have also relied on IS audit conducted by internal audit department, and also the audit of Internal Financial Control over Financial Reporting conducted by the Operational Risk Management department of the Bank. We also tested key automated and manual business cycle controls and logic for system generated reports relevant to the audit; including testing of compensating controls or performed alternate procedures to assess whether there were any unaddressed IT risks that would materially impact the financial statements.\n\n## Information other than the standalone financial statements and Auditor's Report thereon\n\nThe  Bank's  management  and  Board  of  Directors  are  responsible  for  the  Other  Information.  The other information comprises the Management Discussion and Analysis, Directors' Report including Annexures to Directors' Report (collectively called as 'Other Information') but does not include the standalone financial statements and our auditor's report thereon and the Pillar III Disclosures under the New Capital Adequacy Framework (Basel III disclosures). The other information is expected to be made available to us after the date of this auditor's report.\n\nOur opinion on the standalone financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the standalone financial statements, our responsibility is to read the Other Information identified above when it becomes available and, in doing so, consider whether the  Other  Information  is  materially  inconsistent  with  the  standalone  financial  statements  or  our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is  not  a  guarantee  that  an  audit  conducted  in  accordance  with  SAs  will  always  detect  a  material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if,  individually  or  in  the  aggregate,  they  could  reasonably  be  expected  to  influence  the  economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these standalone financial statements.\n\nAs  part  of  an  audit  in  accordance  with  SAs,  we  exercise  professional  judgment  and  maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00bb Identify  and  assess  the  risks  of  material  misstatement  of  the  standalone  financial  statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for  expressing  our  opinion  on  whether  the  bank  has  adequate  internal  financial  controls  with reference to financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.\n- \u00bb Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures in the standalone financial statements made by the Management and Board of Directors.\n- \u00bb Conclude on the appropriateness of the Management and Board of Directors use of the going concern  basis  of  accounting  and,  based  on  the  audit  evidence  obtained,  whether  a  material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Bank's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the standalone financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause a Bank to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- \u00bb Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the standalone financial statements, including  the  disclosures,  and  whether  the  standalone  financial  statements  represent  the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that  were  of  most  significance  in  the  audit  of  the  standalone  financial  statements  of  the  current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.",

These  responsibilities  include  the  design, implementation  and  maintenance  of  adequate  internal  financial  controls  that  were  operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to the Bank's policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Companies Act, 2013 ('the Act').\n\n## Auditor's responsibility\n\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on the Bank's internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting ('the Guidance Note') and the Standards on Auditing ('the Standards'), issued by the ICAI and deemed to be, prescribed under section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls over financial reporting, both issued by the ICAI. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about  whether  adequate  internal  financial  controls  with  reference  to  financial  statements  were established and maintained and whether such controls operated effectively in all material respects.\n\nOur audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nassessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the standalone financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Bank's internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements.\n\n## Meaning of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements\n\nA Bank's internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability  of  financial  reporting  and  the preparation of standalone financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Bank's internal financial control with reference to financial statement includes those policies and procedures that\n\n- 1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;\n- 2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of standalone financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and\n- 3) provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention  or  timely  detection  of  unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the standalone financial statements.\n\n## Inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements\n\nBecause of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements,  including  the  possibility  of  collusion  or  improper  management  override  of  controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control with reference to standalone",

Significant accounting policies and notes forming part of the accounts for the year ended March 31, 2021\n\n## 18.1 Background\n\nYES BANK is a publicly held bank engaged in providing a wide range of banking and financial services. YES BANK is a banking company governed by the Banking Regulation Act, 1949. The Bank was incorporated as a limited company under the Companies Act, 1956 on November 21, 2003. The Bank received the licence to commence banking operations from the Reserve Bank of India ('RBI') on May 24, 2004. Further, YES BANK was included to the Second Schedule of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 with effect from August 21, 2004. Also, the Bank has a branch at International Financial Services Centre ('IFSC') at GIFT City, Gujarat ('IBU'). The Bank classifies transactions undertaken by IBU as overseas operation.\n\n## 18.2 Basis of preparation\n\nThe financial statements have been prepared in accordance with requirements prescribed under the Third Schedule (Form A and Form B) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949. The accounting  and  reporting  policies  of  the  Bank  used  in  the  preparation  of  these  financial statements  conform  to  Generally  Accepted  Accounting  Principles  in  India  (Indian  GAAP), the guidelines issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) from time to time, the accounting standards notified under section 133 of the Companies Act 2013 and Companies (Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, 2016 to the extent applicable and practices generally prevalent in the banking industry in India. The Bank follows the accrual method of accounting and the historical cost convention, unless otherwise stated by RBI guidelines.\n\n## 18.3 Assessment of Going Concern:\n\nThe  audit  report  for  the  Financial  Year  ended  March  2020  was  qualified  on  account  of material uncertainty related to Going Concern. The opinion was predicted on a significant decline in Bank's deposit base, credit downgrades resulting in partial prepayment of foreign currency debt linked to external credit rating, breaches in liquidity ratios and RBI mandated Capital ratios.\n\nDuring the current year, the Bank raised capital of ' 150,000 million through FPO in July20. As a consequence, Bank's capital ratio stands at 17.5% as on Mar 31, 2021 as against a minimum requirement of 10.875%. Further, Bank has increased its deposit position by 54.7% to ' 1,629,466 million while also improving the LCR well in excess of the minimum regulatory thresholds.\n\nStatutory Reports\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGiven the capital raise, reinforced capital buffers, strong growth in deposit base, the Banks' compliance  with  regulatory  ratios  and  expanding  customer  &  branch  network,  the  audit report for FY 2020-21 is not modified\n\n## 18.4 Use of estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements requires the management to make estimates and assumptions that are considered while reporting amounts of assets and liabilities (including contingent liabilities) as of the date of the financial statements and income and expenses during the reporting period.\n\nDue to outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the country had witnessed lockdowns across India,  imposed  by  the  Indian  government  from  March  2020.  Subsequently,  the  national lockdown was lifted by the government, but regional lockdowns continue to be implemented in areas with a significant number of COVID-19 cases. The current second wave of Covid-19 pandemic, where the number of new cases has increased significantly in India, has resulted in  re-imposition  of  localised/regional  lockdown  measures  in  various  parts  of  the  country. The extent to which the COVID- 19 pandemic will impact the Bank's results will depend on ongoing as well as future developments, which are highly uncertain. However, management believes that the estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements are prudent and reasonable. Future results could differ from these estimates. Any revision to accounting estimates is recognized prospectively in current and future periods.\n\n## 18.5 Significant accounting policies\n\n## 18.5.1  COVID\n\nThe SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for COVID-19 started spreading across the globe and India in  March  2020,  which  has  contributed  to  a  significant  decline  and  volatility  in  global  and Indian financial markets and a significant decrease in global and local economic activities. Due to outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the country had witnessed lockdowns across India,  imposed  by  the  Indian  government  from  March  2020.  Subsequently,  the  national lockdown was lifted by the government, but regional lockdowns continue to be implemented in areas with a significant number of COVID-19 cases. The current second wave of Covid-19 pandemic, where the number of new cases has increased significantly in India, has resulted in re-imposition of localised/regional lockdown measures in various parts of the country.\n\nRBI  issued  guidelines  on  COVID-19  Regulatory  Packages  under  which,  the  Bank  granted a moratorium of three months (further extended by three months) on the payment of all instalments and / or interest, as applicable, falling due between March 1, 2020 and August",

The corresponding gain or loss is recognised as cash flow hedge reserve. Further to match profit/ loss on account of revaluation of foreign currency borrowing, the corresponding amount is recycled from cash flow hedge reserve to Profit and Loss account.\n\nThe Bank follows the option premium accounting framework prescribed by FEDAI SPL- circular dated Dec 14, 2007. Premium on option transaction is recognized as income/expense on expiry or early termination of the transaction.

The Bank measures compensation cost relating to employee stock options using the intrinsic  value  method.  Compensation  cost  is  measured  by  the  excess,  if  any,  of  the  fair market price of the underlying stock (i.e. the last closing price on the stock exchange on the day preceding the date of grant of stock options) over the exercise price. The exercise price of the Bank's stock option is the last closing price on the stock exchange on the day preceding the date of grant of stock options and accordingly there is no compensation cost under the intrinsic value method.\n\n## Compensated absence\n\nThe employees of the Bank are entitled to carry forward a part of their unavailed/unutilized leave  subject  to  a  maximum  limit.

Under this method, the determination is based on actuarial calculations, which include  assumptions about demographics, early retirement, salary increases and interest rates.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted or substantively enacted tax rates at  the  balance  sheet  date.  The  impact  of  changes  in  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities  is recognised in the profit and loss account.\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent there is reasonable certainty that the assets can be realized in future. Deferred tax assets in case of unabsorbed depreciation/ losses are recognized only if there is virtual certainty that such deferred tax asset can be realized against future taxable profits. Deferred tax assets are recognized and reassessed at each balance sheet date based upon management's judgement and appropriately adjusted to reflect the amount that is reasonably certain to be realized.",

As a consequence of the reconstruction, the Bank was deemed to be nonviable or approaching non-viability and both 'the pre-specified trigger' and 'the trigger at the point of non-viability' were activated. Accordingly, the Bank was constrained to write down Additional Tier 1 Bonds ('AT 1 Bonds') on March 14, 2020. The Axis Trustee Services Limited (Trustee on behalf of the bondholders of AT 1 Bonds) and other bondholders have filed various writ petition(s) and consumer complaint(s) across India challenging the decision of the Bank to write down AT 1 Bonds. A Transfer Petition has been preferred by the Bank to transfer all pending litigation(s) to Mumbai as per the jurisdictional clause in the Information Memorandum(s) for the issuance of AT 1 Bonds. The Bank, based on the legal opinion of its external independent legal counsel is of the view that the Bank's decision to write down the AT 1 Bonds is in accordance with the contractual terms for issuance of AT 1 Bonds.\n\nSeparately, on October 26, 2020, Securities and Exchange Board of India ('SEBI') issued a Show Cause Notice, inter alia, alleging mis-selling of AT-1 Bonds. Though the Bank filed its objections, SEBI vide its Adjudication Order No. Order/SM/MG/2021-22/11306-11309 dated April  12,  2021  ('the  Order')  has  imposed  a  penalty  of ' 25 Crore against the Bank under Section 15 HA of SEBI Act, 1992 for the alleged mis-selling of AT-1 Bonds in the secondary market. The Bank is in the process of filing an appeal before the Hon'ble Securities Appellate Tribunal against the Order.' Interest on Additional Tier I Capital (Unsecured, Non-Convertible, Tier I Subordinated Perpetual Bonds in the nature of Promissory Notes issued under Basel II  guidelines)  amounting to ' 84.0 million which was not cumulative was not paid by Bank during FY 2019-20 as the regulatory Capital Adequacy ratio of the Bank were lower than the minimum prudential requirement. However post capital raise (FPO), the Bank exercised the call option with approval of RBI and repaid the Bonds along with interest for FY 2020-21.",

The management of these products and businesses is  governed  by  Market  Risk  Policy,  Investment  Policy,  Derivatives  Policy,  Derivatives Appropriate ness Policy, Hedging Policy and ALM policy.\n- b) Structure: The Board of Directors of the Bank have constituted a Board level sub-committee, the Risk Monitoring Committee ('RMC') and delegated to it all functions and responsibilities relating to the risk management policy of the Bank and its supervision thereof.\n- c) As part of prudent business and risk management practice, the Bank has also instituted a comprehensive limit and control structure encompassing Value-at-Risk (VAR), Sensitivity, Greeks,  Stop  loss  &  credit  limits  for  derivative  transactions  including  suitability  and appropriateness framework. The Bank has an internal reporting mechanism providing regular reports to the RMC as well as to the management of the Bank. Such a structure helps the Bank to monitor and mitigate market risk across FX and interest rates.\n- d) The  Bank  has  an  independent  Middle  Office  and  Market  Risk  functions,  which  are responsible  for  monitoring,  measurement,  and  analysis  of  derivative  related  risks, among others. The Bank has a Credit Risk Management unit which is responsible for setting up counterparty limits and also a treasury operation unit which is responsible for  managing operational aspects of derivatives including settlement of transactions. The  Bank  is  subject  to  a  concurrent  audit  for  all  treasury  transactions,  including derivatives transactions, a monthly report of which is periodically submitted to the Audit & Compliance Committee of the Bank.\n- e) In addition to the above, the Bank independently evaluates the potential credit exposure on account of all derivative transactions, wherein risk limits are specified separately for each product, in terms of both credit exposure and tenor. As mandated by the Credit Policy of the Bank, the Bank has instituted an approval structure for all treasury/derivative related credit exposures. Wherever necessary, appropriate credit covenants are stipulated as trigger events to call for collaterals or terminate transaction and contain the risks.\n- f) The Bilateral Netting of Qualified Financial Contracts has been notified by the RBI through circular  dated  March  30,  2021.  The  Bank  has  computed  capital  adequacy  as  well  as\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nexposure on account of these contracts as per Current Exposure method considering each transaction as separate netting set on conservative basis.

        "page_content": "## FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nfor the year ended March 31, 2021\n\n## Qualitative Disclosure:\n\nThe Bank measures and monitors the LCR in line with the Reserve Bank of India's circular dated June 09, 2014 and November 28, 2014 on 'Basel III Framework on Liquidity Standards Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), Liquidity Risk Monitoring Tools and LCR Disclosure Standards' as amended for 'Prudential Guidelines on Capital Adequacy and Liquidity Standards' dated March 31,  2015.  The  LCR  guidelines  aims  to  ensure  that  a  bank  maintains  an  adequate level of unencumbered High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLAs) that can be converted into cash to meet its liquidity needs for a 30 calendar day time horizon under a significantly severe liquidity stress scenario. At a minimum, the stock of liquid assets should enable the bank to survive until day 30 of the stress scenario, by which time it is assumed that appropriate corrective actions can be taken. Banks are required to maintain High Quality Liquid Assets of a minimum of 90% of its Net Cash Outflows as prescribed by regulator.\n\n- \u00bb The Bank endeavors to meet the LCR requirement on an ongoing basis. The adequacy in the LCR maintenance remains a conscious strategy of the Bank towards complying with LCR mandate.\n- \u00bb The Board of Directors of the Bank have empowered ALCO (Top Management Executive Committee) to monitor and strategize the Balance Sheet profile of the Bank. In line with the business strategy, ALCO forms an Interest Rate/Liquidity view for the bank with the help of the economic analysis provided by the in-house economic research team of the bank.  ALCO of  the  Bank  channelizes  various  business  segments  of  the  Bank  to  target good quality asset and liability profile to meet the Bank's profitability as well as Liquidity requirements with the help of robust MIS and Risk Limit architecture of the Bank.\n- \u00bb Funding strategies are formulated by the ALCO of the Bank. The objective of the funding strategy is to achieve an optimal funding mix which is consistent with prudent liquidity, diversity of sources and servicing costs. Accordingly, BSMG (Balance Sheet Management Group) of the Bank estimates daily liquidity requirement of the various business segments and manages the same on consolidated basis under ALCO guidance. With the help of Liquidity  Statement  prepared  by  the  Bank,  BSMG  evaluates  liquidity  requirement  and takes necessary action. Periodical reports are also placed before the ALCO for perusal and review.\n- \u00bb The  Bank's  HQLA  comprises  of  Excess  CRR,  Excess  SLR,  eligible  foreign  sovereign investments, Marginal Standing Facility (MSF) and Facility to Avail Liquidity for Liquidity Coverage  Ratio  (FALLCR)  as  permitted  under  prudential  guidance  and  eligible  Level\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 2 investments. The Bank has a very limited exposure to liquidity risk on account of its Derivatives portfolio. Further, the Bank believes that all inflows and outflows which might have a material impact under the liquidity stress scenario have been considered for the purpose of LCR. Further, SLR investments as well as Corporate Bond portfolio of the Bank considered for HQLA is also well diversified across various instruments and Liquid Asset Type Mix and should provide the Bank with adequate and timely liquidity.\n- \u00bb The daily average LCR for quarter ending March 31, 2021 is 113.9% which is well above the prudential requirement of 90%.\n- \u00bb The  Bank  has  been  in  compliance  with  prudential  requirement  for  Liquidity  Coverage Ratio for the FY 2020-21 on all days, starting from from Jun 15, 2020 onwards except for 4 days (Aug 26, 2020 and from Aug 31, 2020 to Sep 2, 2020) due to repayment of Special Liquidity  facility  availed  from  RBI.  Since  Sept  3,2020  Bank  was  in  compliance  with  LCR prudential requirements.\n\n## 18.6.57 Intra-Group Exposures to Subsidiaries\n\nThe Bank has three subsidiary viz.

In  line  with  the  policy, assessment of unhedged foreign currency exposure is a part of assessment of borrowers and is undertaken while proposing limits or at the review stage. Additionally, at the time of sanctioning limits for all clients, the Bank stipulates a limit on the unhedged foreign currency exposure of the client (as a % of total foreign currency exposure sanctioned by the Bank) after considering factors such as internal rating of the borrower, size, possibility of natural hedging, sophistication of borrower and maturity of borrower's financial systems, relative size of unhedged foreign currency exposure with respect to total borrowings of the client, etc. Further, the Bank reviews the unhedged foreign currency exposure across its portfolio on a periodic basis.

The Bank conducted an internal enquiry of these allegations, which was carried out by management and supervised by the Board of Directors. The enquiry resulted in a report that was reviewed by the Board in November 2018. Based on further inputs and deliberations in December 2018, the Audit Committee of the Bank engaged an external firm\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nto independently examine the matter. In April 2019, the Bank had received the phase 1 report from the external firm and based on further review/ deliberations had directed a phase 2 investigation from the said firm. In February 2020, the Bank has received the final phase 2 report from the said external firm. The Bank has taken this report to the Audit Committee. As advised by the Audit Committee, the Bank has reviewed and carried out remediation actions across areas of process, design, policy and control related issues highlighted in the report including conducting forensic audits for few of the identified borrower accounts. The forensic audits for remaining accounts are in the process. Basis guidance from the ACB during the year,  further  action  has  been  taken  and  a  comprehensive note was put up to the Board on January 15, 2021 for closure of the report. The Board expressed satisfaction with the review carried out and approved the closure of the review of the anonymous complaints received by the Bank in September / December 2018. Exposure to such borrower accounts are recognized as NPA and commensurately provided.\n\nFurther, the Bank received forensic audit reports on certain borrower groups commissioned by other consortium bankers, which gave more information regarding the above mentioned allegations and has filed complaints with the law enforcement agencies. Also, Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) - the Enforcement Directorate (ED), the Central Bureau of Investigations (CBI) and the Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) have launched investigations into some aspects of transactions of the founder / former MD & CEO, and alleged links with certain borrower groups. LEAs are investigating allegations of money laundering, fraud and nexus between the founder / former MD & CEO and certain loan transactions. The investigation continues to be carried out by the various law enforcement agencies. There are no claims made by any whistleblower or other parties against the Bank in this matter. The Bank does not foresee any substantial financial impact on the Bank arising out of these investigations.",

Interest rate  swaps are commitments to exchange fixed and floating interest rate cash flows. The notional amounts of financial instruments of such foreign exchange  contracts and derivatives provide a basis for comparison with instruments recognized on the balance sheet but do not necessarily indicate the amounts  of future cash flows involved or the current fair value of the instruments and, therefore, do not indicate the Bank's exposure to credit or price risks.

Audited accounts of YES BANK Limited, audited by us, vide our audit report dated April 30, 2021.\n- ii. Audited accounts of 3 subsidiaries of which 2 subsidiaries are audited by us and 1 is audited by other auditor.\n\nIn our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, and based on the consideration of report of the other auditor on separate financial statements of one subsidiary  as  were  audited  by  the  other  auditor,  the  aforesaid  consolidated  financial  statements give the information required by the section 29 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 as well as the Companies Act, 2013 (the 'Act') and circulars and guidelines issued by the Reserve Bank of India, in the manner so required for banking companies and give a true and fair view in conformity with the accounting  principles  generally  accepted  in  India,  including  the  Accounting  Standards  prescribed under section 133 of the Act, read with rules made thereunder, of the consolidated state of affairs of the Bank as at March 31, 2021, and its consolidated loss, and its consolidated cash flows for the year ended on that date.\n\n## Basis of opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing ('SAs') specified under Section 143  (10)  of  the  Act.  Our  responsibilities  under  those  SAs  are  further  described  in  the  Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements under the provisions of the Act, and the Rules thereunder, and\n\nStatutory Reports\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nwe have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Emphasis of matter\n\n- a) We draw attention to Note 18.19 which describes the state of affairs pertaining to the whistle blower complaints received in prior years and the subsequent actions including the corrective steps  initiated  by  the  Bank.  The  Management  has  made  provisions  in  accordance  with  the relevant prudential norms issued by the Reserve Bank of India in respect of income recognition, asset classification and provisioning and does not expect any further substantial impact on the financial position of the Bank. Our opinion is not modified of this matter.\n- b) We draw attention to Note 18.6.1 which describes the business uncertainties due to the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 virus (COVID-19). In view of these uncertainties, the impact on the Bank's financial statements is significantly dependent on future developments. Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.\n\n## Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in  the  audit  of  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  of  the  current  period.  These  matters  were addressed in the context of our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report:",

When we read the other information, if we conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, we are required to communicate the matter to those charged with governance.\n\n## Management's and Board of Director's Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nThe Bank's management and Board of Directors are responsible for the matters stated in Section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation and presentation of these consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position, consolidated financial performance and consolidated cash flows of the Group in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the Accounting Standards specified under Section 133 of the Act, provisions of Section 29 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 and the circulars and guidelines issued by Reserve Bank of India ('RBI') from time to time. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act, for safeguarding of the assets of the Group and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthat were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, which have been used for the purpose of preparation of the consolidated financial statements by the Directors of the Holding Company, as aforesaid\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Management and Board of Directors included in  the  Group  are  responsible  for  assessing  the  Group's  ability  to  continue  as  a  going  concern, disclosing,  as  applicable,  matters  related  to  going  concern  and  using  the  going  concern  basis  of accounting unless the Management and Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThe Board of Directors included in the Group are responsible for overseeing the Bank's financial reporting process of the Group.\n\n## Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nOur  objectives  are  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether  the  consolidated  financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if,  individually  or  in  the  aggregate,  they  could  reasonably  be  expected  to  influence  the  economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs  part  of  an  audit  in  accordance  with  SAs,  we  exercise  professional  judgment  and  maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.

These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to the respective Company's policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Companies Act, 2013 ('the Act').\n\n## Auditors' responsibility\n\nOur  responsibility  is  to  express  an  opinion  on  the  internal  financial  controls  with  reference  to consolidated  financial  statements  based  on  our  audit.  We  conducted  our  audit  in  accordance with  the  Guidance  Note  on  Audit  of  Internal  Financial  Controls  Over  Financial  Reporting  ('the Guidance Note') and the Standards on Auditing ('the Standards'), issued by the ICAI and deemed to be, prescribed under section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls, both issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India with reference to consolidated financial statements. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements were established and maintained and whether such controls operated effectively in all material respects.\n\nOur audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements included obtaining  an  understanding  of  internal  financial  controls  with  reference  to  consolidated  financial\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nstatements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and the audit evidence obtained by the other auditor of the relevant subsidiary company, in terms of their report referred to in the Other Matters paragraph below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Meaning of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements\n\nA  company's  internal  financial  controls  with  reference  to  consolidated  financial  statements  is  a process  designed  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  the  reliability  of  financial  reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal financial control with reference to consolidated financial statement includes those policies and procedures that\n\n- 1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;\n- 2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and\n- 3) provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention  or  timely  detection  of  unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements\n\nBecause  of  the  inherent  limitations  of  internal  financial  controls  with  reference  to  consolidated financial  statements,  including  the  possibility  of  collusion  or  improper  management  override of  controls,  material  misstatements  due  to  error  or  fraud  may  occur  and  not  be  detected.

The transaction is subject to requisite regulatory approvals\n\n## 18.2 Assessment of Going Concern:\n\nThe  audit  report  for  the  Financial  Year  ended  March  2020  was  qualified  on  account  of material uncertainty related to Going Concern. The opinion was predicted on a significant decline in Bank's deposit base, credit downgrades resulting in partial prepayment of foreign currency debt linked to external credit rating, breaches in liquidity ratios and RBI mandated Capital ratios.\n\nDuring the current year, Bank has been able to address the concerns of erstwhile auditors, on the back of capital raise of ' 150,000 million through FPO in July-20. As a consequence, Bank's capital ratio stands at 17.5% as on Mar 31, 2021 as against a minimum requirement of 10.875%. Further, Bank has increased its deposit position by 54.7% to ' 1,629,466 million while also improving the LCR well in excess of the minimum regulatory thresholds.\n\nGiven the capital raise, reinforced capital buffers, strong growth in deposit base, the Banks' compliance  with  regulatory  ratios  and  expanding  customer  &  branch  network,  the  audit report for FY 2020-21 is not modified.\n\n## 18.3 Principles of Consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of YES Bank Limited, and its subsidiaries, YES Securities (India) Limited, YES Asset Management (India) Limited and YES Trustee Limited which together constitute the 'Group'.\n\nThe  Bank  consolidates  its  subsidiaries  in  accordance  with  Accounting  Standard  ('AS')  21, Consolidated Financial Statements notified under section 133 of the Companies Act 2013, read together with paragraph 7 of the Companies (Accounts) Rules 2014 issued by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs to the extent applicable on a line-by-line basis by adding together the like items of assets, liabilities, income and expenditure.",

The accounting and reporting policies of The Group used in the preparation of these financial statements conform to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in India (Indian GAAP), the guidelines issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) from time to time, the accounting standards notified under section 133 of the Companies Act 2013, read together with paragraph 7 of the Companies (Accounts) Rules 2014 and Companies (Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, 2016 to the extent applicable and practices generally prevalent in the banking industry in India. The Group follows accrual method of accounting and the historical cost convention, unless otherwise stated by RBI guidelines.\n\n## 18.5 Use of estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements requires the management to make estimates and assumptions that are considered while reporting amounts of assets and liabilities (including contingent liabilities) as of the date of the financial statements and income and expenses during the reporting period.\n\nDue to outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the country had witnessed lockdowns across India,  imposed  by  the  Indian  government  from  March  2020.  Subsequently,  the  national lockdown was lifted by the government, but regional lockdowns continue to be implemented in areas with a significant number of COVID-19 cases. The current second wave of Covid-19 pandemic, where the number of new cases has increased significantly in India, has resulted in  re-imposition  of  localised/regional  lockdown  measures  in  various  parts  of  the  country. The extent to which the COVID- 19 pandemic will impact the Bank's results will depend on ongoing as well as future developments, which are highly uncertain. However, management believes that the estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements are prudent and reasonable. Future results could differ from these estimates. Any revision to accounting estimates is recognized prospectively in current and future periods.\n\n## 18.6 Significant accounting policies\n\n## 18.6.1  COVID\n\nThe SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for COVID-19 started spreading across the globe and India in  March  2020,  which  has  contributed  to  a  significant  decline  and  volatility  in  global  and Indian financial markets and a significant decrease in global and local economic activities.\n\nStatutory Reports\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDue to outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the country had witnessed lockdowns across India,  imposed  by  the  Indian  government  from  March  2020.

The current second wave of Covid-19 pandemic, where the number of new cases has increased significantly in India, has resulted in re-imposition of localised/regional lockdown measures in various parts of the country.\n\nRBI  issued  guidelines  on  COVID-19  Regulatory  Packages  under  which,  the  Bank  granted a moratorium of three months (further extended by three months) on the payment of all instalments and / or interest, as applicable, falling due between March 1, 2020 and August 31, 2020.

Union of India & Anr), through its interim order dated September 3, 2020 had directed that accounts which were not declared as NPA till August 31, 2020 shall not be declared as NPA till further orders. Accordingly, the Bank did not classify any account which was not NPA as of August 31, 2020 as per the RBI IRAC norms, as NPA after August 31, 2020. The Bank had made contingency provision of \u20b9 2,683 crore till December 31, 2020.

Compensation cost is measured by the excess, if any, of the fair market price of the underlying stock (i.e. the last closing price on the stock exchange on the day preceding the date of grant of stock options) over the exercise price. The exercise price of the Bank's stock option is the last closing price on the stock exchange on the day preceding the date of grant of stock options and accordingly there is no compensation cost under the intrinsic value method.\n\n## Compensated absence\n\nThe employees of the Group are entitled to carry forward a part of their unavailed/unutilized leave  subject  to  a  maximum  limit.

The Bank conducted an internal enquiry of these allegations, which was carried out by management and supervised by the Board of Directors. The enquiry resulted in a report that was reviewed by the Board in November 2018. Based on further inputs and deliberations in December 2018, the Audit Committee of the Bank engaged an external firm to independently examine the matter. In April 2019, the Bank had received the phase 1 report from the external firm and based on further review/ deliberations had directed a phase 2 investigation from the said firm. In February 2020, the Bank has received the final phase 2 report from the said external firm. The Bank has taken this report to the Audit Committee. As advised by the Audit Committee, the Bank has reviewed and carried out remediation actions across areas of process, design, policy and control related issues highlighted in the report including conducting forensic audits for few of the identified borrower accounts. The forensic audits for remaining accounts are in the process. Basis guidance from the ACB during the year,  further  action  has  been  taken  and  a  comprehensive note was put up to the Board on January 15, 2021 for closure of the report. The Board expressed satisfaction with the review carried out and approved the closure of the review of the anonymous complaints received by the Bank in September / December 2018. Exposure to such borrower accounts are recognized as NPA and commensurately provided.\n\nFurther, the Bank received forensic audit reports on certain borrower groups commissioned by other consortium bankers, which gave more information regarding the above mentioned allegations and has filed complaints with the law enforcement agencies. Also, Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) - the Enforcement Directorate (ED), the Central Bureau of Investigations (CBI) and the Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) have launched investigations into some",
