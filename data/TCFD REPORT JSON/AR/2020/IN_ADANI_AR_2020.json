        "page_content": "## The Adani Group businesses\n\n## The Group Adani growth platform\n\nBetting on India\n\n## The platform\n\n## India\n\nAt the Adani Group, we believe in and bet on India. We have observed that following the announcement of liberalisation in 1991, India has not just grown faster; it has compressed the GDP growth of the earlier decades into considerably fewer years for equivalent growth. For instance, the GDP growth that India achieved across nearly 60 years was replicated in the next seven years. This is precisely what is expected going ahead: India is expected to transition from a sub-USD 3 Trillion economy to a USD 5 Trillion economy in the next few years. At Adani Group, we have proactively invested in businesses that will ride the middleincome consumption engine seeking improved life quality. We have invested not on the basis of what is, but on what can be. In making disproportionate investments, we intend to shift the needle not just for the Company but for the country as a whole with the objective of widening access, reducing costs, widening the market and, in doing so, helping strengthen India.\n\n## Competitive advantage\n\nAt the Adani Group, we believe that the ability to make a significant national contribution can only be derived from a broadbased competitive advantage that is not dependent on any one factor but is the result of an overarching culture of excellence - the coming together of rich sectorial experience, timely project implementation, ability to commission projects faster than the sectorial curve, competence to do so at a cost lower than the industry average, foresight to not merely service the market but to grow it, establish a decisive sustainable leadership and evolve the Company's position into a generic name within the sector of its presence.\n\n## Relatively non-mature spaces\n\nAt the Adani Group, we have selected to enter businesses that may be considered 'maturely non-\n\nmature'. Some of the businesses can be classified as mature, based on the enduring industry presence and the conventional interpretation of their market potential; these very businesses can be considered non-mature by the virtue of their vast addressable market potential and the superior Adani Group value proposition. The result is that the Adani Group addresses sectorial spaces not on the basis of existing market demand but on the basis of prospective market growth following the superior Adani sectorial value proposition.\n\n## Outsized\n\nThe Adani Group has established a respect for taking outsized bets in select sectors and businesses without compromising Balance Sheet safety. The Group establishes a large capacity aspiration that sends out a strong message of its long-term\n\ndirection. Its outsized initial capacity establishes economies of scale within a relatively short time horizon that deters prospective competition and generates a substantial cost leadership (fixed and variable) across market cycles.\n\n## Technology\n\nThe Adani Group invests in the best technology standards of the day that could generate precious additional basis points in profitability and help more than recover the additional cost (if at all) paid within a short tenure. This superior technology standard evolves into the Company's sustainable competitive advantage, respect, talent traction and profitability.\n\n## Execution excellence\n\nThe Adani Group has built a distinctive specialisation in project execution, one of the most challenging segments in\n\nStrategic big picture\n\nMaking outsized investments in futuristic infrastructure\n\nInvesting at a competitive capital cost in a relatively low commissioning time\n\n21\n\nCreating longterm revenue visibility\n\nReinforcing attractive margins",

He could at the same moment and by the same means adventure his wealth in the natural resources and new enterprises of any quarter of the world.'\n\nThis appeared in John Maynard Keynes' influential best-seller The Economic Consequences of the Peace, first published in 1919, when the word globalisation had not even been coined (it first showed up in its modern meaning only in 1930). The fact is that globalisation did exist even then, except that the pace was sedentary in comparison to today's world.\n\n## Some Things Never Change\n\nIf Keynes' time is remembered for the gradual globalisation of social and economic life, our time will be remembered for the unbridled pace at which globalisation is enveloping our lives, driven by the ubiquitous reach of the internet. The consequences are still emerging as our world's political, cultural and economic\n\nbarriers dissolve faster than ever before in a dual solvent of global interdependence and hyper interconnectivity that are creating unprecedented new opportunities, new business models and several new challenges.\n\nOf all the challenges, however, one of the most significant consequences of globalisation has been pandemics - and the most difficult of them has been COVID-19. While this is no surprise given that pandemics like the Asian Flu of 1957 spread through trade and travel routes, it is obvious that the world was just not prepared for the explosive rate of spread of a pandemic of COVID19's scale. This has exposed several of the fragilities of global interdependence that will need to be fixed and each country is expected to do it differently.\n\nCuriously though, the remedy for this malady is coming through the process of globalisation, as evidenced by the worldwide collaboration on accelerated genome sequencing, vaccine development and vaccine manufacturing. Therefore, paradoxically, both the problem and its solution lie in our embrace of globalisation.\n\n## Learnings During a Crisis\n\nThere is no denying the fact that while COVID-19 has challenged every nation, India's size and population density have made it a harsher challenge. Indeed, the pandemic froze economic\n\nThere is no denying the fact that while COVID-19 has challenged every nation, India's size and population density have made it a harsher challenge.",

We must believe in our own capabilities and must be able to depend on it for economic construction, especially in times of crisis.\n\nDespite a pandemicinduced large-scale disruption in economic activity, all six of our listed entities posted results significantly above market expectations.\n\npriorities and forced the world to divert time and resources to manage the crisis, as did India. No one denies that India could have done much better and that every life lost is a tragedy. However, as the world races to vaccinate its people, we see India being criticised repeatedly for not doing enough to protect its own. Sometimes, it is worth keeping in mind that India has more people than the combined population of Europe, North America and Oceania. In other words, our country is facing a challenge bigger than what three continents are facing at a time when every nation is maximising what it can do for its own people and has far better healthcare infrastructure built over several decades. Given that our vaccination effort is bigger than the combined efforts of 87 countries, it is only fair to take a step back and determine the scale of the challenge our nation has confronted.\n\nIn this context, I believe that the Atmanirbharta initiative launched by the Government is a transformational and correct step in our nation's journey. The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated, to most nations across the world, that free market economies cannot be at the cost of self-reliance. We must believe in our own capabilities and must be able to depend on it for economic construction, especially in times of crisis. Therefore, the five pillars of Atmanirbhar Bharat - Economy, Infrastructure, System, Vibrant Demography, and Demand - are a necessity to ensure our economy builds the intrinsic robustness to manage disruptive black swan events like COVID-19. The definition of a free-market economy will undergo a change in a post-COVID-19 world, and we must unhesitatingly write our own definition. After all, not only is India the world's\n\nlargest democracy but it is also the world's most unique and boldest experiment with democracy. One size does not fit all and it is increasingly evident that the phenomenon of hyper-globalisation that created the unrealistic expectation of being the panacea for efficient manufacturing and services across the world has been one important cause of much of the inequalities we are witnessing today. Therefore, only when we are able to fully mobilise the efforts of our own people will we be able to develop our economy in a way that we can take advantage of our country's demographic dividends that we have not yet been able to fully unleash. COVID-19 is a wakeup call for all of us to transform ourselves. There cannot be a better time for us to commence the journey towards true self-reliance (Atmanirbharta) for accelerating the building of our nation in the post-COVID-19 world.\n\n## Organisational Values as a Platform for Numbers\n\nThe past year has been one that further reinforced my belief in the values of an organisation. About a decade back, we chose Courage, Trust and Commitment as the guiding values that would determine our actions and, today, I credit the resilience that we have demonstrated to the stoutness of these values. It strengthens my confidence in our organisation's fortitude, and this has been demonstrated in the results of our Group. Not only has the Adani Group emerged as India's benchmark for market leadership in difficult times, but we have also broadcast our organisational ability to rapidly pivot in the right market direction. An exciting example of this agility is our expanding partnership with TOTAL (now TotalEnergies)",

These developments exemplify the resilience of our diversified business across sectors, industries, and geographies. Despite a pandemic-induced large-scale disruption in economic activity, all six of our listed entities posted results significantly above market expectations and some of these record highlights appear below.\n\n## Group highlights\n\n- \u00a7 Capacity addition, sweating of assets, and a relentless focus on operational excellence and efficiency ensured that the EBITDA of our listed portfolio registered a year-on-year growth of 22% ( H 32,337 Crore in FY21).\n- \u00a7 The return to equity shareholders (PAT) increased by a significant 166% on a year-on-year basis ( H 9,415 Crore in FY21).\n- \u00a7 All Adani portfolio stocks gave returns over 100% and outperformed index by a significant margin (Nifty-50 gave a return of 71%).\n\n## Segment highlights\n\n- \u00a7 Adani Green Energy Limited (AGEL) added 925 MW operational capacity, achieved a high consistent Solar CUF of 22.5% and Wind CUF of 26.8%.\n- \u00a7 Adani Transmission Limited (ATL) added 3,931 ckt km to its network, reaching 18,801 ckt km, and sold a record 7,169 Million units during the year.\n- \u00a7 Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Limited (APSEZ) achieved a cargo volume of 247 MMT (up by 11%) and reached a market share of 25%, a gain of 4% points.\n- \u00a7 Adani Total Gas Limited (ATGL) added 102 CNG stations, 500 commercial and 40,939 domestic customers, achieving a combined volume of 515 MMSCM\n\n## (CNG+PNG)\n\n## Strategic highlights\n\n- \u00a7 APSEZ announced four acquisitions - KPCL, GPL, Dighi Ports & SRCPL - thus improving East Coast - West Coast parity. It also announced the setting up of a container terminal at Colombo port in partnership with John Keells and SLPA.\n- \u00a7 Adani Enterprise Limited (AEL) took over operations of airports at Ahmedabad, Lucknow and Mangalore, signed concession agreements for Guwahati, Jaipur & Thiruvananthapuram, and is in the process of acquiring Mumbai International Airports Limited (MIAL) & Navi Mumbai International Airport Limited (NMIAL) airports.\n- \u00a7 AGEL fortified its partnership with TotalEnergies who acquired a 50% stake in its 2.35 GW portfolio of operating solar assets and 20% equity stake in AGEL from the founders for an investment amounting to USD 2.5 Billion.\n\nWhile we can look back and feel satisfied about our results, I believe that the real phase of accelerated growth of the Adani Group as an entity that benefits from having a portfolio of companies with several strategic adjacencies, is only now gathering momentum. This helps us bridge the B2B to B2C gap in unique ways and will encompass our new businesses like Airports, Data Centres, Defence and several others. What we have built over the past two decades is India's largest integrated and yet diversified infrastructure business that is now manifesting itself as an integrated 'platform of platforms' and moving us closer to unprecedented access to the Indian end consumer. I know of no business model akin to ours with access to an unlimited B2B and B2C market over the next several decades.\n\n20\n\nNot only has the Adani Group emerged as India's benchmark for market leadership in difficult times, we have also broadcast our organisational ability to rapidly pivot in the right market direction. These traits exemplify the resilience of our diversified business across sectors, industries, and geographies.\n\n## Building the Template for Capitalising on Trends\n\nWhile we are known as an organisation that makes swift decisions, our foray into the world of renewables and clean energy has further allowed us to templatise our expansion process and has given us the confidence to move into several new sectors as has been increasingly evident with our diverse business portfolio. As an example, it is worth noting that the thought process of accelerating our clean energy footprint was seeded as recently as in 2020 (at the Davos World Economic Forum in January 2020). From my meetings at Davos, two things had become evident.\n\n- \u00a7 First - Climate change had become the defining issue of our time and climate change action must be accepted as a global, national, and personal responsibility.",

I also decided that a significant part of our Group's future investments must be focused on sustainable and renewable energy.\n\n- \u00a7 Second - With India driving one of the largest consumption growths, our country would have to play a defining role as it balanced its need to provide affordable electricity to its citizens as well as accelerate its renewable energy ambitions.\n\nIt was at Davos that I decided we must align with our nation's perspective on renewable energy - and set ourselves the goal to be the world's largest solar power producer. I also decided that a significant part of our Group's future investments must be focused on sustainable and renewable energy. On the 22 nd of January, I penned down my thoughts and the Group's ambitions in a LinkedIn article wherein I wrote: 'Our vision is to become the world's largest solar power company by 2025 and thereafter the world's largest renewable power company by 2030'. I also stated that we would 'build 25 Gigawatts by 2025 and also become the world's biggest solar player'. Our existing portfolio of renewable power at that time stood at just 2.5 Gigawatts.\n\nWe moved fast since January 2020 and my focus has been on building an organisation that can add an unmatched 5 Gigawatts of generation capacity every year over the next decade and foster a cleaner energy future. So far, we are very much on target. Let me highlight some of the milestones:\n\n- \u00a7 Five months following the promise at Davos, in Q2 of 2020, we won the world's largest solar tender when SECI awarded us 8 Gigawatts through a competitive bidding process.\n- \u00a7 Thereafter, in Q3 of 2020, Mercom reported that we had become the world's largest solar power developer. We rose from No.6 position in 2019 to No.1 in 2020 - in just nine months.\n- \u00a7 Simultaneously, we formed game-changing partnerships in energy to start establishing the base for global partnerships. Inducting TotalEnergies as a 20% partner in the renewables business sealed a strategic alliance that covers investments in LNG terminals and renewable assets across India, besides the gas utility business. The partnership within the renewables space in India will be a key contributor to TotalEnergies' objective of transforming into a clean energy leader.\n- \u00a7 Since January 2020, the value of our renewables business increased over 600 times thereby yielding one of the best returns across all stock markets.\n- \u00a7 Thereafter, in May 2021, we acquired Softbank's and Bharti's 5 Gigawatts portfolio of renewable assets, allowing us to leapfrog and get to our target of 25 Gigawatts a full four years ahead of our schedule.\n\nThis is what templatisation means to us and it gives us the confidence to expand swiftly across several adjacent sectors. This success is also a manifestation of the core of our three organisational values Courage, Trust, and Commitment - that fundamentally define our Group.\n\n## Adani Foundation: Growth with Goodness\n\nAs a Group with businesses in locations where some of the poorest segments of our population reside, we are deeply conscious of our responsibility to help marginalised and underprivileged communities - over and above just creating jobs. Through a wide variety of initiatives led by the Adani Foundation, we have touched millions of lives across thousands",

We expect to amplify our work and double these numbers over the next five years.\n\nHowever, in line with the rest of the world, the Adani Foundation's primary focus over the past year was guided by the battle against COVID-19. One of the issues the cascading nature of this pandemic thrust into the national spotlight was the grave inequality across our scattered communes in access to relief and care. As soon as the virus took hold, we mapped out the urgencies of the moment and studied how best we could mitigate distress across India. We quickly realised that the battle needed more than the standard assortment of medical items, like protective gear and diagnostic kits. The most pressing need was for additional means to quickly deliver medical oxygen across the land.\n\nThe solution was tied to several items that were in short supply locally. We needed more cryogenic tanks capable of transporting oxygen in supercooled liquid form, more medical oxygen cylinders for hospitalised patients, more oxygen generator plants for healthcare facilities unable to rely on transported supplies and more oxygen concentrators for people managing their infection by themselves.\n\nAt no time in the past was the work of the Adani Foundation more necessary and relevant than it is now.\n\nIt was a formidable challenge but one that we rose to, quickly and efficiently. Working with our business partners and Indian missions across the world, we managed to secure a massive life-saving inventory of these critical items, the biggest of which we brought in with the help of the Indian Air Force. Back home, our indefatigable logistics teams ensured that the oxygen tanks and cylinders were repeatedly refilled and despatched to all corners of the country.\n\nI am also proud that the Foundation went well beyond procuring essential supplies. In just days, our engineering and medical teams expertly converted our Adani Vidya Mandir school in Ahmedabad and the Noida Indoor Stadium into emergency COVID Care Facilities with hundreds of beds, oxygen support and catered food. In Bhuj and Mundra, our hospitals that serve as a general medical oasis for the neighbouring districts were swiftly turned into 100% COVID care hospitals.\n\nAt no time in the past was the work of the Adani Foundation more necessary and relevant than it is now. I am deeply moved by the extent of the effort our Foundation's team members have put in, often choosing to ignore the risk to their own health.\n\n## The Belief in the Long Term\n\nOver the past few months there have been several voices that wonder if India's target to be a five-trillion-dollar economy over the next four years is achievable. I personally see it as an inconsequential question. History has amply demonstrated that out of every pandemic crisis, emerge several learnings and I believe that India and the world become wiser as we go through this pandemic. India will be a five-trillion-dollar economy and\n\nIndia will be a fivetrillion-dollar economy and will then go on to be a 15-trillion-dollarplus economy over the next two decades and will emerge as one of the largest global markets, in terms of both consumption size and market capitalisation.\n\nwill then go on to be a 15-trilliondollar-plus economy over the next two decades, emerging as one of the largest global markets in terms of consumption size and market capitalisation. There will be bumps along the road, as has been the case in the past, and is expected to be the case in the future. However, there cannot be any doubt that the largest middle-class that will ever exist, augmented by an increase in the working age and consuming population share, will have a positive impact on India's growth rates very much in line with the demographic dividend India enjoys. The most essential factor required will be a better trained workforce and I have no reason to believe that over the next two decades we will not have been able to suitably address this challenge. It is a virtuous cycle that is driven by the growth in the middle-class population and India today has a longer runway than any other nation in the world.\n\nRegards,\n\nGautam S Adani Chairman",

The global and Indian economies have passed through prolonged and repetitive lockdowns, brought about by fresh bouts of the COVID-19 contagion, some of which has proved pugnacious and unprecedented in every way.\n\nHowever, across the world and much more so in India, the collective resilience of the people, coupled with initiatives by governments, helped counter these attacks, although the pandemic was not completely vanquished. Human ingenuity presented in the form of rapid development of advanced vaccines; their quick rollout to\n\nvulnerable populations, however the same may yet not be an immediate cure to the challenges.\n\nThe impact of the pandemic has been devastating for those affected directly and it has become incumbent upon us, as a society, to provide succour to all those needing the same.\n\nYour Company is a leading power generator, which contributes considerably to India's economic engine. During the COVID-19 lockdown, your Company honoured all its commitments duly, ensuring maximum power generation availability so that power supply to consumers remained uninterrupted. We were able to achieve this while following all safety guidelines, strict social distancing and minimising our workforce in",

Power demand in India declined (-) 1.1% in FY 2020-21, which followed the slower growth of 1.2% during FY 2019-20. While demand in FY 2020-21 was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, a slowdown in economic growth\n\nand lower agricultural demand due to heavy monsoons in recent years across much of the country dampened demand growth.\n\nHowever, before the COVID-19related movement restrictions came into effect, power demand started improving, providing evidence of India's economic resilience and deep-rooted growth drivers. During the FY 2020-21, our average PLF achievement was lower at 59% compared to 67% in the previous financial year due to a sharp drop in demand from the Commercial and Industrial (C&I) segments, especially during the initial nation-wide lockdown and gradual lifting during the second half of the year. Units sold in FY 2020-21 declined to 59.3 Billion Units (BUs) compared to 64 BUs in FY 2019-20.\n\nAt Adani Power, we have always been amenable to a rapidly evolving environment and ecosystem with agility and speed.

Further, the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) completed hearings on the petition filed by Adani Power (Mundra) Ltd. as per the order of the Supreme Court, for compensation under Section 62 of the Electricity Act, following termination of the Bid-2 PPA, and reserved its order.\n\nDomestic coal supply during the year remained satisfactory, allowing our power plants to maintain high availability for generation and service customer demand at all times. We were able to post high availability numbers above the normative availability, due to our continuous focus on excellence in O&M, as well as fuel and logistics management.\n\nLooking forward, as India's power demand reclaims its growth trajectory, your Company, with its modern and efficient portfolio will be standing ready to fulfil need for reliable, cost-effective and efficient base load supply.

Engaged in addressing a critical building block for a modern India\n\n## Overview\n\nEven as India's electricity demand has increased significantly over the past decade, the country's per capita electricity consumption of 1,208 units still compares weakly with that of countries like USA (11,730 units), China (3,991 units) and the global average of 3,316 units (Source: Our world in data).\n\n## Demand outlook\n\nThe International Energy Agency has projected that India's electricity demand will treble between 2018 and 2040. The increase in consumption will be accompanied by a significant increase in base load demand, which will need to be addressed through stable power supply sources like thermal energy.\n\n## Accelerating reforms\n\nThe Indian government has undertaken significant reforms to improve the health of the country's power sector. These have strengthened fuel linkages under the Scheme for Harnessing and Allocating Koyala (Coal) Transparently in India (SHAKTI) and the Ujwal DISCOMS Assurance Yojana (UDAY) to catalyse the transformation of power distribution companies. The\n\nDeen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY) for rural electrification and the Pradhan Mantri Har Ghar Sahaj Bijli Yojana (Saubhagya) will widen the consumption of electricity across the coming years.\n\n## Dependence on conventional fuel sources\n\nEven as the Indian power sector has broadened its access to renewable energy, more than 60% of the country's total installed capacity and ~84% of the total generation is still thermal (including coal, lignite, and gas-based power plants). This indicates a continuing coexistence of conventional fuel sources alongside renewable options. Coal-fired (including lignite) thermal power plants accounted for ~55% of India's installed capacity by the close of the year under review.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Besides, the Company is commissioning an ultra-supercritical power project of 1,600 MW (2 x 800 MW) through its Adani Power (Jharkhand) Limited to supply power to Bangladesh through a dedicated transmission line (supported by a 25-year power purchase agreement with Bangladesh Power Development Board, power supply projected to commence from January 2022 for Unit 1 and May 2022 for Unit 2). The Company invested in sonic soot blowers in boilers to reduce ash accumulation at gooseneck furnace areas. It installed fast\n\ncooling turbine devices to reduce turbine downtime in plants. Its thermography of coal stockpiles identifies hot spots in coal stockpiles to prevent coal fires in yards across all plants and eliminate energy loss. A comparative study between UAV Ninja/Drone and 3D scanner was carried out in the Mundra port for volumetric measurement to establish technology suitability.\n\nSpeed: The Mundra super critical units 6 and 9 achieved synchronisation following boiler commissioning in less than 3.5 months. The super critical segment of unit 5 of the Mundra thermal power plant (660MW) was synchronised within 36 months from inception, the fastest such implementation anywhere in the world. Two super-critical units (Unit 8 and Unit 9 of the Mundra thermal power plant) completed steam blowing within two days of boiler commissioning, among the quickest. The Mundra units 3, 5 and 9 achieved full load operation following synchronisation in less than four days.\n\nScale: The Mundra thermal power plant is India's largest to function off a seawater-based closed-cycle induced draft circulating cooling water system. The system draws on sea water that is recycled up to\n\nThe Company's power generation outperforming India's thermal power sector\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nfour times, conserving water and requiring a smaller discharge pipeline into the sea than an open circuit cooling system. The Company's Tiroda plant is equipped with the largest denomination of the latest high efficiency electrostatic precipitators (pollution control equipment) in Asia.\n\nIntegration: The Company invested in power generation facilities that represent a synergic complement of scale, cost economy, feedstock integration, port support and power back-up. Besides, a complement of identical power generation units across locations represents an advantage in the utilisation of spares and vendor management. The progressive indigenisation of critical equipment and a widening domestic vendor eco-system is a strategic priority that is periodically measured.\n\nSophistication: In the underconstruction 1,600 MW Godda thermal power project in Jharkhand, the Company employed the next generation ultra-supercritical technology. The Company's Energy Network Operations Centre (ENOC) draws online and real-time data from all its power generating plants comprising remote monitoring, automated reporting, benchmarking and performance enhancement. This real-time supervision facilitates timely troubleshooting and responsive decision-making following supervision by multi-disciplinary experts using artificial intelligence and machine learning. Besides, the Company invested in drones to facilitate the inspection of difficultto-approach high-rise structures (natural draft cooling tower and chimneys), enhancing accuracy, costefficiency and time saving.\n\nScope: The Company built the rail under rail (RUR) on the busy Mumbai-Howrah rail route, resulting in uninterrupted coal supply.",

        "page_content": "## Adani Power. How we have created environmentally responsible assets for the long-term\n\n## Overview\n\nIndia submitted a Nationally Determined Contribution to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). As per the NDC, India committed to reduce its emissions intensity of GDP by 33-35% by 2030 (compared to the 2005 levels). Besides, the Government targeted 450 GW of renewable energy investment by 2030 in line with the National Action Plan on Climate Change.\n\n## Our priority\n\nAt Adani Power, we have grown our business in line with this national direction and priority. We have not only focused on timely project completion; we have also focused on a high environmental responsibility.\n\nThis responsibility has been holistic, reflecting in a high plant availability, relatively low resource consumption and high environment integrity.\n\nThis culture of high operating efficiency ensured that the Company's resource consumption was more optimised than the sectorial average.\n\n## Environment performance\n\nIn FY 2020-21, we were well on course to achieve our target of 0.84 tCO2/MWh consumption by 2025.\n\nOur continuous online emission monitoring system was functional at all sites; the data\n\nwas continually shared with the Central Pollution Control Board.\n\nIndia's surface water consumption regulatory norm for thermal power plants was 3.5 m3/MWh; the Company set a stricter internal target of 2.5 m3/MWh of surface water consumption for hinterland power plants. For seawater consumption, where there was no regulatory limit, the Company set an internal target of 9.5 m3/MWh for plants with seawater-based Flue Gas Desulphurisation (FGD) and 6 m3/MWh at plants without seawater-based FGD. During the year under review, the Company performed creditably in the area of seawater consumption; it initiated rainwater harvesting across all its plants, harvesting 3.79 Million m3 rainwater in FY 2020-21.\n\n## Operational excellence\n\nAt Adani Power, we believe that a culture of operational\n\nexcellence moderates resource consumption, strengthening environment integrity. The Company deepened innovation, embraced best-in-class technologies and implemented internationally recognised management standards. The Company was conferred awards for excellence in 5S (Workplace Management System), ISO 45000:2018 (OHSAS) and ISO 50001:2018 (EMS), as well as Quality management.\n\nThe result is that about 75% of the power generation by the Company was derived from the supercritical power generation technology, saving ~2% fuel consumed per unit of power generated over legacy technologies and correspondingly reducing greenhouse gas emissions per unit of generation.",

        "page_content": "## Climate change\n\nThe power generation sector is witnessing an increased push for innovation and technology upgradation against the backdrop of growing climate change concerns. At APL, we have constantly demonstrated our commitment towards climate change mitigation by adopting the best-available technologies at our power plants, thereby ensuring efficient operations.\n\nWe were the first in India to commission super-critical boilers at our Mundra (Gujarat) plant, saving ~2% of fuel per unit of power generated and leading to lower GHG emissions. To date, we commissioned 14 units of 660 MW each based on the Supercritical technology.\n\nWith our 1,600 MW Godda thermal power project in Jharkhand, which is currently under construction, we are now moving towards the adoption of the next generation ultrasupercritical technology. For our expansion plans, we remain committed to deploying the best available technologies to address India's energy requirements.\n\nIn addition, we implemented all appropriate measures to minimise climate change-related risks to our assets and operations, while adopting for climate change.\n\nMost of our thermal power plants are equipped with induced draft cooling towers with a recirculation system which can function effectively if the water temperature rises. Besides, our plants have inbuilt design and construction safety standards to withstand any adverse impact under different scenarios of climate change. In 2020, we also responded to the CDP's Climate Change and Water Security questionnaire. To drive low carbon investments, we adopted an internal carbon price (ICP) in the annual capex approval of the identified energy efficiency measures.\n\n## Resource conservation\n\nWe recognise the correlation between our operations and the impacts they have on the surrounding ecosystems. We take all the required measures to minimise our footprint and are committed to conserving resources. All hinterland power plants are based on the zero liquid discharge principle. All our operational power plants are certified with internationally recognised standards of Environmental Management System (ISO 14001) and Energy Management System (ISO 50001), which allow control over the environmental aspects of thermal\n\npower generation and enable us to continuously improve our performance.\n\n## Water conservation and management\n\nWater is one of the main requirements for thermal power plants; we are committed to optimising our water consumption and ensuring conservation. We set an internal target of 2.5 m3/MWh for surface water consumption at our hinterland plants well below the stipulated limit of 3.5 m3/MWh set by the MoEFCC. Although there is no regulatory limit on seawater withdrawal, we set an internal target at our Mundra (9.5 m3/MWh for seawater-based FGD) and Udupi (6 m3/MWh for wet limestone-FGD) power plants as well.\n\nWe adopted an inside-out approach to minimise our impact on surroundings. De-silting and cleaning of community ponds were undertaken to improve\n\n## 2.5 m3/MWh\n\nInternal water consumption target versus the regulatory limit of 3.5 m3/MWh\n\n<!-- image -->",

Within our premises, we developed water storage capacity to meet 53 days of requirements for the Tiroda plant and 23 days for the Kawai plant to reduce surface water intake during the lean season.\n\n## Air emissions management\n\nIn December 2015, the Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change (MoEF&CC) issued the Environment (Protection) Amendment Rules, 2015, setting specific limits on water and stack emissions from thermal power plants for SOx, NOx, Particulate Matter (PM) and mercury. The Central Electricity Authority (CEA) mandated all operating power plants to install suitable devices to achieve new emission standards and the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) issued directives in this regard.\n\nWhile all our existing operational units were already compliant with the new emission standards for mercury and PM, some units are in the process of installing new devices for meeting the SOx and NOx emission norms. During FY 2019-20, we initiated the International Commercial Bidding process for the installation of Flue Gas Desulphirisation (FGD) equipment. We are on track to\n\nmeet the new emission standards for all our power plants, in accordance with the plan laid out by the MoEF&CC.\n\n## Waste management\n\nFly ash is a solid waste generation in coal-based power production process. As its disposal in landfills presents a significant challenge, the central government is focusing on utilising this fly ash. At Tiroda, we installed a High Concentration Slurry Disposal (HCSD) system for ash disposal, which solidifies the ash immediately. At our other plants, we have also taken various actions and developed infrastructure to make fly ash a valuable and in-demand material for cement, ready-mix concrete and other industries. This helped increase our fly ash utilisation and supply to specialised agencies. This resulted in more than 100% ash utilisation during FY 2020-21.\n\nAll the APL's power plants initiated single use plastic (SuP) free certification Process with CII. CII, after completing the assessment, will certify the successful plants based on the CII CESD's Plasticsuse Protocol: Verification and Certification (1.0). The assessment is underway and will be completed by July 2021.\n\n## Our social initiatives\n\n## Our employees\n\nThe Company ensures people career growth, maintaining health & safety standards, and adopting best practices in managing human resources. We define a clear growth path for each employee; talent supersedes all considerations as we provide equal opportunities to all.\n\nThe learning, development and retention of our people is important in the creation of a world-class talent pool and transitioning to more modern technologies.\n\nThere were 117 new recruits including trainees at APL in FY 2020-21, compared to 387\n\n20\n\nOur Tiroda site installed a wastepaper recycling unit in the premises in June 2016 and recycled more than 7,205 Kg of paper.\n\n## Energy Efficiency\n\nThe Government of India imposed a cess on domestically produced and imported coal as India's Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) includes fiscal policies in its climate action toolkit. This includes instruments like coal cess, cuts in subsidies, increase in taxes on petrol and diesel; the Company is complying with this regulation. The Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) launched The Perform, Achieve, and Trade (PAT) Scheme. The objective of this scheme is to reduce energy consumption and promote enhanced energy efficiency among specific energyintensive industries in the country. In the first cycle of this scheme, which started in FY 2014-15, and since the second cycle which lasted from 2016 to 2019, all the nominated APL subsidiaries actively participated and got audited periodically. The betterthan-PAT target performance has enabled two of our plants to generate EScerts and revenue as an incentive for the higher energy efficiency performance.\n\nin the previous year. Of these, 102 left the organisation during the year. The attrition rate declined to 3.35% in FY 2020-21, compared to 4% in FY 2019-20 across all sites.",

They mainly consist  of  expenses  in  nature  of  fuel  cost, purchase of trading goods, employee benefits expense,  transmission  expense,  repairs  and maintenance expense etc.\n\nThe percentage of Operating and administrative expenses  to  total  revenue  has  decreased  to 62.36% in FY 2020-21 from 74.64% in FY 201920.\n\n## c)   Depreciation and amortization expenses\n\nConsolidated  Depreciation  and  amortization expenses during FY 2020-21 were H 3,201.65 Crores, which have increased by 6.49% from H 3,006.50 Crores in FY 2019-20 largely due to full year consolidation of REL and REGL.\n\n## d)   Finance costs\n\nConsolidated Finance costs during FY 2020-21 were H 5,106.33 Crores, which have decreased by 3.92% from H 5,314.82 Crores in FY 201920, mainly due to interest rate reduction and repayments.\n\n## e)   Total Comprehensive Income / Loss for the year\n\nConsolidated  Total  Comprehensive  Income for the FY 2020-21 was H 1,239.58 Crores as compared  to  Total  Comprehensive  Loss  of H 2,264.45 Crores in FY 2019-20.\n\n## 3.   DIVIDEND:\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  of  your  Company,  after considering the relevant circumstances holistically and  keeping  in  view  the  Company's  dividend distribution policy, has decided that it would be prudent not to recommend any Dividend for the year under review.\n\n## 4.   COVID-19 PANDEMIC:\n\nDue  to  outbreak  of  Covid-19  pandemic  globally and  in  India,  the  Company's  management  has made initial assessment of likely adverse impact on business and financial risks on account of Covid-19 and  the  efforts  to  combat  it.  The  management does not see any medium to long term risks in the Company's ability to continue as a going concern and meeting its liabilities. The management will\n\n21\n\ncontinue to monitor performance and take remedial measures as needed to respond to the Covid-19 related risk, if any.\n\nThe  generation  and  supply  of  electricity  are essential services. During the lockdown announced by the Central Government to restrict the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Ministry of Power instructed various bodies and agencies of State Governments  and  urban  local  administration to  ensure  that  generation  of  power  continues without interruption, and that the movement of fuel, manpower, or machinery is not hampered. As a result of these measures, the Company was able to maintain plant uptime and supply power as per demand.  Further,  the  disruptions  caused  across the world due to the pandemic created the need for practical and scalable solutions to overcome the challenges of remote working by transforming to  new  business  processes  and  creating  new workflows. The transition to remote working was facilitated by various digital initiatives adopted by the Company.\n\nThe demand for power was affected significantly due to the lockdown, as all non-essential industrial and commercial establishments were shut across the nation. This reduction in demand had an impact on the PLF of most of the power plants of the Company and its subsidiaries, especially during the first  half  of  FY  2020-21.  However,  power  demand revived quickly after the lockdowns were eased and as economic activity started to normalise.\n\nDuring  the  lockdown  period,  power  distribution companies also faced cash flow shortages due to their inability to collect dues from customers on account  of  restrictions  on  movement.  However, the  Government  undertook  proactive  measures to ensure that the liquidity of power generating companies  does  not  get  affected  adversely. Initially in FY 2020-21 the Government announced financial packages with an aim to provide liquidity to DISCOMs by lending against their receivables and thereby to relieve cash flow bottlenecks in the power sector. The Company has taken necessary steps  to  ensure  adequate  liquidity  during  and beyond the lockdown period.\n\nPower demand for FY 2020-21, measured by energy demand as well as peak demand, has again reached the level of the demand seen during FY 2019-20, demonstrating  the  depth  and  resilience  of  the Indian economy. Various policies and protocols put in place by the Government and the private sector, combined with timely enhancement of healthcare infrastructure and the experience gained during",

The  Company  has  also invested  a  lot  in  taking  requisite  initiatives  by setting  up  medical  helplines,  first  line  Covid  Care Center  at  Adani  Vidyamandir,  Ahmedabad  etc., and has also extended counselling and self-help services providing psychological support to all its employees.\n\n## 5.

        "page_content": "## Management Discussion and Analysis\n\n## Global economy\n\nThe  global  economy  is  recovering  steadily  from the  COVID-19  pandemic,  marked  by  the  rollout  of vaccination programs across nations, announcement of  additional  fiscal  support  in  various  economies  and an improving capability to contain the re-emergence of further virus outbreaks.\n\n## Year in review\n\nIn 2020, global economic activity was affected by the pandemic, resulting in a contraction of (-) 3.4% after a slow growth 2.4% in 2019.  G20 countries experienced an aggregate slowdown of (-) 3.2%, with the Euro area contracting by (-) 6.8%, UK by (-) 9.9%, Japan by (-) 4.8% and the US by (-) 3.5%. Among other countries, China was the only major economy to record a growth of 2.3% in 2020.\n\n## Outlook\n\nGlobal GDP growth is forecast to touch 6% in 2021, supported primarily by improving prospects in the US, China, and India. Drivers of resilience and growth have been different across economies, with the US being led by household spending, while emerging markets and East Asia are catalysed by industrial production, exports and a commodity boom. Europe is benefiting from a resumption in world trade, while its consumer spending remains constrained.\n\nThere  could  be  a  spurt  in  inflation  as  a  result  of combination  of  pent-up  demand  and  accumulated household savings with the easing of restrictions as vaccination progresses. Cost pressures and temporary supply disruptions may emerge due to surging demand and  strict  containment  measures.  However,  the  idle and spare global manufacturing capacity could keep inflation in check.\n\n## Indian economy\n\nThe Indian economy, which had been beset by a gradual growth slowdown in the last few years, experienced a challenge in FY 2020-21 in the form of the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to a strict lockdown enforced by the Government.  However, the economy demonstrated resilience and depth by recovering much of the lost ground  in  the  subsequent  quarters.    However,  the challenge posed by the virus only subsided to come back stronger in a devastating second wave in the first quarter of FY 2021-22.\n\nFor  India,  emerging  victorious  against  this  invisible enemy and returning to the path of prosperity will call for concerted efforts by Central and State Governments, the healthcare sector, and the people.  Various measures\n\nannounced by the Government to support livelihoods and incentivize investments are expected to emerge as drivers for sustained long-term growth.\n\n## Year in review\n\nIndia was able to contain the impact of COVID-19 on its economy in FY 2020-21 with combined efforts of the people and businesses as well as the Government. Decline in GDP in FY 2020-21 is expected to be in the region of (-) 7.3% to (-) 7.5%, largely due to the lockdown imposed in the first quarter of the year. However, the economy rebounded rapidly after the restrictions eased and posted growth in the fourth quarter simultaneously with the rollout of a nationwide vaccination program.\n\nThe Indian Government announced a bold economic stimulus to combat the sharp slowdown caused by the lockdown, its various measures aimed at easing liquidity and  credit  unavailability  faced  by  the  MSME  sector to  reinvigorate  economic  activity.  Similarly,  various measures  targeted  at  incentivizing  investments  in economic segments and bringing about long-awaited labour reforms helped improve sentiment and attract global investments, strengthening India's self-reliance for critical needs.\n\nDuring  FY  2020-21,  while  the  Agricultural  sector  is expected to have a growth of 3%, the Industrial sector may have contracted by (-) 7.4% and the Services sector may have been hit the hardest with a decline of (-) 8.4%. As a result, consumption expenditure is expected to decline by (-) 7.1% while Gross Fixed Capital Formation may have contracted by (-) 12.4%. On the other hand, while power generation declined (-) 15.7% in the first quarter, it rebounded during the second half of the year to a cumulative decline of only (-) 0.95% for FY 2020-21.\n\nA decline in global commodity prices helped contain inflation,  with  Consumer  Price  Index  inflation  rising 6.18% and Wholesale Price Index inflation rising 1.2% during the year.\n\n## Outlook\n\nEmergence of the second COVID-19 wave has dampened the outlook for a strong projected rebound in real GDP growth of 10.5% in FY 2021-22, which had been supported by  a  strong  revival  achieved  in  Q4  FY  2020-21  and impact of fiscal stimulus packages under AtmaNirbhar 2.0 and 3.0 schemes, increased capital outlays and the promotion of investments in the Union Budget 2021-22. As a result of the setback caused by the second wave, real GDP growth for FY 2021-22 may finish lower than expected before India returns to robust growth in FY 2022-23 with a projected 6.8% growth over FY 2021-22.",

However, India's growth outlook could also depend on the trajectory of global economic recovery, in view of external trade linkages, hardening crude oil prices and competition in the export markets.\n\n## Indian power sector review\n\nUniversal, affordable, and uninterrupted power supply have been the guiding principles of India's electricity policy.  As the third largest global power producer with a combined installed capacity of 382 GW, India still has a long way to go to achieve economic progress and  electricity  consumption  comparable  to  major economies in the region, if not developed nations.\n\nIndia's installed capacity has grown at compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.27% since 2010.\n\nSource: CEA\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIndia's power generating capacity is based on conventional thermal sources like coal and gas in addition to hydro power, with a rapidly growing proportion of renewable energy. Thermal power represents most of the power generated in India. Coal-fired power plants act as base load power generators and enjoy high energy security due to India's large coal reserves, in addition to competitive generation costs. The growth in coal-fired power generation was responsible for making affordable and reliable electricity available across the nation.\n\nSource: CEA\n\n<!-- image -->",

With improving standards of living, increasing electrical and electronic appliance penetration even across rural areas, and emphasis by the Government to increase the share of the manufacturing sector in GDP growth, per capita consumption and overall power demand are likely to grow significantly.\n\n## Energy requirement and peak availability\n\nIndia's energy deficit decreased from an interim high of 8.7% in FY 2012-13 to 0.4% in FY 2020-21. Peak deficit decreased from an interim high of 10.6% in FY 2011-12 to 0.4% in FY 2020-21.\n\nReduction in power deficits demonstrates the success of  various  policy  initiatives  and  investments  made in  infrastructure  augmentation,  generation  capacity growth, and fuel supply enhancement by the public and private sectors.\n\nDemand for electricity is on the rise as India's economy continues to grow. Various factors contributing to the rising  per  capita  consumption  include  improvement of  electrification  across  all  villages,  GDP  growth  and general  economic  activity,  and  growth  in  consumer electricals and electronic device penetration. Increasing consumption of online services and streaming video is an emerging growth driver for the power sector, as it will require large-scale establishment and expansion of data centers, content delivery networks, and cellular as well as terrestrial network infrastructure.\n\n## Indian power sector outlook\n\nAccess to cost-effective and reliable power supply are the  biggest  catalysts  for  inclusive  growth.  They  are critical for industrial growth, ensuring social growth of citizens and a high human development index. Demand for electricity in India is expected to grow at a sustained pace  given  the  government's  massive  push  towards Make-In-India,  increasing  industrialization,  improving incomes and living standards.\n\nAs  per  the  Central  Electricity  Authority  (CEA),  peak demand is likely to increase to around 340 GW from the current peak demand of around 190 GW by 2030. The base demand is expected to increase to 2325 BU by 2030. CEA predicts that India's likely installed capacity by FY 2030 could be around 817 GW, more than double the present installed capacity.\n\nIn terms of coal-based capacity, CEA estimates capacity addition of over 60 GW till 2030. Further, coal-based power will still be the dominant fuel type in 2030. In terms  of  the  PLF  of  coal-based  plants,  CEA  studies indicated that high-capacity pit head plants (600 800 MW unit size) could enjoy PLFs of over 70% whilst similar load centre plants could have PLFs of around 50%. It is evident that coal-based power could continue to play a significant role in meeting India's electricity demand into the long-term.\n\n## Coal demand and supply\n\nOver  the  years,  overall  coal  consumption  increased continuously. In FY 2020-21, it witnessed a decline in domestic coal consumption due to the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown, coming after tepid growth in power",

Coal India Ltd. (CIL) and Singareni Collieries Company Limited (SCCL) produced 647 MT of coal in FY 2020-21 as against 666 MT in FY 2019-20. However, coal offtake from producers reduced from 676 MT in FY 2019-20 to 622 MT in FY 2020-21\n\nCoal  imports  increased  through  the  last  few  years from 204 MT in FY 2015-16 to 249 MT in FY 2019-20. However, coal imports in FY 2020-21 were lower, with only 196 MT being imported till February 2021.\n\nInternational coal prices declined during the COVID-19 pandemic  in  2020,  with  the  Australian  coal  index registering a low of USD 50.14/T in August 2020 and Indonesian HBA coal price reference registered a low of USD 49.42/T in September 2020. However, prices recovered to USD 94.92/T for the Australian coal index and USD 84.49/T for the HBA index in March 2021.\n\nThis sharp increase in global coal prices was the result of a coal shortage coupled with strong demand in China and seaborne coal supply disruptions. However, supply side response and easing of maritime freight rates are expected to ease the pressure and move global prices towards a long term USD 70/T (real prices) trajectory. Price  are  expected  to  move  gradually  towards  the cost support level, with supply improving and imports demand from China easing.\n\n## Adani Power Limited (APL): Delivering sustainable value\n\nAPL is the largest private thermal power producer in India with a power generation capacity of 12,450 MW comprising 12,410 MW of thermal power plants and a 40 MW solar power project. APL has built and operates (through  wholly  owned  subsidiaries)  9,240  MW  of thermal power capacity, including a 4,620 MW plant of APMuL at Mundra in Gujarat, a 3,300 MW plant of APML at Tiroda in Maharashtra and a 1,320 MW plant of APRL at Kawai in Rajasthan. APJL, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, is developing a 1,600 MW greenfield, ultra-supercritical  power  project  in  Jharkhand  for supplying power to Bangladesh, a country witnessing base load demand growth and growing power deficit.\n\nAPL also acquired three thermal power plants with a total capacity of 3,170 MW, comprising a 1,200 MW plant of UPCL at Udupi in Karnataka, a 1,370 MW plant of REL at Raipur in Chhattisgarh and a 600 MW plant of REGL at Raigarh in Chhattisgarh.\n\nIn addition to the above, Pench Thermal Energy (MP) Ltd.  (PTEMPL),  a  wholly  owned  subsidiary  of  APL,\n\nsigned a 25-year Power Supply Agreement (PSA) with the  Madhya  Pradesh  Power  Management  Company Ltd., to be supplied from an ultra-supercritical power plant to be established in Madhya Pradesh. The Madhya Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission also adopted the tariff under the PSA, under which power supply is to commence from December, 2026.\n\nVarious power plants of APL and its subsidiaries have specific  geographic  and  competitive  characteristics, enabling  their  categorisation  as  Regulated  Utility (Udupi), Coastal (Mundra), Near-Pithead (Tiroda, Raipur, and Raigarh), and Hinterland (Kawai) segments.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAPL  operates  modern  and  efficient  fleets  with sub-  and  supercritical  technology,  with  long-term Power  Purchase  Agreements  (PPAs)  for  74%  of  its generation capacity, under Sections 62 and 63 of the Electricity  Act.

These do not extend to other entities including suppliers / joint venture / contractors / NGOs and others.\n- 2. How  many  stakeholder  complaints  have  been received  in  the  past  financial  year  and  what percentage  was  satisfactorily  resolved  by  the management?  If  so,  provide  details  thereof,  in about 50 words or so.\n\nNo stakeholder complaints pertaining to the above Codes were received in the past financial year.\n\nPrinciple  2:  Business  should  provide  goods  and services that are safe and contribute to sustainability throughout their life cycle\n\n- 1. List up to 3 of your products or services whose design has incorporated social or environmental concerns, risks and/or opportunities.\n\nThe product of the company is Electricity. In the modern world, electricity is the preferred way to deliver energy to all corners of the nation and to all segments of its society and economy. Access to reliable electric power is now considered as one of  the  basic  necessities  for  society  and  human development. Environmental concerns have been incorporated in the design and business by adopting criteria for site selection and conducting Environmental Impact Assessment. In operational phase, the Company has developed Environment Management System (EMS) with inbuilt mechanism  for  identification  of  potential  nonconformances and opportunities for improvements. The  EMS  is  ISO  14001:2015  certified.  Emissions form  all  operation  is  monitored  and  controlled as  per  design.  Occupational  health  and  safety management is integrated in business by adopting Health  and  Safety  management  system  and following  ISO  45001:20018  Occupational  Health &  Safety  Standard  as  per  international  norms. Company has also incorporated Risk Identification and management framework across all operations and corporate office.\n\n- 2.

Reduction  during  sourcing  /  production  / distribution achieved since the previous year through the value chain:\n- The  Company  has  developed  Environment Management  System  (EMS)  with  in-built mechanism  for  identification  of  potential non-  conformances  and  opportunities  for improvements.  Emissions  from  all  operations are  monitored  and  controlled  as  per  design. The  adoption  of  super-critical  technology for  thermal  power  generation  has  led  to  a decrease in the specific coal consumption, ash generation  and  water  requirement,  per  unit power generation.\n\nAll the company's operating power plants have an energy efficiency target under the Perform Achieve Trade (PAT) mechanism of Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) under the Ministry of Power, Government of India. Our better-thanPAT target performance has enabled two of our plants  to  generate  energy  saving  certificates (EScerts)  which  are  tradable  instruments, as  an  incentive  for  higher  energy  efficiency performance.\n\nAt  Adani  Power  Limited's  Mundra  thermal power plant, effluents are reused in the Flue Gas  Desulphurization  process  and  outlet  is again treated before deep-sea outfall. At other locations, system is designed for zero discharge and effluents are treated and mainly reused for fly ash evacuation and green belt development. The  EMS  is  certified  as  per  ISO  14001:2015 standard  and  there  is  a  programme  for continual  improvement  through  reduction  in resource consumption and waste generation.\n\n- ii. Reduction during usage by consumers (energy, water) achieved since the previous year?\n\nNot significant as the product is electricity.\n\n- 3.

The other information comprises the information  included  in  the  Annual  Report,  but  does not  include  the  standalone  financial  statements  and our auditor's report thereon.\n\nOur  opinion  on  the  standalone  financial  statements does  not  cover  the  other  information  and  we  do  not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the standalone financial statements,  our  responsibility  is  to  read  the  other information  and,  in  doing  so,  consider  whether  such other  information  is  materially  inconsistent  with  the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that  there  is  a  material  misstatement  of  this  other information,  we  are  required  to  report  that  fact.  We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Responsibilities  of  the  Management  for  the Standalone Financial Statements\n\nThe  Company's  Board  of  Directors  is  responsible for  the  matters  stated  in  section  134(5)  of  the  Act with  respect  to  the  preparation  of  these  standalone financial  statements  that  give  a  true  and  fair  view of the financial position, financial performance including  other  comprehensive  income,  cash  flows and changes in equity of the Company in accordance with  the  accounting  principles  generally  accepted in  India,  including  the  Indian  Accounting    Standards (Ind  AS)  specified  under  section  133  of  the  Act  read with  the  Companies  (Indian  Accounting  Standards) Rules,  2015,  as  amended.  This  responsibility  also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  the Act  for  safeguarding  of  the  assets  of  the  Company and  for  preventing  and  detecting  frauds  and  other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that  are  reasonable  and  prudent;  and  the  design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial  controls,  that  were  operating  effectively for  ensuring  the  accuracy  and  completeness  of  the accounting  records,  relevant  to  the  preparation  and presentation  of  the  standalone  financial  statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn  preparing  the  standalone  financial  statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability  to  continue  as  a  going  concern,  disclosing, as  applicable,  matters  related  to  going  concern  and using  the  going  concern  basis  of  accounting  unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or  to  cease  operations,  or  has  no  realistic  alternative but to do so.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  are  also  responsible  for overseeing the Company's financial reporting process.\n\n## Auditor's  Responsibilities  for  the  Audit  of  the Standalone Financial Statements\n\nOur  objectives  are  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance about whether the standalone financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that  includes  our  opinion.  Reasonable  assurance is  a  high  level  of  assurance,  but  is  not  a  guarantee that  an  audit  conducted  in  accordance  with  SAs  will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements  can  arise  from  fraud  or  error  and  are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they  could  reasonably  be  expected  to  influence  the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these standalone financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment  and  maintain  professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the standalone financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks,  and  obtain  audit  evidence  that  is  sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional  omissions,  misrepresentations,  or  the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to  the  audit  in  order  to  design  audit  procedures that  are  appropriate  in  the  circumstances.  Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Company has  adequate  internal  financial  controls  with reference to financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.",

If  we  conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report  to  the  related  disclosures  in  the  financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion.

We describe  these  matters  in  our  auditor's  report  unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter  or  when,  in  extremely  rare  circumstances,  we determine that a matter should not be communicated in  our  report  because  the  adverse  consequences  of doing  so  would  reasonably  be  expected  to  outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\n## Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements\n\n- 1. As  required  by  the  Companies  (Auditor's  Report) Order,  2016  (the  'Order'),  issued  by  the  Central Government of India in terms of sub-section (11) of section 143 of the Act, we give in the 'Annexure 1' a statement on the matters specified in paragraphs 3 and 4 of the Order.\n- 2.

These  responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of  its  business,  including  adherence  to  the  Company's policies,  the  safeguarding  of  its  assets,  the  prevention and  detection  of  frauds  and  errors,  the  accuracy  and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Companies Act, 2013.\n\n## Auditor's Responsibility\n\nOur  responsibility  is  to  express  an  opinion  on  the Company's  internal  financial  controls  over  financial reporting with reference to these standalone financial statements  based  on  our  audit.  We  conducted  our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the 'Guidance Note') and the Standards on Auditing as  specified  under  section  143(10)  of  the  Companies Act, 2013, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial  controls  and,  both  issued  by  the  Institute of  Chartered  Accountants  of  India.  Those  Standards and  the  Guidance  Note  require  that  we  comply  with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls over financial reporting with reference  to  these  standalone  financial  statements was established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.\n\nAn audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls  over  financial  reporting  with  reference  to these  standalone  financial  statements  and  their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls  over  financial  reporting  included  obtaining an  understanding  of  internal  financial  controls  over financial reporting with reference to these standalone financial statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgement, including the assessment of  the  risks  of  material  misstatement  of  the  financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is  sufficient  and  appropriate  to  provide  a  basis  for our  qualified  audit  opinion  on  the  internal  financial controls  over  financial  reporting  with  reference  to these standalone financial statements.\n\n## Meaning  of  Internal  Financial  Controls  Over Financial  Reporting  With  Reference  to  these Standalone Financial Statements\n\nA  company's  internal  financial  control  over  financial reporting with reference to these standalone financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted accounting  principles.  A  company's  internal  financial control over financial reporting with reference to these standalone financial statements includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of  the  company;  (2)  provide  reasonable  assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation  of  financial  statements  in  accordance with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles,  and that  receipts  and  expenditures  of  the  company  are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management  and  directors  of  the  company;  and  (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely  detection  of  unauthorised  acquisition,  use,  or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.",

Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls over financial reporting with reference to these standalone financial  statements  to  future  periods  are  subject  to the risk that the internal financial control over financial reporting with reference to these standalone financial statements  may  become  inadequate  because  of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n## Qualified Opinion\n\nAccording  to  the  information  and  explanations  given to us and based on our audit, material weakness  has been  identified  in  the  Company's  internal  financial controls over financial reporting as at March 31, 2021 as  regards  evaluation  of  uncertainty  for  realising  the carrying value of its investments / loans related to Adani Power  (Mundra)  Limited,  a  wholly  owned  subsidiary, aggregating to H 5,675.13 Crores.\n\nA 'material weakness' is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal financial control over financial reporting,  such  that  there  is  a  reasonable  possibility that a material misstatement of the company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\n\nIn  our  opinion,  except  for  the  possible  effects  of  the material weakness described above on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, the Company has  maintained,  in  all  material  respects,  adequate\n\ninternal financial controls over financial reporting with reference to these standalone financial statements and such internal financial controls over financial reporting with reference to these standalone financial statements were operating effectively as of March 31, 2021, based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note  on  Audit  of  Internal  Financial  Controls  Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.\n\n## Explanatory paragraph\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the Standards on  Auditing  issued  by  the  Institute  of  Chartered Accountants of India, as specified under Section 143(10) of the Act, the standalone financial statements of Adani Power Limited, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2021, and the related Statement of Profit and Loss including the Statement of Other Comprehensive Income, the Cash Flow Statement and the Statement of  Changes  in  Equity  for  the  year  then  ended,  and  a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information, and our report dated May 6, 2021, expressed a qualified opinion.\n\nFor S R B C & CO LLP\n\nChartered Accountants\n\nICAI Firm Registration Number : 324982E/E300003\n\nper Navin Agrawal\n\nPartner\n\nMembership Number : 056102\n\nUDIN : 21056102AAAABC7888\n\nPlace : Bengaluru\n\nDate : May 6, 2021",

All other repairs and maintenance are charged to profit  or  loss  during the  reporting  period  in  which  they  are  incurred. Subsequent  costs  are  depreciated  over  the residual life of the respective assets.

An  intangible  asset  is  derecognised  on  disposal,  or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal.\n\nGains  or  losses  arising  from  derecognition  of  an intangible  asset  are  measured  as  the  difference between  net  disposal  proceeds  and  the  carrying amount  of  the  asset  and  are  recognised  in  the statement  of  profit  and  loss  when  the  asset  is derecognised.\n\n## c Non-current assets held for sale\n\nNon-current  assets  are  classified  as  held  for  sale  if their  carrying  amount  will  be  recovered  through  a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition and the sale is highly probable. Management must be\n\ncommitted to the sale which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment and intangible are not  depreciated,  or  amortised  once  classified  as held  for  sale.  Assets  and  Liabilities  classified  as held for  sale  are  presented  separately  from  other items in the balance sheet.\n\nNon-current  assets  classified  as  held  for  sale  are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and their fair value less costs to sell.\n\n## d Financial Instruments\n\nA  Financial  Instrument  is  any  contract  that  gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity.\n\nFinancial  assets  and  financial  liabilities  are  initially measured  at  fair  value.  Transaction  costs  that  are directly  attributable  to  the  acquisition  or  issue  of financial  assets  and  financial  liabilities  (other  than financial  assets  and  financial  liabilities  at  fair  value through  profit  or  loss)  are  added  to  or  deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as  appropriate,  on  initial  recognition. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition  of  financial  assets  or  financial  liabilities at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss  are  recognised immediately in statement of profit or loss.\n\n## e Financial assets\n\n## Initial recognition and measurement\n\nAll regular way purchases or sales of financial assets are recognised and derecognised on a trade date basis  i.e.  the  date  that  the  Company  commits  to purchase or sell the assets. Regular way purchases or sales are purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within a timeframe established  by  regulation  or  convention  in  the market place.\n\n## Subsequent measurement\n\nAll  recognised  financial  assets  are  measured  in their entirety at either amortised cost or fair value, depending  on  the  classification  of  the  financial assets.\n\n## Classification of financial assets\n\n## Financial assets measured at amortised cost\n\nFinancial assets that meet the following conditions are subsequently measured at amortised cost using",

The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly  discounts  estimated  future  cash  receipts (including all fees and transaction costs and other premiums or discounts) through the expected life of  the  financial  assets,  or  where  appropriate,  a shorter period, to the net carrying amount on initial recognition.\n\nInterest is recognised on an effective interest basis for  debt  instruments  other  than  those  financial assets classified as at Fair Value through Profit and Loss (FVTPL).\n\n## Financial  assets  at  fair  value  through  other comprehensive income (FVTOCI)\n\nFinancial assets that meet the following conditions are measured initially as well as at the end of each reporting  date  at  fair  value,  recognised  in  other comprehensive income (OCI).\n\n- a) The objective of the business model is achieved both by collecting contractual cash flows and selling the financial assets, and\n- b)   The contractual terms of the asset give rise on specified  dates  to  cash  flows  that  represent solely payment of principal and interest.\n\n## Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)\n\nFinancial  assets  that  do  not  meet  the  amortised cost  criteria  or  FVTOCI  criteria  are  measured  at FVTPL.\n\nFinancial assets at FVTPL are measured at fair value at the end of each reporting period, with any gains or losses arising on remeasurement recognised in profit  or  loss.  The  net  gain  or  loss  recognised  in profit or loss incorporates any dividend or interest earned on the financial asset.\n\n## Derecognition of financial assets\n\nThe Company derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset  expire,  or  when  it  transfers  the  financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another party or when it has neither transferred nor retained substantially all  the  risks  and  rewards  of  the  asset,  but  has transferred control of the asset.\n\nOn derecognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the difference between the asset's carrying amount and  the  sum  of  the  consideration  received  and receivable and the cumulative gain or loss that had been  recognised  in  other  comprehensive  income and accumulated in equity, is recognised in profit or  loss  if  such  gain  or  loss  would  have  otherwise been recognised in profit or loss on disposal of that financial asset.\n\n## f Financial liabilities and equity instruments Classification as debt or equity\n\nDebt  and  equity  instruments  issued  by  the Company are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangements and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument.\n\n## Equity instruments\n\nAn equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting  all  of  its  liabilities.

Financial  liabilities  are classified as held for trading if these are incurred for the purpose of repurchasing in the near term.\n\nFinancial liabilities at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any gains or losses arising on remeasurement recognised  in  profit  or  loss.  The  net  gain  or  loss recognised in profit or loss incorporates any interest paid on the financial liability.\n\nFair values are determined in the manner described in note 'n'.\n\n## Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost\n\nFinancial  liabilities  that  are  not  held-for-trading and are not designated as FVTPL are measured at amortised cost at the end of subsequent accounting periods. The carrying amounts of financial liabilities that are subsequently measured at amortised cost are  determined  based  on  the  effective  interest method. Interest expense that is not capitalised as part of costs of an asset is included in the 'Finance costs' line item in statement of profit and loss.\n\nThe  effective  interest  method  is  a  method  of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments (including all fees and costs paid or received that form an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts) through the expected life of the financial liability, or (where appropriate) a shorter period, to the net carrying amount on initial recognition.\n\nTrade  and  other  payables  are  recognised  at the  transaction  cost,  which  is  its  fair  value, and  subsequently  measured  at  amortised  cost. Similarly,  interest  bearing  loans  and  borrowings are  subsequently  measured  at  amortised  cost using effective interest rate method. Trade credits include Buyer's credit, Foreign Letter of Credit and Inland Letter of Credit.\n\n## Derecognition of financial liabilities\n\nThe  Company  derecognises  financial  liabilities when,  and  only  when,  the  Company's  obligations\n\nare  discharged,  cancelled  or  have  expired.  An exchange with a lender of debt instruments with substantially  different  terms  is  accounted  for  as an extinguishment of the original financial liability and  the  recognition  of  a  new  financial  liability. Similarly,  a  substantial  modification  of  the  terms of an existing financial liability is accounted for as an extinguishment of the original financial liability and  the  recognition  of  a  new  financial  liability. The  difference  between  the  carrying  amount of  the  financial  liability  derecognised  and  the consideration  paid  and  payable  is  recognised  in profit or loss.\n\n## Financial guarantee contracts\n\nFinancial  guarantee  contracts  issued  by  the Company  are  those  contracts  that  require  a payment to be made to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because the specified debtor fails to make a payment when due in accordance with the terms  of  a  debt  instrument.  Financial  guarantee contracts  are  recognised  initially  as  a  liability at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss,  adjusted  for transaction costs that are directly attributable to the issuance of the guarantee. Subsequently, the liability  is  measured  at  the  higher  of  the  amount of  loss  allowance  determined  as  per  impairment requirements  of  Ind  AS  109  and  the  amount recognised less cumulative amortisation.\n\n## g Derivative financial instruments\n\nThe  Company  enters  into  a  variety  of  derivative financial  instruments  to  manage  its  exposure  to interest rate and foreign exchange rate risks, including foreign  exchange  forward  contracts,  interest  rate swaps,  cross  currency  swaps,  principal  only  swap and coupon only swap. Further details of derivatives financial instruments are disclosed in note 43.\n\nDerivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date the derivative contracts are entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the statement of profit or loss immediately.\n\n## Embedded derivatives\n\nDerivatives embedded  in  non-derivative  host contracts that are not financial assets within the scope of Ind AS 109 - 'Financial Instruments' are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contracts and the host contracts are not",

These embedded derivatives are  measured  at  fair  value  with  changes  in  fair value recognised in profit and loss.\n\nReassessment only occurs if there is either a change in  the  terms  of  the  contract  that  significantly modifies the cash flows that would otherwise be required  or  a  reclassification  of  a  financial  asset out of the fair value through profit or loss category.\n\n## h   Investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures\n\nInvestments  in  subsidiaries,  associates  and  joint ventures are accounted for at cost. (Also refer note 3(v)).\n\n## i Inventories\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realisable  value.  Costs  include  all  non-refundable duties  and  all  charges  incurred  in  bringing  the goods to their present location and condition. Cost is  determined  on  First  in  First  out  (FIFO)  for  coal inventory and on weighted average basis for other than coal inventory. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price for inventories less all estimated costs necessary to make the sale.\n\n## j Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash  and  cash  equivalent  in  the  balance  sheet comprise cash at banks and on hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or  less,  that  are  readily  convertible  to  a  known amount of cash and subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.\n\nFor the purpose of the statement of cash flows, cash and  cash  equivalents  consist  of  cash  and  shortterm deposits, as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts as they are considered an integral part of the company's cash management.\n\n## k Business combinations\n\nAcquisitions of business are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration transferred in a business combination is measured at fair value, which is calculated as the sum of the acquisition date  fair  values  of  the  assets  transferred  and liabilities  incurred  by  the  Company  to  the  former owners  of  the  acquiree  and  the  equity  interest issued by the Company in exchange of control of the acquiree. Acquisition related costs are added to the cost of investment.\n\nBusiness combination involving entities or businesses under common control are accounted for  using  the  pooling  of  interest  method.  Under pooling of interest method the assets and liabilities of the combining entities / business are reflected at their carrying value.\n\nPurchase  consideration  paid  in  excess  /  shortfall of the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities including  contingent  liabilities  and  contingent assets,  is  recognised  as  goodwill  /  capital  reserve respectively, except  in  case  where  different accounting  treatment  is  specified  in  the  court approved scheme.\n\nDeferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities  and  assets or liabilities related to employee benefits arrangements  are  recognised  and  measured  in accordance with Ind AS 12 - 'Income Taxes' and Ind AS 19 - 'Employee Benefits' respectively.\n\nPotential  tax  effects  of  temporary  differences and  carry  forwards  of  an  acquiree  that  exist  at the  acquisition  date  or  arise  as  a  result  of  the acquisition are accounted in accordance with Ind AS 12.\n\n## l Current versus Non-Current Classification\n\nThe  Company  presents  assets  and  liabilities  in the  balance  sheet  based  on  current/  non-current classification. An asset is treated as current when it is:\n\n- \u00b7 Expected to be realised or intended to be sold or consumed in normal operating cycle.\n- \u00b7 Held primarily for the purpose of trading.\n- \u00b7 Expected to be realised within twelve months after the reporting period, or\n- \u00b7 Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being  exchanged  or  used  to  settle  a  liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period.\n\nThe  Company  classifies  all  other  assets  as  noncurrent.\n\nA liability is current when:\n\n- \u00b7 It is expected to be settled in normal operating cycle.\n- \u00b7 It is held primarily for the purpose of trading.\n- \u00b7 It  is  due  to  be  settled  within  twelve  months after the reporting period, or",

At the end of each reporting period, monetary items denominated  in  foreign  currencies  are  retranslated at  the  rates  prevailing  at  that  date.  Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.\n\nExchange  differences  on  monetary  items  are recognised  in  profit  and  loss  in  the  period  in which they arise except for exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings relating to assets under construction for future productive use, which are included in the cost of those assets when they are regarded as an adjustment to interest costs on those foreign currency borrowings.\n\nThe  Company has elected to  continue  the  policy adopted for  accounting  for  exchange  differences arising from  translation  of  long-term  foreign currency monetary items outstanding and recognised  in  the  financial  statements  for  the period  ending  immediately  before  the  beginning of the first Ind AS financial reporting period i.e. 31 st March, 2016 as per the previous GAAP.\n\n## n Fair value measurement\n\nThe Company measures financial instruments, such as, derivatives at fair value at each balance sheet date.\n\nFair  value  is  the  price  that  would  be  received  to sell  an  asset  or  paid  to  transfer  a  liability  in  an orderly  transaction  between  market  participants at  the  measurement  date,  regardless  of  whether that price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation technique. In estimating the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Company takes into  account  the  characteristics  of  the  asset  or liability  at  the  measurement  date.  The  fair  value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the financial asset or settle the financial liability takes place either:\n\n- \u00b7 In the principal market, or\n- \u00b7 In  the  absence  of  a  principal  market,  in  the most  advantageous  market  for  the  asset  or liability.\n\nThe  principal  or  the  most  advantageous  market must be accessible by the Company.\n\nThe fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using  the  assumptions  that  market  participants would  use  when  pricing  the  asset  or  liability, assuming  that  market  participants  act  in  their economic best interest.\n\nThe  Company's  management  determines  the policies and procedures for both recurring fair value measurement, such as derivative instruments and unquoted financial assets measured at fair value.\n\nA fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant's ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use.\n\nAll  assets  and  liabilities  for  which  fair  value  is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as  follows,  based  on  the  lowest  level  input  that  is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:\n\n- \u00b7  Level  1  Quoted  (unadjusted)  market  prices  in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n- \u00b7  Level  2  Valuation  techniques  for  which  the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable.\n- \u00b7  Level  3  Valuation  techniques  for  which  the lowest  level  input  that  is  significant  to  the  fair value measurement is unobservable.",

Where the rentals are structured solely to increase in line with expected general inflation to compensate for the Company's expected inflationary cost increases, such increases are recognised in the year in which such benefits accrue. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\n## The Company as lessee\n\nThe  Company  recognised  right-of-use  assets  and lease liabilities for all leases except for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets. The Company recorded the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments discounted at the incremental borrowing rate at the date of initial application and right of use asset at an amount equal to the lease liability  adjusted  for  any  prepayments/accruals recognised in the balance sheet.\n\nThe  Company also  applied  the  available  practical expedients wherein it:\n\n- \u00b7 Used  a  single  discount  rate  to  a  portfolio  of leases with reasonably similar characteristics.\n- \u00b7 Relied on its assessment of whether leases are onerous immediately before the date of initial application.\n- \u00b7 Applied  the  short-term  leases  exemptions to leases with lease term that ends within 12 months at the date of initial application.\n- \u00b7 Excluded  the  initial  direct  costs  from  the measurement of the right-of-use asset at the date of initial application.\n- \u00b7 Used hindsight in determining the lease term where the contract contains options to extend or terminate the lease.\n\n## u Taxes on Income\n\nTax on Income comprises current tax and deferred tax.  These  are  recognised  in  statement  of  profit and loss except to the extent that it relates to a business combination, or items recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income.\n\n## Current tax\n\nTax  including  Minimum  Alternative  Tax('MAT')  on income for the current period is determined on the basis of estimated taxable income and tax credits computed  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of\n\nthe relevant tax laws and based on the expected outcome of assessments / appeals. Current income tax  assets  and  liabilities  are  measured  at  the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used  to  compute  the  amount  are  those  that  are enacted or substantially enacted, at the reporting date. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation  and  establishes  provisions  where appropriate.\n\nCurrent  income  tax  relating  to  items  recognised outside  profit  or  loss  is  recognised  outside  profit or  loss  (either  in  other  comprehensive  income or  in  equity).  Current  tax  items  are  recognised  in correlation to the underlying transaction either in OCI or directly in equity. Management periodically evaluates  positions  taken  in  the  tax  returns  with respect  to  situations  in  which  applicable  tax regulations  are  subject  to  interpretation  and establishes provisions where appropriate.\n\n## Deferred tax\n\nDeferred  tax  is  recognised  for  the  future  tax consequences of deductible temporary differences between the carrying values of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases at the reporting date. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all  taxable  temporary  differences  except  when the  deferred  tax  liability  arises  at  the  time  of transaction  that  affects  neither  the  accounting profit or loss nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred tax assets  are  generally  recognised  for  all  deductible temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax credits  and  any  unused  tax  losses,  to  the  extent that it is probable that future taxable income will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and carry forward of unused tax credit and  unused  tax  losses  can  be  utilised,  except when the deferred tax asset relating to temporary differences arising at the time of transaction that affects neither the accounting profit or loss nor the taxable profit or loss. Deferred tax relating to items recognised  outside  the  statement  of  profit  and loss is recognised outside the statement of profit and loss, either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that  sufficient  taxable  profit  will  be  available  to",

Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and are recognised to  the  extent  that  it  has  become  probable  that future  taxable  profits  will  allow  the  deferred  tax assets to be recovered.\n\nDeferred  tax  liabilities  and  assets  are  measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the liability is settled or the asset realised, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the end of the reporting period.\n\nThe  Company  offsets  deferred  tax  assets  and deferred tax liabilities if and only if it has a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets and current  tax  liabilities  and  the  deferred  tax  assets and deferred tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on the same taxable entity which intend either to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis, or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously, in each future period in which significant amounts of deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected to be settled or recovered.\n\n## v Earnings per share\n\nBasic earnings per share is computed by dividing the profit / (loss) after tax (net off distribution on Unsecured Perpetual Securities whether declared or not) by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding  during  the  year.  Diluted earnings  per  share  is  computed  by  dividing  the profit / (loss) after tax as adjusted for the effects of dividend, interest and other charges relating to the  dilutive  potential  equity  shares  by  weighted average  number  of  shares  plus  dilutive  potential equity shares.\n\n## w   Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets\n\nProvisions are recognised when the Company has a  present  obligation  (legal  or  constructive)  as  a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of  resources  embodying  economic  benefits  will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate  can  be  made  of  the  amount  of  the obligation.  The  amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the end of the\n\nreporting  period,  taking  into  account  the  risks and  uncertainties  surrounding  the  obligation.  If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions  are  discounted  using  a  current  pretax rate that reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.\n\nContingent  liabilities  may  arise  from  litigation, taxation  and  other  claims  against  the  Company. Where  it is management's  assessment  that the  outcome  is  uncertain  or  cannot  be  reliably quantified, the claims are disclosed as contingent liabilities  unless  the  likelihood  of  an  adverse outcome is remote.\n\nContingent  assets  are  not  recognised  but  are disclosed in the notes where an inflow of economic benefits is probable.\n\n## x Impairment\n\n## i) Impairment of tangible and intangible assets\n\nAt  the  end  of  each  reporting  period,  the Company reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible  and  intangible  assets  to  determine whether  there  is  any  indication  that  those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). When it  is  not  possible  to  estimate  the  recoverable amount  of  an  individual  asset,  the  Company estimates the recoverable amount of the cashgenerating  unit  to  which  the  asset  belongs. When  a  reasonable  and  consistent  basis  of allocation  can  be  identified,  corporate  assets are also allocated to individual cash-generating units,  or  otherwise  they  are  allocated  to  the smallest  group  of  cash-generating  units  for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identified.\n\nRecoverable amount is the higher of fair value less  costs  of  disposal  and  value  in  use.  In assessing  value  in  use,  the  estimated  future cash  flows  are  discounted  to  their  present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current  market  assessments  of  the  time  value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements\n\nfor the year ended 31 st March, 2021\n\nThe Company bases its impairment calculation on detailed  budget  and  forecast  calculations, which  are  prepared  separately  for  each  of the Company's cash-generating unit to which the individual assets are allocated. For longer periods, a long term growth rate is calculated and  applied  to  project  future  cash  flows.  To estimate cash flow projections beyond periods covered by the most recent budget / forecasts, the Company estimates cash flow projections based on estimated growth rate.\n\nIf the recoverable amount of an asset (or cashgenerating  unit)  is  estimated  to  be  less  than its  carrying  amount,  the  carrying  amount  of the  asset  (or  cash-generating  unit)  is  reduced to  its  recoverable  amount.  An  impairment  loss is  recognised  immediately  in  the  statement  of profit or loss.\n\nWhen an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or a  cash-generating  unit)  is  increased  to  the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, so that  the  increased  carrying  amount  does  not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised  for  the  asset  (or  cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in statement of profit or loss.\n\n## ii) Impairment of Financial assets\n\nThe  Company  applies  the  expected  credit loss model for recognising impairment loss on financial  assets  measured  at  amortised  cost, trade receivables and other contractual rights to receive cash or other financial asset.\n\nExpected credit loss is the difference between all  contractual cash flows that are due to the Company in accordance with the contract and all  the  cash  flows  that  the  Company  expects to  receive  (i.e.  all  cash  shortfalls),  discounted at  the  original  effective  interest  rate.  The Company estimates cash flows by considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument through  the  expected  life  of  that  financial instrument.\n\nThe Company measures the loss allowance for a  financial  instrument  at  an  amount  equal  to the lifetime expected credit losses if the credit\n\nrisk on that financial instrument has increased significantly  since  initial  recognition.  If  the credit  risk  on  a  financial  instrument  has  not increased significantly since initial recognition, the Company measures the loss allowance for that financial instrument at an amount equal to 12-month expected credit losses.\n\n## 3 Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions\n\nThe  preparation  of  the  Company's  financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities,  and  the  accompanying  disclosures, and  the  disclosure  of  contingent  liabilities.  The estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to  be  relevant.  The  estimates  and  underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and any revisions thereto are recognised in the period of revision and future periods if the revision affects both the current and future periods. Uncertainties about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities affected in future periods.\n\n## Key sources of estimation uncertainty:\n\nThe  key  assumptions  concerning  the  future  and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date, that have a significant risk of causing a  material  adjustment  to  the  carrying  amounts of  assets  and  liabilities  within  the  next  financial year,  are  described  below.  Existing  circumstances and assumptions about future developments may change due to market changes or circumstances arising that are beyond the control of the Company. Such  changes  are  reflected  in  the  assumptions when they occur.\n\n## i) Useful lives of property, plant and equipment\n\nIn case of the power plant assets, where the life of  the  assets  has  been  estimated at 25 years based  on  technical  assessment,  taking  into account the nature of the assets, the estimated usage of the asset, the operating condition of the asset, anticipated technological changes, manufacturer  warranties  and  maintenance support, depreciation on the same is provided",

Where such Level 1 inputs are not available, the Company establishes appropriate valuation techniques and inputs to the model. The inputs to  these  models  are  taken  from  observable markets  where  possible,  but  where  this  is  not feasible,  a  degree  of  judgement  is  required  in establishing  fair  values.  Judgements  include considerations  of  inputs  such  as  liquidity  risk, credit risk and volatility. Changes in assumptions about  these  factors  could  affect  the  reported fair  value  of  financial  instruments.  Information about the valuation techniques and inputs used in determining the fair value of various assets and liabilities are disclosed in Note 47.\n\n## iii)   Defined benefit plans (gratuity benefits)\n\nThe cost of  the  defined  benefit  gratuity  plan and the present value of the gratuity obligation are  determined using actuarial valuations. An actuarial  valuation  involves  making  various assumptions  that  may  differ  from  actual developments  in  the  future.  These  include the determination of the discount rate, future salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the complexities involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, a defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes  in  these assumptions.  All  assumptions  are  reviewed at  each  reporting  date.  Information  about the  various  estimates  and  assumptions  made in  determining  the  present  value  of  defined benefit obligations are disclosed in note 50.\n\n## Iv)  Impairment\n\nDetermining  whether  property,  plant  and equipment are impaired requires an estimation of  the  value  in  use  of  the  relevant  cash generating units. The value in use calculation is based on a Discounted Cash Flow model over the estimated useful life of the Power Plants. Further, the cash flow projections are based on estimates  and  assumptions  relating  to  tariff, operational  performance  of  the  Plants,  life extension plans, market prices of coal and other fuels,  exchange  variations,  inflation,  terminal value etc. which are considered reasonable by the Management. (Refer note 40).\n\n## v) Investments  made  /  Intercorporate  deposits (''ICDs'') given to subsidiaries\n\nIn case of investments made and Intercorporate Deposits  ('ICD')  given  by  the  company  in its subsidiaries,  the  Management  assesses whether there is any indication of impairment in the value of investments and ICDs. The carrying amount is compared with the present value of future net cash flow of the subsidiaries. (Refer note 39 and 42).\n\n## vi)  Taxes\n\nSignificant management judgement is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing  and  the  level  of  future  taxable  profits together  with  future  tax  planning  strategies, including  estimates  of  temporary  differences reversing  on  account  of  available  benefits under  the  Income  Tax  Act,  1961.  Deferred tax  assets  is  recognised  to  the  extent  of  the corresponding deferred tax liability. (Also refer note 23).",

APMuL continues to supply power to GUVNL and Haryana Discoms, pending resolution of certain matters under dispute and the management is reasonably confident of realizing all the receivables. The management expects that APMuL will  sustain  its  operational  performance from sale of power to GUVNL, Haryana Discoms and on merchant basis along with expected significant compensation tariff on cancellation of Bid 2 PPA/ SPPA with GUVNL as detailed below based on the SC order.\n\nAPMuL's power purchase agreement of 1000 MW and SPPA of 234 MW (under Bid 2) with GUVNL got terminated vide order dated 2 nd July, 2019 of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India ('SC') in the matter of civil appeal dated 8 th November, 2011 with retrospective effect from respective date of PPAs . The SC has allowed APMuL to claim compensatory tariff towards cancellation of PPA since January 2010, in accordance with section 62 of the Electricity Act, 2003 and the CERC (Terms and Conditions of Tariff) Regulation 2009. APMuL has filed the petition on 2 nd September, 2019 with CERC for determination of compensatory tariff. The proceedings in the matter, are in progress and the compensation claim is not yet decided by the CERC. As at reporting date, APMuL and GUVNL have both filed petitions with CERC to settle claims and contractual arrangement in terms of Bid 1 and Bid 2 PPAs pursuant to the SC Order dated 2 nd July, 2019. APMuL has not recognised any compensatory tariff in the books as at reporting date, pending settlement of the matter with GUVNL.\n\nThe management has also made long term assessment of recoverable amount of APMuL's power generation assets that has factored better operational parameters such as coal prices, borrowing cost, power tariff, leading to better operational and financial performance of APMuL. The management believes that over foreseeable future, APMuL would be able to establish profitable operations and meet its liabilities as and when they fall due and hence, no provision / adjustment is considered necessary to the carrying value of the said investments / loans (including accrued interest) aggregating to H 5,675.13 Crores as at 31 st March, 2021.\n\n- 40 The Company has determined the recoverable amounts of the Power Plants over its useful life under Ind AS 36, Impairment of Assets based on the estimates relating to tariff, operational performance of the Plants, life extension plans, inflation, terminal value etc. which are considered reasonable by the Management.\n- On a careful evaluation of the aforesaid factors, the Management of the Company has concluded that the recoverable values of the Power Plants is higher than their carrying amounts as at 31 st March, 2021. However, if  these estimates and assumptions were to change in future, there could be corresponding impact on the recoverable amounts of the Plants.\n- 41 Due to ongoing impact of COVID-19 globally and in India, the Company has assessed likely adverse impact on economic environment in general and financial risks on account of COVID-19. The Company and its subsidiaries (the 'Group') are in the business of generation of electricity which is an essential service as emphasised by the Ministry of Power, Government of India. The demand for power is continuously increasing with increase in economic activities in the Country, although demand may get impacted in short term due to lock downs in",

On long term basis, the Group does not anticipate any major challenge in operating the Group's power plants at various locations and meeting its financial obligations. Basis above, the management has estimated its future cash flows for the Group which indicates no major impact in the operational and financial performance of the Group. The management will continuously monitor the performance of the Group and take appropriate remedial measures as needed to respond to the Covid related risks, if any.\n\n- 42 As at 31 st March, 2021, the Company is carrying equity investment of H 4,205.92 Crores, Unsecured Perpetual Securities of H 750.00 Crores relating to its wholly owned subsidiary APML, equity investment of H 1,200 Crores and Unsecured Perpetual Securities of H 2,200 Crores relating to its wholly owned subsidiary APRL, equity investment of H 353.34 Crores and outstanding loans of H 2,047.77 Crores relating to its wholly owned subsidiary REGL and equity investment of H 53.19 Crores and outstanding loans of H 1,129.62 Crores relating to its wholly owned subsidiary REL.\n\nAPML and APRL own and operate 3300 MW and 1320 MW coal based power plants respectively with major capacities tied up under power purchase agreements ('PPAs') for twenty five years with substantially fixed tariffs. The PPAs for these plants were made based on the commitments / understanding that domestic coal linkages would be available to meet the fuel requirements. However, adequate coal linkages could not be made available due to various reasons, including government policies, not attributable to the respective subsidiary companies. In response to the pleas to various regulatory authorities for compensating the losses due to above and orders passed thereof, the respective state electricity regulators have granted part relief on account of Change in Law. The Company's management believes that APML and APRL, based on availability of linkage coal shall continue to supply power under the Long Term PPAs and will be eligible for relief on account of Change in Law / Force Majeure to compensate the operating losses for shortage of domestic coal. The SC in its order has upheld the APTEL's order wherein directions were issued to Rajasthan Discoms to verify the claim documents submitted by APRL and make additional payments in terms of the judgement and order. The review petition filed by Rajasthan Discoms in the matter with the Hon'ble Supreme Court was rejected on 2 nd March, 2021. Considering that, Rajasthan Discoms are yet to verify the claim documents submitted by APRL for  the  quantification  of  the  final  amount  of  tariff  compensation,  APRL  has  not  recognised  any  additional tariff  compensation revenue, pending ascertainment of tariff compensation amount by Rajasthan Discoms, post verification of the claim and supporting documents submitted by APRL. As at reporting date, APRL has filed contempt petition with the Hon'ble Supreme Court against Rajasthan Discoms for non-compliance with the Hon'ble Supreme Court order dated 31 st August, 2020. As per the assessment by the Management, It is expected that equivalent amounts as recognised by APRL up to 31 st March, 2021 will be ultimately recovered. Having regard to above and the expectation that similar relief will continue to be available till existence of the aforesaid circumstances, the Management of the Company has concluded that no provision for impairment is considered necessary at this stage.\n\nIn addition to this, REL and REGL which were acquired during the previous year owns and operates 1370 MW and 600 MW coal based power plants respectively. These Companies sell the power generated mainly on Short term PPA and merchant basis and management expects that these companies would be able to generate adequate cash flows from future operations to meet its financial commitment.\n\n## 43 The Company has not taken any derivatives to hedge its foreign currency exposures.\n\nThe details of foreign currency exposures not hedged by derivative instruments are as under:\n\n-\n\n|    |                                  | As at 31 st  March, 2021   | As at 31 st  March, 2021          | As at 31 st  March, 2020   | As at 31 st  March, 2020          |\n|----|----------------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n|    |                                  | Amount                     | Foreign   Currency   (in Million) | Amount                     | Foreign   Currency   (in Million) |\n| 1. | Other Receivable                 | (3.36)                     | USD (0.46)                        | -                          |                                   |\n| 2. | Import Creditors and Acceptances | -                          | -                                 | 527.58                     | USD 69.73                         |\n| 3. | Loans under letters of credit    | -                          | -                                 | 0.06                       | EURO 0.01                         |\n|    |                                  | (3.36)                     |                                   | 527.64                     |                                   |\n\n21",

The Management ensures appropriate risk governance framework for the Company through appropriate policies and procedures and  the  risks  are  identified,  measured  and  managed  in  accordance  with  the  Company's  policies  and  risk objectives.\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company is exposed to Market risk, Credit risk and Liquidity risk.\n\n## (i) Market risk\n\nMarket risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Market risk comprises three types of risk: interest rate risk, foreign currency risk and commodity price risk.\n\n## a) Interest rate risk\n\nInterest  rate  risk  is  the  risk  that  the  fair  value  or  future  cash  flows  of  a  financial  instrument  will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Company's exposure to the risk of changes in  market  interest  rates  relates  primarily  to  the  part  of  Company's  long-term  debt  obligations  with floating interest rates.\n\nThe Company manages its interest rate risk by having a mixed portfolio of fixed and variable rate loans and borrowings.\n\nThe sensitivity analysis have been carried out based on the exposure to interest rates for instruments not hedged against interest rate fluctuation at the end of the reporting period. The said analysis has been carried out on the amount of floating rate long term liabilities outstanding at the end of the reporting period.\n\nThe year end balances are not necessarily representative of the average debt outstanding during the year. A 50 basis point increase or decrease represents management's assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest rates.\n\nIn case of fluctuation in interest rates by 50 basis points on the exposure on long term borrowings (having fluctuating rate) of H 124.29 Crores as on 31 st March, 2021 (Previous year H 191.21 Crores) and if all other variables were held constant, the Company's profit or loss for the year would increase or decrease as follows:\n\n|                                       |   For the year ended   31 st  March, 2021 |   For the year ended   31 st  March, 2020 |\n|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| Impact on Profit or Loss for the year |                                      0.62 |                                      0.96 |\n\n## b)   Foreign currency risk\n\nForeign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of an exposure will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates. The Company's exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates relates primarily to the Company's operating activities. The Company manages its foreign currency risk by hedging transactions that are expected to realise in future. The Company manages its foreign currency risk by entering into derivative contracts for converting H loan into other foreign currency for taking advantage of lower cost of borrowing in stable currency environment. The Company also enters into various foreign exchange contracts to mitigate the risk arising out of foreign exchange rate movement on foreign currency borrowings and trade payables.",

The Company's objective is to provide financial resources to meet its business objectives in a timely, cost effective and reliable manner and to manage its capital structure.

Asset Liability Matching Strategies\n\nThe Company has funded benefit plan and has purchased insurance policy, which is basically a year-on-year cash accumulation plan in which the interest rate is declared on yearly basis and is guaranteed for a period of one year.  The insurance company, as part of the policy rules, makes payment of all gratuity outgoes happening during the year (subject to sufficiency of funds under the policy).    The  policy,  thus,  mitigates  the  liquidity  risk.    However,  being  a  cash  accumulation plan, the duration of assets is shorter compared to the duration of liabilities.  Thus, the Company is exposed to movement in interest rate (in particular, the significant fall in interest rates,  which should result in a increase in liability without corresponding increase in the asset).\n\n## x.

The  invoices  for change in law claims are raised considering operational /  cost  parameters  based  on  qualitative  parameters approved in the relevant Regulatory Authorities Orders and are subject to final acceptance of the claims by the respective Discoms. Considering that the methodology and the parameters are subject to final acceptance by the respective Discoms, the revenue is recognised in the books of account based on the prudent parameters and methodology, till the respective matters are  accepted / settled with the Discoms.\n\nThus,  the  receivables  from  Discoms  are  subject  to adjustments to the extent there may be adverse impact on account of appeals with the regulatory authorities.\n\nIn  certain cases where the regulatory order is subject matter  of  appeal  with  higher  appellate  forums  / authorities, and the amount of claim is not ascertainable, revenues for change in law claims are not recognised, pending outcome of the final decision.\n\nIn  view  of  the  complexity  and  judgement  involved in  estimation  of  the  amounts  of  such  claims  and recoverability thereof, the same is considered as a key audit matter.\n\nOur audit procedures in response to this key audit matter included, but not limited to, the following:\n\n- -Obtained  understanding  of  the  key  controls  that management has in place to monitor change in law events and related claims, status of various pending claims including under appeals and orders passed by various regulatory authorities.\n- -Inspected the relevant state regulatory commission, CERC,  appellate  tribunal  and  court  rulings  and examined  management  assumptions  /  judgement relating to various parameters in terms of regulatory orders, for measuring / estimating the amount of such claims.\n- -Examined the underlying parameters and assumptions /  judgement  used  for  measuring  /  computing  the amounts  of  compensation  claims  as  per  regulatory orders  through  verification  of  historical  information and other available internal and external data.\n- -Tested on sample basis, the accuracy of the underlying data used for computation of such claims.\n- -Tested the joint reconciliations for trade receivables performed by the Group with the Discoms, wherever available with underlying records.\n- -Tested  the  status  of  the  outstanding  receivables and recoverability of the overdue / aged receivables through  inquiry  with  management,  and  collection trends in respect of receivables.",

This is a key audit matter as the testing of impairment of carrying value of PPE is complex and involves significant judgement.\n\nThe  key  assumptions  involved  in  impairment  test are  projected  revenue  growth,  operating  margins, estimated life of PPE, discount rates and terminal value and expected amount of compensation to be realised from termination of Bid 2 Power Purchase Agreement entered with Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Limited.\n\n## Information Other than the Financial Statements and Auditor's Report Thereon\n\nThe Holding Company's Board of Directors is responsible for  the  other  information.  The  other  information comprises  the  information  included  in  the  Annual Report, but does not include the consolidated financial statements and our auditor's report thereon.\n\nOur opinion on the consolidated financial statements does  not  cover  the  other  information  and  we  do  not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn  connection  with  our  audit  of  the  consolidated financial  statements,  our  responsibility  is  to  read  the other  information  and,  in  doing  so,  consider  whether such  other  information  is  materially  inconsistent  with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other  information,  we  are  required  to  report  that  fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Responsibilities of Management for the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nThe Holding Company's Board of Directors is responsible  for  the  preparation  and  presentation  of these consolidated financial statements in terms of the requirements of the Act that give a true and fair view of  the  consolidated  financial  position,  consolidated financial  performance including other comprehensive income,  consolidated  cash  flows  and  consolidated\n\n- -We discussed potential changes in key drivers with management  in  order  to  evaluate  the  suitability of  inputs  and  assumptions  used  in  the  cash  flow forecasts  and  performed  sensitivity  analysis  around the key assumptions used by management.\n- -Read the relevant order of the Supreme Court of India in respect of termination of Bid 2 PPA with retrospective effect  and  inquired  with  the  management  for expected recovery of claim determined in accordance with section 62 of the Electricity Act, 2003 and CERC (Terms and Conditions of Tariff)  Regulations,  2009, which is pending with the CERC.\n- -Assessed  the  disclosures  in  accordance  with  the requirements of Ind AS 36 'Impairment of Assets'.\n\nstatement  of  changes  in  equity  of  the  Group  in accordance  with  the  accounting  principles  generally accepted  in  India,  including  the  Indian  Accounting Standards  (Ind  AS)  specified  under  section  133  of the  Act  read  with  the  Companies  (Indian  Accounting Standards)  Rules,  2015,  as  amended.

Reasonable assurance is  a  high  level  of  assurance,  but  is  not  a  guarantee that  an  audit  conducted  in  accordance  with  SAs  will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements  can  arise  from  fraud  or  error  and  are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they  could  reasonably  be  expected  to  influence  the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment  and  maintain  professional skepticism throughout the audit.

The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional  omissions,  misrepresentations,  or  the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to  the  audit  in  order  to  design  audit  procedures that  are  appropriate  in  the  circumstances.  Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Holding Company has adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made  by management.\n- \u00b7 Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based  on  the  audit  evidence  obtained,  whether a  material  uncertainty  exists  related  to  events  or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the\n\nability of the Group to continue as a going concern. If  we  conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial  statements  or,  if  such  disclosures  are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or  conditions  may  cause  the  Group  to  cease  to continue as a going concern.\n\n- \u00b7 Evaluate  the  overall  presentation,  structure  and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether  the consolidated  financial  statements  represent  the underlying  transactions  and  events  in  a  manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- \u00b7 Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or  business  activities  within  the  Group  of  which we  are  the  independent  auditors,  to  express  an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We  are  responsible  for  the  direction,  supervision and  performance  of  the  audit  of  the  financial statements  of  such  entities  included  in  the consolidated financial statements of which we are the  independent  auditors.  For  the  other  entities included in the consolidated financial statements, which have been audited by other auditors, such other auditors remain responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audits carried out by them. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance of  the  Holding  Company  and  such  other  entities included  in  the  consolidated  financial  statements of  which  we  are  the  independent  auditors  regarding, among  other  matters,  the  planned  scope  and  timing of  the  audit  and  significant  audit  findings,  including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a  statement  that  we  have  complied  with  relevant ethical  requirements  regarding  independence,  and  to communicate  with  them  all  relationships  and  other matters  that  may  reasonably  be  thought  to  bear  on our  independence,  and  where  applicable,  related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of  most  significance  in  the  audit  of  the  consolidated financial statements for the financial year ended March 31,  2021  and  are  therefore  the  key  audit  matters.

These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of  its  business,  including  adherence  to  the  respective company's  policies,  the  safeguarding  of  its  assets, the  prevention  and  detection  of  frauds  and  errors, the  accuracy  and  completeness  of  the  accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Act.\n\n## Auditor's Responsibility\n\nOur  responsibility  is  to  express  an  opinion  on  the company's  internal  financial  controls  over  financial reporting with reference to these consolidated financial statements  based  on  our  audit.  We  conducted  our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the 'Guidance Note') and the Standards on Auditing, both,  issued  by  Institute  of  Chartered  Accountants of  India,  and  deemed  to  be  prescribed  under  section 143(10)  of  the  Act,  to  the  extent  applicable  to  an audit  of  internal  financial  controls.  Those  Standards and  the  Guidance  Note  require  that  we  comply  with\n\nethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls over financial reporting with reference  to  these  consolidated  financial  statements was established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.\n\nOur  audit  involves  performing  procedures  to  obtain audit  evidence  about  the  adequacy  of  the  internal financial controls over financial reporting with reference to  these  consolidated  financial  statements  and  their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls  over  financial  reporting  included  obtaining an  understanding  of  internal  financial  controls  over financial reporting with reference to these consolidated financial statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgement, including the assessment of  the  risks  of  material  misstatement  of  the  financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and the audit evidence obtained by the other auditors in terms of their reports referred to in the Other Matters paragraph below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the internal financial controls  over  financial  reporting  with  reference  to these consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Meaning  of  Internal  Financial  Controls  Over Financial  Reporting  With  Reference  to  these Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nA  company's  internal  financial  control  over  financial reporting with reference to these consolidated financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable  assurance  regarding  the  reliability  of financial  reporting  and  the  preparation  of  financial statements for external  purposes  in  accordance  with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal financial control over financial reporting with reference  to  these  consolidated  financial  statements includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to  the  maintenance  of  records  that,  in  reasonable detail,  accurately  and  fairly  reflect  the  transactions and  dispositions  of  the  assets  of  the  company;  (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions",

Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls  over  financial  reporting  with  reference  to these  consolidated  financial  statements  to  future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control  over  financial  reporting  with  reference  to these consolidated financial statements may become inadequate  because  of  changes  in  conditions,  or that  the  degree  of  compliance  with  the  policies  or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n## Opinion\n\nIn  our  opinion,  the  Holding  Company,  its  subsidiary companies, which are companies incorporated in India, have,  maintained  in  all  material  respects,  adequate internal financial controls over financial reporting with\n\nreference  to  these  consolidated  financial  statements and  such  internal  financial  controls  over  financial reporting with reference to these consolidated financial  statements  were  operating  effectively  as at March 31, 2021, based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Holding Company  considering  the  essential  components  of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued  by  the  Institute  of  Chartered  Accountants  of India.\n\n## Other Matters\n\nOur  report  under  Section  143(3)(i)  of  the  Act  on  the adequacy and operating effectiveness of the internal financial controls over financial reporting with reference to  these  consolidated  financial  statements  of  the Holding Company, insofar as it relates to  six subsidiary companies, which are companies incorporated in India, is based on the corresponding reports of the auditors of such subsidiary companies, incorporated in India.\n\nFor S R B C & CO LLP\n\nChartered Accountants\n\nICAI Firm Registration Number: 324982E/E300003\n\nper Navin Agrawal Partner Membership Number: 056102 UDIN: 21056102AAAABD5482\n\nPlace: Bengaluru\n\nDate: May 6, 2021",

G. Highway, Khodiyar, Ahmedabad-382421,  Gujarat,  India.  Its  shares  are listed on two recognised stock exchanges in India.\n\nThe  Company,  together  with  its  subsidiaries, currently  has  multiple  power  projects  located  at various  locations  with  a  combined  installed  and commissioned capacity of 12,450 MW.

Information on the Group's structure is provided in Note 40.\n\nAs  at  31 st March,  2021,  S.  B.  Adani  Family  Trust ('SBAFT')  together  with  entities  controlled  by  it, has the ability to control the Group. The Group gets synergetic benefit of the integrated value chain of Adani group.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements were approved for issue in accordance with a resolution of the directors on 6 th May, 2021.\n\n## 2 Significant accounting policies\n\n## 2.1  Basis of preparation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Group have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  Indian Accounting  Standards  (Ind  AS)  notified  under the  Companies  (Indian  Accounting  Standards) Rules,  2015  (as  amended)  read  with  section 133  of  Companies  Act,  2013  and  presentation requirements  of  Division  II  of  schedule  III  to  the Companies Act, 2013 (as amended), on the historical cost basis except for certain financial instruments that are measured at fair values, as explained in the accounting policies below.\n\nThe Group's consolidated financial statements are presented in H , which is also the parent company's functional  currency.  and  all  values  are  rounded to  the  nearest  Crores,  except  when  otherwise indicated.\n\n## 2.2  Basis of consolidation\n\n## a Subsidiaries\n\nThe consolidated financial statements incorporate the  financial  statements  of  the  Company  and  its subsidiaries, being the entities controlled by it as at 31 st March, 2021. Control is achieved when the Company:\n\n- \u00b7 has power over the investee;\n- \u00b7 is  exposed,  or  has  rights,  to  variable  returns from its involvement with the investee; and\n- \u00b7 has  the  ability  to  use  its  power  to  affect  its returns.\n\nThe Company reassesses whether or not it controls an  investee  if  facts  and  circumstances  indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control listed above.\n\nWhen the Company has less than a majority of the voting rights of an investee, it has power over the investee when the voting rights are sufficient to give it the practical ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee unilaterally. The Company considers all  relevant  facts  and  circumstances  in  assessing whether  or  not  the  Company's  voting  rights  in  an investee are sufficient to give it power, including:\n\n- \u00b7 the  size  of  the  Company's  holding  of  voting rights  relative  to  the  size  and  dispersion  of holdings of the other vote holders;\n- \u00b7 potential  voting  rights  held  by  the  Company, other vote holders or other parties;\n- \u00b7 rights arising from other contractual arrangements; and\n- \u00b7 The  contractual  arrangement  with  the  other vote holders of the investee.\n\nConsolidation  of  a  subsidiary  begins  when  the Company obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases  when  the  Company  loses  control  of  the subsidiary. Specifically, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated statement of profit and loss from the date the Company gains control until the date when the Company ceases to control the subsidiary.\n\nProfit  or  loss  and  each  component  of  other comprehensive income or loss are attributed to the\n\n20\n\n21",

Total  comprehensive  income  or  loss of  subsidiaries  is  attributed  to  the  owners  of  the Company and to the non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.\n\nConsolidated  financial  statements  are  prepared using uniform accounting policies for like transactions and other events in similar circumstances.  If  a  member  of  the  Group  uses accounting  policies  other  than  those  adopted in  the  consolidated  financial  statements  for  like transactions  and  events  in  similar  circumstances, appropriate  adjustments  are  made  to  that  Group member's  financial  statements  in  preparing  the consolidated financial statements to ensure conformity with the Group's accounting policies.\n\nThe  financial  statements  of  all  entities  used  for the purpose of consolidation are drawn up to same reporting date as that of the parent company, i.e., year ended on 31 March.\n\nAll intragroup assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions between members of the Group are eliminated in full on consolidation.\n\n## Changes  in  the  Group's  ownership  interests  in existing subsidiaries\n\nChanges  in  the  Group's  ownership  interests  in subsidiaries that do not result in the Group's losing control over the subsidiaries are accounted for as equity  transactions.  The  carrying  amounts  of  the Group's interests and the non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiaries. Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to owners of the Company.\n\nWhen the Group loses control of a subsidiary, a gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss and is calculated as  the  difference  between  (i)  the  aggregate  of the  fair  value  of  the  consideration  received  and the fair value of any retained interest and (ii) the previous carrying amount of the assets (including goodwill), and liabilities of the subsidiary and any non-controlling  interests.  All  amounts  previously recognised  in  other  comprehensive  income  in relation  to  that  subsidiary  are  accounted  for  as if  the  Group  had  directly  disposed  of  the  related\n\nassets or liabilities of the subsidiary (i.e. reclassified to profit or loss or transferred to another category of equity as specified/permitted by applicable Ind AS). The fair value of any investment retained in the former subsidiary at the date when control is lost is regarded as the fair value on initial recognition for subsequent accounting under Ind AS 109 'Financial Instruments' or, when applicable, the cost on initial recognition of an investment in an associate or a joint venture.\n\n## 2.3 Summary of significant accounting policies\n\n## a Property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at original cost  grossed  up  with  the  amount  of  tax  /  duty benefits availed, less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Properties in  the  course  of  construction  are  carried  at  cost, less  any  recognised  impairment  losses.  All  costs, including borrowing costs incurred up to the date the asset is ready for its intended use, is capitalised along with respective asset. Capital work in progress is  stated  at  cost,  net  of  accumulated  impairment loss, if any.\n\nWhen significant parts of plant and equipment are required to be replaced at intervals, the Company depreciates them separately based on their specific useful lives.\n\nItems of stores and spares that meet the definition of property, plant and equipment are capitalised at cost and depreciated over their useful life.\n\nIn  respect  of  business  covered  under  part  A  of Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013, depreciation is recognised based on the cost of assets (other than freehold  land  and  properties  under  construction) less  their  residual  values  over  their  useful  lives, using  the  straight-line  method.  The  useful  life  of property, plant and equipment is considered based on life prescribed in schedule II to the Companies Act,  2013  except  in  case  of  power  plant  assets, where the life has been estimated at 25 years based on technical assessment, taking into account the nature of assets, the estimated usage of the assets, the operating condition of the assets, anticipated technical  changes,  manufacturer  warranties  and maintenance support.  The  estimated  useful  lives, residual  values  and  depreciation  method  are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimate accounted for on a prospective basis.",

All other repair and maintenance costs are recognised in statement of profit and loss as incurred.\n\nAn item of property, plant and equipment and any significant part initially recognised is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are  expected  to  arise  from  the  continued  use  of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on the disposal or  retirement  of  an  item  of  property,  plant  and equipment is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in profit and loss.\n\nSubsequent  costs  are  included  in  the  asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic  benefits  associated  with  the  item  will flow  to  the  Group  and  the  cost  of  the  item  can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of any component  accounted  for  as  a  separate  asset  is derecognised when replaced. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to profit  or  loss  during the  reporting  period  in  which  they  are  incurred. Subsequent  costs  are  depreciated  over  the residual life of the respective assets. The residual values,  useful  lives  and  methods  of  depreciation of  property,  plant  and  equipment are reviewed at each financial year end and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate.\n\n## b Intangible assets\n\nIntangible  assets  with  finite  useful  lives  that are  acquired  separately  are  carried  at  cost  less accumulated  amortisation  and  any  accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation is recognised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The Group has intangible assets in the nature of Computer software having useful life of 5 years. The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are\n\nreviewed  at  least  at  the  end  of  each  reporting period.  An  intangible  asset  is  derecognised  on disposal, or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal.\n\nGains  or  losses  arising  from  derecognition  of  an intangible  asset  are  measured  as  the  difference between  net  disposal  proceeds  and  the  carrying amount  of  the  asset  and  are  recognised  in  the statement  of  profit  and  loss  when  the  asset  is derecognised.\n\n## c Non-current assets held for sale\n\nNon-current assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition and the sale is highly probable. Management must be committed to the sale which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment and intangible are not depreciated,  or  amortised  assets  once  classified  as held for sale. Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale are presented separately from other items in the balance sheet.\n\nNon-current  assets  classified  as  held  for  sale  are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and their fair value less costs to sell.\n\n## d Financial Instruments\n\nA  Financial  Instrument  is  any  contract  that  gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity.\n\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs that are directly  attributable  to  the  acquisition  or  issue of  financial  assets  and  financial  liabilities  (other than  financial  assets  and  financial  liabilities  at fair  value  through  profit  or  loss)  are  added  to  or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or  financial  liabilities,  as  appropriate,  on  initial recognition. Transaction costs directly attributable to  the  acquisition  of  financial  assets  or  financial liabilities  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss  are recognised immediately in consolidated statement of profit or loss.",

Regular way purchases or sales are purchases  or  sales  of  financial  assets  that  require delivery of assets within a timeframe established by regulation or convention in the market place.\n\n## Subsequent measurement\n\nAll  recognised  financial  assets  are  subsequently measured in their entirety at either amortised cost or fair value, depending on the classification of the financial assets.\n\n## Classification of Financial assets Financial assets measured at amortised cost\n\nFinancial assets that meet the following conditions are subsequently measured at amortised cost using effective  interest  method  ('EIR')  (except  for  debt instruments  that  are  designated  as  at  fair  value through profit or loss on initial recognition):\n\n- \u00b7 the asset is held within a business model whose objective  is  to  hold  assets  in  order  to  collect contractual cash flows; and\n- \u00b7 Contractual  terms  of  the  asset  give  rise  on specified  dates  to  cash  flows  that  are  solely payments  of  principal  and  interest  (SPPI)  on the principal amount outstanding.\n\nAmortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR.\n\nFor  the  impairment  policy  on  financial  assets measured at amortised cost, refer note x(ii).\n\nThe  effective  interest  method  is  a  method  of calculating the amortised cost of financial assets and of allocating interest income over the relevant period. The  effective  interest  rate  is  the  rate  that  exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts (including all fees and transaction costs and other premiums or discounts) through the expected life of the financial assets, or where appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount on initial recognition.\n\nInterest is recognised on an effective interest basis for  debt  instruments  other  than  those  financial\n\nassets classified as at Fair Value through Profit and Loss (FVTPL).\n\n## Financial  assets  at  fair  value  through  other comprehensive income (FVTOCI)\n\nFinancial assets that meet the following conditions are measured initially as well as at the end of each reporting  date  at  fair  value,  recognised  in  other comprehensive income (OCI).\n\n- a) The objective of the business model is achieved both by collecting contractual cash flows and selling the financial assets, and\n- b)   The contractual terms of the asset that give rise on specified dates to cash flows that represent solely payment of principal and interest.\n\n## Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)\n\nFinancial  assets  that  do  not  meet  the  amortised cost  criteria  or  FVTOCI  criteria  are  measured  at FVTPL.\n\nFinancial assets at FVTPL are measured at fair value at the end of each reporting period, with any gains or  losses  arising  on  remeasurement  recognised in  statement  of  profit  or  loss.  The  net  gain  or loss  recognised  in  profit  or  loss  incorporates  any dividend or interest earned on the financial asset.\n\n## Derecognition of financial assets\n\nThe Group derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another party or when it has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and  rewards  of  the  asset,  but  has  transferred control of the asset.\n\nOn derecognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the difference between  the  asset's  carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received and  receivable  and  the  cumulative  gain  or  loss that  had  been  recognised  in  consolidated  other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity, is  recognised in profit or loss if  such  gain  or  loss would have otherwise been recognised in profit or loss on disposal of that financial asset.",

Equity  instruments issued by the Group are recognised at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.\n\n## Financial liabilities Initial recognition and measurement\n\nAll  financial  liabilities  are  recognised  initially  at fair  value  and  in  the  case  of  financial  liabilities at  amortised  cost,  net  of  directly  attributable transaction costs.\n\n## Subsequent Measurement\n\nAll  financial  liabilities  are  measured  at  amortised cost  using  the  effective  interest  method  or  at FVTPL.\n\n## Classification of Financial liabilities\n\n## Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)\n\nFinancial  liabilities  at  fair  value  through  profit  or loss  include  financial  liabilities  held  for  trading and  financial  liabilities  designated  upon  initial recognition  as  FVTPL.  Financial  liabilities  are classified as held for trading if these are incurred for the purpose of repurchasing in the near term.\n\nFinancial liabilities at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any gains or losses arising on remeasurement recognised in statement of profit or loss. The net gain or loss recognised in profit or loss incorporates any interest paid on the financial liability.\n\nFair values are determined in the manner described in note 'n'.\n\n## Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost\n\nFinancial liabilities that are not held-for-trading and are  not  designated  as  at  FVTPL  are  measured  at amortised cost at the end of subsequent accounting periods. The carrying amounts of financial liabilities\n\nthat are subsequently measured at amortised cost are  determined  based  on  the  effective  interest method. Interest expense that is not capitalised as part of costs of an asset is included in the 'Finance costs' line item in consolidated statement of profit and loss.\n\nThe  effective  interest  method  is  a  method  of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments (including all fees and costs paid or received that form an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts) through the expected life of the financial liability, or (where appropriate) a shorter period, to the net carrying amount on initial recognition.\n\nTrade  and  other  payables  are  recognised  at the  transaction  cost,  which  is  its  fair  value, and  subsequently  measured  at  amortised  cost. Similarly,  interest  bearing  loans  and  borrowings are  subsequently  measured  at  amortised  cost using effective interest rate method. Trade credits include Buyer's credit, Foreign Letter of Credit and Inland Letter of Credit.\n\n## Derecognition of financial liabilities\n\nThe Group derecognises financial liabilities when,  and  only  when,  the  Group's  obligations are  discharged,  cancelled  or  have  expired.  An exchange with a lender of debt instruments with substantially  different  terms  is  accounted  for  as an extinguishment of the original financial liability and  the  recognition  of  a  new  financial  liability. Similarly,  a  substantial  modification  of  the  terms of an existing financial liability is accounted for as an extinguishment of the original financial liability and  the  recognition  of  a  new  financial  liability. The  difference  between  the  carrying  amount of  the  financial  liability  derecognised  and  the consideration  paid  and  payable  is  recognised  in profit or loss.\n\n## g Derivative financial instruments\n\nThe Group enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange rate risks, including foreign exchange  forward  contracts,  interest  rate  swaps and  cross  currency  swaps,  Principal  only  Swap,",

The resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss immediately,  except  for  the  effective  portion  of cash flow hedges, which is recognised in OCI and later reclassified to profit or loss.\n\n## Embedded derivatives\n\nDerivatives embedded in non-derivative host contracts  that  are  not  financial  assets  within  the scope of Ind AS 109 'Financial Instruments' except for  the  effective  portion  of  cash  flow  hedges  (refer note  (h))  are  treated  as  separate  derivatives  when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contracts and the host contracts are  not  measured  at  FVTPL.  These  embedded derivatives are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in profit and loss.\n\nReassessment only occurs if there is either a change in  the  terms  of  the  contract  that  significantly modifies the cash flows that would otherwise be required  or  a  reclassification  of  a  financial  asset out of the fair value through profit or loss category.\n\n## h Hedge Accounting\n\nThe Group designates certain hedging instruments, which  includes  derivatives  and  non-derivatives in  respect  of  foreign  currency  risk,  as  cash  flow hedges.\n\nTo  qualify  for  hedge  accounting,  the  hedging relationship must  meet  all  of  the  following requirements:\n\n- -there is an economic relationship between the hedged items and the hedging instruments,\n- -the effect of credit risk does not dominate the value changes that result from that economic relationship,\n- -the  hedge  ratio  of  the  hedging  relationship  is the same as that resulting from the quantity of the hedged item that the entity actually hedges and the quantity of the hedging instrument that the entity actually uses to hedge that quantity of hedged item.\n\nAt  the  inception  of  the  hedge  relationship,  the Group  documents  the  relationship  between  the hedging instrument and hedged item, along with its  risk  management  objectives  and  its  strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an  ongoing  basis,  the  Group  documents  whether the  hedging  instrument  is  highly  effective  in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk.\n\n## Cash flow hedges\n\nChanges in the fair value of derivatives / hedging instruments  that  are  designated  and  qualify  as cash  flow  hedges  are  deferred  in  the  'Cash  Flow Hedge Reserve'.\n\nThe  effective  portion  of  the  gain  or  loss  on  the hedging  instrument  is  recognised  in  OCI  while  any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the statement  of  profit  and  loss.  The  Effective  portion of cash flow hedges is adjusted to the lower of the cumulative  gain  or  loss  on  the  hedging  instrument and the cumulative change in fair value of the hedged item.  The  Group  uses  forward  currency  contracts as  hedges  of  its  exposure  to  foreign  currency  risk in  forecast  transactions  and  firm  commitments. The  ineffective  portion  relating  to  foreign  currency contracts is recognised in finance costs.\n\nThe  Group  designates  only  the  spot  element  of a  forward  contract  as  a  hedging  instrument.  The forward element is recognised in OCI.\n\nThe  amounts  accumulated  in  OCI  are  accounted for,  depending  on  the  nature  of  the  underlying hedged  transaction.  If  the  hedged  transaction subsequently results in  the  recognition  of  a  nonfinancial item, the amount accumulated in equity is removed from the separate component of equity and  included  in  the  initial  cost  or  other  carrying amount of the hedged asset or liability.\n\nFor  any  other  cash  flow  hedges,  the  amount accumulated in OCI is reclassified to profit or loss as reclassification adjustment in the same period or periods during which the hedged cash flows affect profit or loss.\n\n## i Inventories\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realisable  value.

Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price for inventories less all estimated costs necessary to make the sale.\n\n## j Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash  and  cash  equivalent  in  the  balance  sheet comprise cash at banks and on hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or  less,  that  are  readily  convertible  to  a  known amount of cash and subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.\n\nFor the purpose of the consolidated statement of cash  flows,  cash  and  cash  equivalents  consist  of cash  and  short-term  deposits,  as  defined  above, net  of  outstanding  bank  overdrafts  as  they  are considered  an  integral  part  of  the  Group's  cash management.\n\n## k Business combinations and Goodwill\n\nAcquisitions of business are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration transferred in a business combination is measured at fair value, which is calculated as the sum of the acquisition date  fair  values  of  the  assets  transferred  by  the Group, liabilities incurred by the Group to the former owners  of  the  acquiree  and  the  equity  interest issued by the Group in exchange of control of the acquiree. Acquisition related costs are recognised in profit and loss as incurred.\n\nBusiness combination involving entities or businesses under common control are accounted for  using  the  pooling  of  interest  method.  Under pooling of interest method, the assets and liabilities of the combining entities / business are reflected at their carrying value.\n\nPurchase  consideration  paid  in  excess  /  shortfall of the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities including  contingent  liabilities  and  contingent assets,  is  recognised  as  goodwill  /  capital  reserve respectively, except  in  case  where  different accounting  treatment  is  specified  in  the  court approved scheme.\n\nDeferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities  and  assets or liabilities related to employee benefits arrangements  are  recognised  and  measured  in\n\naccordance with Ind AS 12 'Income Taxes' and Ind AS 19 'Employee Benefits' respectively.\n\nPotential  tax  effects  of  temporary  differences and  carry  forwards  of  an  acquiree  that  exist  at the  acquisition  date  or  arise  as  a  result  of  the acquisition are accounted in accordance with Ind AS 12.\n\nGoodwill  arising  on  an  acquisition  of  a  business is  carried  at  cost  as  established  at  the  date  of acquisition  of  the  business  less  accumulated impairment losses, if any.\n\nFor the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated  to  each  of  the  Group's  cash-generating units  (or  groups  of  cash-generating  units)  that is  expected  to  benefit  from  the  synergies  of  the combination.\n\nA  cash-generating  unit  to  which  goodwill  has been  allocated  is  tested  for  impairment  annually, or  more  frequently  when  there  is  an  indication that  the  unit  may  be  impaired.  If  the  recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro rata based on the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. Any impairment loss for goodwill  is  recognised  directly  in  profit  or  loss. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in subsequent periods.\n\nOn disposal  of  the  relevant  cash-generating  unit, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.\n\n## l Current versus non-current classification\n\nThe  Group  presents  assets  and  liabilities  in  the balance  sheet  based  on  current/  non-current classification. An asset is treated as current when it is:\n\n- \u00b7 Expected to be realised or intended to be sold or consumed in normal operating cycle\n- \u00b7 Held primarily for the purpose of trading\n- \u00b7 Expected to be realised within twelve months after the reporting period, or\n- \u00b7 Cash  or  cash  equivalent  unless  restricted  from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period",

A liability is current when:\n\n- \u00b7 It is expected to be settled in normal operating cycle\n- \u00b7 It is held primarily for the purpose of trading\n- \u00b7 It  is  due  to  be  settled  within  twelve  months after the reporting period, or\n- \u00b7 There  is  no  unconditional  right  to  defer  the settlement  of  the  liability  for  at  least  twelve months after the reporting period\n\nThe terms of the liability that could, at the option of  the  counterparty,  result  in  its  settlement  by the  issue  of  equity  instruments  do  not  affect  its classification.\n\nThe  Group  classifies  all  other  liabilities  as  noncurrent.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current assets and liabilities.\n\nThe  operating  cycle  is  the  time  between  the acquisition  of  assets  for  processing  and  their realisation in cash and cash equivalents. The group has identified twelve months as its operating cycle.\n\n## m  Foreign currency translations\n\nIn preparing the financial statements of the Group, transactions  in  currencies  other  than  the  entity's functional currency are recognised at the rate of exchange prevailing at the date of the transactions. At the end of each reporting period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at that date. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.\n\nExchange  differences  on  monetary  items  are recognised  in  profit  and  loss  in  the  period  in which they arise except for exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings relating to assets under construction for future productive use, which are included in the cost of those assets when they are regarded as an adjustment to interest costs on those foreign currency borrowings.\n\nThe  Group  has  elected  to  continue  the  policy adopted for  accounting  for  exchange  differences arising from  translation  of  long-term  foreign currency monetary items outstanding and\n\nrecognised  in  the  financial  statements  for  the period  ending  immediately  before  the  beginning of the first Ind AS financial reporting period i.e. 31 st March, 2016 as per the previous GAAP.\n\n## n Fair value measurement\n\nThe Group measures financial instruments, such as, derivatives at fair value at each balance sheet date.\n\nFair  value  is  the  price  that  would  be  received  to sell  an  asset  or  paid  to  transfer  a  liability  in  an orderly  transaction  between  market  participants at  the  measurement  date,  regardless  of  whether that price is directly observable or estimated using another  valuation  technique.  In  estimating  the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group takes into  account  the  characteristics  of  the  asset  or liability  at  the  measurement  date.  The  fair  value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the financial asset or settle the financial liability takes place either:\n\n- \u00b7 In the principal market, or\n- \u00b7 In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability\n\nThe  principal  or  the  most  advantageous  market must be accessible by the Group.\n\nThe fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using  the  assumptions  that  market  participants would  use  when  pricing  the  asset  or  liability, assuming  that  market  participants  act  in  their economic best interest.\n\nThe Group's management determines the policies and  procedures  for  both  recurring  fair  value measurement, such as derivative instruments and unquoted financial assets measured at fair value.\n\nA fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant's ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use.\n\nAll  assets  and  liabilities  for  which  fair  value  is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are  categorised  within  the  fair  value  hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:",

If the Company performs by transferring goods  or  services  to  a  customer  before  the\n\ncustomer pays consideration or before payment is due, a contract asset is recognised for the earned consideration that is conditional.\n\n## Trade receivables\n\nA  receivable  represents  the  Group's  right  to  an amount of consideration that is unconditional i.e. only the passage of time is required before payment of consideration is due and the amount is billable.\n\n## Contract liabilities\n\nA  contract  liability  is  the  obligation  to  transfer goods or services to a customer for which the Group has  received  consideration  from  the  customer. Contract liabilities are recognised as revenue when the Group performs obligations under the contract.\n\n## q Revenue recognition\n\nRevenue  from  contracts with customers is recognised when control of the goods or services are transferred to the customer at an amount that reflects  the  consideration  to  which  the  Group expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.\n\nRevenue  is  measured  based  on  the  transaction price,  which  is  the  consideration,  adjusted  for discounts and other incentives, if any, as specified in  the  contract  with  the  customer.  Revenue  also excludes  taxes  or  other  amounts  collected  from customers.\n\nThe disclosure of significant accounting judgements,  estimates  and  assumptions  relating to  revenue  from  contracts  with  customers  are provided in Note 3.\n\nThe  specific  recognition  criteria  described  below must also be met before revenue is recognised.\n\n## i) Revenue from Power Supply\n\nThe  Group's  contracts  with  customers  for the  sale  of  electricity  generally  include  one performance obligation. The Group has concluded that revenue from sale of electricity should be recognised at the point in time when electricity is transferred to the customer.\n\nRevenue from operations on account of Force Majeure / change in law events in terms of PPAs with  customers  (Power  Distribution  Utilities) is  accounted  for  by  the  Group  based  on  the orders / reports of Regulatory Authorities, best",

Interest income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowings pending  their  expenditure  on  qualifying  assets is  deducted  from  the  borrowing  costs  eligible  for capitalisation.\n\nAll  other  borrowing costs are recognised in profit or  loss  in  the  period  in  which  they  are  incurred. Borrowing  cost  consist  of  interest  and  other costs that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing  of  funds.  Borrowing  cost  also  includes exchange differences to the extent regarded as an adjustment to the borrowing cost.\n\n## s Employee benefits\n\n## i) Defined benefit plans:\n\nThe Group has obligations towards gratuity, a defined benefit retirement plan covering eligible employees  (in  some  cases  funded  through Group  Gratuity  Scheme  of  Life  Insurance Corporation of India).

Remeasurement, comprising of actuarial gains and losses, the effect of changes to the asset ceiling  (excluding  amounts  included  in  net interest or the net defined benefit liability) and the return on plan assets (excluding amounts included  in  net  interest  on  the  net  defined benefit liability) are recognised immediately in the balance sheet with corresponding debit or credit to retained earnings through OCI in the period in which it occurs. Remeasurement are not classified to profit and loss in subsequent periods. Past service cost is recognised in profit and loss in the period of a plan amendment.\n\nNet  interest  is  calculated  by  applying  the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or  asset.

The arrangement  is,  or  contains,  a  lease  if  fulfilment of  the  arrangement  is  dependent  on  the  use  of a  specific  asset  or  assets  and  the  arrangement conveys a right to use the asset or assets, even if that right is not explicitly specified in an arrangement.\n\nLeases  are  classified  as  finance  leases  whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks  and  rewards  of  ownership  to  the  lessee.  All other leases are classified as operating leases.\n\nRental  income  from  operating  leases  is  generally recognised  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  the term of the relevant lease. Where the rentals are structured solely to increase in line with expected general inflation to compensate for the Company's expected inflationary cost increases, such increases are recognised in the year in which such benefits accrue. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating\n\nand arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\n## The Group as lessee\n\nThe Group recognised right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for all leases except for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets. The Group recorded the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments discounted at the incremental borrowing rate at the date of initial application and right of use asset at an amount equal to the lease liability adjusted for any prepayments/accruals recognised in the balance sheet.\n\nThe  Group  also  applied  the  available  practical expedients wherein it:\n\n- \u00b7 Used  a  single  discount  rate  to  a  portfolio  of leases with reasonably similar characteristics\n- \u00b7 Relied on its assessment of whether leases are onerous immediately before the date of initial application\n- \u00b7 Applied  the  short-term  leases  exemptions to leases with lease term that ends within 12 months at the date of initial application\n- \u00b7 Excluded  the  initial  direct  costs  from  the measurement of the right-of-use asset at the date of initial application\n- \u00b7 Used hindsight in determining the lease term where the contract contains options to extend or terminate the lease\n\n## u Taxes on Income\n\nTax on Income comprises current tax and deferred tax.

Management periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation  and  establishes  provisions  where appropriate.\n\nCurrent  income  tax  relating  to  items  recognised outside  profit  or  loss  is  recognised  outside  profit or  loss  (either  in  other  comprehensive  income or  in  equity).  Current  tax  items  are  recognised  in correlation to the underlying transaction either in OCI or directly in equity. Management periodically evaluates  positions  taken  in  the  tax  returns  with respect  to  situations  in  which  applicable  tax regulations  are  subject  to  interpretation  and establishes provisions where appropriate.\n\nMinimum  alternate  tax  (MAT)  paid  in  a  year  is charged  to  the  statement  of  profit  and  loss  as current  tax  for  the  year.  The  deferred  tax  asset is  recognised for MAT credit available only to the extent that it is  probable that the Group will pay normal  income  tax  during  the  specified  period, i.e.,  the  period for which MAT credit is allowed to be carried forward. In the year in which the Group recognizes MAT credit as an asset, it is created by way of credit  to  the  statement  of  profit  and  loss and shown as part of deferred tax asset.\n\n## Deferred tax\n\nDeferred  tax  is  recognised  for  the  future  tax consequences of deductible temporary differences between the carrying values of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases at the reporting date. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all  taxable  temporary  differences  except  when the  deferred  tax  liability  arises  at  the  time  of transaction  that  affects  neither  the  accounting profit or loss nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred tax assets  are  generally  recognised  for  all  deductible temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax credits  and  any  unused  tax  losses,  to  the  extent that it is probable that future taxable income will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and carry forward of unused tax credit and  unused  tax  losses  can  be  utilised,  except when the deferred tax asset relating to temporary differences arising at the time of transaction that affects neither the accounting profit or loss nor the taxable profit or loss. Deferred tax relating to items\n\nrecognised  outside  the  statement  of  profit  and loss is recognised outside the statement of profit and loss, either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that  sufficient  taxable  profit  will  be  available  to allow  all  or  part  of  the  deferred  tax  asset  to  be utilised.  Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and are recognised to  the  extent  that  it  has  become  probable  that future  taxable  profits  will  allow  the  deferred  tax assets to be recovered.\n\nDeferred  tax  liabilities  and  assets  are  measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the liability is settled or the asset realised, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the end of the reporting period.\n\nThe  Group  offsets  deferred  tax  assets  and deferred tax liabilities if and only if it has a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets and current  tax  liabilities  and  the  deferred  tax  assets and deferred tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on the same taxable entity which intend either to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis, or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously, in each future period in which significant amounts of deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected to be settled or recovered.\n\n## v Earnings per share\n\nBasic earnings per share is computed by dividing the profit / (loss) after tax (net off distribution on Perpetual  Securities  whether  declared  or  not)  by the  weighted  average  number  of  equity  shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing the profit / (loss) after tax as adjusted for the effects of dividend, interest and other charges relating to the dilutive potential equity  shares  by  weighted  average  number  of shares plus dilutive potential equity shares.\n\n## w   Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets\n\nProvisions  are  recognised  when  the  Group  has a  present  obligation  (legal  or  constructive)  as  a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of  resources  embodying  economic  benefits  will",

The  amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting  period,  taking  into  account  the  risks and  uncertainties  surrounding  the  obligation.  If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions  are  discounted  using  a  current  pretax rate that reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.\n\nContingent  liabilities  may  arise  from  litigation, taxation and other claims against the Group. Where it  is  management's assessment that the outcome is  uncertain  or  cannot  be  reliably  quantified,  the claims are disclosed as contingent liabilities unless the likelihood of an adverse outcome is remote.\n\nContingent  assets  are  not  recognised  but  are disclosed in the notes where an inflow of economic benefits is probable.\n\nA  contingent  liability  recognised  in  a  business combination is initially measured at its fair value. Subsequently, it is measured at the higher of the amount  that  would  be  recognised  in  accordance with the requirements for provisions above or the amount initially recognised less, when appropriate, cumulative amortisation recognised in accordance with the requirements for revenue recognition.\n\n## x Impairment\n\n## i) Impairment of tangible and intangible assets\n\nAt the end of each reporting period, the Group reviews  the  carrying  amounts  of  its  tangible and  intangible  assets  to  determine  whether there  is  any  indication  that  those  assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication  exists,  the  recoverable  amount  of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent  of  the  impairment  loss  (if  any).  When it  is  not  possible  to  estimate  the  recoverable amount  of  an  individual  asset,  the  Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cashgenerating  unit  to  which  the  asset  belongs. When  a  reasonable  and  consistent  basis  of allocation  can  be  identified,  corporate  assets are also allocated to individual cash-generating units,  or  otherwise  they  are  allocated  to  the\n\nsmallest  group  of  cash-generating  units  for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identified.\n\nRecoverable amount is the higher of fair value less  costs  of  disposal  and  value  in  use.  In assessing  value  in  use,  the  estimated  future cash  flows  are  discounted  to  their  present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.\n\nThe  Group  bases  its  impairment  calculation on detailed  budget  and  forecast  calculations, which  are  prepared  separately  for  each  of the  Group's  cash-generating  unit  to  which the individual assets are allocated. For longer periods, a long term growth rate is calculated and  applied  to  project  future  cash  flows.  To estimate cash flow projections beyond periods covered by the most recent budget / forecasts, the Company estimates cash flow projections based on estimated growth rate.\n\nIf the recoverable amount of an asset (or cashgenerating  unit)  is  estimated  to  be  less  than its  carrying  amount,  the  carrying  amount  of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in the consolidated statement of profit and loss.\n\nWhen an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or a  cash-generating  unit)  is  increased  to  the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised  for  the  asset  (or  cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss.\n\n## ii)   Impairment of Financial assets\n\nThe  Group  applies  the  expected  credit  loss model  for  recognising  impairment  loss  on financial  assets  measured  at  amortised  cost, trade receivables and other contractual rights to receive cash or other financial asset.\n\nExpected credit loss is the difference between all  contractual cash flows that are due to the",

The Group estimates cash flows by considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument through  the  expected  life  of  that  financial instrument.\n\nThe Group measures the loss allowance for a financial  instrument  at  an  amount  equal  to the lifetime expected credit losses if the credit risk on that financial instrument has increased significantly  since  initial  recognition.  If  the credit  risk  on  a  financial  instrument  has  not increased significantly since initial recognition, the Group measures the loss allowance for that financial  instrument  at  an  amount  equal  to 12-month expected credit losses.\n\n## y Mine Development Expenditure (In case of Raipur Energen Limited ('REL'))\n\n## Stripping Costs:\n\nStripping costs are the costs of removing overburden from a mine. Stripping costs incurred in  a  development  of  the  mine  before  production commences  are  capitalised  as  part  of  the  cost of  developing  the  mine  and  are  subsequently depleted/  amortised  using  unit  of  production method  on  the  basis  of  proven  and  probable reserves once production starts.\n\nStripping  costs  incurred  for  removing  overburden during  the  production  stage  are  accumulated under  'Prepaid  expenses'  under  Advances  and is  charged  to  Statement  of  Profit  and  Loss  using unit-of-production method on the basis of proven and  probable  reserves  on  the  basis  of  estimated stripping ratio for the mine. Provision for stripping costs  are  made  for  any  shortfall  based  on  the estimated stripping ratio.\n\n## Mine Closure Obligations:\n\nThe liability for meeting the mine closure has been estimated based on the mine closure plan in the proportion of total area exploited to the total area of  the  mine as a whole. These costs are updated annually during the life of the mine to reflect the developments in mining activities. The mine closure obligations  have  been  included  in  Mining  Rights under  Intangible  assets  and  amortised  based  on unit of production method.\n\n## 3 Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions\n\nThe preparation of the Group's financial statements requires management  to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported  amounts  of  revenues,  expenses,  assets and liabilities,  and  the  accompanying  disclosures, and  the  disclosure  of  contingent  liabilities.  The estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to  be  relevant.  The  estimates  and  underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and any revisions thereto are recognised in the period of revision and future periods if the revision affects both the current and future periods. Uncertainties about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities affected in future periods.\n\n## Key Sources of estimation uncertainty:\n\nThe  key  assumptions  concerning  the  future  and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date, that have a significant risk of causing a  material  adjustment  to  the  carrying  amounts of  assets  and  liabilities  within  the  next  financial year,  are  described  below.  Existing  circumstances and assumptions about future developments may change due to market changes or circumstances arising  that  are  beyond  the  control  of  the  Group.

        "page_content": "## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nfor the year ended 31 st March, 2021\n\nobservable data to the extent available. Where such Level 1 inputs are not available, the Group establishes  appropriate  valuation  techniques and inputs to the model. The inputs to these models  are  taken  from  observable  markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is required in establishing fair values. Judgements include considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility. Changes in assumptions about these factors  could  affect  the  reported  fair  value of  financial  instruments.  Information  about the  valuation  techniques  and  inputs  used  in determining the fair value of various assets and liabilities are disclosed in note 56.\n\n## iii)  Defined benefit plans (gratuity benefits)\n\nThe cost of  the  defined  benefit  gratuity  plan and the present value of the gratuity obligation are  determined using actuarial valuations. An actuarial  valuation  involves  making  various assumptions  that  may  differ  from  actual developments  in  the  future.  These  include the determination of the discount rate, future salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the complexities involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, a defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes  in  these assumptions.  All  assumptions  are  reviewed at  each  reporting  date.  Information  about the  various  estimates  and  assumptions  made in  determining  the  present  value  of  defined benefit obligations are disclosed in note 57.\n\n## iv)  Impairment\n\nDetermining  whether  property,  plant  and equipment are impaired requires an estimation of  the  value  in  use  of  the  relevant  cash generating units. The value in use calculation is based on a Discounted Cash Flow model over the estimated useful life of the Power Plants. Further, the cash flow projections are based on estimates  and  assumptions  relating  to  tariff, operational  performance  of  the  Plants,  life extension plans, market prices of coal and other fuels,  exchange  variations,  inflation,  terminal value etc. which are considered reasonable by the Management. (Refer note 48).\n\n## v) Taxes\n\nSignificant management judgement is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing  and  the  level  of  future  taxable  profits together  with  future  tax  planning  strategies, including  estimates  of  temporary  differences reversing  on  account  of  available  benefits under  the  Income  Tax  Act,  1961.  Deferred tax  assets  is  recognised  to  the  extent  of  the corresponding deferred tax liability. (Also refer note 23).\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the losses can be utilised. Significant management judgement is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based upon the likely  timing  and  the  level  of future taxable profits together with future tax planning strategies.\n\n## vi)   Income\n\nRevenue  from  operations  on  account  of force majeure / change in law events or other income  on  account  of  carrying  cost  in  terms of  Power  Purchase  Agreements  with  various State Power Distribution Utilities is accounted for / recognised  by  the  Group  on  best management  estimates  following  principles of  prudence,  reasonable  certainty  to  expect ultimatecollection, as per the orders / reports of Regulatory Authorities, and the outstanding receivables thereof in the books of account may be subject to adjustments on account of final orders of the respective Regulatory Authorities, the Hon'ble Supreme Court or final closure of the matter with the Discoms (Refer note 31).\n\nIn certain  cases,  the  Group  has  claimed compensation  from  the  Discoms  based  on management's interpretation of the regulatory orders and various technical parameters, which are subject to final verification and confirmation by the respective Discoms, and hence, in these cases, the revenues have been recognised on a prudent basis with conservative parameters in the books.",

(Refer note 31).\n\n## vii)  Mining Rights for REL\n\nIn case of Raipur Energen Limited ('REL'), The carrying  value  of  Mining  Rights  is  arrived  at by depreciating the rights over the life of the mine  using  the  unit  of  production  method based  on  proved  and  probable  reserves.  The estimate of reserves is subject to assumptions relating  to  life  of  the  mine  and  may  change when  new  information  becomes  available. Changes  in  reserves  as  a  result  of  factors such as production cost, recovery rates, grade of  reserves  or  commodity  prices  could  thus impact  the  carrying  values  of  mining  rights and mine closure provisions. Further regulatory restrictions if any have been considered for the purposes of determining the carrying value of\n\nthe mine such as capping of fixed costs, mining license renewals etc.\n\nThe coal mine being used for captive consumption is considered as an integral part of the power plant and cannot generate cash flows  on  its  own.  The  Management  performs impairment tests for the power plant as a whole when there is an indication of impairment.\n\nThe  Group  has  considered  the  last  available information on assessment of the above parameters in view of Group's petition to surrender the mines, expecting to recover the money's paid for  obtaining  of  mining  rights  including  other costs and expects the recoverability higher than the carrying value.\n\n## viii) Mega Power Status for REL:\n\nREL has availed exemption of customs / excise duty  in  pursuance  to  terms  of  the  provisional mega  power  exemption  received  by  REL.  REL has not accounted for the said reduction in cost as a grant pending compliance of terms of Mega Power Status which needs to be attained by FY 2021-22 as the management is of the view that the  matter  has  not  attained  finality.  REL  will recognize grant to the extent of the duty waiver received  in  the  year  of  receipt  of  final  mega power status or corresponding liability if any on expiry of the time lines specified in the scheme.",

The relief to APML was upheld by the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity ('APTEL') vide its order dated 5 th October, 2020 although the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited ('MSEDSL') has filed an appeal in Hon'ble Supreme court of India ('Supreme Court') against certain matters in the APTEL order which is currently pending adjudication. Based on the APTEL order, APML has estimated the tariff compensation claim amount on conservative basis considering the various claim parameters as per the order and recognised revenue of H 3,561.32 Crores and carrying cost thereon of H 1,106.48 Crores during the year ended 31 st March, 2021 (includes revenue of H 3,172.80 Crores and Carrying cost of H 1,106.48 Crores pertaining to earlier years).\n- (b)  In a matter relating to APML tariff compensation claim (including carrying costs thereon) for additional costs incurred by APML for 2500 MW power generation capacity due to shortfall in availability of domestic coal under New Coal Distribution Policy ('NCDP') and Scheme of Harnessing and Allocating Koyala (Coal) Transparently  in  India  ('SHAKTI')  policy  of  the  government,  APML  had  earlier  received  favorable  order from MERC, based on which tariff compensation claim of H 5,467.30 Crores (including carrying cost of H 836.59 Crores) was recognised till 31 st March, 2020. In the current year, APTEL vide its orders dated 14 th September, 2020 and 28 th September, 2020 provided further clarity on the various claim parameters to be considered and remanded the matter to MERC for giving consequential order in the matter. MERC vide  its  order  dated  10 th December,  2020,  has  issued  consequential  order  for  determination  of  tariff compensation in the matter, although MSEDCL have filed a petition with Hon'ble Supreme Court against the aforesaid orders of APTEL. On prudent accounting principles, APML has revised the recognition of tariff compensation downwards by H 13.25 Crores and carrying cost by H 176.75 Crores during the year ended 31 st March, 2021 (includes revenue reversal of H 235.56 Crores and Carrying cost of H 176.75 Crores pertaining to earlier years).\n- (ii)  In respect of APRL,\n- (a)  The  Hon'ble  Supreme  Court  vide  its  order  dated  31 st August,  2020  has  upheld  the  allowance  of  tariff compensation, including carrying cost thereon, for the additional costs incurred by APRL due to shortfall in  availability  of  domestic  linkage  coal  under  NCDP  and  SHAKTI  policy  of  the  government,  in  a  matter relating to the appeal filed by the Rajasthan Discoms against the APTEL Order dated 14 th September, 2019.",

The review petition filed by Rajasthan Discoms in the matter with the Hon'ble Supreme Court was rejected on 2 nd March, 2021. Considering that, Rajasthan Discoms are yet to verify the claim documents submitted by APRL for the quantification of the final amount of tariff compensation, APRL has not recognised any additional tariff compensation revenue, pending ascertainment of tariff compensation amount by Rajasthan Discoms, post verification of the claim and supporting documents submitted by APRL. As at reporting date, APRL has filed contempt petition with the Hon'ble Supreme Court against Rajasthan Discoms for non-compliance with the Hon'ble Supreme Court order dated 31 st August, 2020.\n\n- (b)  During previous year, Appellate Tribunal for Electricity ('APTEL') vide its order dated 14 th September, 2019, has granted APRL further relief towards change in law event including carrying cost thereof, as provided under clause 10 of the Power Purchase Agreements ('PPAs'), for the additional cost incurred on procurement of  alternate  coal  under  the  Scheme  for  Harnessing  and  Allocating  Koyala  (Coal)  Transparently  in  India (Shakti) due to shortfall in availability of domestic coal and upheld the compensation under National Coal Distribution Policy ('NCDP') including for the period from February 2018 to March 2020. Accordingly, APRL had recognised revenue towards such cost compensation of H 124.80 Crores and carrying cost claim of H 737.99 Crores (under Other Income) during the previous year on the best management estimate basis.\n- iii) In respect of UPCL,\n- (a)  During the previous year, CERC vide its order dated 27 th June, 2019 has revised the tariff applicable for Multi Year Tariff ('MYT') period 2009-14, as per directions in the APTEL's Judgment dated 6 th February, 2019. UPCL had recognised revenue of H 394.80 Crores. APTEL Judgment dated 6 th February, 2019 has been challenged by the Power Company of Karnataka Limited/Discoms in Supreme Court as at reporting date.\n- (b)  During the previous year, UPCL had recognised revenue of H 17.82 Crores on account of tariff adjustment for the regulation period 2014-19 based on CERC order dated 22 nd January, 2020.\n- (c)  UPCL raises invoices on its customers based on the most recent tariff approved by the CERC, as modified by the orders of APTEL/CERC to the extent applicable, having regard to mechanism provided in applicable tariff regulations and the bilateral arrangements with the customers.\n- During the year ended 31 st March, 2021, UPCL recorded a reversal of tariff compensation claim of H 97.27 Crores (net) (Previous year - reversal of H 379.12 Crores) for the multi-year tariff for tariff cycles 2009-14 and 2014 - 2019 based on the account reconciliations and discussions held with the Discoms. In respect of certain claim matters, UPCL has also filed an appeal with APTEL/CERC as at reporting date, relating to earlier years.\n- (iv)  Revenue from operations for the year ended 31 st March, 2021, (other than the amounts disclosed in above notes (i) and (iii)) are net of reversal of H 63.18 Crores (net) pertaining to the financial years upto 31 st March, 2020 (Previous year H 240.58 Crores (net) pertaining to earlier years), recognised based on the orders received from various regulatory authorities such as RERC / MERC / CERC, APTEL and reconciliation with discoms during the year relating to various claims towards change in law events, cost escalations and carrying cost thereon.\n\n-",

To acquire the land for development of mines, APMuL had deposited H 97.66 Crores with the authorities from time to time (shown under capital advance) and incurred various expenditure (including H 6.09 Crores shown under capital work in progress) in relation to development of coal block and also gave a performance bank guarantee of H 92.90 Crores to the government authorities. During the previous year, District Collector, Godda informed to APMuL that the process to acquire land for development of mine had lapsed and it needed to apply afresh for acquisition of land in terms of Land Acquisition Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013. APMuL has taken up the matter with the Government of Jharkhand (GOJ) and Nominated Authority (NA), Ministry of Coal (MoC).\n\nConsidering the long pendency of the matter, APMuL applied for surrendering the coal block to the Nominated Authority  and  requested  for  refund  of  the  amounts  deposited,  as  stated  above  along  with  the  additional expenditure incurred by it and also release of the performance bank guarantee. APMuL also filed a writ petition in  Delhi  High  Court  on  2 nd November, 2020, in order to seek protection from BG invocation by Nominated Authority and surrendering of coal block whereby Hon'ble Delhi High Court vide it's order on 3 rd November, 2020 has directed the Nominated Authority to take decision on APMuL's application within 3 months from the order date. As at reporting date, the Nominated Authority has not concluded the matter as directed by Hon'ble Delhi High Court. In the meantime, APMuL has extended the performance bank guarantee till 31 st March, 2022 pursuant to the direction of Nominated Authority.\n\nAPMuL's management expects to resolve all matters relating to Jitpur mine with Nominated Authority and the management, basis legal opinion obtained, is reasonably confident to realise the entire amounts deposited/ incurred towards the development of the coal mine.\n\n- 47 The National Green Tribunal ('NGT') vide its order dated 14 th March, 2019, directed UPCL to make payment of H 5.00 Crores as an interim environmental compensation to Central Pollution Control Board ('CPCB'). UPCL had made payment of the said amount in April 2019 with CPCB. Further, the Committee of Experts constituted by the NGT, submitted its Interim Report on 2 nd March, 2021 with revised environmental compensation with no consensus amongst all the committee members.\n\nThe matter came up for hearing before NGT on 3 rd March, 2021. NGT allowed the respondents to file their objection on the interim report of  the committee of experts and directed the State of Karnataka to submit the final report on or before 6 th July, 2021.\n\nAs  at  reporting  date,  the  existing  plant  continues  to  operate  in  compliance  with  all  the  conditions  under Environment Clearance. The management basis opinion of legal expert, does not foresee any further liability in the matter.\n\n- 48 (a) The Hon'ble Supreme Court of India ('Hon'ble Supreme Court'), vide its order dated 2 nd July, 2019, allowed appeal filed by Adani Power (Mundra) Limited ('APMuL'), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, for termination of long term Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) ('Bid 2') with Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Ltd. ('GUVNL'), for supply of 1000 MW power including Supplementary Power Purchase Agreement ('SPPA') signed on 5 th December, 2018 with retrospective effect from respective date of PPAs and allowed APMuL to claim compensatory tariff thereof as may be decided by Central Electricity Regulatory Commission ('CERC'). The Hon'ble Supreme Court in its order, has directed CERC to decide the said matter in the light of the provisions of Section 62 of the Electricity Act, 2003 and CERC (Terms and Conditions of Tariff) Regulation 2009, within three months from the date APMuL approaches CERC. Based on the Hon'ble Supreme Court order, APMuL has filed its petition on 2 nd September, 2019. Based on Record of Proceedings, APMuL also submitted additional information on 7 th January, 2020 and 5 th March, 2020 with CERC for determination of compensatory tariff. The proceedings in the matter, are in progress and the compensation claim is not yet determined and finalised by CERC.",

GUVNL however filed a review petition in the matter which was set aside by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in September 2019 and GUVNL has subsequently also filed curative petition in November, 2019 which is currently pending in the Hon'ble Supreme Court. APMuL has not recognised any compensatory tariff in the books as at reporting date since the matter is pending closure with GUVNL.\n\nAfter Hon'ble Supreme Court order, GUVNL has discontinued scheduling power w.e.f. 10 th July, 2019 under Bid 2 PPA (including subsequent amendments thereof). Post discontinuation of scheduling, APMuL has been selling power from underlying 1320 MW of power generation capacity on merchant sale basis. The management does not foresee any significant / material adverse financial impact on future operating cash flows of APMuL due to termination of Bid 2 PPA considering the expected compensation on account of such termination of the 1000 MW PPA (1234 MW as per amended PPA) and generation and sale of power on merchant basis.\n\nAPMuL has also evaluated the factors based on which the future cash flow projections have been prepared for computing the recoverable amount / value in use of its Mundra power generation plants of 4620 MW capacity. The management's long term assessment for recoverable amount of APMuL's power generation assets has also factored better operational parameters such as coal prices, borrowing cost and power tariff, leading to better operational and financial performance of APMuL. The management believes that over foreseeable future, APMuL would be able to establish profitable operations and meet its liabilities as and when they fall due and hence, no provision / adjustment is considered necessary to the carrying value of its property, plant and equipment aggregating to H 18,312.89 Crores as at 31 st March, 2021.\n\n- (b) APML, UPCL, APRL. REL and REGL have determined the recoverable amounts of the Power Plants under Ind AS 36, Impairment of Assets on the basis of their Value in Use by estimating the future cash inflows over the estimated useful lives of the Power Plants. Further, the cash flow projections are based on estimates and assumptions relating  to  tariff,  operational  performance  of  the  Plants,  availability  of  domestic  coal under fuel supply agreement / coal linkage as per the directives of Competent Authority, life extension plans, market prices of coal and other fuels, exchange variation, inflation, terminal value etc. which are considered reasonable by the Management.\n\nOn a careful evaluation of the aforesaid factors, the Management of APML, UPCL, APRL. REL and REGL have concluded that the Recoverable Amounts of the Power Plants are higher than their carrying amounts as  at  31 st March,  2021.  However,  if  these  estimates  and  assumptions  change  in  future,  there  could  be corresponding impact on the recoverable amounts of the Plants.\n\n- 49 APMuL has recognised tariff compensation claim of H 1,483.11 Crores and carrying cost thereon of H 238.30 Crores during the FY 2013-14 to FY 2020-21 due to shortfall in domestic coal against power supplied to Haryana Discoms based on CERC Order dated 31 st May, 2018 and 13 th June, 2019 pursuant to Hon'ble Supreme Court Order dated 11 th April, 2017. The Haryana Discoms' appeal in the matter, with APTEL has been decided in favour of  APMuL on 3 rd November,  2020.  As  at  reporting  date,  appeal  filed  by  Haryana  Discoms  in  this  matter  is pending disposal by Hon'ble Supreme Court. As per the assessment made by APMuL and favourable decision of APTEL including favorable orders in respect of similar other matters, management expects to fully realise the claims recognised in the books.\n- 50 Government of Gujarat (GoG), vide its resolution (G.R.) dated 12 th June, 2020, has revoked and superseded its earlier G.R. dated 1 st December, 2018, basis which APMuL and GUVNL had signed Bid-01 and Bid-02 Supplementary Power Purchase Agreements (SPPAs) in December, 2018 and these SPPAs were also approved by CERC. In this matter, the management supported by legal views firmly believes that G.R. dated 12 th June, 2020 as issued by GoG will not have impact on SPPA signed in respect of Bid-01 (Bid-02 since cancelled) given any changes in SPPA/PPA is legally possible through mutual written consent of the counterparties and approval of CERC. The matter is under consideration  of  CERC.  However,    APMuL  continues  to  supply  power  to  GUVNL,  pending  resolution  of  certain matters under dispute, and the management is reasonably confident of realizing all the receivables from GUVNL.",

The Group is in the business of generation of electricity which is an essential service as emphasised by the Ministry of Power, Government of India. The demand for power is continuously increasing with increase in economic activities in the Country, although demand may get impacted in short term due to lock downs in various parts of the country. On long term basis, the Group does not anticipate any major challenge in operating the Group's power plants at various locations and meeting its financial obligations. Basis above, the management has estimated its future cash flows for the Group which indicates no major impact in the operational and financial performance of the Group. The  management  will  continuously  monitor  the  performance  of  the  Group  and  take  appropriate  remedial measures as needed to respond to the Covid related risks, if any.\n- 52 The Group has taken various derivatives to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations on items including principal loan amount and interest thereof along with interest rate changes.

        "page_content": "for the year ended 31 st March, 2021\n\n-\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nAll amounts are in H Crores, unless otherwise stated\n\n## 53  Financial Risk Management Objective and Policies:\n\nThe  Group's  risk  management  activities  are  subject  to  the  management  direction  and  control  under  the framework of Risk Management Policy as approved by the Board of Directors of the Group. The Management ensures appropriate risk governance framework for the Group through appropriate policies and procedures and the risks are identified, measured and managed in accordance with the Group's policies and risk objectives.\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Group is exposed to Market risk, Credit risk and Liquidity risk.\n\n## (i) Market risk\n\nMarket risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Market risk comprises three types of risk: interest rate risk, currency risk and commodity risk.\n\n## a) Interest rate risk\n\nInterest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Group's exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the part of Group's long-term debt obligations with floating interest rates.\n\nThe Group manages its interest rate risk by having a mixed portfolio of fixed and variable rate loans and borrowings. To manage this, the Group enters into interest rate swaps, in which it agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional principal amount.\n\nThe sensitivity analysis have been carried out based on the exposure to interest rates for instruments not hedged against interest rate fluctuation at the end of the reporting period. The said analysis has been carried out on the amount of floating rate long term liabilities outstanding at the end of the reporting period.  The  year  end  balances  are  not  necessarily  representative  of  the  average  debt  outstanding during the year. A 50 basis point increase or decrease represents management's assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest rates.\n\nIn case of fluctuation in interest rates by 50 basis points on the exposure of Non-current borrowings (having fluctuating rates i.e. exposed to changes in rates) of H 25,882.47 Crores as on 31 st March, 2021 and H 27,606.11 Crores as on 31 st March, 2020 respectively and if all other variables were held constant, the Group's profit or loss for the year would increase or decrease as follows:\n\n|                                       |   For the year ended   31 st  March, 2021 |   For the year ended   31 st  March, 2021 |\n|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| Impact on Profit or Loss for the year |                                    129.41 |                                    138.03 |\n\n## b)   Foreign currency risk\n\nForeign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of an exposure will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates. The Group's exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates relates primarily to the Group's operating activities. The Group manages its foreign currency risk by hedging transactions that are expected to realise in future. The Group manages its foreign currency risk by entering into currency swap for converting H loan into other foreign currency for taking advantage of lower cost of borrowing in stable currency environment. The Group also enters into various foreign exchange contracts to mitigate the risk arising out of foreign exchange rate movement on foreign currency borrowings or trade payables.\n\nEvery one percentage point depreciation / appreciation in the exchange rate between the Indian rupee and U.S.dollar on the exposure of $ 234.94 Million as on 31 st March, 2021 and $ 261.48 Million as on 31 st March, 2020 would have affected the Group's profit or loss for the year as follows:\n\n|                                                                                                         |   For the year ended   31 st  March, 2021 |   For the year ended   31 st  March, 2021 |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| Impact on Profit or Loss for the year (net of amounts  capitalised under Property, Plant and Equipment) |                                     17.18 |                                     19.28 |\n\n21",

Its  operating  /  trading  activities  require  the  on-going  purchase  or continuous sale of coal and other commodities. Therefore the Group monitors its purchases closely to optimise the price.\n\n## (ii)  Credit risk\n\nCredit risk is the risk that counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading to a financial loss.\n\nThe Group is having majority of receivables from State Electricity Boards which are Government undertakings and have interest clause on delayed payments and hence they are secured from credit losses in the future.\n\n## (iii)  Liquidity risk\n\nThe Group monitors its risk of shortage of funds using cash flow forecasting models. These models consider the maturity of its financial investments, committed funding and projected cash flows from operations. The Group's objective is to provide financial resources to meet its business objectives in a timely, cost effective and reliable manner and to manage its capital structure. A balance between continuity of funding and flexibility is maintained through internal accruals as well as adequately adjusting the working capital cycle.\n\n## Maturity profile of financial liabilities:\n\nThe table below provides details regarding the remaining contractual maturities of financial liabilities at the reporting date based on contractual undiscounted payments.\n\n| As at 31 st  March, 2021           | Carrying  Amount   | Less than 1  year   | 1 to 5 years   | More than  5 years   | Total     |\n|------------------------------------|--------------------|---------------------|----------------|----------------------|-----------|\n| Borrowings (Refer note 20 and 25)* | 52,411.27          | 15,436.89           | 33,738.41      | 22,509.09            | 71,684.39 |\n| Trade Payables                     | 3,803.13           | 3,803.13            | -              | -                    | 3,803.13  |\n| Derivative Instruments             | 119.59             | 62.41               | 57.18          | -                    | 119.59    |\n| Lease liabilities                  | 107.41             | 17.21               | 54.41          | 341.92               | 413.54    |\n| Other Financial Liabilities        | 1,451.93           | 806.03              | 645.90         | -                    | 1,451.93  |\n\n| As at 31 st  March, 2020           | Carrying  Amount   | Less than 1  year   | 1 to 5 years   | More than  5 years   | Total     |\n|------------------------------------|--------------------|---------------------|----------------|----------------------|-----------|\n| Borrowings (Refer note 20 and 25)* | 55,198.76          | 14,348.84           | 39,818.64      | 26,525.97            | 80,693.45 |\n| Trade Payables                     | 5,596.05           | 5,596.05            | -              | -                    | 5,596.05  |\n| Derivative Instruments             | 33.06              | 0.65                | 32.41          | -                    | 33.06     |\n| Lease obligations                  | 107.05             | 23.05               | 51.70          | 336.11               | 410.86    |\n| Other Financial Liabilities        | 1,487.19           | 1,273.21            | 213.98         | -                    | 1,487.19  |",

Asset Liability Matching Strategies\n\nThe Company, UPCL and REL has funded benefit plan and have purchased insurance policy, which is basically a year-on-year cash accumulation plan in which the interest rate is declared on yearly basis and is guaranteed for a period of one year. The insurance Company, as part of the policy rules, makes payment of all gratuity outgoes happening during the year (subject to sufficiency of funds under the policy). The policy thus, mitigates the liquidity risk. However, being a cash accumulation plan, the duration of assets is shorter compared to the duration of liabilities. Thus, the Group is exposed to movement in interest rate, which can result in a increase in liability without corresponding increase in the funded asset wherever applicable. Gratuity plan is unfunded in other subsidiaries.\n\n## x. Effect of Plan on Entity's Future Cash Flows\n\n## a) Funding arrangements and Funding Policy\n\nThe Company, UPCL and REL have purchased an insurance policies to provide for payment of gratuity to the employees. Every year, the insurance company carries out a funding valuation based on the latest employee data provided by these Companies. Any deficit in the assets arising as a result of such valuation is funded by these Companies.\n\n21",

THE  INSTRUCTIONS  FOR  SHAREHOLDRES  FOR REMOTE VOTING ARE AS UNDER:\n\n- (i) The  voting  period  begins  on  Friday,  9 th July, 2021 at 9:00 a.m. and will ends on Monday, 12 th July, 2021 at 5:00 p.m. During this period shareholders' of the Company, holding shares either  in  physical  form  or  in  dematerialised form, as on the cut-off date i.e. Tuesday, 6 th July, 2021, may cast their vote electronically.

However,  it has been observed that the participation by the public non-institutional shareholders/retail shareholders is at a negligible level.\n\nCurrently, there are multiple e-voting service providers  (ESPs)  providing  e-voting  facility to  listed  entities  in  India.  This  necessitates registration on various ESPs and maintenance of  multiple  user  IDs  and  passwords  by  the shareholders.\n\nIn order to increase the efficiency of the voting process,  pursuant  to  a  public  consultation, it  has  been  decided  to  enable  e-voting  to all  the  demat  account  holders,  by  way  of  a single  login  credential,  through  their  demat accounts/ websites of Depositories/ Depository Participants.  Demat  account  holders  would be able to cast their vote without having to register  again  with  the  ESPs,  thereby,  not only facilitating seamless authentication but also enhancing ease and convenience of participating in e-voting process.\n\n- (iv)  In terms of SEBI circular no. SEBI/HO/CFD/CMD/ CIR/P/2020/242 dated 09 th December, 2020 in respect of e-Voting facility provided by Listed Companies, Individual shareholders holding securities in demat mode are allowed to vote through  their  demat  account(s)  maintained with Depositories and Depository Participants.

Audit Qualification (each audit qualification separately):\n\n- a. Details of Audit Qualification:\n\nWe draw attention to Note 4 to the standalone financial results regarding Adani Power (Mundra) Limited (\"APMuL\"), a wholly owned subsidiary, having Mundra Thennal Power Undertaking, which has been incurring significant operational losses since earlier years, whereby net worth of APMuL has been completely eroded. For the reasons stated by the management in the Note, the performance and the financial position of APMuL over the foreseeable future is dependent on the outcome of resolution of various matters with the discoms / regulators,  improvement in its  future  operational  performance  and  financial  support  from  Adani  Power  Limited  (the \"Company\"). We have not been able to corroborate the Management's contention of realising the carrying value of its investments and loans and advances (including interest accrued) related to  APMuL aggregating to z 5,675.13  crores. Accordingly, we  are unable to  comment on  the appropriateness of the  carrying value of such  investments  and  loans  and  advances and  their consequential impact on the financial  results and financial  position of the Company as  at and for the quarter and year ended March 31, 2021.\n\n- b. Type of Audit Qualification: Qualified Opinion\n- c. Frequency of qualification: The above matter is qualified since FY 2018-19\n- d. For Audit Qualification(s) where the impact is quantified by the auditor, Management's Views: Not applicable\n- e. For Audit Qualification(s) where the impact is not quantified by the auditor:\n- (i) Manaeement's estimation on the impact of audit qualification: Not Applicable\n- (ii) If management is  unaulc to estimate the impact, reasons fo1\u00b7 the same: Considering the amount of Bid 2 claims is sub-judice, the same is  not determinable as also given in Note no. 4 of the standalone financial results which is  self-explanatory.\n\n(iii) Auditors' Comments on (i) or (ii) above: Audit qualification is  self-explanatory.",
