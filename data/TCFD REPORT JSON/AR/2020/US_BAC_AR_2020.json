Our report documents how your company responded to the impacts - both humanitarian and financial - of the global health crisis. It describes how we responded to the social and racial justice issues that moved to the forefront in 2020. The pages also tell the story of how our company came together in new ways to deliver for our shareholders, our teammates, our clients, our communities and to help address society's biggest challenges.\n\nI begin this letter by thanking my 213,000 teammates and our senior management team. I thank them for their extraordinary efforts over the past 12 months, and for everything they do to support our clients, and each other, every day.\n\nI would also like to thank our Board of Directors for their leadership and guidance throughout 2020. In particular, I would like to extend my gratitude to our\n\noutgoing Lead Independent Director, Jack Bovender, for all he has done for our company and those we serve. As we announced in September 2020, Lionel Nowell III takes over this important role. Lionel is an experienced leader and has been a valued member of our Board for the past eight years. Jack and Lionel share their perspectives on the past year, and what lies ahead, on page 11.\n\nLooking at our 2020 results, one thing is clear: Our decade-long focus on Responsible Growth prepared us well for this crisis. It allowed us to be a source of stability for our customers and clients during challenging times, to continue supporting the communities in which we work and live and deliver more consistent results for our shareholders through a well-understood risk framework. You can see the impact of Responsible Growth in the chart below.\n\nDespite the impacts of the global health crisis, which resulted in a historically low interest rate\n\n<!-- image -->",

Moreover, we ended 2020 with more capital, more deposits, record liquidity and improved capital ratios. We did this while increasing support for our clients.\n\nIn March of 2020, the stock price for banks in general saw a sharp drop as the health crisis unfolded and investors contemplated potentially large credit losses and revenue declines from interest rates and a paucity of economic activity. From those lows, bank stocks made a steady recovery as fears moderated, ending the year modestly down from the start of the year.\n\nOur stock price declined 49% in March from the beginning of 2020 and then saw a 68% recovery, ending the year down 14%. This was in line with the broader bank index but below the broader market rise of 16%. Despite the 2020 decline, our stock price has outperformed the broader bank index on a 3-year and 5-year basis. As we prepare to issue this report in late February 2021, the price is up 14% this year, reflecting the improved economic outlook.\n\nDuring 2020, we delivered $12 billion in capital back to shareholders through dividends and net share repurchases. We did this even as we halted share repurchases late in the first quarter of 2020 in line with additional federal bank regulatory restrictions. We have resumed share repurchases in the first quarter of 2021 from a position of strength with $36 billion of capital above our minimum regulatory requirements.\n\nOur results in 2020 built onto a solid foundation established by focusing on Responsible Growth for the past decade. We have a strong balance sheet, a best-in-class suite of products and capabilities - including our industry-leading digital capabilities - and a global team of dedicated professionals that is second to none. We are well-positioned to continue delivering for our shareholders, and all those we serve, in 2021 and beyond.\n\nWe believe we must continue to deliver these strong results and help make progress on important societal priorities. That is core to how we run our business and drive Responsible Growth.\n\nIn 2020, we also continued to make meaningful progress on important issues that affect us all. During the year, we accelerated our longstanding work to promote racial equality and economic opportunity, with a $1 billion, four-year commitment aimed at supporting jobs, healthcare, housing and businesses. While we were pleased to see commitments being made by other companies and organizations, we have moved quickly to get money moving to our priority areas of focus. So far, we have invested in jobs and skills training at 11 historically Black colleges and universities and 11 community colleges. We have delivered over 20 million masks and other personal protective equipment (PPE) to\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1 The BKX Index consists of 24 stocks selected from the largest U.S. regional and nationwide banking companies.\n- 2 Total shareholder return includes stock price appreciation and dividends paid.

We supported commercial clients with our strong balance sheet that provided more than $70 billion in loans in a few-week period, and raised $772 billion in capital over the course of the year. For institutional investors, it meant having the market expertise and insights, trading capabilities and access to enable them to navigate through.\n\nBut we believe it was our planning and investments over the past decade that made this all work. We supplied needed capital and liquidity to borrowers. Our investments in digital client interfaces across our client groups allowed us to maintain a close relationship with our clients, as they moved seamlessly to digital check deposits, payments, banking and investing. On the commercial side, we had invested in our CashPro application, which allowed our clients to safely and securely move billions of dollars every day. We used automated signature capabilities to allow clients to complete estate plans, borrow or invest - all with the same security as doing it in person. With institutional investors, we moved quickly to supply liquidity and a strong and resilient platform to support their activities and help assure stability of the financial system.\n\nAll of this, and more, allowed us to continue to serve clients relatively uninterrupted by the pandemic, even as volumes surged. We played our part, with our industry colleagues, in helping ensure economies around the world, and here in the U.S., recover more quickly. In the end, that is the role of the bank. Your company executed that role well.\n\n## And we grew.\n\nIn 2020, average deposits increased 18% year-over-year to approximately $1.6 trillion. In Consumer Banking, we added $115 billion in average deposits during the year, cementing our position as the #1 bank in the U.S. by retail deposits. We leveraged our leading digital capabilities to serve our consumer clients how, when and where they chose to bank with us. Across all consumer sales in 2020, 42% of sales came through digital channels.\n\nDuring the year, we also enrolled more than one million clients into our flagship loyalty program, Preferred Rewards, driving total membership to 7.2 million. Preferred Rewards recognizes\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Note: Amounts may not total due to rounding.\n- \u00b9 Business segment results are reported on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis with remaining operations recorded in All Other with revenue of ($3.6B).\n\n\u00b2 Total revenue, net of interest expense, on a GAAP basis is $85.5B and $86.0B on an FTE basis, a non-GAAP financial measure.

According to our internal research, we continued to gain share in key markets. In 25 of the top 30 markets across America - representing over half of the U.S. population - we now hold the #1, #2 or #3 position. That is twice as many markets as our closest peer and includes 14 markets in which we hold the #1 position.\n\nDuring the year, our wealth management team found new ways to connect with, and deliver for, our Merrill and Private Bank clients. On page 22, we take a closer look at how our advisors continued to support clients and helped them navigate a changing environment. We added roughly 22,000 Merrill and 1,800 Private Bank relationships in 2020, and ended the year with client balances at all-time highs of $3.3 trillion.\n\nFor the companies we serve, we begin with our small business clients. Apart from the role we played as the largest lender in the federal government's PPP by number of loans, we also continued as the largest small business lender in the country overall, ending the year with more than $32 billion in small business loan balances. We also deployed our new merchant services capabilities.\n\nFor our commercial clients, the year was difficult as they had to absorb massive changes to the business cycle brought by the health crisis. We were there for them. Early in the year, we supported their borrowing rush as they sought liquidity in February, March and April. As conditions stabilized, we helped with market access for them to raise needed and permanent capital. We continued to bring digital capabilities to ensure their businesses could run smoothly, even in a work-from-home environment. The results for us were a surge in loans to these businesses. We peaked at $585 billion in commercial loans; by year-end those were down to $499 billion.\n\nOur investment banking team recorded $7 billion in total investment banking fees and posted three of the strongest investment banking quarters in our history. Our performance in this business helped us gain market share and retain the #3 market position, thanks to the efforts of our talented team. Matthew Koder, President of Global Corporate & Investment Banking, looks back on his team's accomplishments on page 20.\n\nIn Global Markets, full-year sales and trading revenue for 2020 increased 18% year-over-year to $15 billion. During the year we continued to push our innovative capabilities in electronic trading forward to help win mindshare with some of our largest clients. At the same time, our own research team was again ranked as one of the top Global Research Firms by Institutional\n\nInvestor-placing as one of the top two firms for each of the past 10 years. You can read more about our award-winning research capabilities on page 23.\n\nEach of our businesses contributed to our results, and the diversity of our offerings served us well through a dynamic market environment. It will continue to serve us well as we look forward.\n\n## Grow by focusing on our clients\n\nLast year, thanks to the commitment of our teammates, the strength of our platform and our focus on Responsible Growth, we achieved the highest client satisfaction scores in company history. That is a credit to each and every member of our global team, who work hard to serve our customers and clients - and exceed their expectations - in every interaction.\n\nIn 2020, that included far-ranging measures to support those impacted by the health crisis, through our own relief programs and those provided by the federal government. We processed approximately 2 million payment deferral requests as part of our Client Assistance Program. We processed more than 16 million Economic Impact Payments (EIP), totaling more than $26 billion in the initial round of U.S. government stimulus payments - and continued processing additional payments following subsequent relief legislation.\n\nAs the largest PPP lender by number of PPP loans in the first three rounds of the program, in 2020 we helped more than 343,000 small business clients - in every industry, every market - receive PPP loans, delivering more than $25 billion in PPP loan funds to businesses in need. We began accepting applications for PPP loans once again in January 2021, in line with a new round of federal PPP lending. Once again, we are among the top lenders in the program.\n\nAt the same time, we remained focused on supporting the everyday financial needs of millions of clients. With additional health and safety measures in place, our teams continued to serve individuals and businesses across our nationwide network of approximately 4,300 financial centers and 17,000 ATMs. I'd like to offer a special thanks to my teammates in the financial centers who have played an essential role for our clients and communities through this health crisis.\n\nNot surprisingly, we also saw a growing number of clients choose to connect with us digitally during 2020. Our ten-plus years of sustained investment into technology - such as\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "artificial intelligence (AI) - and our award-winning digital platforms ensured we could continue to serve our clients when they needed us most.\n\nIn Consumer Banking, we ended 2020 with 39.3 million digital customers, up 3% over 2019. They connected with us nearly 11 billion times. Our roughly 13 million active Zelle\u00ae users, both consumers and small businesses, sent approximately $141 billion in transfers in 2020. To put that into perspective, that's almost 50% of the payments made by our 38 million consumers and small businesses using their credit cards.\n\nMore than 17 million of our digital banking clients use Erica\u00ae, our AI-based virtual financial assistant, to do everything from checking their balances to paying their bills. Erica will also reach out to help if, for example, a client's balance is at risk of going below $0 in the next week, or if a merchant charges them twice. Erica continues to gain knowledge and evolve in response to client needs. For example, at the beginning of the health crisis, Erica learned 60,000 new pandemic-related intents in a matter of days. In 2020 alone, Erica completed 135 million client requests.\n\nIn September, we launched LifePlan\u00ae, which gives clients the power to select what's most important to them and receive personalized insights - through both high-tech and high-touch interactions - to help them achieve their financial needs and goals. By the end of 2020, our clients had created more than 2 million plans, one of the fastest product rollouts in our history.\n\nOur digital platforms also allow us to extend further into our communities, allowing millions of clients to access services and connect into the broader economy. In 2020, we added Balance Assist\u2122, a low-cost, digital-only alternative to payday-type loans. Balance Assist, which allows clients to borrow up to $500 for a $5 flat fee, joins our existing suite of safe banking solutions, including SafeBalance\u2122 and Secured Card. D. Steve Boland, President of Retail, joins Aron Levine, President of Preferred and Consumer Banking & Investments, to discuss how these products can help provide financial freedom and stability for clients on page 18.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n$1B\n\nIn 2020, our team generated more than 1,700 ideas to drive operational excellence, saving the company nearly $1 billion.\n\nDigital connectivity was also fundamental to our success in wealth management, and we saw digital engagement for wealth management clients climb to record levels. By the end of 2020, 77% of Merrill Lynch households and Private Bank clients were using online or mobile banking. Our digital platforms also allowed for effective advisor-client communications, which became a critical part of relationship building as the pandemic continued.\n\nIn Global Banking, our CashPro\u00ae platform helped more CFOs and other business leaders efficiently and securely manage their cash flow from their offices and homes-and on their mobile devices. Our roughly 500,000 CashPro users drove a 40% increase in platform sign-ins in 2020. Here, too, we applied the power of AI for our clients, digitally matching 19 million incoming receivables in a 12-month period using our Intelligent Receivables\u00ae solution.\n\nStepping back, what we saw in 2020 was the impact of years of investment in capabilities and digital access across our platform and our businesses. And what was unique is that even in areas where we had heretofore experienced customers or employees traditionally preferring to operate in a face-to-face, physical world, we saw dramatic changes. We had a record year in new $10 million or higher relationships in Global Wealth & Investment Management (GWIM), yet we were unable to have many face-to-face meetings. We had a record year in investment banking fees, yet all of our 'pitch' meetings with clients were virtual. We saw record movement in money by our consumer customers yet we had up to 30% of our financial centers closed for safety. The implications for the long term are yet to be borne out. But we are confident that the investments we have made set us on the correct course.\n\nI want to call out our technology and operations team, who showed creativity and excellence in execution by positioning all of our client-facing teammates to be able to operate in a workfrom-home environment. In four weeks, our tech and ops team deployed 100,000 computers and screens to those teammates. It was no small task, and it enabled us to continue to serve clients who themselves were adjusting to the pandemic conditions.\n\n## Grow within our risk framework\n\nGrowing within our established risk framework is integral to how we drive Responsible Growth. Our principled approach to risk management allowed us to continue supporting our customers and clients against the backdrop of one of the worst economic declines in U.S. history, driven by the global pandemic.\n\nAt the onset on the health crisis, we took immediate action to strengthen our reserves for credit losses. We ended 2020 with nearly $21 billion in credit reserves, more than twice what we had at the end of 2019. Together with our existing capital, we have substantial reserves available to manage potential losses. Credit losses were much lower than many expected, but we were confident our underwriting would hold up, and it did. In fact, our actual charge-offs moved from $3.6 billion in 2019 to $4.1 billion in 2020, a slight increase.",

        "page_content": "On the markets side, our team led by Tom Montag and Jim DeMare navigated the markets very well and we had a strong year of trading revenue. More importantly, we provided support for our institutional clients. And we had only a handful of days with trading losses.\n\nWe continue to actively monitor and assess the impacts - both direct and indirect - of the health crisis and other potential risks through our risk management framework. And we continue to drive out operational risk from the company through our focus on operational excellence.\n\n## Grow in a sustainable manner\n\nTo drive Responsible Growth, we must ensure that our growth is sustainable. There are three complementary and interdependent tenets to how we approach sustainable growth: driving operational excellence, being the best place for teammates to work and sharing our success with our communities.\n\n## Driving operational excellence\n\nWhile 'operational excellence,' 'organizational health,' 'simplify and improve' and other terms we use may sound a little mechanical, they are instrumental to our success. In 2015, your company had $57 billion in expenses. In 2020, we had $55 billion, including roughly $1.5 billion in net coronavirus-related costs. Compared with 2015, we have more customers and clients and more transactions - so more work. Yet costs are down and headcount is down. During those six years, we invested about $18 billion in technology initiatives, added 15% more sales teammates, opened 300 financial centers and refurbished 2,000 more. All of these investments were made while costs came down. We continue to apply the practice of operational excellence to enable us to produce strong returns above our cost of capital while investing back into our company and our capabilities. This will provide powerful leverage as interest rates rise and the economy continues to recover and grow.\n\nOperational excellence is as much a mindset as it is a program. It describes the ways in which we drive continuous improvement, reduce operational risk and seek to find faster, simpler and more efficient ways of working and serving our clients.\n\nThis work is fueled by the ingenuity and creativity of our teammates, who continuously look for ways we can do things better. In total, we've approved nearly 8,600 of their ideas, which commit to delivering billions in expense savings. In 2020 alone, our team generated more than 1,700 ideas that helped us define commitments to save nearly $1 billion. We reinvested those savings back into our team, our capabilities, our client experience, our communities and our shareholders.\n\nFor example, savings from operational excellence help fund the ongoing modernization of sites across our real estate portfolio, including renovating our financial centers to deliver a client-focused interior and exterior design and full support for digital transactions.\n\nIt's important to note we made investments like these in 2020 - and many more described throughout this report - while at the same time returning $12 billion in net capital to our shareholders. And - as you will see discussed elsewhere in this report - we invested in our team, including the fourth consecutive year of company-wide supplemental bonuses, increasing our minimum hourly rate of pay for U.S. employees and keeping medical expenses down for our lesser-paid teammates.\n\n## Being a great place to work for our teammates\n\nAttracting and retaining the best talent is key to driving Responsible Growth and one of our top priorities. It helps us manage our operations, provide the best service for our clients and support our communities.\n\nWe strive to make Bank of America a great place to work for all teammates. And we fulfill this commitment by being a diverse and inclusive workplace, attracting and developing talent, recognizing and rewarding performance and supporting teammates' physical, emotional and financial wellness. On page 26, Sheri Bronstein, our Chief Human Resources Officer, shares her thoughts on our progress in 2020 and what it means for the future.\n\nOur workforce must reflect the communities we serve. As highlighted in our 2020 Human Capital Management Report, we have continued to make progress in our goal to ensure diverse representation at all levels of our company. Fi/fty percent of our management team is diverse, and Bank of America is one of only five S&P 100 companies with six or more women on the Board. And over the past decade, the number of people of color we hire in the U.S. from universities has increased by 50%.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "We want our teammates to build long-term careers with Bank of America. And that starts with a competitive starting wage and benefits. We moved to our minimum hourly rate of pay for U.S. teammates of $20 - roughly $42,000 per year - one year earlier than planned. And we offer ongoing training and development resources to help those teammates grow and thrive within our organization. We hire with a career mindset. And we work to reskill our teammates.\n\nFor teammates earning lower salaries, we provide higher company subsidies for medical premiums. Since 2012, there has been no increase in medical premiums for teammates earning less than $50,000.\n\nTo support our teammates during the health crisis, at work and at home, we expanded many of our benefits and resources. This included additional support for mental health, free virtual consultations and no-cost coronavirus testing.\n\nAs the pandemic hit, we knew our teammates were going to be under pressure at home. For most of them, home was their workplace. For our 40,000 teammates with children, home was o/ften a school or daycare. For many teammates with aging parents, home became an assisted living space. Our teammates needed help. We offered them $100 per day to hire that help. More than 3 million days of care have been provided. This helped our teammates immensely - they have told us. And it also allowed them to serve our clients better.\n\nIn 2020, we came together to support one another like never before. It was a great reflection of the commitments, the compassion and the people that make our company a great place to work.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n$2B\n\nWe issued a $2 billion equality progress sustainability bond designed to advance racial equality, economic opportunity and environmental sustainability.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n$1B\n\nWe launched a $1 billion corporate social bond , the first issued by a U.S. commercial bank to entirely focus on fighting the pandemic.\n\n## Sharing our success with our communities\n\nOne of the ways we ensure our growth is sustainable is by sharing our success with the communities in which we work and live. We invest significant time and money to help address issues facing our local communities and society at large, and commit all of our business activities and operations to the task.\n\nThis begins with our $250 million in annual corporate philanthropy. To this, we added another $100 million in 2020 to increase access to food and medical supplies in local communities.\n\nIndividual giving by my teammates, combined with matching gi/fts from Bank of America, amounted to more than $65 million in additional philanthropic support in 2020. To maximize the impact of each employee gi/ft, we lowered the employee matching gi/ft minimum to $1 and doubled our match for employee donations to 17 organizations through 2020.\n\nWe also support our communities through our lending and investing activities. In 2020, for example, we provided a record $5.87 billion in loans, tax credit equity investments and other real estate development solutions, and deployed $3.62 billion in debt commitments and $2.25 billion in investments to help build strong, sustainable communities by financing affordable housing and economic development across the country. Between 2005 and 2020, we financed more than 215,000 affordable housing units.\n\nIn May of 2020, we launched a $1 billion corporate social bond, the first issued by a U.S. commercial bank to entirely focus on fighting the pandemic. We followed that up with an industry-first $2 billion equality progress sustainability bond designed to advance racial equality, economic opportunity and environmental sustainability.\n\nOur commitment to racial equality and economic opportunity demonstrates the way in which we approach major societal issues and align all of our resources to help drive progress locally. Our investments and partnerships in this work are targeted at strategic areas in which we already are a leader: jobs, healthcare, housing and businesses. By providing even sharper focus, we seek to make a lasting impact on underserved minority entrepreneurs and communities. You\n\ncan read more about how we are executing on our $1 billion commitment and a broader update on our work in sustainable finance in the discussion between Vice Chairman Anne Finucane and Global Sustainable Finance Executive Karen Fang on pages 33-35.\n\nThe most important way we shape our engagement in local communities is through our market president organization. Our network of 90 presidents is responsible for leading an integrated team to deliver for clients, teammates and the community, serving as the chief executive for Bank of America in that market. We talk more about how our presidents support our clients and communities on page 25.",

        "page_content": "## Driving profits and purpose\n\nThe principles of stakeholder capitalism are embedded in Responsible Growth. We deliver for our clients, our employees, our communities and our shareholders and, at the same time, do our part to deliver progress against society's biggest challenges. This includes our work to support the health and safety of our teammates, the many ways we help the communities we serve grow and prosper, our efforts to promote racial equality and economic opportunity and our ongoing drive toward a clean energy future.\n\nStakeholder capitalism is not a new concept, even if its recent focus makes it seem that way. As a financial institution, our success has always been tied to the success of the communities and markets we serve. In recent years, business organizations including the U.S. Business Roundtable, the World Economic Forum and others have helped create broader awareness of the ways that companies must think about delivering long-term value - for shareholders, of course, but for all of our other stakeholders, too.\n\nHelping address societal issues can stimulate the commitment of private sector capital to help drive even more progress. And there's growing evidence to back that up. As our Global Research team has found, companies that pay close attention to environmental, social and governance (ESG) priorities are much less likely to fail than companies that do not, giving\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ninvestors a significant opportunity to build investment portfolios for the long-term. And - through research and our own lived experience - we know that ESG commitments can translate into a better brand, more client favorability and a better place for our teammates to work.\n\nThere is an important discussion underway about the role capitalism plays in our society and the ways in which it must evolve to ensure all participants in our economic system are treated fairly and rewards are available equitably. Public companies have an important role to play to help drive that discussion. At Bank of America, we embrace our dual responsibility to drive both profits and purpose. And we work with organizations and leaders around the world to champion these ideals and drive meaningful progress. We need a way to measure that and in 2020 we made substantial progress on that front, too.\n\n## Measuring and delivering long-term value\n\nTo help society make progress toward important goals you need to know two things.\n\nFirst, you need to understand what society's priorities are. And we do. The countries of the world identified those priorities in 2015, when nearly 200 countries agreed to the The SDGs reflect 17 categories of societal priorities that United Nations (U.N.) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).",

        "page_content": "## Measuring stakeholder capitalism\n\nThe International Business Council, with the collaboration of the accounting firms Deloitte, KPMG, PwC and EY, compiled a set of common ESG Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics disclosures. These metrics are compiled from leading ESG standardssetters, including the Task Force on Climate-related Disclosures (TCFD), the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and others. As discussed in CEO Brian Moynihan's shareholder letter in this report, the goal of the Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics is to provide investors and other stakeholders a common set of standards by which to evaluate the progress the company is making to address the societal priorities agreed to in the SDGs. The metrics include non-financial disclosures in four categories: people, planet, prosperity and principles of governance.\n\nNearly 70 global companies have agreed to begin using the Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics, and many more are evaluating them for their own use. Bank of America is a founding member of His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales' Sustainable Markets Initiative (SMI), which seeks to harness the creativity, the innovation and the balance sheets of businesses around the world to help drive long-term growth in a globally sustainable fashion. In December 2020, under the guidance of His Holiness Pope Francis and His Eminence Cardinal Peter Turkson, Bank of America joined an alliance of business leaders and companies around the world as part of the Vatican's Council for Inclusive Capitalism (VCIC). Comprising companies that collectively have more than 200 million employees from over 163 countries, the VCIC illustrates how capitalism can take the lead in creating economic growth that is fair, responsible, trusted, dynamic and sustainable. The SMI, the VCIC, and similar organizations recognize the Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics as an important step toward providing the disclosures needed to measure the progress that private sector capitalism can help deliver in addressing important societal priorities.\n\nGiven the cross-industry application of this set of common metrics, not each standard will apply to each company that is disclosing. Where a disclosure is not provided or not linked to another Bank of America disclosure, we provide a brief explanation. We share the long-term objective of other companies, asset owners and asset managers, key government regulators and the standards-setters themselves that eventually there will be a single set of non-financial ESG disclosure standards to help stakeholders evaluate companies in the same fashion that standard financial disclosures now permit.\n\naddress equality of opportunity, affordable housing, prosperity, access to clean water, renewable energy, and other priorities, with specific goals to be met. Leaders in each country agreed these goals are the ones we need to address to build a sustainable future and create opportunity and prosperity for all.\n\nSecond, you need to know how to measure progress. The International Business Council (IBC), which I am privileged to chair, has compiled a set of Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics aligned to the SDGs. These metrics create a consistent way of measuring companies' long-term value, across industries. This, in turn, helps direct investment toward high performers and align capital to progress on the SDG and ultimately defines stakeholder capitalism. It also aligns capitalism's innovation, its entrepreneurship and its massive resources to the progress, which won't be made without the private sector.\n\nIn September, the IBC - working with the accounting firms Deloitte, EY, KPMG and PwC - released a set of 21 core metrics, and 34 expanded metrics, aligned to the themes of people, planet, prosperity and principles of governance. As of January 2021, Bank of America and nearly 70 other global corporations have agreed to implement reporting on the Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics, and the coalition continues to grow. Later in this Annual Report you can see our initial set of Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics disclosures.\n\nAt Bank of America, we drive progress on the SDGs through all of our efforts and activities. We do so through our operations, our philanthropy, our human resources practices, our client financing capabilities and the guidance we provide to investor clients. We bring our $2.8 trillion balance sheet, our $55 billion expense base and the trillions of dollars we raise each year for our clients to the task. And, critically, we commit the considerable ingenuity, innovation and passion of our team.\n\nFor over a decade, we have focused on driving Responsible Growth so that we can create value for every stakeholder and for society - through every economic environment. Our focus on Responsible Growth positioned us well as we faced the unforeseen challenges of 2020, and positions us well as we look to the future. We remain committed to delivering for our shareholders, our teammates, our clients, our communities and to making a positive impact on the world for years to come.\n\nOn behalf of my 213,000 teammates, our management team and the Board of Directors, I thank you for your support of Bank of America.\n\nBrian Moynihan March /one.text, /two.text/zero.text/two.text/one.text\n\n<!-- image -->",

The tenets of Responsible Growth include the company's ESG practices.

Fifteen of the company's 16 directors are independent and we bring our unique perspectives to each of our board and committee meetings.\n\nOur discussions among ourselves and with the company's management are grounded in facts and data.

For more detailed information, please review this 2020 Annual Report, our 2021 Proxy Statement and our Human Capital Management Report.\n\nAt the annual meeting, Lionel Nowell will assume the role of Lead Independent Director. Lionel is totally committed to his new role and will continue our practice of meeting regularly with our shareholders.\n\nIt has been both an honor and pleasure to serve as Lead Independent Director.

For employees who identify as high-risk, many have been redeployed to roles they can perform remotely.\n- \u00b7 To ensure our employees maintain access to critical medical resources , we have provided no-cost telehealth resources with 24/7 virtual access to general medicine doctors and mental health specialists, home delivery service of preventative prescription medications with a temporarily waived refill waiting period and no-cost coronavirus testing.\n- \u00b7 To help address the personal impacts the environment has had on teammates and their families, we have expanded our back-up childcare for employees in the U.S. , including providing nearly three million days of back-up child and adult care and an investment of nearly $300 million in child and adult care reimbursements in 2020 to help offset costs for our teammates. We have continued that support in 2021.\n- \u00b7 Additionally, we have provided a variety of resources to help parents and caregivers as their children return to school (whether in-person or virtually), including a dedicated back-to-school website with webinars, articles, weekly tips and discounts on computers, devices and school supplies.\n- \u00b7 We also have added new physical and mental health resources , such as training for stress management, resiliency and mindfulness - and provided additional vacation and personal day flexibility.\n- \u00b7 We have expanded our dedicated team of Life Event Services (LES) specialists to provide personalized support\n\nto teammates impacted by the coronavirus, and we continue to offer 24/7 confidential counseling through our Employee Assistance Program (EAP) for teammates and their immediate family members.\n\nAdditionally, we have taken specific actions to support the health of our thousands of teammates working in the office - in our financial centers, operations centers and trading floors - and to recognize all our employees are doing in support of our clients, including:\n\n- \u00b7 Temperature checks, daily health screenings and onsite nurses at many of our sites. We will continue to expand these measures prior to additional employees returning to the office.\n- \u00b7 Onsite coronavirus testing introduced for employees working in our financial centers and administrative buildings with more than 100 employees working in the office\n- \u00b7 Enhanced deep cleanings of our facilities, installing thousands of wellness barriers and putting physical distancing markings in place for our employees and clients\n- \u00b7 Special compensation programs , including supplemental pay, enhanced overtime pay and other special incentives for employees working in our offices and buildings to serve clients\n- \u00b7 Transportation and meal subsidies , delivering more than three million meals to employees to-date\n\nThese are just some examples of how we have supported our teammates and their families during this critical time.

How did your business stand out in 2020?\n\nMatthew: Despite last year's unprecedented uncertain market environment, we were relentless in helping our clients and distinguishing our business with many leading, innovative solutions. We provided support by advising across the entire capital structure and executing transactions across loans, bonds, convertibles, follow-ons, IPOs, private capital markets, mergers and acquisitions and more. Through it all, we believe the high volume of deals and transactions we completed on behalf of our clients repeatedly showed we had their trust and that our integrated corporate banking, investment banking and capital market services - along with the bank's strong balance sheet, highly developed global platform and innovative solutions - were our defining differentiators.\n\nWhile 2020 may have physically separated us from our clients, it didn't dampen the opportunity to stay connected, deepen relationships and drive enhanced value. We significantly increased the level of our communications with our clients and expanded our client base by leveraging local coverage teams and cross-business integration opportunities. We believe the more clients do with us, the more value we can offer them from our integrated resources and expertise. In addition, despite the complexities of the environment, we continued to enhance our client-facing platforms at a record pace to drive connectivity and efficiency and deliver smarter, faster and more secure digital experiences for clients.\n\n## Q. What were some of your key accomplishments in 2020?\n\nMatthew: When our clients needed a strong financial partner through the crisis, we were committed to be there - approving over $100 billion in credit across approximately 500 requests. In addition, our team's resilience and the seamless strength of our connections positioned us as the industry leader in re-opening the capital markets a/fter the initial market dislocation resulting from the pandemic. By the end of 2020, we helped raise approximately $772 billion of capital in the",

This leadership and experience further provided us with critical insight into investor receptivity, which allowed us to advise our clients on optimal financing solutions across products, markets and geographies throughout the year.\n\nWe believe all of these efforts resonated with our clients and translated into our ability to increase our investment banking fees by 27% in 2020. This resulted in a total of $7.2 billion in fees, which was a record for a full-year and also included three of the strongest quarters in our company's history. In addition, we increased our investment banking industry ranking to #3 and grew our market share by 70 bps - including our highest ever share in equity capital markets and mergers and acquisitions. We see all of these as valuable indicators of our clients' confidence in our people and capabilities.\n\n## Q. What impact did your business make on sustainable finance in 2020?\n\nMatthew: Leadership in ESG and sustainable finance are valuable competitive differentiators for Bank of America. We're always looking for innovative solutions for investors to support social and environmental change. The past year was particularly meaningful to us because our bankers and operations teams drove a number of industry-leading achievements.\n\nFor example, we were the #1 global underwriter of corporate ESG-related bonds. In addition, we helped launch the world's first sustainability-linked bond and led the first green convertible bond in the U.S. with a designated green use of proceeds. This particular accomplishment represented an important, innovative landmark, as it was the first time sustainable finance tools crossed over into the equity-linked market. We also underwrote nearly $50 billion in coronavirusrelated social bonds, helping a broad audience from corporations to national governments finance their pandemic responses.\n\nStrong interest from our clients in these bonds shows that companies can do good and do well. There is a growing desire around the globe to support investments that have a positive societal impact. And, we're proud to be at the forefront in delivering these solutions.\n\n## Q. Looking to 2021 and beyond, what do you want your clients to know?\n\nMatthew: That we will continue to be there for them. In the long shadow of the health crisis and amidst so many transformational changes, we will continue to be there for our clients as their steadfast and trusted partner. We are committed to leveraging our resources and franchise to deliver for them - and grow with them - as the recovery takes root.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Making significant progress internationally\n\n## A message from Bernie Mensah\n\nPresident, International\n\nOur international presence, which spans approximately 35 countries and territories, is vital to the thousands of corporate and institutional clients that we serve. We strive to provide rapid, on-the-ground access to our expansive platform and capabilities, exceptional market insight and a talented, diverse and dedicated employee base. Never has this been more important than in 2020, a year of significant progress for our company internationally, notwithstanding the challenges of the health crisis.\n\nIn Asia Pacific, we generated record revenues participating in the rapid growth of capital markets in the region and connecting investment capital to significant opportunities presented in many of the world's fastest growing large economies. From China to Australia, and India to Japan, we provided critical advice on multiple transactions, helping clients to access primary capital and market liquidity as needed.\n\nIn Europe, Africa and the Middle East, despite the backdrop of more challenging economic conditions and political uncertainties, we continued to see our franchise advance with important new client gains in many product areas. In addition, a/fter nearly four years of preparation, we successfully completed our thorough Brexit planning, making the necessary adjustments to ensure we could continue to seamlessly and efficiently service all clients in both the E.U. and the U.K. from our key hubs in Dublin, Paris and London and additional local offices. With Brexit uncertainties behind us, we now look forward to continuing to expand our market share across all our lines of business in the region.\n\nWe now are focused on building on our current momentum by continuing to drive Responsible Growth globally and meeting client needs in the year ahead.",

To meet clients' diverse needs and maintain the highest level of service as we helped them navigate the changes 2020 presented, our advisors created new ways to deliver innovative solutions and the power of Bank of America's capabilities and technology. As a result, we forged even deeper, more meaningful connections with our existing clients, while adding thousands of new relationships - and improving client satisfaction across the board.\n\n## Running a relationship business when people can't come together\n\nAs the environment changed, our wealth management businesses quickly transitioned to connecting with clients in new ways, including meeting virtually. Through rapid deployment of Webex video conferencing, 25,000 wealth teammates held approximately 375,000 virtual client meetings - five times more than the year before engaging clients in wealth, estate and philanthropic planning conversations. Our teams also stayed connected virtually, setting strategy, sharing peer-to-peer learning and insights and recognizing success in new ways.\n\n## Expanding digital capabilities to meet clients' needs\n\nThroughout the year, we added a steady stream of digital enhancements to transform how we deliver advice and service. Working closely with our clients, we empowered them to embrace our digital innovations so they could access information, execute transactions and seamlessly collaborate with their advisors.\n\nFor example, clients now use Mobile Easy Sign digital signatures for more than 80% of account opening and maintenance tasks. Through the Client Engagement Work Station, advisors can view all critical information regarding clients' accounts which helps deliver a great experience. Another innovation, the Personal Wealth Analysis, is a single tool connecting clients' goals to investment solutions.\n\nThe bank's digital leadership also made it easier for us to provide more comprehensive service. With one click, clients can deposit checks, make transfers, pay their mortgage and see their credit card activity. During 2020, 77% of wealth management clients used our online or mobile platforms and opened 107,000 bank accounts.\n\n## The importance of advice and guidance in a changing environment\n\nThroughout 2020, our clients and families expressed a greater need for comprehensive and personalized financial advice than at any time in the past. Our Chief Investment Office helped answer the call by providing valuable insights through its rapid-response commentaries, as well as through its industry-leading thought leadership and investment strategies, the latter comprising more than 100 managed investment platforms.\n\n## Building wealth management for the future\n\nIn 2020, we continued to carry out our vision to be our clients' trusted partners - providing support, helping them meet their needs and achieve their goals by providing helpful advice and service at every stage of their financial lives. We are led by advisor teams with a passion to serve and excel. Our exceptional colleagues are winning more top rankings than any other firm and multiple awards for their customer service and philanthropy expertise. And we are becoming more diverse, better reflecting the families, enterprises, institutions and communities we serve.\n\nWe believe Bank of America's wealth management businesses are strongly positioned for the future, ready to answer the next set of challenging questions that comes. We will continue to strive to be an industry leader, and we will judge our performance on our success in helping our clients achieve their goals.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We saw record-setting levels of use of our digital and electronic channels to conduct every element of our clients' business - investing, savings, all the way up to our large institutional customers.\n\nPeople are interested in virtual connectivity and its ability to augment and, in some cases, replace physical connectivity. Add in the fact that we had no choice but to connect virtually, and our digital capabilities really worked to our advantage. 2020 has shown us that digital adoption will continue to grow.\n\nOur clients' rapid adoption of digital capabilities was made possible by work we began a decade ago. Back then, we started to simplify and modernize our technology and infrastructure, an intensive transformation that would support our businesses, help reduce risk and improve our competitive cost position. Through that work, we removed $2 billion annually from our operating expenses while replacing core platforms to create modern operations.\n\n'Merrill benefits tremendously from the technology investments made by Bank of America over the past several years,' said Andy Sieg, president of Merrill Lynch Wealth Management. 'Our best-in-industry digital capabilities continue to set Merrill apart from the competition, enabling clients to work with us when they want, how they want, while providing the seamless experience they demand.'\n\nShared platforms and a common infrastructure across the enterprise brought together company data and emerging technology to improve service, drive speed to market and increase data accuracy, while decreasing risk and improving cost to serve our clients. Our modern infrastructure and simplified operations underscore the importance of smart investments. We continue to\n\ninvest approximately $3 billion annually in technology growth - especially in digital, mobile and online platforms.\n\nFurther driving the digital transformation is our culture of innovation. Last year, the bank ranked 108 th on the Intellectual Property Owners Association's list of the top 300 U.S. organizations receiving patents, our highest ranking ever. That ranking reflects our company's record-high 443 patents for innovations related to money transfers, bill payments, ATM transactions, check verification using augmented reality and authentication technology. The bank's patent portfolio consists of more than 4,600 patents and applications, resulting from the work of more than 5,700 inventors from 12 countries.\n\n'Innovating is essential to making life easier for our clients,' said Cathy Bessant, chief operations and technology officer. 'We do not have an innovation lab or an innovation team, because it's everyone's job. These numbers demonstrate our unmatched commitment to making sure innovation is part of our DNA.'\n\nDuring the world health crisis this past year, we realized the importance of connectivity, bandwidth and technical tools. We are using technology to bridge divides by helping to make sure connectivity is universal and equally available to all. We believe equity of access and service will drive economic mobility and equality going forward, and Bank of America will strive to be at the forefront of that change.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In /two.text/zero.text/two.text/zero.text, the efforts of our market presidents were more critical than ever, particularly in cities like Houston, Texas, that faced challenges on multiple fronts.\n\n'/two.text/zero.text/two.text/zero.text will be a year to remember,' said Hong Ogle, president of Bank of America Houston, who also leads the Central South Division for the Private Bank region, overseeing offices in Texas, Kansas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and the surrounding states. 'In addition to the health crisis, oil and gas price volatility added extra stress on Houston, the energy capital of the world. And, being the hometown to George Floyd pushed our city to the front lines of the racial justice movement.'\n\nThrough it all, Hong says, the team remained undeterred, rising to the challenge to support teammates, serve clients and help the Houston community. Hong is especially complimentary of the financial center teammates who expertly cared for clients who needed our support and services throughout the health crisis and of commercial banking client managers, financial advisors and personal bankers who rallied to help their clients manage through changing conditions.\n\nIntegrating our full capabilities for the benefit of each client is among the chief responsibilities of our market presidents, who help to ensure all lines of business are working together seamlessly.\n\nFor example, last year, Houston teammates in Business Banking and the Private Bank came together to help a /two.text/zero.text -year, Houston-based client sell their company to another client in Ohio. The Houston-based client manager connected the Texas client to a local Private Bank advisor, ultimately helping them entrust the proceeds of the sale, along with other assets, to the Private Bank. This interaction highlights the value and importance of integration across our businesses in markets across the country.\n\nIntegrating our capabilities and expertise influences how market presidents and their teams address challenges facing their communities. After our four-year, $/one.text billion commitment to drive racial equality and economic opportunity was announced, the Houston team went to work, partnering with local elected officials and community leaders to help ensure the collective resources were spent wisely.\n\nHong also feels a personal connection to the commitment the company has made to driving equality and helps further these efforts locally in the Houston community. She came to the U.S. from China when she was /two.text/four.text, and is a leader in several company diversity groups as well as the city's Greater Houston Partnership Racial Equity Committee. 'I feel a strong responsibility to help make sure dollars are spent where it makes a difference,' she said. 'It's not just about giving money - it's helping people and communities. And it's helping not just those individuals who benefit directly from these programs; it's also helping their families and future generations.'\n\nThis focus on clients and community led Bank of America to be named Large Corporation of the Year by the Association of Fundraising Professionals Greater Houston and Hong to be recognized as a Houston Business Journal Most Admired CEO in /two.text/zero.text/one.text/nine.text, accolades that reflect the team's work carrying forward the bank's mission while making an impact locally.",

At Bank of America, it was a year that strengthened our resolve to identify additional opportunities to support our teammates and address societal issues. Together, we continued driving progress, and we have much to be hopeful for as we look ahead. And importantly, in 2020 we were reminded how critical it is that we take care of ourselves, our families, our clients, our communities and each other.\n\nAs a company, we have a long history of supporting our teammates and their families by investing in their physical, emotional and financial well-being. In response to the global health crisis, we took significant steps to provide enhanced resources and benefits to help our teammates stay healthy and balance the competing priorities of work and home. Those benefits include access to virtual medical and behavioral consultations, robust emotional wellness training through our partnership with Thrive Global and child and adult care resources designed to help our teammates ensure their loved ones were cared for. You can read more about our support for teammates on page 15.\n\nWe also felt the urgency to address the ongoing impacts of racial inequality in the communities where we live and work. While diversity and inclusion is and has been core to our values as a company for multiple decades, it was a year in which we needed to bring together our efforts with our teammates and marry those with the work we do with our communities and clients.

And from last year, we learned incredible lessons: thanks to our teammates, our ability to remain resilient and the importance of our decade-long commitment to Responsible Growth, we were able to serve our clients and communities when they needed us most.

In addition, we continue to share metrics on diverse representation across our company, a practice we have had in place for many years.

The global health crisis has exposed longstanding disparities in our society and inspired one of the greatest social justice movements in modern history.\n\nThese realities strengthened our resolve and inspired our work to right the injustices we've witnessed. We have a greater clarity of purpose for where we want to go as a company and in the communities where we live and work - as well as the work we need to do to get there.\n\nThis starts with being a great place for our teammates to work, which is foundational to continuing to drive Responsible Growth. We know we must reflect the diversity of the clients and communities we serve and continue to take meaningful steps to ensure diverse representation at all levels of our company. Attracting diverse talent is a priority, and we achieve this through a variety of recruiting efforts, including through internships and campus programs, targeted partnerships with diverse organizations, support for military and veterans, and hiring and reskilling individuals from low-and-moderate income (LMI) communities. 'We know that just because you have diversity in representation does not mean you have inclusion. That's why we continue to work to ensure we have a culture where our teammates feel comfortable bringing who they are to work each day and why we offer equal access to opportunity\n\nat all levels of our company,' says our Chief Diversity & Inclusion and Talent Acquisition Officer Cynthia Bowman.\n\nWe also look to address societal priorities that impact communities around the world. In 2020, building on longstanding work underway, we made a $1 billion, four-year commitment to help drive racial equality and economic opportunity for people and communities of color with a focus on healthcare, jobs, small businesses and housing. We've also continued to deploy capital to businesses and communities in need of economic revitalization through CDFIs and issuing social bonds.\n\nAnother way we actively promote these principles is by engaging each other through courageous conversations sharing perspectives on our differences and establishing connections to create greater empathy and understanding. Last year, we held courageous conversations, reaching more than 165,000 employees with civil rights, social justice and inclusion leaders focused on racial, social and economic injustices.\n\nAs we look to the work and road ahead, investing in our teammates, our clients and communities will always be core to who we are and how we drive Responsible Growth. By first looking inward and holding ourselves accountable to increasing diversity across our teams, we will continue taking steps forward to help drive inclusion and meaningful progress in the communities we serve.",

This extends to how we support our clients through core lending and investments; equity and debt capital markets activities; the advisory services we offer; how we manage our supply chain and how we conduct our own operations. In /two.text/zero.text/two.text/zero.text, after meeting our goal to be carbon-neutral a year early, we finalized our commitment to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions before /two.text/zero.text/five.text/zero.text across all scopes of emissions including those from our operations, financing activities and supply chain.\n\nCentral to our purpose as a financial services company, we will need to assist our clients in their own carbon reduction journey. To accelerate our sustainable finance work and help create a consistent perspective across all of our capabilities and product offerings, in January /two.text/zero.text/two.text/zero.text, we established the Sustainable Markets Committee, which I co-chair along with Chief Operating Officer Tom Montag. To lead this effort, we named Karen Fang as the Global Head of Sustainable Finance. Karen and I sat down recently to talk about our progress, the business, and our goals for /two.text/zero.text/two.text/one.text.\n\nAnne: Karen, we have developed a leadership position in clean energy finance, and we will discuss that later. This year, though, we saw particular interest in other aspects of sustainable finance, against a backdrop of economic and social challenges during the global health crisis. We mobilized and deployed approximately $/one.text/zero.text/zero.text billion of sustainable finance capital aligned with the United Nations (U.N.) SDGs in /two.text/zero.text/two.text/zero.text, a significant increase from /two.text/zero.text/one.text/nine.text despite the global challenges,\n\nwith approximately $/five.text/five.text billion allocated to climate finance. In addition, approximately $/four.text/five.text billion was allocated to Inclusive Development. This includes our significant lending and investing in affordable housing, healthcare, education and other social infrastructure as a part of our support for local communities across the U.S. Also included are the deposits and equity capital we provided to CDFIs and MDIs, and equity and fund investments into minority-owned businesses as a part of our $/one.text billion racial equality and economic opportunity initiative. And the global health crisis and associated challenges did offer the opportunity for some unique offerings by our company. Can you discuss that a little bit?\n\nKaren: Yes, we are particularly proud of two innovative transactions we completed in /two.text/zero.text/two.text/zero.text for Bank of America that demonstrate the creativity and strength of collaboration across many of our lines of business in an effort to deliver for our clients. In May /two.text/zero.text/two.text/zero.text, we issued a $/one.text billion corporate social bond focused on the coronavirus response, the first such",

This bond was designed to provide targeted lending to healthcare institutions that are on the front lines of combatting the health crisis, and it paved the way for Bank of America to underwrite and distribute more than $/five.text/zero.text billion of social bonds for numerous governments, agencies and public companies. This speaks to our ability to scale capital deployment for important societal needs.\n\nIn September /two.text/zero.text/two.text/zero.text, we issued a $/two.text billion equality progress sustainability bond to advance racial equality, economic opportunity and environmental sustainability. The social side of the proceeds were exclusively allocated to make new and impactful investments and lending in affordable housing, healthcare, and small businesses in Black and Hispanic-Latino communities. This first-of-its-kind transaction again inspired other issuers to follow similar approaches, scaling capital for wealth creation and socioeconomic empowerment of these communities.\n\nSome highlights on the environmental transition side include underwriting and distributing green and sustainability bonds, completing some of the largest asset finance transactions for renewable energy generation and providing financing and leasing solutions for energy efficiency projects and electric vehicles (EVs).\n\nBank of America's commitment to sustainable finance runs deeper than just doing transactions. Thanks to the commitment and leadership from you, our whole Management Team and all of our teammates, we are at the forefront of climate change thought leadership. We are key members of various global alliances focused on sustainable development, such as the U.N. Global Investors for Sustainable Development, the World Economic Forum Net-Zero Transition Finance Committee, His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales' Sustainable Markets Initiative, the Rocky Mountain Institute Center for Climate Aligned Finance and the /one.textt.org U.S. Steering Council, among others.\n\nAnne: Let's talk a little more about 'traditional' sustainable finance, if I can use that term since we've been at it now for so many years. We reached carbon neutrality in our own footprint and are on a path toward net-zero before /two.text/zero.text/five.text/zero.text. We have reduced our energy use by /four.text/zero.text% and our location-based GHG emissions by /five.text/zero.text%, sourced renewable energy to power our facilities, and purchased and retired carbon offsets for those final amounts of unavoidable emissions. In keeping with our focus on the environment, we even erected the first\n\nplatinum Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) skyscraper and continue to make progress in our own real estate footprint. So our own track record means we are well positioned to (i) have a comprehensive discussion with our clients about carbon neutrality and net-zero as a business imperative; (ii) encourage clients to establish a concrete and credible glide path plan to reduce their own carbon footprints; and (iii) offer clients advisory services and financial tools to support their decarbonization efforts toward net-zero.\n\nKaren: Exactly. In /two.text/zero.text/two.text/zero.text, we developed the '/four.text R's' approach to decarbonization for our corporate clients: Reduce, Renew, Retire, and Realign. We financed energy efficiency projects that helped clients reduce their energy usage; we helped shift clients' electricity footprints from fossil fuels to renewable energy by providing debt financing, tax equity and leasing capital for wind and solar power generation; we mobilized capital for more EV production and leasing; and we financed LEED-certified construction of office facilities and manufacturing sites. We are also helping develop a more robust, voluntary carbon-offset market.\n\nAnne: Whether it is Environmental Transition or Inclusive Development, our business focus has been to expand current activities and innovate to help advance emerging technologies. New domains and possibilities seem to be emerging at an ever faster pace. In the area of Environmental Transition, we are looking at solutions for the next frontier beyond wind, solar, and EVs including (i) clean hydrogen, fuel cells, sustainable aviation fuels and waste-to-energy; (ii) EV charging and battery infrastructure; (iii) nature and engineered solutions for carbon capture and offsets; and (iv) sustainable agriculture and better water infrastructure. Let's talk about what we're focused on in the Inclusive Development side of things.\n\nKaren: We'll continue to help advance racial and gender equality, support healthcare as we focus on continued coronavirus response and vaccine delivery, and investing in job training and reskilling. Certain projects that we are pursuing include working with developers to create affordable housing projects that incorporate more environmental and social sustainability features and materials. Also, we are expanding our supply chain financing and banking services to more minority-owned and operated businesses.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The area of these buildings is  6,900 square meters. Only U.S. sites are included in this analysis; U.S.  sites make up over 90% of Bank of America's real estate footprint.  Sites were overlaid on the U.S. Geological Survey's Protected Areas  Database (PADUS) to understand intersection with protected areas.     |\n| Air pollution | Air pollution:  Report wherever material along the value chain:  Nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulphur oxides (SOx), particulate matter  and other significant air emissions. Wherever possible, estimate  the proportion of specified emissions that occur in or adjacent  to urban/densely populated areas. | Bank of America's 2019 air pollution emissions (metric tons) are  as follows. These air pollution emissions are from all of our sites  globally and are not specific to urban/densely populated areas.

This figure was  calculated using the social cost factors of each pollutant as reported  in the World Resources Institute's Transport Emissions & Social Cost  Assessment (TESCA) Tool v1.0. These social cost factors are weighted  averages based on a meta-analysis of international academic studies. |\n\n*/two.text/zero.text/two.text/zero.text Environmental Data will be published in

These  statements  can be  identified  by  the  fact  that  they  do  not  relate  strictly  to historical  or  current  facts.  Forward-looking  statements often use words  such  as  'anticipates,'  'targets,'  'expects,'  'hopes,' 'estimates,' 'intends,' 'plans,' 'goals,' 'believes,' 'continue' and other  similar  expressions  or  future  or  conditional  verbs  such  as 'will,'  'may,'  'might,'  'should,'  'would'  and  'could.'  Forwardlooking statements represent the Corporation's current expectations,  plans  or  forecasts  of  its  future  results,  revenues, provision  for  credit  losses,  expenses,  efficiency  ratio,  capital measures, strategy and future business and economic conditions more generally, and other future matters. These statements are not  guarantees  of  future  results  or  performance  and  involve certain known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict and are often beyond the Corporation's control.  Actual  outcomes  and  results  may  differ  materially  from those  expressed  in,  or  implied  by,  any  of  these  forward-looking statements.\n\nYou should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statement  and  should  consider  the  following  uncertainties  and risks, as well as the risks and uncertainties more fully discussed under Item 1A. Risk Factors of our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K: the Corporation's potential judgments, damages, penalties, fines  and  reputational  damage  resulting  from  pending  or  future litigation,  regulatory  proceedings  and  enforcement  actions;  the possibility  that  the  Corporation's  future  liabilities  may  be  in excess  of  its  recorded  liability  and  estimated  range  of  possible loss  for  litigation,  and  regulatory  and  government  actions, including  as  a  result  of  our  participation  in  and  execution  of government  programs  related  to  the  Coronavirus  Disease  2019 (COVID-19)  pandemic;

At  December  31,  2020,  the  Corporation  had  $2.8 trillion  in  assets  and  a  headcount  of  approximately  213,000 employees.\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2020,  we  served  clients  through operations across the U.S., its territories and approximately 35 countries. Our retail banking footprint covers all major markets in  the  U.S.,  and  we  serve  approximately  66  million  consumer and  small  business  clients  with  approximately  4,300  retail financial  centers,  approximately  17,000  ATMs,  and  leading digital  banking  platforms  (www.bankofamerica.com)  with  more than 39 million active users, including approximately 31 million active  mobile  users.  We  offer  industry-leading  support  to approximately  three  million  small  business  households.  Our GWIM businesses, with client balances of $3.3 trillion, provide tailored  solutions  to  meet  client  needs  through  a  full  set  of investment management, brokerage, banking, trust and retirement  products.  We  are  a  global  leader  in  corporate  and investment banking and trading across a broad range of asset classes  serving  corporations,  governments,  institutions  and individuals around the world.\n\n## Recent Developments\n\n## Capital Management\n\nIn  June  2020,  the  Board  of  Governors  of  the  Federal  Reserve System  (Federal  Reserve)  notified  BHCs  of  their  2020 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) supervisory stress test results. Due to economic uncertainty resulting from the  Coronavirus  Disease  2019  (COVID-19)  pandemic  (the pandemic),  the  Federal  Reserve  required  all  large  banks  to update  and  resubmit  their  capital  plans  in  November  2020 based on the Federal Reserve's updated supervisory stress test scenarios. The results of the additional supervisory stress tests were published in December 2020.\n\nThe Federal Reserve also required large banks to suspend share  repurchase  programs  during  the  second  half  of  2020, except for repurchases to offset shares awarded under equitybased  compensation  plans,  and  to  limit  common  stock dividends  to  existing  rates  that  did  not  exceed  the  average  of the  last  four  quarters'  net  income.  In  December  2020,  the Federal Reserve announced that beginning in the first quarter of 2021,  large  banks  would  be  permitted  to  pay  common  stock dividends  at  existing  rates  and  to  repurchase  shares  in  an amount  that,  when  combined  with  dividends  paid,  does  not exceed the average of net income over the last four quarters.\n\nOn  January  19,  2021,  we  announced  that  the  Board  of Directors  (the  Board)  declared  a  quarterly  common  stock dividend  of  $0.18  per  share,  payable  on  March  26,  2021  to shareholders  of  record  as  of  March  5,  2021.  We  also announced  that  the  Board  authorized  the  repurchase  of  $2.9 billion in common  stock  through  March  31,  2021,  plus repurchases  to  offset  shares  awarded  under  equity-based compensation  plans  during  the  same  period,  estimated  to  be approximately  $300  million.  This  authorization  equals  the maximum amount allowed by the Federal Reserve for the period. For more information, see Capital Management on page 73.\n\n## COVID-19 Pandemic\n\nIn  the  first  quarter  of  2020,  the  World  Health  Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic. In an attempt to contain the spread and impact of the pandemic, travel bans and restrictions,  quarantines,  shelter-in-place  orders  and  other limitations on business activity were implemented. Additionally, there  has  been  a  decline  in  global  economic  activity,  reduced U.S.  and  global  economic  output  and  a  deterioration  in macroeconomic  conditions  in  the  U.S.  and  globally.  This  has\n\n48\n\nBank of America 2020\n\nresulted in, among other things, higher rates of unemployment and  underemployment  and  caused  volatility  and  disruptions  in the global financial markets, including the energy and commodity markets. Although vaccines have been approved for immunization  against  COVID-19  in  certain  countries  and restrictive measures  have  been  eased  in  certain  areas, COVID-19 cases have significantly increased in recent months in the  U.S.  and  many  regions  of  the  world  compared  to  earlier levels. Businesses, market participants, our counterparties and clients,  and  the  U.S.  and  global  economies  have  been negatively  impacted  and  are  likely  to  be  so  for  an  extended period  of  time,  as  there  remains  significant  uncertainty  about the timing and strength of an economic recovery.\n\nTo address the economic impact in the U.S., in March and April  2020, four economic stimulus packages were enacted to provide  relief  to  businesses  and  individuals,  including  the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act). Among other measures, the CARES Act established the  Small Business  Administration  (SBA)  Paycheck  Protection  Program (PPP),  which  provides  loans  to  small  businesses  to  keep  their employees  on  payroll  and  make  other  eligible  payments.  The original  funding  for  the  PPP  under  the  CARES  Act  was  fully allocated  by  mid-April  2020,  with  additional  funding  made available  on  April  24,  2020  under  the  Paycheck  Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act. In December 2020, an additional economic stimulus package was included as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021  (the Consolidated  Appropriations  Act),  which  provides  relief  to individuals  and  businesses.  This  relief  included  additional funding  for  the  PPP  under  the  Economic  Aid  to  Hard-Hit  Small Businesses, Nonprofits, and Venues Act (the Economic Aid Act).\n\nIn response  to  the  pandemic,  the  Corporation  has implemented protocols and processes to execute its business continuity plans and help protect its employees and support its clients.  The  Corporation  is  managing  its  response  to  the pandemic  according  to  its  Enterprise  Response  Framework, which invokes centralized management of the crisis event and the  integration  of  its  response.  The  CEO  and  key  members  of the  Corporation's  management  team  meet  regularly  with  coleaders of the Executive Response Team, which is composed of senior  executives  across  the  Corporation,  to  help  drive decisions, communications and consistency of response across all  businesses  and  functions.  We  are  also  coordinating  with global,  regional  and  local  authorities  and  health  experts, including  the  U.S.  Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization.\n\nAdditionally,  we  have  implemented a number of measures to assist our employees, clients and the communities we serve as discussed below.\n\n## Employees\n\nWe are providing support to our teammates to help promote the health  and  safety  of  our  employees  and  help  to  ensure  our protocols  remain  aligned  to  current  guidance  by  monitoring guidance from the CDC, medical boards and health authorities and  sharing  such  guidance  with  our  employees.  We  are  also operating our businesses from remote locations and leveraging our business continuity plans and capabilities.\n\nThe Corporation has globally implemented a work-from-home posture,  which  has  resulted  in  the  substantial  majority  of  our employees  working  from  home,  and  pre-planned  contingency strategies for site-based operations for our remaining employees.  We  continue  to  evaluate  our  continuity  plans  and work-from-home strategy in an effort to best protect the health and safety of our employees.",

We  are also participating in the programs created by the CARES Act and Federal  Reserve  lending  programs  for  businesses,  including originating  PPP  loans.  We  have  also  participated  in  the  Main Street Lending Program, which ended on January 8, 2021. While most  of  our  deferral  programs  expired  in  the  third  quarter  of 2020, we continue to offer assistance on a case-by-case basis when requested by clients affected by the pandemic.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 332,000 PPP  loans  outstanding  with  a  carrying  value  of  $22.7  billion, which were recorded in the Consumer , GWIM and Global Banking segments.  Since  the  PPP's  inception  through  February  17, 2021, borrowers have submitted applications for forgiveness to us for approximately 113,000 PPP loans with balances totaling $10.9  billion.  We  have  submitted  approximately  72,000  PPP loans  with  balances  totaling  $8.5  billion  to  the  SBA  for repayment,  of  which  we  have  received  to  date  $5.4  billion  in repayment from the SBA. Additionally, as of February 17, 2021, we have originated $4.1 billion in PPP loans under the Economic Aid  Act.  For  more  information  on  PPP  loans,  see  Credit  Risk Management  on  page  84,  and  for  more  information  on accounting  for  PPP  loans  and  loan  modifications  under  the CARES  Act,  see Note  1  -  Summary  of  Significant  Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Community Partners\n\nWe continue to support the communities where we live and work by  engaging  in  various  initiatives  to  help  those  affected  by COVID-19.  These  initiatives  include  committing  resources  to provide medical supplies, food and other necessities for those in  need.  We  are  also  supporting  racial  equality,  economic opportunity  and  environmental  sustainability  through  direct equity  investments  in  minority-owned  depository  institutions, equity  investments  in  minority  entrepreneurs,  businesses  and funds, as well as other initiatives.\n\n## Risk Management\n\nWe continue to manage the increased operational risk related to the  execution  of  our  business  continuity  plans  in  accordance with  our  Enterprise  Response Framework, Risk Framework and Operational  Risk  Management  Program.  For  more  information, see Managing Risk on page 70.\n\n## Loan Modifications\n\nThe  Corporation  has  implemented  various  consumer  and commercial loan modification programs to provide its borrowers relief  from  the  economic  impacts  of  COVID-19.  Based  on guidance  in  the  CARES  Act  that  the  Corporation  adopted, COVID-19  related  modifications  to  consumer  and  commercial loans that were current as of December 31, 2019 are exempt from  troubled  debt  restructuring  (TDR)  classification  under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America  (GAAP).  In  addition,  the  bank  regulatory  agencies issued  interagency  guidance  stating  that  COVID-19  related short-term  modifications  (i.e.,  six  months  or  less)  granted  to consumer or commercial loans that were current as of the loan modification  program  implementation  date  are  not  TDRs.  In December 2020, the Consolidated Appropriations Act amended the CARES  Act  by  extending  the  exemption  from  TDR classification for COVID-19 related modifications from December 31, 2020 to the earlier of January 1, 2022 or 60 days after the national emergency has ended. For more information, see Note\n\n- 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Note 5 Outstanding Loans and Leases and Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements .\n\nWe have  provided  borrowers  with  relief  from  the  economic impacts of COVID-19 through payment deferral and forbearance programs.  A  significant  portion  of  deferrals  expired  during  the second half of 2020, reflecting a decline in customer requests for  assistance.  As  of  February  17,  2021,  deferred  consumer and small business loans recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet  totaled  $6.8  billion,  predominantly  consisting  of  $6.4 billion of residential mortgage and home equity loans, including loans serviced by others, that are well-collateralized.\n\n## Other Related Matters\n\nAlthough the macroeconomic outlook improved modestly during the second half of 2020, the future direct and indirect impact of COVID-19 on our businesses, results of operations and financial condition  of  the  Corporation  remains  highly  uncertain.  Should current economic  conditions  persist  or  deteriorate, this macroeconomic  environment  will  have  a  continued  adverse effect  on  our  businesses  and  results  of  operations  and  could have  an  adverse  effect  on  our  financial  condition.  For  more information  on  how  the  risks  related  to  the  pandemic  may adversely  affect  our  businesses,  results  of  operations  and financial  condition,  see  Item  1A.  Risk  Factors  of  our  2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rates\n\nFollowing  the  2017  announcement  by  the  U.K.'s  Financial Conduct  Authority  (FCA)  that  it  would  no  longer  compel participating  banks  to  submit  rates  for  the  London  Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) after 2021, regulators, trade associations and financial industry working groups have identified recommended  replacement  rates  for  LIBOR,  as  well  as  other Interbank Offered Rates (IBORs), and have published recommended conventions to allow new and existing products to  incorporate  fallbacks  or  that  reference  these  Alternative Reference  Rates  (ARRs).  The  continuation  of  all  British  Pound Sterling,  Euro,  Swiss  Franc  and  Japanese  Yen  LIBOR  settings and one-week and two-month U.S. dollar LIBOR settings on the current basis are expected to terminate at the end of December 2021,  and  the  remaining  U.S.  dollar  LIBOR  settings  (i.e., overnight,  one  month,  three  month,  six  month  and  12  month) are expected to terminate at the end of June 2023.\n\nAs  a  result  of  this  and  other  announcements,  financial benchmark reforms, regulatory guidance and changes in shortterm  interbank  lending  markets  more  generally,  a  major transition is in progress in global financial markets with respect to  the  replacement  of  IBORs  and  certain  benchmarks.  The transition of IBORs to ARRs is a complex process impacting a variety  of  global  financial  markets  and  our  business  and operations.\n\nIBORs are used in many of the Corporation's products and contracts,  including  derivatives,  consumer  and  commercial loans,  mortgages,  floating-rate  notes  and  other  adjustable-rate products  and  financial  instruments.  The  discontinuation  of IBORs  requires  us  to  transition  a  significant  number  of  IBORbased  products  and  contracts,  including  related  hedging arrangements.  In  response,  the  Corporation  established  an enterprise-wide IBOR transition program led by senior management in early 2018. This program, which is led by the Corporation's Chief Operating Officer, includes active involvement  of  senior  management  and  regular  reports  to  the Enterprise  Risk  Committee  (ERC).  The  program  is  intended  to address the Corporation's industry and regulatory engagement, client  and  financial  contract  changes,  internal  and  external\n\nBank of America 2020\n\n49",

In  addition,  the  program  is designed to monitor a variety of scenarios, including operational risks  associated  with  insufficient  preparation  by  individual market  participants  or  the  overall  market  ecosystem,  volatility along  the  Secured  Overnight  Financing  Rate  (SOFR)  curve, development  and  adoption  of  credit-sensitive  and  other  rates, regulatory and legal uncertainty with respect to various matters including  contract  continuity,  access  by  market  participants  to liquidity in certain  products,  and  IBOR  continuity  beyond December 2021.\n\nAs  of  February  1,  2021,  a  significant  majority  of  the aggregate  notional  amount  of  our  LIBOR-based  products  and contracts maturing after 2021 include or have been updated to include  fallbacks  to  ARRs  based  on  market  driven  protocols, regulatory guidance and industry-recommended fallback provisions and related mechanisms. For certain of the remaining products  and  contracts,  the  transition  will  be  more  complex, particularly  where  there  is  no  industry-wide  protocol  or  similar mechanism. The Corporation is executing transition plans that are  intended  to  be  in  line  with  applicable  major  industry-wide IBOR  product  cessation  and  launch  milestones  recommended by  the  Alternative  Reference  Rates  Committee,  a  group  of private market participants and official sector entities convened by  the  Federal  Reserve  and  the  Federal  Reserve  Bank  of  New York, and the Bank of England Sterling Risk Free Rate Working Group, other than the cessation of LIBOR-based adjustable-rate consumer mortgages. The Corporation plans to no longer offer these  mortgages  and  launch  SOFR-based  adjustable-rate consumer mortgages by the end of the first quarter of 2021.\n\nThe  Corporation  is  executing  product  and  client  roadmaps that it believes align with industry-recommended and regulatory milestones,  and  the  Corporation  has  developed  employee training programs as well as other internal and external sources of information on the various challenges and opportunities that the  replacement of IBORs presents. As the transition to ARRs evolves, the Corporation continues to monitor and participate in the  development  and  usage  of  certain  ARRs,  including  SOFR, the  Euro  Short  Term  Rate  and  the  Sterling  Overnight  Index Average (SONIA). The Corporation's key transition efforts to date include  issuances  of  debt  and  deposits  linked  to  SOFR  and SONIA by the  Corporation, facilitating debt issuances  linked  to ARRs  by  clients  and  secondary  market  liquidity  for  products linked to ARRs, originating and arranging loans linked to ARRs, including  hedging  arrangements,  executing,  trading,  market making  and  clearing  ARR-based  derivatives,  and  launching capabilities and services to support the issuance and trading in products indexed to certain ARRs. The Corporation updated its operational models, systems, procedures and internal infrastructure  in  connection  with  the  transition  to  ARRs  by  the central clearing counterparties. In October 2020, the Corporation  and  certain  of  its  subsidiaries  adhered  to  the International  Swaps  and  Derivatives  Association,  Inc.  2020 IBOR  Fallbacks  Protocol,  effective  January  25,  2021,  which provides  a  mechanism  to  enable  market  participants  to incorporate  fallbacks  for  certain  legacy  non-cleared  derivatives linked to certain IBORs.\n\nAdditionally,  the  Corporation  is  continuing  to  evaluate potential regulatory, tax and  accounting  impacts  of  the transition, including guidance published and/or proposed by the Internal  Revenue  Service  and  Financial  Accounting  Standards Board, engage impacted clients in connection with the transition to  ARRs  and  work  actively  with  global  regulators,  industry working groups and trade associations to develop strategies for\n\n50\n\nBank of America 2020\n\nan  effective  transition  to  ARRs.  For  more  information  on  the expected replacement of LIBOR and other benchmark rates, see Item 1A. Risk Factors of our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## U.K. Exit from the EU\n\nOn  January  31,  2020,  the  U.K.  formally  exited  the  European Union (EU), and a transition period began during which time the U.K. and the EU negotiated a trade agreement and other terms associated  with  their  future  relationship.  The  transition  period ended on December 31, 2020.\n\nWe conduct business in Europe, the Middle East and Africa primarily through our subsidiaries in the U.K., Ireland and France and implemented changes to enable us to continue to operate in the region, including establishing a bank and broker-dealer in the  EU,  as  well  as  minimize  the  potential  for  any  operational disruption.  As  the  global  economic  impact  of  the  U.K.'s withdrawal  from  the  EU  remains  uncertain  and  could  result  in regional and global financial market disruptions, we continue to assess  potential  operational,  regulatory  and  legal  risks.  For more information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors of our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Financial Highlights\n\nEffective  January  1,  2020,  we  adopted  the  new  accounting standard on current expected credit losses (CECL), under which the  allowance  is  measured  based  on  management's  best estimate  of  lifetime  expected  credit  losses  (ECL).  Prior-year periods presented reflect measurement of the allowance based on management's estimate of probable incurred credit losses. For  more  information,  see Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nTable 1  Summary Income Statement and Selected Financial Data\n\n| (Dollars in millions, except per share information)          | 2020       | 2019       |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Income statement                                             |            |            |\n| Net interest income                                          | $ 43,360   | $  48,891  |\n| Noninterest income                                           | 42,168     | 42,353     |\n| Total revenue, net of interest expense                       | 85,528     | 91,244     |\n| Provision for credit losses                                  | 11,320     | 3,590      |\n| Noninterest expense                                          | 55,213     | 54,900     |\n| Income before income taxes                                   | 18,995     | 32,754     |\n| Income tax expense                                           | 1,101      | 5,324      |\n| Net income                                                   | 17,894     | 27,430     |\n| Preferred stock dividends                                    | 1,421      | 1,432      |\n| Net income applicable to common  shareholders                | $ 16,473   | $  25,998  |\n| Per common share information                                 |            |            |\n| Earnings                                                     | $ 1.88     | $ 2.77     |\n| Diluted earnings                                             | 1.87       | 2.75       |\n| Dividends paid                                               | 0.72       | 0.66       |\n| Performance ratios                                           |            |            |\n| Return on average assets  (1)                                | 0.67 %     | 1.14 %     |\n| Return on average common shareholders'  equity  (1)          | 6.76       | 10.62      |\n| Return on average tangible common  shareholders' equity  (2) | 9.48       | 14.86      |\n| Efficiency ratio  (1)                                        | 64.55      | 60.17      |\n| Balance sheet at year end                                    |            |            |\n| Total loans and leases                                       | $  927,861 | $  983,426 |\n| Total assets                                                 | 2,819,627  | 2,434,079  |\n| Total deposits                                               | 1,795,480  | 1,434,803  |\n| Total liabilities                                            | 2,546,703  | 2,169,269  |\n| Total common shareholders' equity                            | 248,414    | 241,409    |\n| Total shareholders' equity                                   | 272,924    | 264,810    |",

The  decline  in  net  income  was  primarily  due  to  higher provision  for  credit  losses  driven  by  the  weaker  economic outlook related to COVID-19 and lower net interest income.\n\nFor  discussion  and  analysis  of  our  consolidated  and business segment results of operations for 2019 compared to 2018,  see  the  Financial  Highlights  and  Business  Segment Operations  sections  in  the  MD&A  of  the  Corporation's  2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Net Interest Income\n\nNet  interest  income  decreased  $5.5  billion  to  $43.4  billion  in 2020 compared to 2019. Net interest yield on a fully taxableequivalent (FTE) basis decreased 53 basis points (bps) to 1.90 percent  for  2020.  The  decrease  in  net  interest  income  was primarily  driven  by  lower  interest  rates,  partially  offset  by reduced  deposit  and  funding  costs,  the  deployment  of  excess deposits  into  securities  and  an  additional  day  of  interest accrual. Assuming continued economic improvement and based on the forward interest rate curve as of January 19, 2021, when we  announced  quarterly  and  annual  results  for  the  periods ended December 31, 2020, we expect net interest income to be higher  in  the  second  half  of  2021  as  compared  to  both  the second  half  of  2020  and  the  first  half  of  2021.  For  more information  on  net  interest  yield  and  the  FTE  basis,  see Supplemental  Financial  Data  on  page  54,  and  for  more information on interest rate risk management, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book on page 105.\n\n## Noninterest Income\n\n## Table 2  Noninterest Income\n\nTable 4  Income Tax Expense\n\n| (Dollars in millions)                | 2020     | 2019     |\n|--------------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| Fees and commissions:                |          |          |\n| Card income                          | $ 5,656  | $ 5,797  |\n| Service charges                      | 7,141    | 7,674    |\n| Investment and brokerage services    | 14,574   | 13,902   |\n| Investment banking fees              | 7,180    | 5,642    |\n| Total fees and commissions           | 34,551   | 33,015   |\n| Market making and similar activities | 8,355    | 9,034    |\n| Other income                         | (738)    | 304      |\n| Total noninterest income             | $ 42,168 | $ 42,353 |\n\nNoninterest income decreased $185 million to $42.2 billion in 2020 compared to 2019. The following highlights the significant changes.\n\n- \u00b7 Card income decreased $141 million primarily due to lower levels  of  consumer  spending  driven  by  the  impact  of COVID-19,  partially  offset  by  higher  income  related  to  the processing of unemployment insurance.\n- \u00b7 Service  charges  decreased  $533  million  primarily  due  to higher deposit balances and lower client activity due to the impact of COVID-19.\n- \u00b7 Investment and brokerage services income increased $672 million  primarily  due  to  higher  client  transactional  activity, higher  market  valuations  and  assets  under  management (AUM) flows, partially offset by declines in AUM pricing.\n- \u00b7 Investment  banking  fees  increased  $1.5  billion  primarily driven by higher equity issuance fees.\n- \u00b7 Market making and similar activities decreased $679 million primarily  due  to  the  impact  of  lower  U.S.  interest  rates  on certain  risk  management  derivatives,  partially  offset  by increased  client  activity  and  strong  trading  performance  in fixed income, currencies and commodities (FICC).\n- \u00b7 Other income decreased $1.0 billion primarily due to lower equity investment income, higher partnership losses on tax credit investments, primarily affordable housing and renewable  energy,  partially  offset  by  higher  gains  on  loan sales and sales of debt securities.\n\n## Provision for Credit Losses\n\nThe provision for credit losses increased $7.7 billion to $11.3 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily driven by higher ECL due  to  a  weaker  economic  outlook  related  to  COVID-19.  For more  information  on  the  provision  for  credit  losses,  see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 99.\n\n## Noninterest Expense\n\n## Table 3  Noninterest Expense\n\n| (Dollars in millions)                     | 2020     | 2019     |\n|-------------------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| Compensation and benefits                 | $ 32,725 | $ 31,977 |\n| Occupancy and equipment                   | 7,141    | 6,588    |\n| Information processing and communications | 5,222    | 4,646    |\n| Product delivery and transaction related  | 3,433    | 2,762    |\n| Marketing                                 | 1,701    | 1,934    |\n| Professional fees                         | 1,694    | 1,597    |\n| Other general operating                   | 3,297    | 5,396    |\n| Total noninterest expense                 | $ 55,213 | $ 54,900 |\n\nNoninterest expense increased $313 million to $55.2 billion in 2020  compared  to  2019.  The  increase  was  primarily  due  to higher operating costs related to COVID-19, merchant services expenses,  which  were  previously  recorded  in  other  income  as part  of  joint  venture  net  earnings,  and  higher  activity-based expenses  due  to  increased  client  activity,  partially  offset  by  a $2.1  billion  pretax  impairment  charge  related  to  the  notice  of termination of the merchant services joint venture in 2019.\n\n## Income Tax Expense\n\n| (Dollars in millions)      | 2020      | 2019      |\n|----------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Income before income taxes | $  18,995 | $  32,754 |\n| Income tax expense         | 1,101     | 5,324     |\n| Effective tax rate         | 5.8 %     | 16.3 %    |\n\nIncome  tax  expense  was  $1.1  billion  for  2020  compared  to $5.3  billion  in  2019,  resulting  in  an  effective  tax  rate  of  5.8 percent compared to 16.3 percent.\n\nBank of America 2020\n\n51",

        "page_content": "The change in the effective tax rate for 2020 was driven by the  impact  of  our  recurring  tax  preference  benefits  on  lower levels of pretax income. These benefits primarily consist of tax credits  from  environmental,  social  and  governance  (ESG) investments  in  affordable  housing  and  renewable  energy, aligning with our responsible growth strategy to address global sustainability  challenges.  Excluding  tax  credits  related  to  our ESG investment activity,  the  effective  tax  rate  for  2020  would have been 21 percent.\n\nThe 2020 rate also included the impact of the U.K. tax law change, whereby on July 22, 2020, the U.K. enacted a repeal of the  final  two  percent  of  scheduled  decreases  in  the  U.K. corporation  tax  rate,  which  had  been  previously  enacted.

The increase  in  assets  was  primarily  due  to  higher  cash  held  at central banks that was primarily funded by deposit growth and debt securities, partially offset by a decline in loans and leases.\n\n## Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents increased $218.9 billion driven by deposit growth .\n\n## Federal Funds Sold and Securities Borrowed or Purchased Under Agreements to Resell\n\nFederal funds transactions involve lending reserve balances on a  short-term  basis.  Securities  borrowed  or  purchased  under agreements  to  resell  are  collateralized  lending  transactions utilized  to  accommodate  customer  transactions,  earn  interest rate  spreads,  and  obtain  securities  for  settlement  and  for collateral.  Federal  funds  sold  and  securities  borrowed  or purchased  under  agreements  to  resell  increased  $29.5  billion primarily due to deployment of deposit inflows.\n\n52\n\nBank of America 2020\n\n## Trading Account Assets\n\nTrading  account  assets  consist  primarily  of  long  positions  in equity  and  fixed-income  securities  including  U.S.  government and  agency  securities,  corporate  securities  and  non-U.S. sovereign debt. Trading account assets decreased $31.0 billion due to a decline in inventory within Global Markets .\n\n## Debt Securities\n\nDebt  securities  primarily  include  U.S.  Treasury  and  agency securities, mortgage-backed securities (MBS), principally agency MBS, non-U.S. bonds, corporate bonds and municipal debt. We use  the  debt  securities  portfolio  primarily  to  manage  interest rate  and  liquidity  risk  and  to  take  advantage  of  market conditions that create economically attractive returns on these investments. Debt securities increased $212.7 billion primarily driven  by  the  deployment  of  deposit  inflows.  For  more information  on  debt  securities,  see Note  4  -  Securities to  the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nearnings, and requires a reversal of the adjustment to the U.K. net  deferred  tax  assets  recognized  at  the  time  the  tax  rate decreases  were originally enacted. Accordingly,  during the third quarter of 2020, the Corporation recorded an income tax benefit of  approximately  $700  million  along  with  a  corresponding increase to the U.K. net deferred tax assets.\n\nThe  effective  tax  rate  for  2019  included  net  tax  benefits primarily  related  to  the  resolution  of  various  tax  controversy matters.\n\nAbsent  unusual  items,  we  expect  the  effective  tax  rate  for 2021  to  be  in  the  range  of  10 -12  percent,  reflecting  tax credits related to our ESG investment activity.",

        "page_content": "## Loans and Leases\n\nLoans  and  leases  decreased  $55.6  billion  primarily  driven  by commercial  loan  paydowns,  lower  credit  card  spending  and lower  residential  mortgages  due  to  higher  paydowns  and  a decline  in  originations.  For  more  information  on  the  loan portfolio, see Credit Risk Management on page 84.\n\n## Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses\n\nThe allowance for loan and lease losses increased $9.4 billion primarily  due  to  the  weaker  economic  outlook  related  to COVID-19 and the impact of the adoption of the new credit loss accounting  standard.  For  more  information,  see  Allowance  for Credit Losses on page 99.\n\n## Liabilities\n\nAt December 31, 2020, total liabilities were approximately $2.5 trillion,  up  $377.4  billion  from  December  31,  2019,  primarily due to deposit growth.\n\n## Deposits\n\nDeposits increased $360.7 billion primarily due to an increase in retail and wholesale deposits.\n\n## Federal Funds Purchased and Securities Loaned or Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase\n\nFederal  funds  transactions  involve  borrowing  reserve  balances on  a  short-term  basis.  Securities  loaned  or  sold  under agreements to repurchase are collateralized borrowing transactions  utilized  to  accommodate  customer  transactions, earn  interest  rate  spreads  and  finance  assets  on  the  balance sheet.  Federal  funds  purchased  and  securities  loaned  or  sold under agreements to repurchase increased $5.2 billion primarily driven by client activity within Global Markets .\n\n## Trading Account Liabilities\n\nTrading account liabilities consist primarily of short positions in equity  and  fixed-income  securities  including  U.S.  Treasury  and agency  securities,  corporate  securities  and  non-U.S.  sovereign debt. Trading  account  liabilities decreased  $12.0  billion primarily  due  to  lower  levels  of  short  positions  within Global Markets .\n\n## Short-term Borrowings\n\nShort-term borrowings provide an additional funding source and primarily consist of Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) short-term borrowings,  notes  payable  and  various  other  borrowings  that generally  have  maturities  of  one  year  or  less.  Short-term borrowings decreased $4.9 billion due to higher deposit levels. For  more information on short-term borrowings, see Note 10 Federal Funds Sold or Purchased, Securities Financing Agreements,  Short-term  Borrowings  and  Restricted  Cash to  the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Long-term Debt\n\nLong-term  debt  increased  $22.1  billion  primarily  due  to  debt issuances  and  valuation  adjustments,  partially  offset  by maturities and redemptions. For more information on long-term debt,  see Note  11  -  Long-term  Debt to  the  Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Shareholders' Equity\n\nShareholders'  equity  increased  $8.1  billion  driven  by  net income,  market  value  increases  on  debt  securities  and issuances of preferred and common stock, partially offset by the return  of  capital  to  shareholders  totaling  $14.7  billion  through share repurchases and common and preferred stock dividends, as  well  as  the  impact  of  the  adoption  of  the  new  credit  loss accounting standard and the redemption of preferred stock.\n\n## Cash Flows Overview\n\nThe  Corporation's  operating  assets  and  liabilities  support  our global  markets  and  lending  activities.  We  believe  that  cash flows from operations, available cash balances and our ability to generate cash through short- and long-term debt are sufficient to fund  our  operating  liquidity  needs.  Our  investing  activities primarily  include  the  debt  securities  portfolio  and  loans  and leases.  Our  financing  activities  reflect  cash  flows  primarily related  to  customer  deposits,  securities  financing  agreements and  long-term  debt.  For  more  information  on  liquidity,  see Liquidity Risk on page 80.\n\nBank of America 2020\n\n53",

        "page_content": "## Supplemental Financial Data\n\n## Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nIn  this  Form  10-K,  we  present  certain  non-GAAP  financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain items or  otherwise  include  components  that  differ  from  the  most directly  comparable  measures  calculated  in  accordance  with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures are provided as additional useful information to assess our financial condition, results of operations (including period-to-period operating performance) or compliance  with  prospective  regulatory  requirements.  These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended as a substitute for  GAAP  financial  measures  and  may  not  be  defined  or calculated the same way as non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.\n\nWe view net interest income and related ratios and analyses on an FTE basis, which when presented on a consolidated basis are non-GAAP financial measures. To derive the FTE basis, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt income on an equivalent  before-tax  basis  with  a  corresponding  increase  in income tax expense. For purposes of this  calculation,  we  use the federal statutory tax rate of 21 percent and a representative state  tax  rate.  Net  interest  yield,  which  measures  the  basis points  we  earn  over  the  cost  of  funds,  utilizes  net  interest income on an FTE basis. We believe that presentation of these items on an FTE basis allows for comparison of amounts from both  taxable  and  tax-exempt  sources  and  is  consistent  with industry practices.\n\nWe  may  present  certain  key  performance  indicators  and ratios excluding certain items (e.g., debit valuation adjustment (DVA)  gains  (losses))  which  result  in  non-GAAP  financial measures. We believe that the presentation of measures that exclude these items is useful because such measures provide additional  information  to  assess  the  underlying  operational performance and trends of our businesses and to allow better comparison of period-to-period operating performance.\n\nWe also evaluate our business based on certain ratios that utilize  tangible  equity,  a  non-GAAP  financial  measure.  Tangible equity represents shareholders' equity or common shareholders' equity reduced by goodwill and intangible assets (excluding  mortgage  servicing  rights  (MSRs)),  net  of  related deferred  tax  liabilities  (\"adjusted\"  shareholders'  equity  or common  shareholders'  equity).  These  measures  are  used  to evaluate our use of equity. In addition, profitability, relationship and  investment  models  use  both  return  on  average  tangible common  shareholders'  equity  and  return  on average tangible\n\n54\n\nBank of America 2020\n\nshareholders'  equity  as  key  measures  to  support  our  overall growth objectives. These ratios are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Return  on  average  tangible  common  shareholders'  equity measures our net income applicable to common shareholders as a percentage of adjusted average common shareholders'  equity.  The  tangible  common  equity  ratio represents  adjusted  ending  common  shareholders'  equity divided by total tangible assets.\n- \u00b7 Return  on  average  tangible  shareholders'  equity  measures our  net  income  as  a  percentage  of  adjusted  average  total shareholders'  equity.  The  tangible  equity  ratio  represents adjusted  ending  shareholders'  equity  divided  by  total tangible assets.\n- \u00b7 Tangible book value per common share represents adjusted ending  common  shareholders'  equity  divided  by  ending common shares outstanding.\n\nWe believe ratios utilizing tangible equity provide additional useful  information  because  they  present  measures  of  those assets  that  can  generate  income.  Tangible  book  value  per common share provides additional useful information about the level  of  tangible  assets  in  relation  to  outstanding  shares  of common stock.\n\nThe  aforementioned  supplemental  data  and  performance measures are presented in Tables 6 and 7.\n\nFor more information on the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures  to  the  corresponding  GAAP  financial measures, see Non-GAAP Reconciliations on page 111.\n\n## Key Performance Indicators\n\nWe present certain key financial and nonfinancial performance indicators (key performance indicators) that management uses when assessing our consolidated and/or segment results. We believe  they  are  useful  to  investors  because  they  provide additional information about our underlying operational performance  and  trends.  These  key  performance  indicators (KPIs)  may  not  be  defined  or  calculated  in  the  same  way  as similar KPIs used by other companies. For information on how these metrics are defined, see Key Metrics on page 196.\n\nOur consolidated key performance indicators, which include various equity and credit metrics, are presented in Table 1 on page 50 and/or Tables 6 and 7 on pages 55 and 56.\n\nFor  information  on  key  segment  performance  metrics,  see Business Segment Operations on page 59.",

We manage our segments and report their results on an FTE basis. The primary activities, products and businesses of the business segments and All Other are shown below.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe  periodically  review  capital  allocated  to  our  businesses and  allocate  capital  annually  during  the  strategic  and  capital planning processes. We utilize a methodology that considers the effect  of  regulatory  capital  requirements  in  addition  to  internal risk-based  capital  models.  Our  internal  risk-based  capital models  use  a  risk-adjusted  methodology  incorporating  each segment's credit, market, interest rate, business and operational  risk  components.

diversified range of credit, banking and investment products and services to consumers and small businesses.  Deposits  and  Consumer  Lending  include  the  net impact  of  migrating  customers  and  their  related  deposit, brokerage asset and loan balances between  Deposits, Consumer Lending and GWIM ,  as well as other client-managed businesses. Our customers and clients have access to a coast to coast network including financial centers in 38 states and the District of Columbia. Our network includes approximately 4,300 financial  centers,  approximately  17,000  ATMS,  nationwide  call centers  and  leading  digital  banking  platforms  with  more  than 39  million  active  users,  including  approximately  31  million active mobile users .\n\n## Consumer Banking Results .\n\nNet  income  for Consumer  Banking decreased  $6.5  billion  to $6.5 billion  in 2020  compared  to 2019 primarily due  to lower revenue, higher provision for credit losses and higher expenses. Net  interest  income  decreased  $3.5 billion  to  $24.7 billion\n\n60\n\nBank of America 2020\n\nprimarily  due  to  lower  rates,  partially  offset  by  the  benefit  of higher deposit and loan balances. Noninterest income decreased  $1.9  billion  to  $8.6  billion  driven  by  a  decline  in service  charges  primarily  due  to  higher  deposit  balances  and lower card income due to decreased client activity, as well as lower  other  income  due  to  the  allocation  of  asset  and  liability management (ALM) results.\n\nThe provision for credit losses increased $2.0 billion to $5.8 billion primarily due to the weaker economic outlook related to COVID-19. Noninterest expense increased $1.2 billion to $18.9 billion  primarily  driven  by  incremental  expense  to  support customers and employees during the pandemic, as well as the cost of increased client activity  and  continued  investments  for business growth, including the merchant services platform.\n\nThe  return  on  average  allocated  capital  was  17  percent, down  from  35  percent,  driven  by  lower  net  income  and,  to  a lesser  extent,  an  increase  in  allocated  capital.

Our deposit products include traditional  savings  accounts,  money  market  savings  accounts, CDs  and  IRAs,  and  noninterest- and  interest-bearing  checking accounts,  as  well  as  investment  accounts  and  products.  Net interest  income  is  allocated  to  the  deposit  products  using  our funds  transfer  pricing  process  that  matches  assets  and liabilities  with  similar  interest  rate  sensitivity  and  maturity characteristics.  Deposits  generates  fees  such  as  account service  fees,  non-sufficient  funds  fees,  overdraft  charges  and ATM fees, as well as investment and brokerage fees from Merrill Edge  accounts.  Merrill  Edge  is  an  integrated  investing  and banking service targeted at customers with less than $250,000 in  investable  assets.  Merrill  Edge  provides  investment  advice and  guidance,  client  brokerage  asset  services,  a  self-directed online investing platform and key banking capabilities including access  to  the  Corporation's  network  of  financial  centers  and ATMs.\n\nNet  income  for  Deposits  decreased  $4.1  billion  to  $4.2 billion  primarily  driven  by  lower  revenue.  Net  interest  income declined  $3.2  billion  to  $13.7  billion  primarily  due  to  lower interest  rates,  partially  offset  by  the  benefit  of  growth  in deposits.  Noninterest  income  decreased  $1.3  billion  to  $3.7 billion  primarily  driven  by  lower  service  charges  due  to  higher deposit balances and lower client activity related to the impact of COVID-19, as well as lower other income due to the allocation of ALM results.\n\nThe  provision  for  credit  losses  increased  $110  million  to $379  million  in  2020  due  to  the  weaker  economic  outlook related  to  COVID-19.  Noninterest  expense  increased  $790 million to $11.5 billion driven by continued investments in the business  and  incremental  expense  to  support  customers  and employees during the pandemic.\n\nAverage deposits increased $114.0 billion to $817.0 billion in  2020  driven  by  strong  organic  growth  of  $79.3  billion  in checking  and  time  deposits  and  $34.4  billion  in  traditional savings and money market savings.\n\nThe following  table  provides  key  performance  indicators  for Deposits.

We had a net increase of 12 financial centers as we continued to optimize our consumer banking network.\n\n## Consumer Lending\n\nConsumer  Lending  offers  products  to  consumers  and  small businesses across the U.S. The products offered include credit and debit cards, residential mortgages and home equity loans, and direct and indirect loans such as automotive, recreational vehicle and consumer personal loans. In addition to earning net interest  spread  revenue  on  its  lending  activities,  Consumer Lending  generates  interchange  revenue  from  credit  and  debit card transactions, late fees, cash advance fees, annual credit card fees, mortgage banking fee income and other miscellaneous  fees.  Consumer  Lending  products  are  available to  our  customers  through  our  retail  network,  direct  telephone, and online and mobile channels. Consumer Lending results also include the impact of servicing residential mortgages and home equity  loans  in  the  core  portfolio,  including  loans  held  on  the balance  sheet  of  Consumer  Lending  and  loans  serviced  for others.\n\nBank of America 2020\n\n61",

Noninterest expense increased $326 million primarily due to continued investments in the business, partially offset by lower revenue-related incentives.\n\nThe return on average allocated capital was eight percent in 2020 compared to 20 percent in 2019 due to lower net income and,  to  a  lesser  extent,  an  increase  in  allocated  capital.  For information on capital allocated to the business segments, see Business Segment Operations on page 59.\n\n## Global Corporate, Global Commercial and Business Banking\n\nGlobal  Corporate,  Global  Commercial  and  Business  Banking each include Business Lending and Global Transaction Services activities.  Business  Lending  includes  various  lending-related products and services, and related hedging activities, including commercial loans, leases, commitment facilities, trade finance, real estate lending and asset-based lending. Global Transaction Services  includes  deposits,  treasury  management,  credit  card, foreign exchange and short-term investment products.\n\nBank of America 2020\n\n65",

Global  Markets product coverage includes securities and derivative products in both  the  primary  and  secondary  markets. Global  Markets provides market-making, financing, securities clearing, settlement  and  custody  services  globally  to  our  institutional investor  clients  in  support  of  their  investing  and  trading activities.  We  also  work  with  our  commercial  and  corporate clients to provide risk management products using interest rate, equity,  credit,  currency  and  commodity  derivatives,  foreign exchange,  fixed-income  and  mortgage-related  products.  As  a result of our market-making activities in these products, we may be  required  to  manage  risk  in  a  broad  range  of  financial products  including  government  securities,  equity  and  equitylinked  securities,  high-grade  and  high-yield  corporate  debt securities,  syndicated  loans,  MBS,  commodities  and  assetbacked securities. The economics of certain investment banking and underwriting activities are shared primarily between Global Markets and Global  Banking under  an  internal  revenue-sharing arrangement. Global  Banking originates  certain  deal-related transactions with our corporate and commercial clients that are\n\nexecuted and distributed by Global Markets .  For information on investment banking fees on a consolidated basis, see page 66.\n\nThe  following  explanations  for  year-over-year  changes  for Global  Markets ,  including  those  disclosed  under  Sales  and Trading  Revenue,  are  the  same  for  amounts  including  and excluding net DVA. Amounts excluding net DVA are a non-GAAP financial  measure.  For  more  information  on  net  DVA,  see Supplemental Financial Data on page 54.\n\nNet income for Global Markets increased $1.7 billion to $5.2 billion.  Net  DVA losses were $133 million compared to losses of  $222  million  in  2019.  Excluding  net  DVA,  net  income increased  $1.7  billion  to  $5.4  billion.  These  increases  were primarily  driven  by  higher  revenue,  partially  offset  by  higher noninterest expense and provision for credit losses.\n\nRevenue  increased  $3.2  billion  to  $18.8  billion  primarily driven  by  higher  sales  and  trading  revenue  and  investment banking fees. Sales and trading revenue increased $2.3 billion, and excluding net DVA, increased $2.2 billion. These increases were driven by higher revenue across FICC and Equities.\n\nThe  provision  for  credit  losses  increased  $260  million primarily  due  to  the  weaker  economic  outlook  related  to COVID-19.

Year-end total assets decreased $25.2 billion to $616.6 billion driven by lower levels of inventory in FICC and increased hedging of client activity in Equities with derivative transactions relative to stock positions.\n\nThe return on average allocated capital was 15 percent, up from 10 percent, reflecting higher net income, partially offset by an increase in allocated capital.\n\n## Sales and Trading Revenue\n\nSales  and  trading  revenue  includes  unrealized  and  realized gains  and  losses  on  trading  and  other  assets  which  are included  in  market  making  and  similar  activities,  net  interest income,  and  fees  primarily  from  commissions  on  equity securities.  Sales  and  trading  revenue  is  segregated  into  fixedincome  (government  debt  obligations,  investment  and  noninvestment grade corporate debt obligations, commercial MBS, residential mortgage-backed  securities, collateralized loan obligations,  interest  rate  and  credit  derivative  contracts), currencies  (interest  rate  and  foreign  exchange  contracts), commodities  (primarily  futures,  forwards,  swaps  and  options) and equities (equity-linked derivatives and cash equity activity).

During 2020, total non-core loans decreased $3.0 billion to $12.6 billion due primarily to payoffs and paydowns, as well as Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loan conveyances and sales, partially offset by repurchases. For more information on the  composition  of  the  core  and  non-core  portfolios,  see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management on page 85.\n\nThe net loss for All  Other decreased $949 million to a net loss  of  $407  million,  primarily  due  to  a  $2.1  billion  pretax impairment  charge  related  to  the  notice  of  termination  of  the merchant services joint venture in 2019, partially offset by lower revenue and higher provision for credit losses.\n\nRevenue decreased $1.2 billion primarily due to extinguishment  losses  on  certain  structured  liabilities,  higher client-driven ESG  investment  activity, resulting in higher partnership  losses  on  these  tax-advantaged  investments,  and lower net interest income, partially offset by a gain on sales of mortgage loans.\n\nThe  provision  for  credit  losses  increased  $719  million  to $50 million  from  a  provision  benefit  of  $669  million  in  2019, primarily due to recoveries from sales of previously charged-off non-core  consumer  real  estate  loans  in  2019,  as  well  as  the weaker economic outlook related to COVID-19.\n\nNoninterest  expense  decreased  $2.3  billion  to  $1.4  billion primarily  due  to  the  $2.1  billion  pretax  impairment  charge  in 2019, partially offset by higher litigation expense.\n\nThe  income  tax  benefit  increased  $589  million  primarily driven  by  the  impact  of  the  U.K.  tax  law  change  and  a  higher level  of  income  tax  credits  related  to  our  ESG  investment activity, partially offset  by  the  positive  impact  from  the resolution  of  various  tax  controversy  matters  in  2019.  Both years included income tax benefit adjustments to eliminate the FTE treatment of certain tax credits recorded in Global Banking .\n\n## Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations\n\nWe  have  contractual  obligations  to  make  future  payments  on debt and lease agreements. Additionally, in the normal course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements whereby we\n\ncommit  to  future  purchases  of  products  or  services  from unaffiliated parties. Purchase  obligations  are  defined  as obligations  that  are  legally  binding  agreements  whereby  we agree to purchase products or services with a specific minimum quantity at a fixed, minimum or variable price over a specified period  of  time.  Included  in  purchase  obligations  are  vendor contracts, the most significant of which include communication services,  processing  services  and  software  contracts.  Debt, lease and other obligations are more fully discussed in Note 11 -Long-term  Debt and Note  12  -  Commitments  and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nOther  long-term  liabilities  include  our  contractual  funding obligations related to the Non-U.S.  Pension  Plans  and Nonqualified  and  Other  Pension  Plans  (together,  the  Plans). Obligations to the Plans are based on the current and projected obligations of the Plans, performance of the Plans' assets, and any  participant  contributions,  if  applicable.  During  2020  and 2019,  we  contributed  $115  million  and  $135  million  to  the Plans,  and  we  expect  to  make  $136  million  of  contributions during 2021. The Plans are more fully discussed in Note 17 Employee Benefit Plans to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nWe  enter  into  commitments  to  extend  credit  such  as  loan commitments, standby letters of credit (SBLCs) and commercial letters of credit to meet the financing needs of our customers. For a summary of the total unfunded, or off-balance sheet, credit extension commitment amounts by expiration date, see Credit Extension  Commitments  in Note  12  -  Commitments  and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nWe also utilize variable interest entities (VIEs) in the ordinary course of business to support our financing and investing needs as well as those of our customers. For more information on our involvement with unconsolidated VIEs, see Note 6 -Securitizations  and  Other  Variable  Interest  Entities to  the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nTable 10 includes certain contractual obligations at December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n\nTable 10  Contractual Obligations\n\n|                                                                     | December 31, 2020      | December 31, 2020                         | December 31, 2020                           | December 31, 2020     | December 31  2019   | December 31  2019   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| (Dollars in millions)                                               | Due in One  YearorLess | Due After  One Year  Through  Three Years | Due After  Three Years  Through  Five Years | Due After  Five Years | Total               | Total               |\n| Long-term debt                                                      | $ 20,352               | $ 50,824                                  | $ 48,568                                    | $  143,190            | $  262,934          | $  240,856          |\n| Operating lease obligations                                         | 1,927                  | 3,169                                     | 2,395                                       | 4,609                 | 12,100              | 11,794              |\n| Purchase obligations                                                | 551                    | 700                                       | 80                                          | 103                   | 1,434               | 3,530               |\n| Time deposits                                                       | 50,661                 | 3,206                                     | 426                                         | 1,563                 | 55,856              | 74,673              |\n| Other long-term liabilities                                         | 1,656                  | 1,092                                     | 953                                         | 781                   | 4,482               | 4,099               |\n| Estimated interest expense on long-term debt and time deposits  (1) | 4,542                  | 8,123                                     | 6,958                                       | 30,924                | 50,547              | 44,385              |\n| Total contractual obligations                                       | $ 79,689               | $ 67,114                                  | $ 59,380                                    | $  181,170            | $  387,353          | $  379,337          |\n\n## Representations and Warranties Obligations\n\nFor  information  on  representations  and  warranties  obligations  in  connection  with  the  sale  of  mortgage  loans,  see Note  12  Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nBank of America 2020\n\n69",

        "page_content": "## Managing Risk\n\nRisk  is  inherent  in  all  our  business  activities.  Sound  risk management enables us to serve our customers and deliver for our  shareholders.  If  not  managed  well,  risks  can  result  in financial loss, regulatory sanctions and penalties, and damage to our reputation, each of which may adversely impact our ability to  execute  our  business  strategies.  We  take  a  comprehensive approach  to  risk  management  with  a  defined  Risk  Framework and an articulated Risk Appetite Statement, which are approved annually by the ERC and the Board.\n\nThe  seven  key  types  of  risk  faced  by  the  Corporation  are strategic,  credit,  market,  liquidity,  compliance,  operational  and reputational.\n\n- \u00b7 Strategic  risk  is  the  risk  to  current  or  projected  financial condition arising from incorrect assumptions about external or internal factors, inappropriate business plans, ineffective business strategy execution, or failure to respond in a timely manner  to  changes  in  the  regulatory,  macroeconomic  or competitive  environments  in  the  geographic  locations  in which we operate.\n- \u00b7 Credit  risk  is  the  risk  of  loss  arising  from  the  inability  or failure of a borrower or counterparty to meet its obligations.\n- \u00b7 Market  risk  is  the  risk  that  changes  in  market  conditions may  adversely  impact  the  value  of  assets  or  liabilities,  or otherwise  negatively impact  earnings.  Market  risk  is composed of price risk and interest rate risk.\n- \u00b7 Liquidity risk is the inability to meet expected or unexpected cash  flow  and  collateral  needs  while  continuing  to  support our  businesses  and  customers  under  a  range  of  economic conditions.\n- \u00b7 Compliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, material  financial  loss  or  damage  to  the  reputation  of  the Corporation  arising  from  the  failure  of  the  Corporation  to comply with the requirements of applicable laws, rules and regulations and our internal policies and procedures.\n- \u00b7 Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or  failed  processes,  people  and  systems,  or  from  external events.\n- \u00b7 Reputational risk is the risk that negative perceptions of the Corporation's  conduct  or  business  practices  may  adversely impact its profitability or operations.\n\nThe  following  sections  address  in  more  detail  the  specific procedures, measures and analyses of the major categories of risk.  This  discussion  of  managing  risk  focuses  on  the  current Risk Framework that, as part of its annual review process, was approved by the ERC and the Board.\n\nAs set forth in our Risk Framework, a culture of managing risk well is fundamental to fulfilling our purpose and  our values and delivering responsible growth. It requires us to focus on risk in  all  activities  and  encourages  the  necessary  mindset  and behavior  to  enable  effective  risk  management,  and  promotes sound risk-taking within our risk appetite. Sustaining a culture of managing risk well throughout the organization is critical to our success and is a clear expectation of our executive management team and the Board.\n\nOur  Risk  Framework  serves  as  the  foundation  for  the consistent  and  effective  management  of  risks  facing  the Corporation.  The  Risk  Framework  sets  forth  clear  roles, responsibilities  and  accountability  for  the  management  of  risk and provides a blueprint for how the Board, through delegation of  authority  to  committees  and  executive  officers,  establishes risk appetite and associated limits for our activities.\n\n70\n\nBank of America 2020\n\nExecutive management assesses, with Board oversight, the risk-adjusted  returns  of  each  business.  Management  reviews and approves the strategic and financial operating plans, as well as  the  capital  plan  and  Risk  Appetite  Statement,  and recommends  them  annually  to  the  Board  for  approval.  Our strategic  plan  takes  into  consideration  return  objectives  and financial resources, which must align with risk capacity and risk appetite.  Management  sets  financial  objectives  for  each business by allocating capital and setting a target for return on capital  for  each  business.  Capital  allocations  and  operating limits are regularly evaluated as part of our overall governance processes as the businesses and the economic environment in which  we  operate  continue  to  evolve.  For  more  information regarding capital allocations, see Business Segment Operations on page 59.\n\nThe  Corporation's  risk  appetite  indicates  the  amount  of capital,  earnings  or  liquidity  we  are  willing  to  put  at  risk  to achieve our strategic objectives and business plans, consistent with  applicable  regulatory  requirements.  Our  risk  appetite provides a common and comparable set of measures for senior management  and  the  Board  to  clearly  indicate  our  aggregate level of risk and to monitor whether the Corporation's risk profile remains in alignment with our strategic and capital plans. Our risk  appetite  is  formally  articulated  in  the  Risk  Appetite Statement,  which  includes  both  qualitative  components  and quantitative limits.\n\nOur  overall  capacity  to  take  risk  is  limited;  therefore,  we prioritize  the  risks  we  take  in  order  to  maintain  a  strong  and flexible  financial  position  so  we  can  withstand  challenging economic  conditions  and  take  advantage  of  organic  growth opportunities.  Therefore,  we  set  objectives  and  targets  for capital and liquidity that are intended to permit us to continue to operate in a safe and sound manner, including during periods of stress.\n\nOur  lines  of  business  operate  with  risk  limits  (which  may include credit, market and/or operational limits, as applicable) that  align  with  the  Corporation's  risk  appetite.  Executive management  is responsible for tracking and reporting performance  measurements  as  well  as  any  exceptions  to guidelines  or  limits.  The  Board,  and  its  committees  when appropriate,  oversee  financial  performance,  execution  of  the strategic  and  financial  operating  plans,  adherence  to  risk appetite limits and the adequacy of internal controls.\n\nFor  a  more  detailed  discussion  of  our  risk  management activities, see the discussion below and pages 73 through 108.\n\nFor more information about the Corporation's risks related to the  pandemic,  see  Item  1A.  Risk  Factors  of  our  2020  Annual Report  on  Form  10-K.  These  COVID-19  related  risks  are  being managed  within  our  Risk  Framework  and  supporting  risk management programs.\n\n## Risk Management Governance\n\nThe Risk Framework describes delegations of authority whereby the  Board  and  its  committees  may  delegate  authority  to management-level  committees  or  executive  officers.  Such delegations may authorize certain decision-making and approval functions, which may be evidenced in, for example, committee charters, job descriptions, meeting minutes and resolutions.\n\nThe chart below illustrates the inter-relationship among the Board,  Board  committees  and  management  committees  that have  the  majority  of  risk  oversight  responsibilities  for  the Corporation.",

The Board authorizes management to maintain an effective  Risk  Framework,  and  oversees  compliance  with  safe and  sound  banking  practices.  In  addition,  the  Board  or  its committees  conduct  inquiries  of,  and  receive  reports  from management  on  risk-related  matters  to  assess  scope  or resource limitations that could impede the ability of Independent Risk  Management (IRM) and/or Corporate Audit to execute its responsibilities.  The  Board  committees  discussed  below  have the  principal  responsibility  for  enterprise-wide  oversight  of  our risk management activities. Through these activities, the Board and applicable committees are provided with information on our risk profile and oversee executive management addressing key risks  we  face.  Other  Board  committees,  as  described  below, provide additional oversight of specific risks.\n\nEach of the committees shown on the above chart regularly reports  to  the  Board  on  risk-related  matters  within  the committee's  responsibilities,  which  is  intended  to  collectively provide the Board with integrated insight about our management of enterprise-wide risks.\n\n## Audit Committee\n\nThe  Audit  Committee  oversees  the  qualifications,  performance and  independence  of  the  Independent  Registered  Public Accounting  Firm,  the  performance  of  our  corporate  audit function, the integrity of our consolidated financial statements, our  compliance  with  legal  and  regulatory  requirements,  and makes  inquiries  of  management  or  the  Chief  Audit  Executive (CAE)  to  determine  whether  there  are  scope  or  resource limitations that impede the ability of Corporate Audit to execute its responsibilities. The Audit Committee is also responsible for overseeing  compliance  risk  pursuant  to  the  New  York  Stock Exchange listing standards.\n\n## Enterprise Risk Committee\n\nThe  ERC  has  primary  responsibility  for  oversight  of  the  Risk Framework  and  key  risks  we  face  and  of  the  Corporation's overall  risk  appetite.  It  approves  the  Risk  Framework  and  the Risk  Appetite  Statement  and  further  recommends  these documents to the Board for approval. The ERC oversees senior management's responsibilities for the identification, measurement, monitoring and control of key risks we face. The\n\nERC  may  consult  with  other  Board  committees  on  risk-related matters.\n\n## Other Board Committees\n\nOur Corporate Governance, ESG, and Sustainability Committee oversees  our  Board's  governance  processes,  identifies  and reviews the qualifications of potential Board members, recommends nominees for election to our Board, recommends committee  appointments  for  Board  approval  and  reviews  our Environmental, Social and Governance and stockholder engagement activities.\n\nOur Compensation and Human Capital Committee oversees establishing,  maintaining  and  administering  our  compensation programs and employee benefit plans, including approving and recommending our Chief Executive Officer's (CEO) compensation to  our  Board  for  further  approval  by  all  independent  directors; reviewing and approving all of our executive officers' compensation,  as  well  as  compensation  for  non-management directors; and reviewing certain other human capital management topics.\n\n## Management Committees\n\nManagement  committees  may  receive  their  authority  from  the Board, a Board committee, another management committee or from one or more executive officers. Our primary management level risk committee is the Management Risk Committee (MRC). Subject  to  Board  oversight,  the  MRC  is  responsible  for management oversight of key risks facing the Corporation. This includes providing management oversight of our compliance and operational risk programs, balance sheet and capital management,  funding  activities  and  other  liquidity  activities, stress  testing,  trading  activities,  recovery  and  resolution planning,  model  risk,  subsidiary  governance  and  activities between member banks and their nonbank affiliates pursuant to Federal Reserve rules and regulations, among other things.\n\n## Lines of Defense\n\nWe have clear ownership and accountability across three lines of  defense:  Front  Line  Units  (FLUs),  IRM  and  Corporate  Audit. We also have control functions outside of FLUs and IRM (e.g., Legal and Global Human Resources). The three lines of defense are integrated into our management-level governance structure. Each  of  these  functional  roles  is  further  described  in  this section.\n\nBank of America 2020\n\n71",

        "page_content": "## Executive Officers\n\nExecutive  officers  lead  various  functions  representing  the functional roles. Authority for functional roles may be delegated to  executive  officers  from  the  Board,  Board  committees  or management-level committees. Executive officers, in turn, may further delegate responsibilities, as appropriate, to management  level  committees,  management  routines  or individuals. Executive officers review our activities for consistency with our Risk Framework, Risk Appetite Statement and applicable  strategic,  capital  and  financial  operating  plans, as  well  as  applicable  policies,  standards,  procedures  and processes.  Executive  officers  and  other  employees  make decisions individually on a day-to-day basis, consistent with the authority they have been delegated. Executive officers and other employees  may  also  serve  on  committees  and  participate  in committee decisions.\n\n## Front Line Units\n\nFLUs, which include the lines of business as well as the Global Technology and Operations Group, are responsible for appropriately assessing and effectively managing all of the risks associated with their activities.\n\nThree  organizational  units  that  include  FLU  activities  and control function activities, but are not part of IRM are first, the Chief  Financial  Officer  (CFO)  Group;  second,  Environmental, Social  and  Governance  (ESG),  Capital  Deployment  (CD)  and Public  Policy  (PP);  and  third,  the  Chief  Administrative  Officer (CAO) Group.\n\n## Independent Risk Management\n\nIRM  is  part  of  our  control  functions  and  includes  Global  Risk Management. We have other control functions that are not part of  IRM  (other  control  functions  may  also  provide  oversight  to FLU  activities),  including  Legal,  Global  Human  Resources  and certain  activities  within  the  CFO  Group;  ESG,  CD  and  PP;  and CAO  Group.  IRM,  led  by  the  Chief  Risk  Officer  (CRO),  is responsible  for  independently  assessing  and  overseeing  risks within FLUs and other control functions. IRM establishes written enterprise  policies  and  procedures  that  include  concentration risk  limits,  where  appropriate.  Such  policies  and  procedures outline how aggregate risks are identified, measured, monitored and controlled.\n\nThe  CRO  has  the  stature,  authority  and  independence  to develop and  implement  a  meaningful  risk  management framework. The CRO has unrestricted access to the Board and reports  directly  to  both  the  ERC  and  to  the  CEO.  Global  Risk Management is organized into horizontal risk teams that cover a specific risk area and vertical CRO teams that cover a particular front line unit or control function. These  teams  work collaboratively in executing their respective duties.\n\n## Corporate Audit\n\nCorporate Audit and the CAE maintain their independence from the FLUs, IRM and other control functions by reporting directly to the  Audit  Committee  or  the  Board.  The  CAE  administratively reports  to  the  CEO.  Corporate  Audit  provides  independent assessment  and  validation  through  testing  of  key  processes and  controls  across  the  Corporation.  Corporate  Audit  includes Credit  Review  which  periodically  tests  and  examines  credit portfolios and processes.\n\n## Risk Management Processes\n\nThe  Risk  Framework  requires  that  strong  risk  management practices  are  integrated  in  key  strategic,  capital  and  financial planning  processes  and  in  day-to-day  business  processes across  the  Corporation,  with  a  goal  of  ensuring  risks  are\n\n72\n\nBank of America 2020\n\nappropriately  considered,  evaluated  and  responded  to  in  a timely  manner.  We  employ  our  risk  management  process, referred to as Identify, Measure, Monitor and Control, as part of our daily activities.\n\nIdentify -  To  be  effectively  managed,  risks  must  be  clearly defined  and  proactively  identified.  Proper  risk  identification focuses on recognizing and understanding key risks inherent in  our  business  activities  or  key  risks  that  may  arise  from external  factors.  Each  employee  is  expected  to  identify  and escalate  risks  promptly.  Risk  identification  is  an  ongoing process, incorporating input from FLUs and control functions, designed  to  be  forward  looking  and  capture  relevant  risk factors across all of our lines of business.\n\nMeasure -  Once  a  risk  is  identified,  it  must  be  prioritized  and accurately measured through a systematic risk quantification process  including  quantitative  and  qualitative  components. Risk is measured at various levels including, but not limited to, risk type, FLU, legal entity and on an aggregate basis. This risk  quantification  process  helps  to  capture  changes  in  our risk profile due to changes in strategic direction, concentrations,  portfolio  quality  and  the  overall  economic environment. Senior management  considers how risk exposures might evolve under a variety of stress scenarios.\n\nMonitor - We monitor risk levels regularly to track adherence to risk appetite, policies, standards, procedures and processes. We  also  regularly  update  risk  assessments  and  review  risk exposures.  Through  our  monitoring,  we  can  determine  our level of risk relative to limits and can take action in a timely manner. We also can determine when risk limits are breached and  have  processes  to  appropriately  report  and  escalate exceptions. This includes requests for approval to managers and  alerts  to  executive  management,  management-level committees or  the  Board  (directly  or  through  an  appropriate committee).\n\nControl - We establish and communicate risk limits and controls through  policies,  standards,  procedures  and  processes  that define  the  responsibilities  and  authority  for  risk-taking.  The limits  and  controls  can  be  adjusted  by  the  Board  or management  when  conditions  or  risk  tolerances  warrant. These  limits  may  be  absolute  (e.g.,  loan  amount,  trading volume)  or  relative  (e.g.,  percentage  of  loan  book  in  higherrisk categories). Our lines of business are held accountable to perform within the established limits.\n\nThe formal processes used to manage risk represent a part of our  overall  risk  management  process.  We  instill  a  strong  and comprehensive culture of managing risk well through communications, training, policies, procedures and organizational  roles  and  responsibilities.  Establishing  a  culture reflective of our purpose to help make our customers' financial lives  better  and  delivering  our  responsible  growth  strategy  is also critical to effective risk management. We understand that improper  actions,  behaviors  or  practices  that  are  illegal, unethical or contrary to our core values could result in harm to the  Corporation,  our  shareholders  or  our  customers,  damage the  integrity  of  the  financial  markets,  or  negatively  impact  our reputation,  and  have  established  protocols  and  structures  so that  such  conduct  risk  is  governed  and  reported  across  the Corporation.  Specifically,  our  Code  of  Conduct  provides  a framework for all of our employees to conduct themselves with the highest integrity. Additionally, we continue to strengthen the link  between  the  employee  performance  management  process and  individual  compensation  to  encourage  employees  to  work toward enterprise-wide risk goals.",

        "page_content": "## Corporation-wide Stress Testing\n\nIntegral to our Capital Planning, Financial Planning and Strategic Planning  processes,  we  conduct  capital  scenario  management and stress forecasting on a periodic basis to better understand balance  sheet,  earnings  and  capital  sensitivities  to  certain economic  and  business  scenarios,  including  economic  and market conditions that are more severe than anticipated. These stress  forecasts  provide  an  understanding  of  the  potential impacts from our risk profile on the balance sheet, earnings and capital,  and  serve  as  a  key  component of  our  capital  and  risk management  practices.  The  intent  of  stress  testing  is  to develop a comprehensive understanding of potential impacts of on- and off-balance sheet risks at the Corporation and how they impact  financial  resiliency,  which  provides  confidence  to management, regulators and our investors.\n\n## Contingency Planning\n\nWe  have  developed  and  maintain  contingency  plans  that  are designed to prepare us in advance to respond in the event of potential  adverse  economic,  financial  or  market  stress.  These contingency  plans  include  our  Capital  Contingency  Plan  and Financial Contingency  and  Recovery  Plan,  which  provide monitoring, escalation, actions and routines designed to enable us to increase capital, access funding sources and reduce risk through  consideration  of  potential  options  that  include  asset sales,  business  sales,  capital  or  debt  issuances,  or  other  derisking  strategies.  We  also  maintain  a  Resolution  Plan  to  limit adverse  systemic  impacts  that  could  be  associated  with  a potential resolution of Bank of America.\n\n## Strategic Risk Management\n\nStrategic risk is embedded in every business and is one of the major  risk  categories  along  with  credit,  market,  liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational risks. This risk results from  incorrect  assumptions  about  external  or  internal  factors, inappropriate  business  plans,  ineffective  business  strategy execution, or failure to respond in a timely manner to changes in the  regulatory,  macroeconomic  or  competitive  environments  in the  geographic  locations  in  which  we  operate,  such  as competitor  actions,  changing  customer  preferences,  product obsolescence and technology developments. Our strategic plan is  consistent  with  our  risk  appetite,  capital  plan  and  liquidity requirements and specifically addresses strategic risks.\n\nOn  an  annual  basis,  the  Board  reviews  and  approves  the strategic  plan,  capital  plan,  financial  operating  plan  and  Risk Appetite  Statement.  With  oversight  by  the  Board,  executive management  directs  the  lines  of  business  to  execute  our strategic plan consistent with our core operating principles and risk appetite.  The  executive  management  team  monitors business  performance  throughout  the  year  and  provides  the Board  with  regular  progress  reports  on  whether  strategic objectives  and  timelines  are  being  met,  including  reports  on strategic risks and if additional or alternative actions need to be considered or implemented. The regular executive reviews focus on  assessing  forecasted  earnings  and  returns  on  capital,  the current  risk  profile,  current  capital  and  liquidity  requirements, staffing  levels  and  changes  required  to  support  the  strategic plan,  stress  testing  results,  and  other  qualitative  factors  such as market growth rates and peer analysis.\n\nSignificant  strategic  actions,  such  as  capital  actions, material  acquisitions  or  divestitures,  and  resolution  plans  are reviewed  and  approved  by  the  Board.  At  the  business  level, processes are in place to discuss the strategic risk implications of new, expanded or modified businesses, products or services and other strategic initiatives, and to provide formal review and\n\napproval  where  required.  With  oversight  by  the  Board  and  the ERC, executive management performs similar analyses throughout  the  year  and  evaluates  changes  to  the  financial forecast  or  the  risk,  capital  or  liquidity  positions  as  deemed appropriate to balance and optimize achieving the targeted risk appetite,  shareholder  returns  and  maintaining  the  targeted financial strength. Proprietary models are used to measure the capital requirements for credit, country, market, operational and strategic risks. The allocated capital assigned to each business is based on its unique risk profile. With oversight by the Board, executive  management  assesses  the  risk-adjusted  returns  of each  business  in  approving  strategic  and  financial  operating plans. The businesses use allocated capital to define business strategies and price products and transactions.\n\n## Capital Management\n\nThe Corporation manages its capital position so that its capital is  more  than  adequate  to  support  its  business  activities  and aligns with risk, risk appetite and strategic planning. Additionally,  we  seek  to  maintain  safety  and  soundness  at  all times, even under adverse scenarios, take advantage of organic growth opportunities, meet  obligations to creditors and counterparties,  maintain  ready  access  to  financial  markets, continue to serve as a credit intermediary, remain a source of strength  for  our  subsidiaries,  and  satisfy  current  and  future regulatory capital requirements. Capital management  is integrated into our risk and governance processes, as capital is a  key  consideration  in  the  development  of  our  strategic  plan, risk appetite and risk limits.\n\nWe  conduct  an  Internal  Capital  Adequacy  Assessment Process  (ICAAP)  on  a  periodic  basis.  The  ICAAP  is  a  forwardlooking  assessment  of  our  projected  capital  needs  and resources,  incorporating  earnings,  balance  sheet  and  risk forecasts  under  baseline  and  adverse  economic  and  market conditions.  We  utilize  periodic  stress  tests  to  assess  the potential  impacts  to  our  balance  sheet,  earnings,  regulatory capital  and  liquidity  under  a  variety  of  stress  scenarios.  We perform  qualitative  risk  assessments  to  identify  and  assess material risks not fully captured in our forecasts or stress tests. We assess the potential capital impacts of proposed changes to regulatory  capital  requirements.  Management  assesses  ICAAP results and provides documented quarterly assessments of the adequacy  of  our  capital  guidelines  and  capital  position  to  the Board or its committees.\n\nWe  periodically  review  capital  allocated  to  our  businesses and  allocate  capital  annually  during  the  strategic  and  capital planning  processes.  For  more  information,  see  Business Segment Operations on page 59.\n\n## CCAR and Capital Planning\n\nThe Federal Reserve requires BHCs to submit a capital plan and planned capital actions on an annual basis, consistent with the rules governing the CCAR capital plan.\n\nBased on the results of our 2020 CCAR supervisory stress test  that  was  submitted  to  the  Federal  Reserve  in  the  second quarter of 2020, we are subject to a 2.5 percent stress capital buffer  (SCB)  for  the  period  beginning  October  1,  2020  and ending  on  September  30,  2021.  Our  Common  equity  tier  1 (CET1)  capital  ratio  under  the  Standardized  approach  must remain  above  9.5  percent  during  this  period  (the  sum  of  our CET1 capital ratio minimum of 4.5 percent, global systemically important bank (G-SIB) surcharge of 2.5 percent and our SCB of 2.5 percent) in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments.\n\nBank of America 2020\n\n73",

        "page_content": "Due  to  economic  uncertainty  resulting  from  the  pandemic, the  Federal  Reserve  required  all  large  banks  to  update  and resubmit  their  capital  plans  in  November  2020  based  on  the Federal  Reserve's  updated  supervisory  stress  test  scenarios. The  results  of  the  additional  supervisory  stress  tests  were published in December 2020.\n\nThe  Federal  Reserve  also  required  large  banks  to  suspend share  repurchase  programs  during  the  second  half  of  2020, except for repurchases to offset shares awarded under equitybased  compensation  plans,  and  to  limit  common  stock dividends  to  existing  rates  that  did  not  exceed  the  average  of the  last  four  quarters'  net  income.  The  Federal  Reserve's directives regarding share repurchases aligned with our decision to  voluntarily  suspend  our  general  common  stock  repurchase program  during  the  first  half  of  2020.  The  suspension  of  our repurchases  did  not  include  repurchases  to  offset  shares awarded under our equity-based compensation plans. Pursuant to  the  Board's  authorization,  we  repurchased  $7.0  billion  of common stock during 2020.\n\nIn  December  2020,  the  Federal  Reserve  announced  that beginning  in  the  first  quarter  of  2021,  large  banks  would  be permitted to pay common stock dividends at existing rates and to  repurchase  shares  in  an  amount  that,  when  combined  with dividends paid, does not exceed the average of net income over the last four quarters.\n\nOn  January  19,  2021,  we  announced  that  the  Board declared a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.18 per share, payable  on  March  26,  2021  to  shareholders  of  record  as  of March 5, 2021. We also announced that the Board authorized the repurchase of $2.9 billion in common stock through March 31,  2021,  plus  repurchases  to  offset  shares  awarded  under equity-based  compensation  plans  during  the  same  period, estimated to be approximately $300 million. This authorization equals the maximum amount allowed by the Federal Reserve for the period.\n\nOur stock repurchase program is subject to various factors, including  the  Corporation's  capital  position,  liquidity,  financial performance and alternative uses of capital, stock trading price and general market conditions, and may be suspended at any time.  Such  repurchases may be effected through open market purchases  or  privately negotiated transactions, including repurchase plans that satisfy the conditions of Rule 10b5-1 of the  Securities  Exchange  Act  of  1934,  as  amended  (Exchange Act).\n\n## Regulatory Capital\n\nAs  a  financial  services  holding  company,  we  are  subject  to regulatory  capital  rules,  including  Basel  3,  issued  by  U.S. banking regulators. Basel 3 established minimum capital ratios and buffer requirements  and  outlined  two  methods  of\n\n74\n\nBank of America 2020\n\ncalculating risk-weighted assets  (RWA),  the  Standardized approach  and  the  Advanced  approaches.  The  Standardized approach relies primarily on supervisory risk weights based on exposure  type,  and  the  Advanced  approaches  determine  risk weights based on internal models.\n\nThe Corporation's depository institution subsidiaries are also subject  to  the  Prompt  Corrective  Action  (PCA)  framework.  The Corporation and its primary affiliated banking entity, BANA, are Advanced  approaches  institutions  under  Basel  3  and  are required to report regulatory risk-based capital ratios and RWA under  both  the  Standardized  and  Advanced  approaches.  The approach that yields  the  lower  ratio  is  used  to  assess  capital adequacy including under the PCA framework. As of December 31, 2020, the CET1, Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios  for  the  Corporation  were  lower  under  the  Standardized approach.\n\n## Minimum Capital Requirements\n\nIn  order  to  avoid  restrictions  on  capital  distributions  and discretionary bonus payments, the Corporation must meet riskbased  capital  ratio  requirements  that  include  a  capital conservation  buffer  greater  than  2.5  percent,  plus  any applicable countercyclical capital buffer and a G-SIB surcharge. On  October  1,  2020,  the  capital  conservation  buffer  was replaced  by  the  SCB  for  the  Corporation's  Standardized approach  ratio  requirements.  The  buffers  and  surcharge  must be comprised solely of CET1 capital.\n\nThe  Corporation  is  also  required  to  maintain  a  minimum supplementary  leverage  ratio  (SLR)  of  3.0  percent  plus  a leverage  buffer  of  2.0  percent  in  order  to  avoid  certain restrictions  on  capital  distributions  and  discretionary  bonus payments.  Our  insured  depository  institution  subsidiaries  are required  to  maintain  a  minimum  6.0  percent  SLR  to  be considered  well  capitalized  under  the  PCA  framework.  The numerator of the SLR is quarter-end Basel 3 Tier 1 capital. The denominator  is  total  leverage  exposure  based  on  the  daily average  of  the  sum  of  on-balance  sheet  exposures  less permitted  deductions  and  applicable  temporary  exclusions,  as well  as  the  simple  average  of  certain  off-balance  sheet exposures, as of the end of each month in a quarter. For more information, see Capital Management -Regulatory Developments  on page 78.\n\n## Capital Composition and Ratios\n\nTable 11 presents Bank of America Corporation's capital ratios and related information in accordance with Basel 3 Standardized  and  Advanced  approaches  as  measured  at December  31,  2020  and  2019.  For  the  periods  presented herein,  the  Corporation  met  the  definition  of  well  capitalized under current regulatory requirements.",

Total  capital  under  the  Standardized  approach increased $16.7 billion primarily driven by the same factors as CET1 capital,  an  increase  in  the  adjusted  allowance  for  credit\n\nlosses included in Tier 2 capital and the issuance of preferred stock. RWA under the Standardized approach, which yielded the lower  CET1  capital  ratio  at  December  31,  2020,  decreased $13.7  billion  during  2020  to  $1,480  billion  primarily  due  to lower  commercial  and  consumer  lending  exposures,  partially offset by investments of excess deposits in securities.

Eligible  long-term  debt  for  TLAC ratios  is  comprised  of  unsecured  debt  that  has  a  remaining maturity of at least one  year  and  satisfies  additional requirements  as  prescribed  in  the TLAC final rule. As with the\n\nrisk-based capital  ratios and SLR,  the Corporation  is required to  maintain  TLAC  ratios  in  excess  of  minimum  requirements plus applicable buffers to avoid restrictions on  capital distributions  and  discretionary  bonus  payments.  Table  15 presents the Corporation's TLAC and long-term debt ratios and related information as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n\nBank of America 2020\n\n77",

For more information, see Note 1 - Summary of Significant  Accounting  Principles to  the  Consolidated  Financial Statements. During the first quarter of 2020, in accordance with an interim final rule issued by U.S. banking regulators that was finalized  on  August 26, 2020, the Corporation delayed for two years the initial adoption impact of CECL on regulatory capital, followed  by  a  three-year  transition  period  to  phase  out  the aggregate  amount  of  the  capital  benefit  provided  during  2020 and 2021 (i.e., a five-year transition period). During the two-year delay, the Corporation will add back to CET1 capital 100 percent of  the  initial  adoption  impact  of  CECL  plus  25  percent  of  the cumulative quarterly changes in the allowance for credit losses (i.e., quarterly transitional amounts). After two years, starting on January 1, 2022, the quarterly transitional amounts along with the initial adoption impact of CECL will be phased out of CET1 capital over the three-year period.\n\n## Stress Capital Buffer\n\nOn March 4, 2020, the Federal Reserve issued a final rule that integrates  the  annual  quantitative  assessment  of  the  CCAR program with the buffer requirements in the U.S. Basel 3 Final Rule. The new approach replaced the static 2.5 percent capital conservation buffer for Basel 3 Standardized approach requirements with a SCB, calculated as the decline in the CET1 capital  ratio  under  the  supervisory  severely  adverse  scenario plus four quarters of planned common stock dividends, floored at  2.5  percent.  Based  on  the  CCAR  2020  supervisory  stress test results, the Corporation is subject to a 2.5 percent SCB for the period beginning October 1, 2020 and ending on September 30, 2021.\n\nIn  conjunction  with  this  new  requirement,  the  Federal Reserve  has  removed  the  annual  CCAR  quantitative  objection process  beginning  with  CCAR  2020.  While  the  final  rule continues  to  require  that  the  Corporation  describe  its  planned capital distributions in its CCAR capital plan, the Corporation is no  longer  required  to  seek  prior  approval  if  it  makes  capital distributions  in  excess  of  those  included  in  its  CCAR  capital\n\n78\n\nBank of America 2020\n\nplan. The Corporation is instead subject to automatic distribution  limitations  if  its  capital  ratios  fall  below  its  buffer requirements, which include the SCB.\n\n## Eligible Retained Income\n\nOn March 17, 2020, in response to the economic impact of the pandemic,  the  U.S.  banking  regulators  issued  an  interim  final rule that revises the definition of eligible retained income to be based on average net income over the prior four quarters. This change,  which  was  finalized  on  August  26,  2020,  more gradually  phases  in  automatic  distribution  restrictions  to  the extent capital buffers are breached.\n\n## Supplementary Leverage Ratio\n\nOn April  1,  2020,  in  response  to  the  economic  impact  of  the pandemic,  the  Federal  Reserve  issued  an  interim  final  rule  to temporarily  exclude  the  on-balance  sheet  amounts  of  U.S. Treasury securities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks from the  calculation  of  supplementary  leverage  exposure  for  bank holding  companies.  The  rule  is  effective  for  June  30,  2020 through  March  31,  2021  reports.  As  of  December  31,  2020, temporary exclusions  improved  the  SLR  by  1.0  percent  to  7.2 percent.\n\nOn  May  15,  2020,  the  U.S.  banking  regulators  issued  an interim final rule that provides a similar temporary exclusion to depository  institutions,  effective  from  the  beginning  of  the second  quarter  of  2020  through  March  31,  2021;  however, institutions must elect the relief. Beginning in the third quarter of 2020, a depository institution electing to apply the exclusion must receive approval from its primary regulator prior to making any capital distributions as long as the exclusion is in effect. As of  December  31,  2020,  the  Corporation's  insured  depository institution subsidiaries have not elected the exclusion.\n\n## Paycheck Protection Program Loans\n\nOn April  9,  2020,  in  response  to  the  economic  impact  of  the pandemic,  the  U.S.  banking  regulators  issued  an  interim  final rule  that,  among other things, stipulates PPP loans, which are guaranteed by the SBA, will receive a zero percent risk weight under the Basel 3 Advanced and Standardized approaches. The rule  was  later  finalized  by  the  U.S.  banking  regulators  on October  28,  2020.  For  more  information  on  the  PPP,  see Executive  Summary  -  Recent  Developments  -  COVID-19 Pandemic  on  page  48  and Note  1  -  Summary  of  Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements.",

        "page_content": "## Standardized Approach for Measuring Counterparty Credit Risk\n\nOn  June  30,  2020  the  Corporation  adopted  the  new standardized  approach  for  measuring  counterparty  credit  risk (SA-CCR),  which  replaces  the  current  exposure  method  for calculating the exposure amount of derivative contracts for riskweighted assets and supplementary leverage exposure. Adoption of SA-CCR resulted in a decrease of approximately $15 billion in the Corporation's Standardized RWA, and a $66 billion decrease in supplementary leverage exposure.\n\n## Swap Dealer Capital Requirements\n\nOn  July  22,  2020,  the  U.S.  Commodity  Futures  Trading Commission  (CFTC)  issued  a  final  rule  to  establish  capital requirements for swap dealers and major swap participants that are not subject to existing U.S. prudential regulation. Under the rule,  applicable  subsidiaries  of  the  Corporation  would  be permitted  to  elect  one  of  two  approaches  to  compute  their regulatory  capital.  The  first  approach  is  a  bank-based  capital approach,  which  requires  that  firms  maintain  CET1  capital greater  than  or  equal  to  6.5  percent  of  the  entity's  RWA  as calculated under Basel 3, Total capital greater than or equal to 8.0 percent of the entity's RWA as calculated under Basel 3 and Total capital greater than or equal to 8.0 percent of the entity's uncleared swap margin. The second approach is based on net liquid  assets  and  requires  that  a  firm  maintain  net  capital greater  than  or  equal  to  2.0  percent  of  its  uncleared  swap margin. The final rule also includes reporting requirements. The impact on the Corporation is not expected to be significant.\n\n## Deduction of Unsecured Debt of G-SIBs\n\nOn  October  20,  2020,  the  Federal  Reserve,  Federal  Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Office of the Comptroller of  the  Currency  (U.S.  Agencies)  finalized  a  rule  requiring Advanced  approaches  institutions  to  deduct  from  regulatory capital  certain  investments  in  TLAC-eligible  long-term  debt  and other pari passu or subordinated debt instruments issued by GSIBs above a specified threshold. The final rule is intended to limit the interconnectedness between G-SIBs and is complementary to existing  regulatory  capital  requirements  that generally require banks to deduct investments in the regulatory capital of financial institutions. The final rule is effective April 1, 2021.  The  impact  to  the  Corporation  is  not  expected  to  be significant.\n\n## Volcker Rule\n\nEffective  January  1,  2020,  we  became  subject  to  certain changes to the Volcker Rule, including removing the requirement for banking  organizations  to  deduct  from  Tier  1  capital ownership interests of covered funds acquired or retained under the  underwriting  or  market-making  exemptions  of  the  Volcker Rule, which the banking entity did not organize or offer.\n\n## Single-Counterparty Credit Limits\n\nThe Federal Reserve established single-counterparty credit limits (SCCL) for BHCs with total consolidated assets of $250 billion or more. The SCCL rule is designed to ensure that the maximum possible  loss  that  a  BHC  could  incur  due  to  the  default  of  a single  counterparty  or  a  group  of  connected  counterparties would  not  endanger  the  BHC's  survival,  thereby  reducing  the probability of future financial crises. Beginning January 1, 2020, G-SIBs  must  calculate  SCCL  on  a  daily  basis  by  dividing  the aggregate net credit exposure to a given counterparty by the GSIB's  Tier  1  capital,  ensuring  that  exposures  to  other  G-SIBs\n\nand  nonbank  financial  institutions  regulated  by  the  Federal Reserve  do  not  breach  15  percent  of  Tier  1  capital  and exposures  to  most  other  counterparties  do  not  breach  25 percent of Tier 1 capital. Certain exposures, including exposures to  the  U.S.  government,  U.S.  government-sponsored  entities and qualifying central counterparties, are exempt from the credit limits.\n\n## Regulatory Capital and Securities Regulation\n\nThe  Corporation's  principal  U.S.  broker-dealer  subsidiaries  are BofA Securities, Inc. (BofAS), Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corp.  (MLPCC)  and  Merrill  Lynch,  Pierce,  Fenner  &  Smith Incorporated  (MLPF&S).  The  Corporation's  principal  European broker-dealer  subsidiaries  are  Merrill  Lynch  International  (MLI) and BofA Securities Europe SA (BofASE).\n\nThe  U.S.  broker-dealer  subsidiaries  are  subject  to  the  net capital  requirements  of  Rule  15c3-1  under  the  Exchange  Act. BofAS  computes  its  minimum  capital  requirements  as  an alternative  net  capital  broker-dealer  under  Rule  15c3-1e,  and MLPCC and MLPF&S compute their minimum capital requirements in accordance with the alternative standard under Rule 15c3-1. BofAS and MLPCC are also registered as futures commission  merchants  and  are  subject  to  CFTC  Regulation 1.17.  The  U.S.  broker-dealer  subsidiaries  are  also  registered with  the  Financial  Industry  Regulatory  Authority,  Inc.  (FINRA). Pursuant  to  FINRA  Rule  4110,  FINRA  may  impose  higher  net capital requirements than Rule 15c3-1 under the Exchange Act with respect to each of the broker-dealers.\n\nBofAS provides institutional services, and in accordance with the alternative net capital requirements, is required to maintain tentative net capital in excess of $1.0 billion and net capital in excess of the greater of $500 million or a certain percentage of its  reserve  requirement.  BofAS  must  also  notify  the  Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the event its tentative net capital is less than $5.0 billion. BofAS is also required to hold a certain  percentage  of  its  customers'  and  affiliates'  risk-based margin  in  order  to  meet  its  CFTC  minimum  net  capital requirement.

To  achieve  that  objective,  we analyze  and  monitor  our  liquidity  risk  under  expected  and stressed  conditions,  maintain  liquidity  and  access  to  diverse funding sources, including our stable deposit base, and seek to align  liquidity-related  incentives  and  risks.  These  liquidity  risk management  practices  have  allowed  us  to  effectively  manage the  market  stress  from  the  pandemic  that  began  in  the  first quarter  of  2020.  For  more  information  on  the  effects  of  the pandemic, see Item 1A. Risk Factors of our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Executive Summary - Recent Developments COVID-19 Pandemic on page 48.\n\nWe  define  liquidity  as  readily  available  assets,  limited  to cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities that we can  use  to  meet  our  contractual  and  contingent  financial obligations as those obligations arise. We manage our liquidity position through line-of-business and ALM activities, as well as through our legal entity funding strategy, on both a forward and current  (including  intraday)  basis  under  both  expected  and stressed conditions. We believe that a centralized approach to funding  and  liquidity  management  enhances  our  ability  to monitor  liquidity  requirements,  maximizes  access  to  funding sources,  minimizes  borrowing  costs  and  facilitates  timely responses to liquidity events.\n\nThe Board approves our liquidity risk policy and the Financial Contingency  and  Recovery  Plan.  The  ERC  establishes  our liquidity  risk  tolerance  levels.  The  MRC  is  responsible  for overseeing liquidity risks and directing management to maintain exposures  within  the  established  tolerance  levels.  The  MRC reviews  and  monitors  our  liquidity  position  and  stress  testing results,  approves  certain  liquidity  risk  limits  and  reviews  the impact  of  strategic  decisions  on  our  liquidity.  For  more information,  see  Managing  Risk  on  page  70.  Under  this governance framework, we have developed certain funding and liquidity  risk  management  practices  which  include:  maintaining liquidity  at  the  parent  company  and  selected  subsidiaries, including  our  bank  subsidiaries  and  other  regulated  entities; determining what amounts of liquidity are appropriate for these entities based on analysis of debt maturities and other potential cash  outflows,  including  those  that  we  may  experience  during stressed  market  conditions;  diversifying  funding  sources, considering  our  asset  profile  and  legal  entity  structure;  and performing contingency planning.\n\n## NB Holdings Corporation\n\nWe  have intercompany arrangements with certain key subsidiaries under which we transferred certain assets of Bank of  America  Corporation,  as  the  parent  company,  which  is  a separate  and  distinct  legal  entity  from  our  bank  and  nonbank subsidiaries,  and  agreed  to  transfer  certain  additional  parent company  assets  not  needed  to  satisfy  anticipated  near-term expenditures,  to  NB  Holdings  Corporation,  a  wholly-owned holding company subsidiary (NB Holdings). The parent company is  expected  to  continue  to  have  access  to  the  same  flow  of dividends,  interest  and  other  amounts  of  cash  necessary  to service its debt, pay dividends and perform other obligations as it would have had if it had not entered into these arrangements and transferred any assets.\n\nIn  consideration  for  the  transfer  of  assets,  NB  Holdings issued a subordinated note to the parent company in a principal\n\n80\n\nBank of America 2020\n\namount  equal  to  the  value  of  the  transferred  assets.  The aggregate  principal  amount  of  the  note  will  increase  by  the amount of any future asset transfers. NB Holdings also provided the parent company with a committed line of credit that allows the  parent  company  to  draw  funds  necessary  to  service  nearterm  cash  needs.  These  arrangements  support  our  preferred single  point  of  entry  resolution  strategy,  under  which  only  the parent  company  would  be  resolved  under  the  U.S.  Bankruptcy Code. These arrangements include provisions to terminate the line  of  credit,  forgive  the  subordinated  note  and  require  the parent company to transfer its remaining financial assets to NB Holdings  if  our  projected  liquidity  resources  deteriorate  so severely  that  resolution  of  the  parent  company  becomes imminent.\n\n## Global Liquidity Sources and Other Unencumbered Assets\n\nWe maintain liquidity available to the Corporation, including the parent company and selected subsidiaries, in the form of cash and  high-quality,  liquid,  unencumbered  securities.  Our  liquidity buffer,  referred  to  as  Global  Liquidity  Sources  (GLS),  is comprised  of  assets  that  are  readily  available  to  the  parent company and selected subsidiaries, including holding company, bank  and  broker-dealer  subsidiaries,  even  during  stressed market  conditions.  Our  cash  is  primarily  on  deposit  with  the Federal  Reserve  Bank  and,  to  a  lesser  extent,  central  banks outside  of  the  U.S.  We  limit  the  composition  of  high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities to U.S. government securities, U.S. agency securities, U.S. agency MBS and a select group of non-U.S. government securities. We can quickly obtain cash for these securities, even in stressed conditions, through repurchase  agreements  or  outright  sales.  We  hold  our  GLS  in legal entities that allow us to meet the liquidity requirements of our global businesses, and we consider the impact of potential regulatory, tax, legal and other restrictions that could limit the transferability of funds among entities.\n\nTable 16 presents average GLS for the three months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n\nTable 16  Average Global Liquidity Sources\n\n|                                        | Three Months Ended  December 31   | Three Months Ended  December 31   |\n|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| (Dollars in billions)                  | 2020                              | 2019                              |\n| Bank entities                          | $ 773                             | $ 454                             |\n| Nonbank and other entities  (1 )       | 170                               | 122                               |\n| Total Average Global Liquidity Sources | $ 943                             | $ 576                             |\n\n(1 )\n\nOur bank subsidiaries' liquidity is primarily driven by deposit and lending activity, as well as securities valuation and net debt activity. Bank  subsidiaries  can  also  generate  incremental liquidity  by  pledging  a  range  of  unencumbered  loans  and securities  to  certain  FHLBs  and  the  Federal  Reserve  Discount Window. The cash we could have obtained by borrowing against this  pool  of  specifically-identified  eligible  assets  was  $306 billion and $372 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019. We have established operational procedures to enable us to borrow against  these  assets,  including  regularly  monitoring  our  total pool  of  eligible  loans  and  securities  collateral.  Eligibility  is defined in guidelines from the FHLBs and the Federal Reserve and is subject to change at their discretion. Due to regulatory restrictions,  liquidity  generated  by  the  bank  subsidiaries  can generally  be  used  only  to  fund  obligations  within  the  bank subsidiaries,  and  transfers  to  the  parent  company  or  nonbank subsidiaries may be subject to prior regulatory approval.",

Parent company  and  NB  Holdings  liquidity  is  typically  in  the  form  of cash  deposited  at  BANA  and  is  excluded  from  the  liquidity  at bank  subsidiaries.  Liquidity  held  in  other  regulated  entities, comprised  primarily  of  broker-dealer  subsidiaries,  is  primarily available to meet the obligations of that entity, and transfers to the parent company or to any other subsidiary may be subject to prior  regulatory  approval  due  to  regulatory  restrictions  and minimum requirements.  Our  other  regulated  entities  also  hold unencumbered investment-grade securities and equities that we believe could be used to generate additional liquidity.\n\nTable 17 presents the composition of average GLS for the three months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n\nTable 17  Average Global Liquidity Sources Composition\n\n|                                                                                             | Three Months Ended  December 31   | Three Months Ended  December 31   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| (Dollars in billions)                                                                       | 2020                              | 2019                              |\n| Cash on deposit                                                                             | $ 322                             | $ 103                             |\n| U.S. Treasury securities                                                                    | 141                               | 98                                |\n| U.S. agency securities, mortgage-backed  securities, and other investment-grade  securities | 462                               | 358                               |\n| Non-U.S. government securities                                                              | 18                                | 17                                |\n| Total Average Global Liquidity Sources                                                      | $ 943                             | $ 576                             |\n\nOur GLS are substantially the same in composition to what qualifies  as  High  Quality  Liquid  Assets  (HQLA)  under  the  final U.S.  Liquidity  Coverage  Ratio  (LCR)  rules.  However,  HQLA  for purposes of calculating LCR is not reported at market value, but at a lower value that incorporates regulatory deductions and the exclusion  of  excess  liquidity  held  at  certain  subsidiaries.  The LCR  is  calculated  as  the  amount  of  a  financial  institution's unencumbered HQLA relative to the estimated net cash outflows the  institution  could  encounter  over  a  30-day  period  of significant  liquidity  stress,  expressed  as  a  percentage.  Our average  consolidated  HQLA,  on  a  net  basis,  was  $584  billion and  $464  billion  for  the  three  months  ended  December  31, 2020  and  2019.  For  the  same  periods,  the  average consolidated LCR was 122 percent and 116 percent. Our LCR fluctuates due to normal business flows from customer activity.\n\n## Liquidity Stress Analysis\n\nWe utilize  liquidity  stress  analysis  to  assist  us  in  determining the  appropriate  amounts  of  liquidity  to  maintain  at  the  parent company  and  our  subsidiaries  to  meet  contractual  and contingent  cash  outflows  under  a  range  of  scenarios.  The scenarios we consider and utilize incorporate market-wide and Corporation-specific  events,  including  potential  credit  rating downgrades for the parent company and our subsidiaries, and more  severe  events  including  potential  resolution  scenarios. The  scenarios  are  based  on  our  historical  experience, experience  of  distressed  and  failed  financial  institutions, regulatory guidance, and both expected and unexpected future events.\n\nThe  types  of  potential  contractual  and  contingent  cash outflows we consider in our scenarios may include, but are not limited  to,  upcoming  contractual  maturities  of  unsecured  debt and  reductions  in  new  debt  issuances;  diminished  access  to secured  financing  markets;  potential  deposit  withdrawals; increased  draws  on  loan  commitments,  liquidity  facilities  and letters  of  credit;  additional  collateral  that  counterparties  could call if our credit ratings were downgraded; collateral and margin requirements arising from market value changes; and potential\n\nliquidity required to maintain businesses and finance customer activities. Changes in certain market factors, including, but not limited  to,  credit  rating  downgrades,  could  negatively  impact potential  contractual  and  contingent  outflows  and  the  related financial instruments, and in some cases these impacts could be material to our financial results.\n\nWe  consider  all  sources  of  funds  that  we  could  access during each stress scenario and focus particularly on matching available  sources  with  corresponding  liquidity  requirements  by legal entity. We also use the stress modeling results to manage our asset and liability profile and establish limits and guidelines on certain funding sources and businesses.\n\n## Net Stable Funding Ratio Final Rule\n\nOn  October  20,  2020,  the  U.S.  Agencies  finalized  the  Net Stable  Funding  Ratio  (NSFR),  a  rule  requiring  large  banks  to maintain  a  minimum  level  of  stable  funding  over  a  one-year period. The final rule is intended to support the ability of banks to  lend  to  households  and  businesses  in  both  normal  and adverse economic conditions and is complementary to the LCR rule, which focuses on short-term liquidity risks. The final rule is effective  July  1,  2021.  The  U.S.  NSFR  would  apply  to  the Corporation  on  a  consolidated  basis  and  to  our  insured depository  institutions.  The  Corporation  expects  to  be  in compliance within the final NSFR rule in the regulatory timeline provided  and  does  not  expect  any  significant  impacts  to  the Corporation.\n\n## Diversified Funding Sources\n\nWe  fund  our  assets  primarily  with  a  mix  of  deposits,  and secured and unsecured liabilities through a centralized, globally coordinated  funding  approach  diversified  across  products, programs, markets, currencies and investor groups.\n\nThe  primary  benefits  of  our  centralized  funding  approach include  greater  control,  reduced  funding  costs,  wider  name recognition  by  investors  and  greater  flexibility  to  meet  the variable funding requirements of subsidiaries. Where regulations, time zone differences or other business considerations  make  parent  company  funding  impractical, certain other subsidiaries may issue their own debt.\n\nWe  fund  a  substantial  portion  of  our  lending  activities through  our  deposits,  which  were  $1.80  trillion  and  $1.43 trillion at December 31, 2020 and 2019. Deposits are primarily generated by our Consumer Banking , GWIM and Global Banking segments.  These  deposits  are  diversified  by  clients,  product type and geography, and the majority of our U.S. deposits are insured  by  the  FDIC.  We  consider  a  substantial  portion  of  our deposits  to  be  a  stable,  low-cost  and  consistent  source  of funding.  We  believe  this  deposit  funding  is  generally  less sensitive to interest rate changes, market volatility or changes in our credit ratings than wholesale funding sources. Our lending activities  may  also  be  financed  through  secured  borrowings, including  credit  card  securitizations  and  securitizations  with government-sponsored enterprises (GSE), the FHA and privatelabel investors, as well as FHLB loans.\n\nOur trading activities in other regulated entities are primarily funded  on  a  secured  basis  through  securities  lending  and repurchase agreements, and these amounts will vary based on customer  activity  and  market  conditions.  We  believe  funding these activities in the secured financing markets is more costefficient and less sensitive to changes in our credit ratings than unsecured  financing.  Repurchase  agreements  are  generally short-term and often overnight. Disruptions in secured financing markets for financial institutions have occurred in prior market cycles which resulted in adverse changes in terms or significant\n\nBank of America 2020\n\n81",

We manage the liquidity  risks  arising  from  secured funding by sourcing funding globally  from  a  diverse  group  of  counterparties,  providing  a range  of  securities  collateral  and  pursuing  longer  durations, when  appropriate.  For  more  information  on  secured  financing agreements,  see Note  10  -  Federal  Funds  Sold  or  Purchased, Securities  Financing  Agreements,  Short-term  Borrowings  and Restricted Cash to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nTotal  long-term  debt  increased  $22.1  billion  to  $262.9 billion  during  2020,  primarily  due  to  debt  issuances  and valuation adjustments,  partially  offset  by  maturities  and redemptions. We may, from time to time, purchase outstanding debt instruments in various transactions, depending on market conditions,  liquidity  and  other  factors.  Our  other  regulated entities  may  also  make  markets  in  our  debt  instruments  to provide liquidity for investors.\n\nDuring  2020,  we  issued  $56.9  billion  of  long-term  debt consisting of $43.8 billion of notes issued by Bank of America Corporation, substantially all of which was TLAC compliant, $4.8 billion of notes issued by Bank of America, N.A. and $8.3 billion of other debt. During 2019, we issued $52.5 billion of long-term debt  consisting  of  $29.3  billion  of  notes  issued  by  Bank  of America  Corporation,  substantially  all  of  which  was  TLAC compliant,  $10.9  billion  of  notes  issued  by  Bank  of  America, N.A. and $12.3 billion of other debt.\n\nDuring  2020,  we  had  total  long-term  debt  maturities  and redemptions  in  the  aggregate  of  $47.1  billion  consisting  of $22.6 billion for Bank of America Corporation, $11.5 billion for Bank of America, N.A. and $13.0 billion of other debt. During 2019, we had total long-term debt maturities and redemptions in the aggregate of $50.6 billion consisting of $21.1 billion for Bank of America Corporation, $19.9 billion for Bank of America, N.A. and $9.6 billion of other debt.\n\nAt  December  31,  2020,  Bank  of  America  Corporation's senior  notes  of  $191.2  billion  included  $146.6  billion  of outstanding  notes  that  are  both  TLAC  eligible  and  callable  at least  one  year  before  their  stated  maturities.  Of  these  senior notes, $12.0 billion will be callable and become TLAC ineligible during 2021, and $15.3 billion, $14.6 billion, $11.7 billion and $13.2  billion  will  do  so  during  each  of  2022  through  2025, respectively, and $79.8 billion thereafter.\n\nWe issue long-term unsecured debt in a variety of maturities and currencies to achieve cost-efficient funding and to maintain an appropriate maturity profile. While the cost and availability of unsecured  funding  may  be  negatively  impacted  by  general market  conditions  or  by  matters  specific  to  the  financial services  industry  or  the  Corporation,  we  seek  to  mitigate refinancing  risk  by  actively  managing  the  amount  of  our borrowings  that  we  anticipate  will  mature  within  any  month  or quarter. We may issue unsecured debt in the form of structured notes  for  client  purposes,  certain  of  which  qualify  as  TLACeligible debt. During 2020, we issued $7.3 billion of structured notes, which are unsecured debt obligations that pay investors returns  linked  to  other  debt  or  equity  securities,  indices, currencies  or  commodities.  We  typically  hedge  the  returns  we are obligated to pay on these liabilities with derivatives and/or investments  in  the  underlying  instruments,  so  that  from  a funding perspective, the cost is similar to our other unsecured long-term debt. We could be required to settle certain structured note  obligations  for  cash  or  other  securities  prior  to  maturity under  certain  circumstances,  which  we  consider  for  liquidity planning purposes. We believe, however, that a portion of such borrowings  will  remain  outstanding  beyond  the  earliest  put  or redemption date.\n\n82\n\nBank of America 2020\n\nSubstantially  all  of  our  senior  and  subordinated  debt obligations contain no provisions that could trigger a requirement for an early repayment, require additional collateral support,  result  in  changes  to  terms,  accelerate  maturity  or create additional financial obligations upon an adverse change in  our  credit  ratings,  financial  ratios,  earnings,  cash  flows  or stock  price.  For  more  information  on  long-term  debt  funding, including issuances and maturities and redemptions, see Note 11 - Long-term Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements .\n\nWe  use  derivative  transactions  to  manage  the  duration, interest  rate  and  currency  risks  of  our  borrowings,  considering the  characteristics  of  the  assets  they  are  funding.  For  more information  on  our  ALM  activities,  see  Interest  Rate  Risk Management for the Banking Book on page 105.\n\n## Contingency Planning\n\nWe maintain contingency funding plans that outline our potential responses to liquidity stress events at various levels of severity. These  policies  and  plans  are  based  on  stress  scenarios  and include  potential  funding  strategies  and  communication  and notification procedures that we would implement in the event we experienced stressed liquidity conditions. We periodically review and test the contingency funding plans to validate efficacy and assess readiness.\n\nOur U.S. bank subsidiaries can access contingency funding through the Federal Reserve Discount Window. Certain non-U.S. subsidiaries  have  access  to  central  bank  facilities  in  the jurisdictions  in  which  they  operate.  While  we  do  not  rely  on these  sources  in  our  liquidity  modeling,  we  maintain  the policies,  procedures  and  governance  processes  that  would enable us to access these sources if necessary.\n\n## Credit Ratings\n\nOur borrowing costs and ability to raise funds are impacted by our credit ratings. In addition, credit ratings may be important to customers  or  counterparties  when  we  compete  in  certain markets and when we seek to engage in certain transactions, including  over-the-counter  (OTC)  derivatives.  Thus,  it  is  our objective to maintain high-quality credit ratings, and management maintains an active dialogue with the major rating agencies.\n\nCredit ratings and outlooks are opinions expressed by rating agencies on our creditworthiness and that of our obligations or securities,  including  long-term  debt,  short-term  borrowings, preferred stock and other securities, including asset securitizations. Our credit ratings are subject to ongoing review by the rating agencies, and they consider a number of factors, including  our  own  financial  strength,  performance,  prospects and  operations  as  well  as  factors  not  under  our  control.  The rating  agencies  could  make  adjustments  to  our  ratings  at  any time, and they provide no assurances that they will maintain our ratings at current levels.\n\nOther  factors  that  influence  our  credit  ratings  include changes to the rating agencies' methodologies for our industry or  certain  security  types;  the  rating  agencies'  assessment  of the general  operating  environment  for  financial  services companies;  our  relative  positions  in  the  markets  in  which  we compete;  our  various  risk  exposures  and  risk  management policies and activities; pending litigation and other contingencies or potential tail risks; our reputation; our liquidity position,  diversity  of  funding  sources  and  funding  costs;  the current  and  expected  level  and  volatility  of  our  earnings;  our capital position and  capital management  practices;  our corporate  governance;  the  sovereign  credit  ratings  of  the  U.S. government; current or future regulatory and  legislative",

The  agency  affirmed  its long-term and short-term senior debt ratings for the Corporation and  all  of  its  rated  subsidiaries,  except  for  select  issuer  and instrument-level  ratings  that  had  previously  been  placed  under criteria observation on March 4, 2020, following changes in the agency's bank rating criteria on February 28, 2020.\n\nConcurrently,  Fitch  reached  a  conclusion  on  select  undercriteria-observation designations for the Corporation and upgraded its long-term and short-term senior debt ratings of MLI and BofASE by one notch to AA-/F1+. The agency also upgraded its  preferred  stock  rating  for  the  Corporation  by  one  notch  to BBB  and  downgraded  its  subordinated  debt  rating  for  the Corporation  by  one  notch  to  A-.  According  to  Fitch,  rating\n\nchanges under criteria observation are the sole result of bank rating  criteria  changes  and  do  not  reflect  a  change  in  the underlying fundamentals of the institution. Fitch's outlook for all of our long-term ratings is currently Stable.\n\n- On  June  9,  2020,  Fitch  affirmed  its  rating  for  the subordinated debt of BANA at A. This rating had remained under criteria observation following Fitch's broader rating actions.\n- On  November  18,  2020,  Moody's  Investors  Service (Moody's) affirmed its long-term and short-term debt ratings for the Corporation and all of its rated subsidiaries, which did not change  during  2020.  Moody's  outlook  for  all  of  our  long-term ratings is currently Stable.\n\nThe current ratings and Stable outlooks for the Corporation and its subsidiaries from Standard & Poor's Global Ratings also did not change during 2020.\n\nTable 18 presents the Corporation's current long-term/shortterm senior debt ratings and outlooks expressed by the rating agencies.\n\nTable 18  Senior Debt Ratings\n\n|                                                     | Moody's Investors Service   | Moody's Investors Service   | Moody's Investors Service   | Standard & Poor's Global Ratings   | Standard & Poor's Global Ratings   | Standard & Poor's Global Ratings   | Fitch Ratings   | Fitch Ratings   | Fitch Ratings   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n|                                                     | Long-term                   | Short-term                  | Outlook                     | Long-term                          | Short-term                         | Outlook                            | Long-term       | Short-term      | Outlook         |\n| Bank of America Corporation                         | A2                          | P-1                         | Stable                      | A-                                 | A-2                                | Stable                             | A+              | F1              | Stable          |\n| Bank of America, N.A.                               | Aa2                         | P-1                         | Stable                      | A+                                 | A-1                                | Stable                             | AA-             | F1+             | Stable          |\n| Bank of America Europe Designated Activity  Company | NR                          | NR                          | NR                          | A+                                 | A-1                                | Stable                             | AA-             | F1+             | Stable          |\n| Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith  Incorporated | NR                          | NR                          | NR                          | A+                                 | A-1                                | Stable                             | AA-             | F1+             | Stable          |\n| BofA Securities, Inc.                               | NR                          | NR                          | NR                          | A+                                 | A-1                                | Stable                             | AA-             | F1+             | Stable          |\n| Merrill Lynch International                         | NR                          | NR                          | NR                          | A+                                 | A-1                                | Stable                             | AA-             | F1+             | Stable          |\n| BofA Securities Europe SA                           | NR                          | NR                          | NR                          | A+                                 | A-1                                | Stable                             | AA-             | F1+             | Stable          |\n\nA reduction in certain of our credit ratings or the ratings of certain  asset-backed  securitizations  may  have  a  material adverse effect on our liquidity, potential loss of access to credit markets,  the  related  cost  of  funds,  our  businesses  and  on certain  revenues,  particularly  in  those  businesses  where counterparty  creditworthiness  is  critical.  In  addition,  under  the terms  of  certain  OTC  derivative  contracts  and  other  trading agreements,  in  the  event  of  downgrades  of  our  or  our  rated subsidiaries' credit ratings, the counterparties to those agreements may require us to provide additional collateral, or to terminate these contracts or agreements, which could cause us to  sustain  losses  and/or  adversely  impact  our  liquidity.  If  the short-term credit ratings of our parent company, bank or brokerdealer subsidiaries were downgraded by one or more levels, the potential loss of access to short-term funding sources such as repo financing and the effect on our incremental cost of funds could be material.\n\nWhile certain potential impacts are contractual and quantifiable,  the  full  scope  of  the  consequences  of  a  credit rating downgrade  to  a  financial  institution  is  inherently uncertain, as it depends upon numerous dynamic, complex and inter-related  factors  and  assumptions,  including  whether  any downgrade of a company's long-term credit ratings precipitates downgrades  to  its  short-term  credit  ratings,  and  assumptions about  the  potential  behaviors  of  various  customers,  investors and counterparties. For more information on potential impacts of credit rating downgrades, see Liquidity Risk - Liquidity Stress Analysis on page 81.\n\nFor more information on additional collateral and termination payments that could be required in connection with certain overthe-counter derivative contracts and other trading agreements in the event of a credit rating downgrade, see Note 3 - Derivatives to  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  and  Item  1A.

The Corporation guarantees the due and punctual payment,  on  demand,  of  amounts  payable  on  the  Guaranteed Notes  if  not  paid  by  BofA  Finance.  In  addition,  each  of  BAC Capital Trust XIII and BAC Capital Trust XIV, Delaware statutory trusts (collectively, the Trusts), is a 100 percent owned finance subsidiary  of  the  Corporation  that  has  issued  and  sold  trust preferred securities (the Trust Preferred Securities and, together with  the  Guaranteed  Notes,  the  Guaranteed  Securities)  that remained outstanding at December 31, 2020. The Corporation guarantees  the  payment  of  amounts  and  distributions  with respect  to  the  Trust  Preferred  Securities  if  not  paid  by  the Trusts,  to  the  extent  of  funds  held  by  the  Trusts,  and  this guarantee, together with the Corporation's other obligations with respect to the Trust Preferred Securities, effectively constitutes a  full  and  unconditional  guarantee  of  the  Trusts'  payment obligations on  the  Trust  Preferred  Securities.  No  other subsidiary  of  the  Corporation  guarantees  the  Guaranteed Securities.\n\nBofA Finance and  each  of  the  Trusts  are  finance subsidiaries, have  no  independent  assets,  revenues  or operations and are dependent upon the Corporation and/or the Corporation's  other  subsidiaries  to  meet  their  respective obligations  under  the  Guaranteed  Securities  in  the  ordinary course. If holders of the Guaranteed Securities make claims on their  Guaranteed  Securities  in  a  bankruptcy,  resolution  or similar  proceeding,  any  recoveries  on  those  claims  will  be limited to those available under the applicable guarantee by the Corporation, as described above.\n\nThe Corporation is a holding company and depends upon its subsidiaries  for  liquidity.  Applicable  laws  and  regulations  and intercompany arrangements entered into in connection with the Corporation's  resolution  plan  could  restrict  the  availability  of funds  from  subsidiaries  to  the  Corporation,  which  could adversely  affect  the  Corporation's  ability  to  make  payments under  its  guarantees.  In  addition,  the  obligations  of  the Corporation under the guarantees of the Guaranteed Securities will  be  structurally  subordinated  to  all  existing  and  future liabilities of its subsidiaries, and claimants should look only to assets of the Corporation for payments. If the Corporation, as guarantor of the Guaranteed Notes, transfers all or substantially all of its assets to one or more direct or indirect majority-owned subsidiaries,  under  the  indenture  governing  the  Guaranteed Notes,  the  subsidiary  or  subsidiaries  will  not  be  required  to assume the Corporation's obligations under its guarantee of the Guaranteed Notes.\n\nFor more information on factors that may affect payments to holders  of  the  Guaranteed  Securities,  see  Liquidity  Risk  -  NB Holdings  Corporation  in  this  section,  see  Item  1.  Business  of our  2020  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K  and  Item  1A.  Risk Factors of our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n84\n\nBank of America 2020\n\n## Credit Risk Management\n\nCredit risk is the risk of loss arising from the inability or failure of a borrower or counterparty to meet its obligations. Credit risk can  also  arise  from  operational  failures  that  result  in  an erroneous  advance,  commitment  or  investment  of  funds.  We define the credit exposure to a borrower or counterparty as the loss  potential  arising  from  all  product  classifications  including loans and leases, deposit overdrafts, derivatives, assets heldfor-sale and unfunded lending commitments which include loan commitments,  letters  of  credit  and  financial  guarantees. Derivative positions are recorded at fair value and assets heldfor-sale are recorded at either fair value or the lower of cost or fair  value.  Certain  loans  and  unfunded  commitments  are accounted  for  under  the  fair  value  option.  Credit  risk  for categories of assets carried at fair value is not accounted for as part  of  the  allowance  for  credit  losses  but  as  part  of  the  fair value adjustments recorded in earnings. For derivative positions,  our  credit  risk  is  measured  as  the  net  cost  in  the event the counterparties with contracts in which we are in a gain position fail to perform under the terms of those contracts. We use the current fair value to represent credit exposure without giving  consideration  to  future  mark-to-market  changes.  The credit risk amounts take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral. Our consumer  and  commercial  credit  extension and review procedures encompass funded and unfunded credit exposures. For  more  information  on  derivatives  and  credit  extension commitments,  see Note  3  -  Derivatives and Note  12  Commitments  and  Contingencies to  the  Consolidated  Financial Statements.\n\nWe  manage  credit  risk  based  on  the  risk  profile  of  the borrower  or  counterparty,  repayment  sources,  the  nature  of underlying  collateral,  and  other  support  given  current  events, conditions and expectations. We classify our portfolios as either consumer  or  commercial  and  monitor  credit  risk  in  each  as discussed below.\n\nWe  refine  our  underwriting  and  credit  risk  management practices  as  well  as  credit  standards  to  meet  the  changing economic  environment.  To  mitigate  losses  and  enhance customer  support  in  our  consumer  businesses,  we  have  in place collection  programs and loan modification and customer assistance  infrastructures.  We  utilize  a  number  of  actions  to mitigate losses  in  the  commercial  businesses  including increasing  the  frequency  and  intensity  of  portfolio  monitoring, hedging activity and our practice of transferring management of deteriorating  commercial  exposures  to  independent  special asset officers as credits enter criticized categories .\n\nFor information on our credit risk management activities, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management below, Commercial Portfolio  Credit  Risk  Management  on  page  91,  Non-U.S. Portfolio on page 97, Allowance for Credit Losses on page 99, and Note 5 - Outstanding Loans and Leases and Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nDuring  2020,  the  pandemic  negatively  impacted  economic activity in the U.S. and around the world. In particular, beginning in the latter portion of the first quarter of 2020, the pandemic resulted  in  changes  to  consumer  and  business  behaviors  and restrictions on economic activity. These restrictions gave rise to increased unemployment and underemployment, lower business profits, increased business closures and bankruptcies, fluctuations  and  disruptions  to  commercial  and  consumer spending  and  markets,  and  lower  global  GDP,  all  of  which negatively  impacted  our  consumer  and  commercial  credit portfolio.",

        "page_content": "To provide relief to individuals and businesses in the U.S., economic  stimulus  packages  were  enacted  throughout  2020, including  the  CARES  Act,  an  executive  order  signed  in  August 2020 to establish the Lost Wage Assistance Program, and most recently, the  Consolidated  Appropriations  Act  enacted  in December  2020.  In  addition,  U.S.  bank  regulatory  agencies issued  interagency  guidance  to  financial  institutions  that  have worked  with  and  continue  to  work  with  borrowers  affected  by COVID-19.\n\nTo  support  our  customers,  we  implemented  various  loan modification programs and other forms of support beginning in March  2020,  including  offering  loan  payment  deferrals, refunding certain fees, and pausing foreclosure sales, evictions and  repossessions.  Since  June  2020,  we  have  experienced  a decline in the need for customer assistance as the number of customer  accounts  and  balances  on  deferral  decreased significantly. For  information  on  the  accounting  for  loan modifications related to the pandemic, see Note 1 - Summary of Significant  Accounting  Principles to  the  Consolidated  Financial Statements.\n\nFurthermore, as COVID-19 cases eased and initial restrictions  lifted,  the  global  economy  began  to  improve.  This improvement, coupled with the aforementioned relief, facilitated economic  recovery,  with  unemployment  dropping  from  doubledigit highs in the second quarter of 2020 and GDP significantly rebounding in the third quarter of 2020.\n\nHowever,  economic  recovery  remains  uneven,  with  certain sectors  of  the  economy  more  significantly  impacted  from  the pandemic (e.g., travel and entertainment). As a result, we have experienced  increases  in  commercial  reservable  criticized utilized exposures driven by industries most heavily impacted by COVID-19. Also, we have seen modest increases in nonperforming loans driven by commercial loans and consumer real  estate  customer  deferral  activities,  though  consumer charge-offs remained low during 2020 due to payment deferrals and government stimulus benefits.\n\nThe  pandemic  and  its  full  impact  on  the  global  economy continue  to  be  highly  uncertain.  While  COVID-19  cases  have begun  to  ease  from  their  January  2021  peak,  the  spread  of new, more contagious variants could impact the magnitude and duration of this health crisis. However, ongoing virus containment  efforts  and  vaccination  progress,  as  well  as  the possibility of further government stimulus, could accelerate the macroeconomic  recovery.  For  more  information  on  how  the pandemic may affect our operations, see Executive Summary Recent  Developments  -  COVID-19  Pandemic  on  page  48  and Item 1A. Risk Factors of our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management\n\nCredit risk management for the consumer portfolio begins with initial underwriting and continues throughout a borrower's credit cycle.  Statistical  techniques  in  conjunction  with  experiential judgment  are  used  in  all  aspects  of  portfolio  management including  underwriting,  product  pricing,  risk  appetite,  setting credit limits, and establishing operating processes and metrics to quantify and balance risks and returns. Statistical models are built using detailed behavioral information from external sources such as credit bureaus and/or internal historical experience and are  a  component  of  our  consumer  credit  risk  management process.  These  models  are  used  in  part  to  assist  in  making both  new  and  ongoing  credit  decisions,  as  well  as  portfolio management  strategies,  including  authorizations  and  line management, collection practices and strategies, and determination  of  the  allowance  for  loan  and  lease  losses  and allocated capital for credit risk.\n\n## Consumer Credit Portfolio\n\nWhile COVID-19 is severely impacting economic activity, and is contributing  to  increasing  nonperforming  loans  within  certain consumer  portfolios,  it  did  not  have  a  significant  impact  on consumer  portfolio  charge-offs  during  2020  due  to  payment deferrals and government stimulus benefits. However, COVID-19 could lead to adverse impacts to credit quality metrics in future periods  if  negative  economic  conditions  continue  or  worsen. During  2020,  net  charge-offs  decreased  $334  million  to  $2.7 billion primarily due to lower credit card losses.\n\nThe  consumer  allowance  for  loan  and  lease  losses increased  $5.5  billion  in  2020  to  $10.1  billion  due  to  the adoption of the new CECL accounting standard and deterioration in the economic outlook resulting from the impact of COVID-19. For more information, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 99.\n\nFor  more  information  on  our  accounting  policies  regarding delinquencies, nonperforming status, charge-offs, TDRs for the consumer  portfolio,  as  well  as  interest  accrual  policies  and delinquency  status  for  loan  modifications  related  to  the pandemic,  see Note  1  -  Summary  of  Significant  Accounting Principles and Note  5  -  Outstanding  Loans  and  Leases  and Allowance  for  Credit  Losses to  the  Consolidated  Financial Statements.\n\nTable  19  presents  our  outstanding  consumer  loans  and leases, consumer nonperforming loans and accruing consumer loans past due 90 days or more.\n\nBank of America 2020\n\n85",

presentation of information adjusted to exclude the impact of the fully-insured loan portfolio and loans accounted for under the fair value option is more representative of the ongoing operations and credit quality of the business. As a  result,  in  the  following  tables  and  discussions  of  the residential  mortgage  and  home  equity  portfolios,  we  exclude loans  accounted  for  under  the  fair  value  option  and  provide information  that  excludes  the  impact  of  the  fully-insured  loan portfolio in certain credit quality statistics.\n\n## Residential Mortgage\n\nThe  residential  mortgage  portfolio  made  up  the  largest percentage  of  our  consumer  loan  portfolio  at  52  percent  of consumer loans and leases at December  31,  2020. Approximately  52  percent  of  the  residential  mortgage  portfolio was  in Consumer  Banking and  40  percent  was  in GWIM. The remaining portion was in All Other and was comprised of loans used  in  our  overall  ALM  activities,  delinquent  FHA  loans\n\nrepurchased  pursuant  to  our  servicing  agreements  with  the Government  National  Mortgage  Association  as  well  as  loans repurchased related to our representations and warranties.\n\nOutstanding  balances  in  the  residential  mortgage  portfolio decreased  $12.6  billion  in  2020  as  both  loan  sales  and paydowns were partially offset by originations.\n\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, the residential mortgage portfolio included $11.8 billion and $18.7 billion of outstanding fully-insured loans, of which $2.8 billion and $11.2 billion had FHA  insurance,  with  the  remainder  protected  by  Fannie  Mae long-term standby agreements. The decline was primarily driven by sales of loans with FHA insurance during 2020.\n\nBank of America 2020\n\n87",

Of  the nonperforming  residential  mortgage  loans  at  December  31, 2020, $892 million, or 45 percent, were current on contractual payments. Loans accruing past due 30 days or more decreased $72 million.\n\nNet  charge-offs  increased  $17  million  to  a  net  recovery  of $30 million in 2020 compared to a net recovery of $47 million in  2019.  This  increase  is  due  largely  to  lower  recoveries  from the sales of previously charged-off loans.\n\nOf  the  $211.7  billion  in  total  residential  mortgage  loans outstanding at December 31, 2020, as shown in Table 22, 27 percent were originated as interest-only loans. The outstanding balance  of  interest-only  residential  mortgage  loans  that  have entered the amortization period was $5.9 billion, or 10 percent, at  December 31, 2020. Residential mortgage loans that have entered  the  amortization  period  generally  have  experienced  a higher  rate  of  early  stage  delinquencies  and  nonperforming status  compared  to  the  residential  mortgage  portfolio  as  a whole. At December 31, 2020, $113 million, or two percent of outstanding interest-only residential mortgages that had entered\n\nthe amortization period were accruing past due 30 days or more compared  to  $1.2  billion,  or  less  than  one  percent,  for  the entire residential mortgage portfolio. In addition, at December  31,  2020,  $356  million,  or  six  percent,  of outstanding  interest-only  residential  mortgage  loans  that  had entered  the  amortization  period  were  nonperforming,  of  which $96 million were contractually current, compared to $2.0 billion, or  one  percent,  for  the  entire  residential  mortgage  portfolio. Loans  that  have  yet  to  enter  the  amortization  period  in  our interest-only  residential  mortgage  portfolio  are  primarily  wellcollateralized loans to our wealth management clients and have an interest-only period of three to ten years. Approximately 98 percent of these loans that have yet to enter the amortization period  will  not  be  required  to  make  a  fully-amortizing  payment until 2022 or later.\n\nTable  23  presents  outstandings,  nonperforming  loans  and net charge-offs by certain state concentrations for the residential  mortgage  portfolio.  The  Los  Angeles-Long  BeachSanta Ana Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) within California represented 16 percent of outstandings at both December 31, 2020 and 2019.

Of  the  nonperforming  home  equity loans at December 31, 2020, $259 million, or 40 percent, were current  on  contractual  payments.  In  addition,  $237  million,  or 36 percent, of nonperforming home equity loans were 180 days or more past due and had been written down to the estimated fair value of the collateral, less costs to sell. Accruing loans that were 30 days or more past due decreased $32 million in 2020.\n\nNet charge-offs increased $285 million to a net recovery of $73 million in 2020 compared to a net recovery of $358 million in  2019 as the prior-year period included recoveries from noncore home equity loan sales.\n\nOf the $34.3  billion in total home  equity  portfolio outstandings at December 31, 2020, as shown in Table 24, 15 percent require interest-only payments. The outstanding balance of HELOCs that have reached the end of their draw period and have  entered  the  amortization  period  was  $9.2  billion  at December  31,  2020.  The  HELOCs  that  have  entered  the amortization  period  have  experienced  a  higher  percentage  of early  stage  delinquencies  and  nonperforming  status  when compared to the HELOC portfolio as a whole. At December 31, 2020, $121 million, or one percent of outstanding HELOCs that had entered  the amortization period  were accruing past due 30\n\ndays or more. In addition, at December 31, 2020, $477 million, or  five  percent,  were  nonperforming.  Loans  that  have  yet  to enter  the  amortization  period  in  our  interest-only  portfolio  are primarily  post-2008  vintages  and  generally  have  better  credit quality  than  the  previous  vintages  that  had  entered  the amortization  period.  We  communicate  to  contractually  current customers more than a year prior to the end of their draw period to inform them of the potential change to the payment structure before  entering  the  amortization  period,  and  provide  payment options to customers prior to the end of the draw period.\n\nAlthough  we  do  not  actively  track  how  many  of  our  home equity  customers  pay  only  the  minimum  amount  due  on  their home  equity  loans  and  lines,  we  can  infer  some  of  this information  through  a  review  of  our  HELOC  portfolio  that  we service and that is still in its revolving period.

Credit card and other consumer loan modifications generally involve a reduction in the customer's interest rate on the account and placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months.\n\nModifications  of  credit  card  and  other  consumer  loans  are made  through  programs  utilizing  direct  customer  contact,  but may also utilize external programs. At December 31, 2020 and 2019,  our  credit  card  and  other  consumer  TDR  portfolio  was $701 million and $679 million, of which $614 million and $570 million  were  current  or  less  than  30  days  past  due  under  the modified terms.\n\n## Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management\n\nCredit risk management for the commercial portfolio begins with an  assessment  of  the  credit  risk  profile  of  the  borrower  or counterparty based on an analysis of its financial position. As part of the overall credit risk assessment, our commercial credit exposures are assigned a risk rating and are subject to approval based on defined credit approval standards. Subsequent to loan origination, risk ratings are monitored on an ongoing basis, and if necessary,  adjusted  to  reflect  changes  in  the  financial condition,  cash  flow,  risk  profile  or  outlook  of  a  borrower  or counterparty. In making credit decisions, we consider risk rating, collateral, country, industry and single-name concentration limits while  also  balancing  these  considerations  with  the  total\n\nborrower or counterparty relationship. We use a variety of tools to continuously monitor the ability of a borrower or counterparty to perform under its obligations. We use risk rating aggregations to  measure  and  evaluate  concentrations  within  portfolios.  In addition,  risk  ratings  are  a  factor  in  determining  the  level  of allocated capital and the allowance for credit losses.\n\nAs part of our ongoing risk mitigation initiatives, we attempt to  work  with  clients  experiencing  financial  difficulty  to  modify their loans to terms that better align with their current ability to pay.  In  situations  where  an  economic  concession  has  been granted to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty, we identify these loans as TDRs. For more information on our accounting policies regarding delinquencies, nonperforming status and net charge-offs for the commercial portfolio, see Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements .\n\n## Management of Commercial Credit Risk Concentrations\n\nCommercial credit risk is evaluated and managed with the goal that  concentrations  of  credit  exposure  continue  to  be  aligned with  our  risk  appetite.  We  review,  measure  and  manage concentrations of credit exposure by industry, product, geography, customer relationship and loan size. We also review, measure  and  manage  commercial  real  estate  loans  by geographic  location  and  property  type.  In  addition,  within  our\n\nBank of America 2020\n\n91",

        "page_content": "non-U.S.  portfolio,  we  evaluate  exposures  by  region  and  by country. Tables 34, 37 and 40 summarize our concentrations. We also  utilize  syndications  of  exposure  to  third  parties,  loan sales, hedging and other risk mitigation techniques to manage the size and risk profile of the commercial credit portfolio. For more information on our industry concentrations, see Commercial  Portfolio  Credit  Risk  Management  -  Industry Concentrations on page 95 and Table 37.\n\nWe  account  for  certain  large  corporate  loans  and  loan commitments,  including  issued  but  unfunded  letters  of  credit which  are  considered  utilized  for  credit  risk  management purposes, that exceed our single-name credit risk concentration guidelines  under  the  fair  value  option.  Lending  commitments, both funded  and  unfunded,  are  actively  managed  and monitored,  and  as  appropriate,  credit  risk  for  these  lending relationships  may  be  mitigated  through  the  use  of  credit derivatives,  with  our  credit  view  and  market  perspectives determining  the  size  and  timing  of  the  hedging  activity.  In addition,  we  purchase  credit  protection  to  cover  the  funded portion as well as the unfunded portion of certain other credit exposures.  To  lessen  the  cost  of  obtaining  our  desired  credit protection  levels,  credit  exposure  may  be  added  within  an industry,  borrower  or  counterparty  group  by  selling  protection. These  credit  derivatives  do  not  meet  the  requirements  for treatment as accounting hedges. They are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in other income.\n\nIn  addition,  we  are  a  member  of  various  securities  and derivative exchanges and clearinghouses, both in the U.S. and other countries. As a member, we may be required to pay a prorata share  of  the  losses  incurred  by  some  of  these organizations as a result of another member default and under other  loss  scenarios.  For  more  information,  see Note  12  Commitments  and  Contingencies to  the  Consolidated  Financial Statements.\n\n## Commercial Credit Portfolio\n\nDuring 2020, commercial asset quality weakened as a result of the economic impact from COVID-19. However, there were also positive signs during this period. The draws by large corporate\n\nand  commercial  clients  contributing  to  the  $67.2  billion  loan growth in the first quarter of 2020 have largely been repaid, as emergency  or  contingent  funding  was  no  longer  needed  or clients were able to access capital markets. Additionally, as part of  the  CARES  Act,  we  had  $22.7  billion  of  PPP  loans outstanding  with  our  small  business  clients  at  December  31, 2020, which are included in U.S. small business commercial in the tables in this section. For more information on PPP loans, see Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nCredit quality of commercial real estate borrowers has begun to  stabilize  in  many  sectors  as  certain  economies  have reopened.  Certain  sectors,  including  hospitality  and  retail, continue  to  be  negatively  impacted  as  a  result  of  COVID-19. Moreover,  many  real  estate  markets,  while  improving,  are  still experiencing  some  disruptions  in  demand,  supply  chain challenges and tenant difficulties.\n\nThe  commercial  allowance  for  loan  and  lease  losses increased  $3.9  billion  during  2020  to  $8.7  billion  due  to  the deterioration in the economic outlook resulting from the impact of  COVID-19.  For  more  information,  see  Allowance  for  Credit Losses on page 99.\n\nTotal  commercial  utilized  credit  exposure  decreased  $15.0 billion during 2020 to $620.3 billion driven by lower loans and leases.  The  utilization  rate  for  loans  and  leases,  SBLCs  and financial  guarantees,  and  commercial  letters  of  credit,  in  the aggregate,  was  57  percent  at  December  31,  2020  and  58 percent at December 31, 2019.\n\nTable  30  presents  commercial  credit  exposure  by  type  for utilized, unfunded and total binding committed credit exposure. Commercial  utilized  credit  exposure  includes  SBLCs  and financial guarantees and commercial letters of credit that have been  issued  and  for  which  we  are  legally  bound  to  advance funds  under  prescribed  conditions  during  a  specified  time period,  and  excludes  exposure  related  to  trading  account assets.  Although  funds  have  not  yet  been  advanced,  these exposure types are considered utilized for credit risk management purposes.\n\n(1 )\n\n(2 , 3 , 4 )\n\nTable 30  Commercial Credit Exposure by Type\n\n|                                                    | Commercial Utilized   | Commercial Utilized   | Commercial Unfunded   | Commercial Unfunded   | Total Commercial Committed   | Total Commercial Committed   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|\n|                                                    | December 31           | December 31           | December 31           | December 31           | December 31                  | December 31                  |\n| (Dollars in millions)                              | 2020                  | 2019                  | 2020                  | 2019                  | 2020                         | 2019                         |\n| Loans and leases                                   | $ 499,065             | $ 517,657             | $ 404,740             | $ 405,834             | $ 903,805                    | $ 923,491                    |\n| Derivative assets  (5 )                            | 47,179                | 40,485                | -                     | -                     | 47,179                       | 40,485                       |\n| Standby letters of credit and financial guarantees | 34,616                | 36,062                | 538                   | 468                   | 35,154                       | 36,530                       |\n| Debt securities and other investments              | 22,618                | 25,546                | 4,827                 | 5,101                 | 27,445                       | 30,647                       |\n| Loans held-for-sale                                | 8,378                 | 7,047                 | 9,556                 | 15,135                | 17,934                       | 22,182                       |\n| Operating leases                                   | 6,424                 | 6,660                 | -                     | -                     | 6,424                        | 6,660                        |\n| Commercial letters of credit                       | 855                   | 1,049                 | 280                   | 451                   | 1,135                        | 1,500                        |\n| Other                                              | 1,168                 | 800                   | -                     | -                     | 1,168                        | 800                          |\n| Total                                              | $ 620,303             | $ 635,306             | $ 419,941             | $ 426,989             | $  1,040,244                 | $  1,062,295                 |\n\n92\n\nBank of America 2020",

U.S. commercial loans  decreased  $18.3  billion  during  2020  driven  by Global Banking . Reservable criticized utilized exposure increased $13.1 billion,  which  was  spread  across  several  industries,  including travel  and  entertainment,  as  a  result  of  weaker  economic conditions arising from COVID-19.\n\n## Non-U.S. Commercial\n\nAt December 31, 2020, 79 percent of the non-U.S. commercial loan portfolio was managed in Global Banking and 21 percent in Global  Markets .  Non-U.S.  commercial  loans  decreased  $14.5 billion during 2020, primarily in Global Banking . For information on the non-U.S. commercial portfolio, see Non-U.S. Portfolio on page 97.\n\n## Commercial Real Estate\n\nCommercial  real  estate  primarily  includes  commercial  loans secured by non-owner-occupied real estate and is dependent on the  sale  or  lease  of  the  real  estate  as  the  primary  source  of repayment.  Outstanding  loans  declined  by  $2.3  billion  during\n\n2020  as  paydowns  exceeded  new  originations.  Reservable criticized  utilized  exposure  increased  $9.1  billion  to  $10.2 billion  from  $1.1  billion,  or  16.42  and  1.75  percent  of  the commercial  real  estate  portfolio  at  December  31,  2020  and 2019,  due  to  downgrades  driven  by  the  impact  of  COVID-19 across industries, primarily hotels. Although we have observed property-level improvements in a number of the most impacted sectors,  the  length  of  time  for  recovery  has  been  slower  than originally anticipated, which has prompted additional downgrades.  The  portfolio  remains  diversified  across  property types and geographic regions. California represented the largest state  concentration  at  23  percent  and  24  percent  of  the commercial  real  estate  portfolio  at  December  31,  2020  and 2019.  The  commercial  real  estate  portfolio  is  predominantly managed  in Global  Banking and  consists  of  loans  made primarily to public and private developers, and commercial real estate firms.\n\nDuring  2020,  we  continued  to  see  low  default  rates  and varying  degrees  of  improvement  in  the  portfolio.  We  use  a number  of  proactive  risk  mitigation  initiatives  to  reduce adversely rated exposure in the commercial real estate portfolio, including transfers of deteriorating exposures to management by independent  special  asset  officers  and  the  pursuit  of  loan restructurings or asset sales to achieve the best results for our customers and the Corporation.\n\nTable 34 presents outstanding commercial real estate loans by  geographic  region,  based  on  the  geographic  location  of  the collateral, and by property type.\n\n## Table 34  Outstanding Commercial Real Estate Loans\n\nTable 35 presents the nonperforming commercial loans, leases and  foreclosed  properties  activity  during  2020  and  2019.\n\n|                                                | December 31   | December 31   |\n|------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| (Dollars in millions)                          | 2020          | 2019          |\n| By Geographic Region                           |               |               |\n| California                                     | $ 14,028      | $ 14,910      |\n| Northeast                                      | 11,628        | 12,408        |\n| Southwest                                      | 8,551         | 8,408         |\n| Southeast                                      | 6,588         | 5,937         |\n| Florida                                        | 4,294         | 3,984         |\n| Midwest                                        | 3,483         | 3,203         |\n| Illinois                                       | 2,594         | 3,349         |\n| Midsouth                                       | 2,370         | 2,468         |\n| Northwest                                      | 1,634         | 1,638         |\n| Non-U.S. (1 )                                  | 3,187         | 3,724         |\n| Other                                          | 2,007         | 2,660         |\n| Total outstanding commercial real estate loans | $ 60,364      | $ 62,689      |\n| By Property Type                               |               |               |\n| Non-residential                                |               |               |\n| Office                                         | $ 17,667      | $ 17,902      |\n| Industrial / Warehouse                         | 8,330         | 8,677         |\n| Shopping centers / Retail                      | 7,931         | 8,183         |\n| Hotels / Motels                                | 7,226         | 6,982         |\n| Multi-family rental                            | 7,051         | 7,250         |\n| Unsecured                                      | 2,336         | 3,438         |\n| Multi-use                                      | 1,460         | 1,788         |\n| Other                                          | 7,146         | 6,958         |\n| Total non-residential                          | 59,147        | 61,178        |\n| Residential                                    | 1,217         | 1,511         |\n| Total outstanding commercial real estate loans | $ 60,364      | $ 62,689      |\n\n## U.S. Small Business Commercial\n\nThe U.S. small business commercial loan portfolio is comprised of small business card loans and small business loans primarily managed  in Consumer  Banking, and  includes  $22.7  billion  of PPP loans outstanding at December 31, 2020.

During  2020,  nonperforming  commercial loans  and  leases  increased  $728  million  to  $2.2  billion, primarily  driven  by  the  impact  of  COVID-19.  At  December  31, 2020,  84  percent  of  commercial  nonperforming  loans,  leases and  foreclosed  properties  were  secured  and  66  percent  were\n\ncontractually  current.  Commercial  nonperforming  loans  were carried  at  81 percent  of  their unpaid principal  balance before consideration of the allowance for loan and lease losses, as the carrying value of these loans has been reduced to the estimated collateral value less costs to sell.\n\nTable 35  Nonperforming Commercial Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties Activity (1 , 2 )\n\n2019\n\nTable  37  presents  commercial  committed  and  utilized  credit exposure by industry and the total net credit default protection purchased to cover the funded and unfunded portions of certain credit exposures. Our commercial credit exposure is diversified across a broad range of industries. Total commercial committed exposure decreased $22.1 billion, or two percent, during 2020 to $1.0  trillion. The  decrease  in  commercial  committed exposure  was  concentrated  in  the  Global  commercial  banks, Asset  managers  and  funds,  Utilities,  and  Real  estate  industry sectors. Decreases were partially offset by increased exposure to  the  Finance  companies  and  Automobiles  and  components industry sectors.\n\n| (Dollars in millions)                                                                                                                                     | 2020    |         |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Nonperforming loans and leases, January 1                                                                                                                 | $ 1,499 | $ 1,102 |\n| Additions                                                                                                                                                 | 3,518   | 2,048   |\n| Reductions:                                                                                                                                               |         |         |\n| Paydowns                                                                                                                                                  | (1,002) | (648)   |\n| Sales                                                                                                                                                     | (350)   | (215)   |\n| Returns to performing status  (3 )                                                                                                                        | (172)   | (120)   |\n| Charge-offs                                                                                                                                               | (1,208) | (478)   |\n| Transfers to foreclosed properties                                                                                                                        | (2)     | (9)     |\n| Transfers to loans held-for-sale                                                                                                                          | (56)    | (181)   |\n| Total net additions to nonperforming loans and leases                                                                                                     | 728     | 397     |\n| Total nonperforming loans and leases, December 31                                                                                                         | 2,227   | 1,499   |\n| Foreclosed properties, December 31                                                                                                                        | 41      | 56      |\n| Nonperforming commercial loans, leases and foreclosed properties, December 31                                                                             | 2,268   | 1,555   |\n| Nonperforming commercial loans and leases as a percentage of outstanding commercial loans and leases  (4 )                                                | 0.45 %  | 0.29 %  |\n| Nonperforming commercial loans, leases and foreclosed properties as a percentage of outstanding commercial loans, leases  and foreclosed properties  (4 ) | 0.46    | 0.30    |\n\nTable 36 presents our commercial TDRs by product type and performing  status.

The  majority  of the increase was due to higher deposits with central banks in Germany and Japan.\n\n|                                                             | December 31   | December 31   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n|                                                             | 2020          | 2019          |\n| Less than or equal to one year                              | 65 %          | 54 %          |\n| Greater than one year and less than or equal  to five years | 34            | 45            |\n| Greater than five years                                     | 1             | 1             |\n| Total net credit default protection                         | 100 %         | 100 %         |\n\n## Table 39  Net Credit Default Protection by Credit Exposure Debt Rating\n\n|                                      | Net  Notional  (1 )   | Percent of  Total   | Net  Notional  (1 )   | Percent of  Total   |\n|--------------------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|\n|                                      | December 31           | December 31         | December 31           | December 31         |\n| (Dollars in millions)                | 2020                  | 2020                | 2019                  | 2019                |\n| Ratings  (2 , 3 )                    |                       |                     |                       |                     |\n| A                                    | $ (250)               | 6.0 %               | $ (697)               | 20.8 %              |\n| BBB                                  | (1,856)               | 44.5                | (1,089)               | 32.5                |\n| BB                                   | (1,363)               | 32.7                | (766)                 | 22.9                |\n| B                                    | (465)                 | 11.2                | (373)                 | 11.1                |\n| CCC and below                        | (182)                 | 4.4                 | (119)                 | 3.6                 |\n| NR  (4 )                             | (54)                  | 1.2                 | (305)                 | 9.1                 |\n| Total net credit  default protection | $  (4,170)            | 100.0 %             | $  (3,349)            | 100.0 %             |\n\nIn  addition  to  our  net  notional  credit  default  protection purchased to cover the funded and unfunded portion of certain credit exposures, credit derivatives are used for market-making activities for clients and establishing positions intended to profit from  directional  or  relative  value  changes.  We  execute  the majority  of  our  credit  derivative  trades  in  the  OTC  market  with large, multinational  financial  institutions,  including  brokerdealers  and,  to  a  lesser  degree,  with  a  variety  of  other investors. Because these transactions are executed in the OTC market, we are subject to settlement risk. We are also subject to  credit  risk  in  the  event  that  these  counterparties  fail  to perform  under the terms of these contracts. In order to properly reflect counterparty credit risk, we record counterparty credit risk valuation adjustments on certain derivative assets, including our\n\npurchased  credit  default  protection.  In  most  cases,  credit derivative  transactions  are  executed  on  a  daily  margin  basis. Therefore, events such as a credit downgrade, depending on the ultimate  rating  level,  or  a  breach  of  credit  covenants  would typically require an increase in the amount of collateral required by the counterparty, where applicable, and/or allow us to take additional protective measures such as early termination of all trades. For more  information  on  credit  derivatives  and counterparty  credit  risk  valuation  adjustments,  see Note  3  Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Non-U.S. Portfolio\n\nOur non-U.S. credit and trading portfolios are subject to country risk. We define country risk as the risk of loss from unfavorable economic and political conditions, currency fluctuations, social instability and changes  in government  policies. A risk management  framework  is  in  place  to  measure,  monitor  and manage non-U.S. risk and exposures. In addition to the direct risk  of  doing  business  in  a  country,  we  also  are  exposed  to indirect country risks (e.g., related to the collateral received on secured  financing  transactions  or  related  to  client  clearing activities). These indirect exposures are managed in the normal course of business through credit, market and operational risk governance, rather than through country risk governance.\n\nNon-U.S.  exposure  is  presented  on  an  internal  risk management  basis  and  includes  sovereign  and  non-sovereign credit exposure, securities and other investments issued by or domiciled in countries other than the U.S.\n\nFunded  loans  and  loan  equivalents  include  loans,  leases, and  other  extensions  of  credit  and  funds,  including  letters  of credit  and  due  from  placements.  Unfunded  commitments  are the  undrawn portion of legally  binding  commitments  related  to loans and loan equivalents. Net counterparty exposure includes the  fair  value  of  derivatives,  including  the  counterparty  risk associated  with  credit  default  swaps  (CDS),  and  secured financing  transactions.  Securities  and  other  investments  are carried  at  fair  value  and  long  securities  exposures  are  netted against short exposures with the same underlying issuer to, but not  below,  zero.  Net  country  exposure  represents  country exposure less hedges and credit default protection purchased, net of credit default protection sold.\n\nBank of America 2020\n\n97",

Our second largest non-U.S. country exposure was Germany with net exposure of $44.9 billion at December 31, 2020, a $14.1 billion  increase  from  December  31,  2019.  The  increase  in Germany  was  primarily  driven  by  an  increase  in  deposits  with the central bank.\n\nIn  light  of  the  global  pandemic,  we  are  monitoring  our  nonU.S. exposure closely, particularly in countries where restrictions on certain activities, in an attempt to contain the spread  and impact  of  the  virus,  have affected  and will likely continue to adversely affect economic activity. We are managing the impact to  our  international  business  operations  as  part  of  our  overall response framework and are taking actions to manage exposure carefully in impacted regions while supporting the needs of our clients. The magnitude and duration of the pandemic and its full impact on the global economy continue to be highly uncertain.\n\nThe impact of COVID-19 could have an adverse impact on the global  economy  for  a  prolonged  period  of  time.

Upon adoption of the new accounting standard, the  Corporation  recorded  a  net  increase  of  $3.3  billion  in  the allowance  for  credit  losses  which  was  comprised  of  a  net increase  of  $2.9  billion  in  the  allowance  for  loan  and  lease losses  and  an  increase  of  $310  million  in  the  reserve  for unfunded lending commitments. The net increase was primarily driven  by  a  $3.1  billion  increase  related  to  the  credit  card portfolio.\n\nThe  allowance  for  credit  losses  further  increased  by  $7.2 billion from January 1, 2020 to $20.7 billion at December 31, 2020, which included a $5.0 billion reserve increase related to the  commercial  portfolio  and  a  $2.2  billion  reserve  increase related to the consumer portfolio. The increases were driven by deterioration in the economic outlook resulting from the impact of COVID-19.\n\nThe following table presents an allocation of the allowance for  credit  losses  by  product  type  for  December  31,  2020, January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2019 (prior to the adoption of the CECL accounting standard).\n\nTable 42  Allocation of the Allowance for Credit Losses by

The provision for credit losses increased $7.7 billion to $11.3 billion during 2020 compared to 2019. The allowance for credit losses included a reserve build of $7.2 billion for 2020, excluding the impact  of  the  new  accounting  standard,  primarily  due  to  the deterioration in the economic outlook resulting from the impact of  COVID-19 on both the consumer and commercial portfolios. The  provision  for  credit  losses  for  the  consumer  portfolio, including unfunded lending commitments, increased $2.0 billion to $4.9 billion during 2020 compared to 2019. The provision for credit losses  for  the  commercial  portfolio, including unfunded\n\nlending  commitments,  increased  $5.7  billion  to  $6.5  billion during 2020 compared to 2019.\n\nThe  following  table  presents  a  rollforward  of  the  allowance for credit losses, including certain loan and allowance ratios for 2020,  noting  that  measurement  of  the  allowance  for  credit losses  for  2019  was  based  on  management's  estimate  of probable  incurred  losses.

        "page_content": "## Market Risk Management\n\nMarket risk is the risk that changes in market conditions may adversely impact the value of assets or liabilities, or otherwise negatively impact earnings. This risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations, primarily within our Global Markets segment. We are also exposed to these risks in other areas of the Corporation (e.g., our ALM activities). In the event  of  market  stress,  these  risks  could  have  a  material impact on our results. For more information, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book on page 105.\n\nWe  have  been  affected,  and  expect  to  continue  to  be affected,  by  market  stress  resulting  from  the  pandemic  that began in the first quarter of 2020. For more information  on  the effects  of the  pandemic,  see  Executive  Summary  -  Recent Developments - COVID-19 Pandemic  on page 48.\n\nOur  traditional  banking  loan  and  deposit  products  are  nontrading  positions  and  are  generally  reported  at  amortized  cost for  assets  or  the  amount  owed  for  liabilities  (historical  cost). However,  these  positions  are  still  subject  to  changes  in economic value based on varying market conditions, with one of the primary risks being changes in the levels of interest rates. The risk of adverse changes in the economic value of our nontrading  positions  arising  from  changes  in  interest  rates  is managed  through  our  ALM  activities.  We  have  elected  to account  for  certain  assets  and  liabilities  under  the  fair  value option.\n\nOur trading positions are reported at fair value with changes reflected  in  income.  Trading  positions  are  subject  to  various changes in market-based risk factors. The majority of this risk is generated by our activities in the interest rate, foreign exchange, credit, equity and commodities markets. In addition, the values of  assets  and  liabilities  could  change  due  to  market  liquidity, correlations across  markets  and  expectations  of  market volatility.  We  seek to manage these risk exposures by using a variety of techniques that encompass a broad range of financial instruments. The key risk management  techniques  are discussed  in  more  detail  in  the  Trading  Risk  Management section.\n\nGlobal Risk Management is responsible for providing senior management with a clear and comprehensive understanding of the trading risks to which we are exposed. These responsibilities include ownership  of  market  risk  policy, developing and maintaining quantitative risk models, calculating aggregated risk measures, establishing and monitoring position limits consistent with risk appetite, conducting daily reviews and analysis of trading inventory, approving material risk exposures and fulfilling  regulatory  requirements.  Market  risks  that  impact businesses  outside  of Global  Markets are  monitored  and governed by their respective governance functions.\n\nModel  risk  is  the  potential  for  adverse  consequences  from decisions  based  on  incorrect  or  misused  model  outputs  and reports.  Given  that  models  are  used  across  the  Corporation, model  risk  impacts  all  risk  types  including  credit,  market  and operational  risks.  The  Enterprise  Model  Risk  Policy  defines model  risk  standards,  consistent  with  our  risk  framework  and risk  appetite,  prevailing  regulatory  guidance  and  industry  best practice. All models, including risk management, valuation and regulatory capital models, must meet certain validation criteria, including effective challenge of the conceptual soundness of the model,  independent  model  testing  and  ongoing  monitoring through  outcomes  analysis  and  benchmarking.  The  Enterprise Model  Risk  Committee  (EMRC),  a  subcommittee  of  the  MRC, oversees that model standards are consistent with model risk requirements and monitors the effective challenge in the model validation process across the Corporation.\n\n## Interest Rate Risk\n\nInterest  rate  risk  represents  exposures  to  instruments  whose values  vary  with  the  level  or  volatility  of  interest  rates.  These instruments  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  loans,  debt securities, certain trading-related assets and liabilities, deposits, borrowings and derivatives. Hedging instruments used to  mitigate  these  risks  include  derivatives  such  as  options, futures, forwards and swaps.\n\n## Foreign Exchange Risk\n\nForeign exchange risk represents exposures to changes in the values of current holdings and future cash flows denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The types of instruments exposed to this risk include investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries, foreign currency-denominated loans and securities, future  cash  flows  in  foreign  currencies  arising  from  foreign exchange  transactions,  foreign  currency-denominated  debt  and various foreign exchange derivatives whose values fluctuate with changes in the level or volatility of currency exchange rates or non-U.S.  interest  rates.  Hedging  instruments  used  to  mitigate this  risk  include  foreign  exchange  options,  currency  swaps, futures,  forwards,  and  foreign  currency-denominated  debt  and deposits.\n\n## Mortgage Risk\n\nMortgage risk represents exposures to changes in the values of mortgage-related instruments. The values of these instruments are sensitive to prepayment rates, mortgage rates, agency debt ratings,  default,  market  liquidity,  government  participation  and interest rate volatility. Our exposure to these instruments takes several  forms.  For  example,  we  trade  and  engage  in  marketmaking  activities  in  a  variety  of  mortgage  securities  including whole  loans,  pass-through  certificates,  commercial  mortgages and  collateralized  mortgage  obligations  including  collateralized debt  obligations  using  mortgages  as  underlying  collateral.  In addition,  we  originate  a  variety  of  MBS,  which  involves  the accumulation  of  mortgage-related  loans  in  anticipation  of eventual securitization, and we may hold positions in mortgage securities  and  residential  mortgage  loans  as  part  of  the  ALM portfolio.  We  also  record  MSRs  as  part  of  our  mortgage origination activities. Hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk  include  derivatives  such  as  options,  swaps,  futures  and forwards as well as securities including MBS and U.S. Treasury securities.  For  more  information,  see  Mortgage  Banking  Risk Management on page 107.\n\n## Equity Market Risk\n\nEquity  market  risk  represents  exposures  to  securities  that represent an ownership interest in a corporation in the form of domestic  and  foreign  common  stock  or  other  equity-linked instruments.  Instruments  that  would  lead  to  this  exposure include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  the  following:  common  stock, exchange-traded funds, American Depositary Receipts, convertible  bonds,  listed  equity  options  (puts  and  calls),  OTC equity  options,  equity  total  return  swaps,  equity  index  futures and other equity derivative products. Hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include options, futures, swaps, convertible bonds and cash positions.\n\n## Commodity Risk\n\nCommodity risk represents exposures to instruments traded in the  petroleum,  natural  gas,  power  and  metals  markets.  These instruments  consist  primarily  of  futures,  forwards,  swaps  and options. Hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include\n\nBank of America 2020\n\n101",

        "page_content": "options,  futures  and  swaps  in  the  same  or  similar  commodity product, as well as cash positions.\n\n## Issuer Credit Risk\n\nIssuer  credit  risk  represents  exposures  to  changes  in  the creditworthiness of individual issuers or groups of issuers. Our portfolio is exposed to issuer credit risk where the value of an asset  may  be  adversely  impacted  by  changes  in  the  levels  of credit  spreads,  by  credit  migration  or  by  defaults.  Hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include bonds, CDS and other credit fixed-income instruments.\n\n## Market Liquidity Risk\n\nMarket  liquidity  risk  represents  the  risk  that  the  level  of expected  market  activity  changes  dramatically  and,  in  certain cases, may even cease. This exposes us to the risk that we will not  be  able  to  transact  business  and  execute  trades  in  an orderly manner which may impact our results. This impact could be further exacerbated if expected hedging or pricing correlations  are  compromised  by  disproportionate  demand  or lack of demand for certain instruments. We utilize various risk mitigating  techniques  as  discussed  in  more  detail  in  Trading Risk Management.\n\n## Trading Risk Management\n\nTo evaluate risks in our trading activities, we focus on the actual and  potential  volatility  of  revenues  generated  by  individual positions as well as portfolios of positions. Various techniques and  procedures  are  utilized  to  enable  the  most  complete understanding of these risks. Quantitative measures of market risk are evaluated on a daily basis from a single position to the portfolio of the Corporation. These measures include sensitivities of positions to various market risk factors, such as the potential impact on revenue from a one basis point change in  interest  rates,  and  statistical  measures  utilizing  both  actual and  hypothetical  market  moves,  such  as  VaR  and  stress testing.  Periods  of  extreme  market  stress  influence  the reliability  of  these  techniques  to  varying  degrees.  Qualitative evaluations  of  market  risk  utilize  the  suite  of  quantitative  risk measures  while  understanding  each  of  their  respective limitations.  Additionally,  risk  managers  independently  evaluate the risk of the portfolios under the current market environment and potential future environments.\n\nVaR is a common statistic used to measure market risk as it allows  the  aggregation  of  market  risk  factors,  including  the effects  of  portfolio  diversification.  A  VaR  model  simulates  the value  of  a  portfolio  under  a  range  of  scenarios  in  order  to generate  a  distribution  of  potential  gains  and  losses.  VaR represents the loss a portfolio is not expected to exceed more than a certain number of times per period, based on a specified holding period, confidence level and window of historical data. We  use  one  VaR  model  consistently  across  the  trading portfolios and it uses a historical simulation approach based on a three-year window of historical data. Our primary VaR statistic is  equivalent  to  a  99  percent  confidence  level,  which  means that for a VaR with a one-day holding period, there should not be losses  in  excess  of  VaR,  on  average,  99  out  of  100  trading days.\n\nWithin  any  VaR  model,  there  are  significant  and  numerous assumptions  that  will  differ  from  company  to  company.  The accuracy of a VaR model depends on the availability and quality of historical data for each of the risk factors in the portfolio. A VaR  model  may  require  additional  modeling  assumptions  for new products that do not have the necessary historical market data or for less liquid positions for which accurate daily prices\n\n102\n\nBank of America 2020\n\nare  not  consistently  available.  For  positions  with  insufficient historical  data  for  the  VaR  calculation,  the  process  for establishing an appropriate proxy is based on fundamental and statistical  analysis  of  the  new  product  or  less  liquid  position. This  analysis  identifies  reasonable  alternatives  that  replicate both the expected volatility and correlation to other market risk factors that the missing data would be expected to experience.\n\nVaR  may  not  be  indicative  of  realized  revenue  volatility  as changes  in  market  conditions  or  in  the  composition  of  the portfolio can have a material impact on the results. In particular, the historical  data  used  for  the  VaR  calculation  might  indicate higher  or  lower  levels  of  portfolio  diversification  than  will  be experienced. In order for the VaR model to reflect current market conditions,  we  update  the  historical  data  underlying  our  VaR model on a weekly basis, or more frequently during periods of market stress, and regularly review the assumptions underlying the  model.  A  minor  portion  of  risks  related  to  our  trading positions  is  not  included  in  VaR.  These  risks  are  reviewed  as part  of  our  ICAAP.  For  more  information  regarding  ICAAP,  see Capital Management on page 73.\n\nGlobal Risk Management continually reviews, evaluates and enhances our VaR model so that it reflects the material risks in our  trading  portfolio.  Changes  to  the  VaR  model  are  reviewed and approved prior to implementation and any material changes are reported to management through the appropriate management committees.\n\nTrading  limits  on  quantitative  risk  measures,  including  VaR, are independently set by Global Markets Risk Management and reviewed  on  a  regular  basis  so  that  trading  limits  remain relevant  and  within  our  overall  risk  appetite  for  market  risks. Trading  limits  are  reviewed  in  the  context  of  market  liquidity, volatility and strategic business priorities. Trading limits are set at both a granular level to allow for extensive coverage of risks as  well  as  at  aggregated  portfolios  to  account  for  correlations among  risk  factors.  All  trading  limits  are  approved  at  least annually.  Approved  trading  limits  are  stored  and  tracked  in  a centralized  limits  management  system.  Trading  limit  excesses are communicated to management  for review. Certain quantitative  market  risk  measures  and  corresponding  limits have  been  identified  as  critical  in  the  Corporation's  Risk Appetite Statement. These risk appetite limits are reported on a daily basis and are approved at least annually by the ERC and the Board.\n\nIn periods of market stress, Global Markets senior leadership communicates  daily  to  discuss  losses,  key  risk  positions  and any limit excesses. As a result of this process, the businesses may selectively reduce risk.\n\nTable 44 presents the total market-based portfolio VaR which is the combination of the total covered positions (and less liquid trading  positions)  portfolio  and  the  fair  value  option  portfolio. Covered positions are defined by regulatory standards as trading assets and liabilities, both on- and off-balance sheet, that meet a defined set of specifications. These specifications identify the most liquid trading positions which are intended to be held for a short-term horizon and where we are able to hedge the material risk  elements  in  a  two-way  market.  Positions  in  less  liquid markets, or where there are restrictions on the ability to trade the  positions,  typically  do  not  qualify  as  covered  positions. Foreign exchange and commodity  positions are always considered  covered  positions,  except  for  structural  foreign currency  positions  that  are  excluded  with  prior  regulatory approval.  In  addition,  Table  44  presents  our  fair  value  option portfolio,  which  includes  substantially  all  of  the  funded  and unfunded exposures for which we elect the fair value option, and their  corresponding  hedges.

A  backtesting  excess  occurs  when  a  trading  loss exceeds the VaR for the corresponding day. These excesses are evaluated to understand the positions and market moves that produced  the  trading  loss  with  a  goal  to  ensure  that  the  VaR methodology accurately represents those losses. We expect the frequency of trading losses in excess of VaR to be in line with the  confidence  level  of  the  VaR  statistic  being  tested.  For example,  with  a  99  percent  confidence  level,  we  expect  one trading loss in excess of VaR every 100 days or between two to three trading losses in excess of VaR over the course of a year. The number of backtesting excesses observed can differ from the statistically expected number of excesses if the current level of  market  volatility  is  materially  different  than  the  level  of market volatility that existed during the three years of historical data used in the VaR calculation.\n\nThe  trading  revenue  used  for  backtesting  is  defined  by regulatory agencies in order to most closely align with the VaR component  of  the  regulatory  capital  calculation.  This  revenue differs  from  total  trading-related  revenue  in  that  it  excludes revenue  from  trading  activities  that  either  do  not  generate market risk or the market risk cannot be included in VaR. Some examples of the types of revenue excluded for backtesting are fees, commissions, reserves, net interest income and intra-day trading revenues.\n\nWe  conduct  daily  backtesting  on  the  VaR  results  used  for regulatory capital calculations as well as the VaR results for key legal  entities,  regions  and  risk  factors.  These  results  are reported to senior market risk management. Senior management  regularly  reviews  and  evaluates  the  results  of these tests.\n\nDuring  2020,  there  were  seven  days  where  this  subset  of trading  revenue  had  losses  that  exceeded  our  total  covered portfolio VaR, utilizing a one-day holding period.\n\n## Total Trading-related Revenue\n\nTotal  trading-related  revenue,  excluding  brokerage  fees,  and CVA,  DVA  and  funding  valuation  adjustment  gains  (losses), represents  the  total  amount  earned  from  trading  positions, including market-based net interest income, which are taken in a diverse range of financial instruments and markets. For more information on fair value, see Note 20  -  Fair Value Measurements to the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements.\n\n104\n\nBank of America 2020\n\nTrading-related revenue can be volatile and is largely driven by general market conditions and customer demand. Also, tradingrelated  revenue  is  dependent  on  the  volume  and  type  of transactions,  the  level  of  risk  assumed,  and  the  volatility  of price  and  rate  movements  at  any  given  time  within  the  everchanging  market  environment.  Significant  daily  revenue  by business  is  monitored  and  the  primary  drivers  of  these  are reviewed.\n\nThe  following  histogram  is  a  graphic  depiction  of  trading volatility and illustrates the daily level of trading-related revenue for  2020  and  2019.  During  2020,  positive  trading-related revenue  was  recorded  for  98  percent  of  the  trading  days,  of which 87 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million, and the largest loss was $90 million. This compares to 2019 where  positive  trading-related  revenue  was  recorded  for  98 percent  of  the  trading  days,  of  which  80  percent  were  daily trading gains of over $25 million, and the largest loss was $35 million.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Trading Portfolio Stress Testing\n\nBecause the very nature of a VaR model suggests results can exceed our estimates and it is dependent on a limited historical window,  we  also  stress  test  our  portfolio  using  scenario analysis. This analysis estimates the change in the value of our trading portfolio that may  result  from  abnormal  market movements.\n\nA  set  of  scenarios,  categorized  as  either  historical  or hypothetical, are computed daily for the overall trading portfolio and individual  businesses.  These  scenarios  include  shocks  to underlying  market  risk  factors  that  may  be  well  beyond  the shocks  found  in  the  historical  data  used  to  calculate  VaR. Historical  scenarios  simulate  the  impact  of  the  market  moves that  occurred  during  a  period  of  extended  historical  market stress.  Generally,  a  multi-week  period  representing  the  most",

Hypothetical  scenarios  provide  estimated  portfolio impacts from potential future market stress events. Scenarios are  reviewed  and  updated  in  response  to  changing  positions and new economic or political information. In addition, new or ad  hoc  scenarios  are  developed  to  address  specific  potential market events or particular  vulnerabilities  in  the  portfolio.  The stress tests are reviewed on a regular basis and the results are presented to senior management.\n\nStress  testing  for  the  trading  portfolio  is  integrated  with enterprise-wide  stress  testing  and  incorporated  into  the  limits framework. The macroeconomic scenarios used for enterprisewide  stress  testing  purposes  differ  from  the  typical  trading portfolio scenarios in that they have a longer time horizon and the  results  are  forecasted  over  multiple  periods  for  use  in consolidated capital and liquidity planning. For more information, see Managing Risk on page 70.\n\n## Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book\n\nThe  following  discussion  presents  net  interest  income  for banking book activities.\n\nInterest rate risk represents the most significant market risk exposure to our banking book balance sheet. Interest rate risk is  measured  as  the  potential  change  in  net  interest  income caused  by  movements  in  market  interest  rates.  Client-facing activities,  primarily  lending  and  deposit-taking,  create  interest rate sensitive positions on our balance sheet.\n\nWe prepare forward-looking forecasts of net interest income. The baseline forecast takes into consideration expected future business growth, ALM positioning -and the direction of interest rate movements as implied by the market-based forward curve.\n\nWe then measure and evaluate the impact that alternative interest rate scenarios have on the baseline forecast in order to assess interest rate sensitivity under varied conditions. The net interest  income  forecast  is  frequently  updated  for  changing assumptions and differing outlooks based on economic trends, market conditions and business strategies. Thus, we continually monitor  our  balance  sheet  position  in  order  to  maintain  an acceptable level of exposure to interest rate changes.\n\nThe  interest  rate  scenarios  that  we  analyze  incorporate balance  sheet  assumptions  such  as  loan  and  deposit  growth and pricing, changes in funding mix, product repricing, maturity characteristics and investment securities premium amortization. Our  overall  goal  is  to  manage  interest  rate  risk  so  that movements in interest rates do not significantly adversely affect earnings and capital.\n\nTable 46 presents the spot and 12-month forward rates used in our baseline forecasts at December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n\n## Table 46  Forward Rates\n\nTable 47 Estimated Banking Book Net Interest Income Sensitivity to Curve Changes\n\n|                        | December 31, 2020   | December 31, 2020   | December 31, 2020   |\n|------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n|                        | Federal  Funds      | Three-month  LIBOR  | 10-Year  Swap       |\n| Spot rates             | 0.25 %              | 0.24 %              | 0.93 %              |\n| 12-month forward rates | 0.25                | 0.19                | 1.06                |\n|                        | December 31, 2019   | December 31, 2019   | December 31, 2019   |\n| Spot rates             | 1.75 %              | 1.91 %              | 1.90 %              |\n| 12-month forward rates | 1.50                | 1.62                | 1.92                |\n\nTable 47 shows the pretax impact to forecasted net interest income over the next 12 months from December 31, 2020 and 2019  resulting  from  instantaneous  parallel  and  non-parallel\n\nshocks  to  the  market-based  forward  curve.  Periodically  we evaluate the scenarios presented so that they are meaningful in the  context  of  the  current  rate  environment.  The  interest  rate scenarios also assume U.S. dollar rates are floored at zero.\n\nDuring  2020,  the  asset  sensitivity  of  our  balance  sheet increased in both up-rate and down-rate scenarios primarily due to continued deposit growth invested in long-term securities. We continue  to  be  asset  sensitive  to  a  parallel  upward  move  in interest rates with the majority of that impact coming from the short  end  of  the  yield  curve.  Additionally,  higher  interest  rates impact  the  fair  value  of  debt  securities  and,  accordingly,  for debt  securities  classified  as  AFS,  may  adversely  affect accumulated  OCI  and  thus  capital  levels  under  the  Basel  3 capital  rules.  Under  instantaneous  upward  parallel  shifts,  the near-term  adverse  impact  to  Basel  3  capital  is  reduced  over time by offsetting positive  impacts to net interest income.

As  part  of  our  ALM activities, we use securities, certain residential mortgages, and interest  rate  and  foreign  exchange  derivatives  in  managing interest rate sensitivity.\n\nThe  behavior  of  our  deposits  portfolio  in  the  baseline forecast  and  in  alternate  interest  rate  scenarios  is  a  key assumption in our projected estimates of net interest income. The  sensitivity  analysis  in  Table  47  assumes  no  change  in deposit  portfolio  size  or  mix  from  the  baseline  forecast  in alternate  rate  environments.  In  higher  rate  scenarios,  any customer activity resulting in the replacement of low-cost or noninterest-bearing deposits with higher yielding deposits or marketbased funding would reduce our benefit in those scenarios.\n\n## Interest Rate and Foreign Exchange Derivative Contracts\n\nInterest  rate  and  foreign  exchange  derivative  contracts  are utilized  in  our  ALM  activities  and  serve  as  an  efficient  tool  to manage  our  interest  rate  and  foreign  exchange  risk.  We  use derivatives to hedge the variability in cash flows or changes in fair value on our balance sheet due to interest rate and foreign exchange  components.

In  addition,  we  use  foreign exchange  contracts,  including  cross-currency  interest  rate swaps,  foreign  currency  futures  contracts,  foreign  currency forward contracts and options to mitigate the foreign exchange risk  associated  with  foreign  currency-denominated  assets  and liabilities.\n\nChanges  to  the  composition  of  our  derivatives  portfolio during 2020 reflect actions taken for interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk management. The decisions to reposition our derivatives  portfolio  are  based  on  the  current  assessment  of economic  and  financial  conditions  including  the  interest  rate and foreign currency environments, balance sheet composition and  trends,  and  the  relative  mix  of  our  cash  and  derivative positions.\n\nWe  use  interest  rate  derivative  instruments  to  hedge  the variability  in  the  cash  flows  of  our  assets  and  liabilities  and other  forecasted  transactions  (collectively  referred  to  as  cash flow hedges). The net results on both open and terminated cash flow hedge derivative instruments recorded in accumulated OCI were a gain of $580 million and a loss of $496 million, on a pretax  basis,  at  December  31,  2020  and  2019.  These  gains and losses are expected to be reclassified into earnings in the same period as the hedged cash flows affect earnings and will decrease income or increase expense on the respective hedged\n\ncash  flows.  Assuming  no  change  in  open  cash  flow  derivative hedge  positions  and  no  changes  in  prices  or  interest  rates beyond what is implied in forward yield curves at December 31, 2020,  the  after-tax  net  gains  are  expected  to  be  reclassified into earnings as follows: a gain of $187 million within the next year, a gain of $358 million in years two through five, a loss of $59 million in years six through ten, with the remaining loss of $50  million  thereafter.  For  more  information  on  derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, see Note 3 - Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nWe  hedge  our  net  investment  in  non-U.S.  operations determined  to  have  functional  currencies  other  than  the  U.S. dollar  using  forward  foreign  exchange  contracts  that  typically settle  in  less  than  180  days,  cross-currency  basis  swaps  and foreign  exchange options. We recorded net after-tax losses on derivatives in accumulated OCI associated with net investment hedges  which  were  offset  by  gains  on  our  net  investments  in consolidated non-U.S. entities at December 31, 2020.\n\nTable  48  presents  derivatives  utilized  in  our  ALM  activities and  shows  the  notional  amount,  fair  value,  weighted-average receive-fixed and pay-fixed rates, expected maturity and average estimated durations of our open ALM derivatives at December 31, 2020 and 2019. These amounts do not include derivative hedges on our MSRs. During 2020, the fair value of receive-fixed  interest  rate  swaps  increased  while  pay-fixed interest swaps decreased, primarily driven by lower swap rates on hedges of U.S. dollar long-term debt.\n\nTable 48  Asset and Liability Management Interest Rate and Foreign Exchange Contracts\n\n|                                                             | December 31, 2020  Expected Maturity

We determine whether loans will be held for investment or held for sale at the time of commitment and manage credit and liquidity risks  by  selling  or  securitizing  a  portion  of  the  loans  we originate.\n\nInterest rate risk and market risk can be substantial in the mortgage business. Changes in interest rates and other market factors impact the volume of mortgage originations. Changes in interest  rates  also  impact  the  value  of  interest  rate  lock commitments (IRLCs) and the related residential first mortgage loans held-for-sale (LHFS) between the date of the IRLC and the date the loans are sold to the secondary market. An increase in mortgage  interest  rates  typically  leads  to  a  decrease  in  the value  of  these  instruments.  Conversely,  when  there  is  an increase in interest rates, the value of the MSRs will increase driven by lower prepayment expectations.  Because the interest rate risks of these hedged items offset, we combine them into one  overall  hedged  item  with  one  combined  economic  hedge portfolio consisting of derivative contracts and securities.\n\nDuring 2020, 2019 and 2018, we recorded gains of $321 million, $291 million and $244 million related to the change in fair value of the MSRs, IRLCs and LHFS, net of gains and losses on the hedge portfolio. For more information on MSRs, see Note 20  -  Fair  Value  Measurements to  the  Consolidated  Financial Statements.\n\n## Compliance and Operational Risk Management\n\nCompliance  risk  is  the  risk  of  legal  or  regulatory  sanctions, material  financial  loss  or  damage  to  the  reputation  of  the Corporation arising from the failure of the Corporation to comply with the requirements of applicable laws, rules, regulations and our  internal  policies  and  procedures  (collectively,  applicable laws, rules and regulations).\n\nOperational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or  failed  processes,  people  and  systems  or  from  external\n\nevents. Operational risk may occur anywhere in the Corporation, including  third-party  business  processes,  and  is  not  limited  to operations  functions.  Effects  may  extend  beyond  financial losses and may result in reputational risk impacts. Operational risk  includes  legal  risk.  Additionally,  operational  risk  is  a component in the calculation of total RWA used in the Basel 3 capital calculation. For more information on Basel 3 calculations, see Capital Management on page 73.\n\nFLUs and control functions are first and foremost responsible for  managing  all  aspects  of  their  businesses,  including  their compliance and operational risk. FLUs and control functions are required  to  understand  their  business  processes  and  related risks  and  controls,  including  third-party  dependencies,  the related regulatory requirements, and monitor and report on the effectiveness  of  the  control  environment.  In  order  to  actively monitor  and  assess  the  performance  of  their  processes  and controls,  they  must  conduct  comprehensive  quality  assurance activities  and  identify  issues  and  risks  to  remediate  control gaps  and  weaknesses.  FLUs  and  control  functions  must  also adhere  to  compliance  and  operational  risk  appetite  limits  to meet strategic, capital and financial planning objectives. Finally, FLUs  and  control  functions  are  responsible  for  the  proactive identification,  management  and  escalation  of  compliance  and operational risks across the Corporation.\n\nGlobal Compliance and Operational Risk teams independently assess compliance and operational risk, monitor business  activities  and  processes  and  evaluate  FLUs  and control  functions  for  adherence  to  applicable  laws,  rules  and regulations,  including  identifying  issues  and  risks,  determining and  developing  tests  to  be  conducted  by  the  Enterprise Independent  Testing  unit,  and  reporting  on  the  state  of  the control environment. Enterprise Independent Testing, an independent  testing  function  within  IRM,  works  with  Global Compliance  and  Operational  Risk,  the  FLUs  and  control functions in the identification of testing needs and test design, and is accountable for test execution, reporting and analysis of results.\n\nBank of America 2020\n\n107",

        "page_content": "Corporate  Audit  provides  independent  assessment  and validation through testing of key compliance and operational risk processes and controls across the Corporation.\n\nThe  Corporation's  Global  Compliance  Enterprise  Policy  and Operational  Risk  Management -Enterprise  Policy  set  the requirements  for  reporting  compliance  and  operational  risk information  to  executive  management as well as the Board or appropriate  Board-level  committees  in  support  of  Global Compliance and Operational Risk's responsibilities for conducting  independent  oversight  of  our  compliance  and operational  risk  management  activities.  The  Board  provides oversight  of  compliance  risk  through  its  Audit  Committee  and the ERC, and operational risk through the ERC.\n\nA key operational risk facing the Corporation is information security, which includes cybersecurity. Cybersecurity risk represents,  among  other  things,  exposure  to  failures  or interruptions of service or breaches of security, including as a result  of  malicious  technological  attacks,  that  impact  the confidentiality, availability or integrity of our, or third parties'  (including  their  downstream  service  providers,  the financial  services  industry  and  financial  data  aggregators) operations, systems or data, including sensitive corporate and customer  information.  The  Corporation  manages  information security  risk  in  accordance  with  internal  policies  which  govern our  comprehensive  information  security  program  designed  to protect the Corporation by enabling preventative, detective and responsive  measures  to  combat  information  and  cybersecurity risks.  The  Board  and  the  ERC  provide  cybersecurity  and information security risk oversight for the Corporation, and our Global  Information  Security  Team  manages  the  day-to-day implementation of our information security program.\n\n## Reputational Risk Management\n\nReputational  risk  is  the  risk  that  negative  perceptions  of  the Corporation's  conduct  or  business  practices  may  adversely impact  its  profitability  or  operations.  Reputational  risk  may result from many of the Corporation's activities, including those related  to  the  management  of  our  strategic,  operational, compliance and credit risks.\n\nThe Corporation manages reputational risk through established  policies  and  controls  in  its  businesses  and  risk management processes to mitigate reputational risks in a timely manner  and  through  proactive  monitoring  and  identification  of potential  reputational  risk  events.  If  reputational  risk  events occur, we focus on remediating the underlying issue and taking action to minimize damage to the Corporation's reputation. The Corporation has processes and procedures in place to respond to events that give rise to reputational risk, including educating individuals  and  organizations  that  influence  public  opinion, implementing external communication strategies to mitigate the risk,  and  informing  key  stakeholders  of  potential  reputational risks. The Corporation's organization and governance structure provides  oversight  of  reputational  risks,  and  reputational  risk reporting is provided regularly and directly to management and the ERC, which provides primary oversight of reputational risk. In  addition,  each  FLU  has  a  committee,  which  includes representatives  from  Compliance,  Legal  and  Risk,  that  is responsible  for  the  oversight  of  reputational  risk.  Such committees' oversight includes providing approval for business activities that present elevated levels of reputational risks.\n\n## Climate Risk Management\n\nClimate-related risks are divided into two major categories: (1) risks  related  to  the  transition  to  a  low-carbon  economy,  which may  entail  extensive  policy,  legal,  technology  and  market\n\n108\n\nBank of America 2020\n\nchanges, and (2) risks related to the physical impacts of climate change, driven by extreme weather events, such as hurricanes and  floods,  as  well  as  chronic  longer-term  shifts,  such  as temperature increases and sea level rises. These changes and events  can  have  broad  impacts  on  operations,  supply  chains, distribution networks, customers,  and  markets  and  are otherwise  referred  to,  respectively,  as  transition  risk  and physical risk. The financial impacts of transition risk can lead to and amplify credit risk. Physical risk can also lead to increased credit  risk  by  diminishing  borrowers'  repayment  capacity  or collateral values.\n\nAs climate risk is interconnected with all key risk types, we have developed and continue to enhance processes to embed climate  risk  considerations  into  our  Risk  Framework  and  risk management programs established for strategic, credit, market, liquidity,  compliance,  operational  and  reputational  risks.  A  key element  of  how  we  manage  climate  risk  is  the  Risk Identification process through which climate and other risks are identified across all FLUs and control functions, prioritized in our risk  inventory  and  evaluated  to  determine  estimated  severity and likelihood of occurrence. Once identified, climate risks are assessed for potential impacts and incorporated into the design of  macroeconomic  scenarios  to  generate  loss  forecasts  and assess  how  climate-related  impacts  could  affect  us  and  our clients.\n\nOur governance framework establishes oversight of climate risk  practices  and  strategies  by  the  Board,  supported  by  its Corporate Governance, ESG, and Sustainability Committee, the ERC  and  the  Global  Environmental,  Social  and  Governance Committee, a management-level committee comprised of senior leaders  across  every  major  FLU  and  control  function.  The Climate  Risk  Steering  Council  oversees  our  climate  risk management  practices,  shapes  our  approach  to  managing climate-related risks in line with our Risk Framework and meets monthly.  In  2020,  the  climate  risk  management  effort  was bolstered  through  the  appointment  of  a  Global  Climate  Risk Executive who reports to the CRO, and establishment of a new division within our Global Risk organization to drive execution of the climate risk management program with the support of FLUs, Technology  &  Operations  and  Risk  partners.  For  additional information about climate risk, see the Bank of America website (the content of which is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K).\n\n## Complex Accounting Estimates\n\nOur significant accounting principles, as described in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements, are essential in understanding the MD&A. Many  of  our  significant  accounting  principles  require  complex judgments to estimate the values of assets and liabilities. We have  procedures  and  processes  in  place  to  facilitate  making these judgments.\n\nThe  more  judgmental  estimates  are  summarized  in  the following  discussion.  We  have  identified  and  described  the development of the variables most important in the estimation processes  that  involve  mathematical  models  to  derive  the estimates.  In  many  cases,  there  are  numerous  alternative judgments that could be used in the process of determining the inputs  to  the  models.  Where  alternatives  exist,  we  have  used the factors that we believe represent the most reasonable value in  developing  the  inputs.  Actual  performance  that  differs  from our estimates of the key variables could materially impact our results of operations. Separate from the possible future impact to our results of operations from input and model variables, the value  of  our  lending  portfolio  and  market-sensitive  assets  and",

        "page_content": "liabilities  may  change  subsequent  to  the  balance  sheet  date, often  significantly,  due  to  the  nature  and  magnitude  of  future credit and market conditions. Such credit and market conditions may change quickly and in unforeseen ways and the resulting volatility  could  have  a  significant,  negative  effect  on  future operating results. These fluctuations would not be indicative of deficiencies in our models or inputs.\n\n## Allowance for Credit Losses\n\nOn  January  1,  2020,  the  Corporation  adopted  the  new accounting  standard  that  requires  the  measurement  of  the allowance  for  credit  losses,  which  includes  the  allowance  for loan  and  lease  losses  and  the  reserve  for  unfunded  lending commitments, to be based on management's best estimate of lifetime  ECL  inherent  in  the  Corporation's  relevant  financial assets.\n\nThe Corporation's estimate of lifetime ECL includes the use of quantitative models that incorporate forward-looking macroeconomic scenarios that are applied over the contractual life  of  the  loan  portfolios,  adjusted  for  expected  prepayments and borrower-controlled extension options. These macroeconomic scenarios include variables that have historically  been  key  drivers  of  increases  and  decreases  in credit  losses.  These  variables  include,  but  are  not  limited  to, unemployment rates, real estate prices, gross domestic product and corporate  bond  spreads.  As  any  one  economic  outlook  is inherently uncertain, the Corporation leverages multiple scenarios. The scenarios that are chosen each quarter and the amount of weighting given to each scenario depend on a variety of  factors  including  recent  economic  events,  leading  economic indicators,  views  of  internal  and  third-party  economists  and industry trends.\n\nThe Corporation also  includes  qualitative  reserves  to  cover losses that are expected but, in the Corporation's assessment, may not be adequately reflected in the economic assumptions described above. For example, factors the Corporation considers include changes in lending policies and procedures, business  conditions,  the  nature  and  size  of  the  portfolio, portfolio  concentrations,  the  volume  and  severity  of  past  due loans and nonaccrual loans, the effect of external factors such as  competition  and  legal  and  regulatory  requirements,  among others. Further, the Corporation considers the inherent uncertainty  in  quantitative  models  that  are  built  on  historical data.\n\nThe  allowance  for  credit  losses  can  also  be  impacted  by unanticipated changes in asset quality of the portfolio, such as increases in risk rating downgrades in our commercial portfolio, deterioration  in  borrower  delinquencies  or  credit  scores  in  our credit card portfolio or increases in LTVs in our consumer real estate  portfolio.  In  addition,  while  we  have  incorporated  our estimated  impact  of  COVID-19  into  our  allowance  for  credit losses,  the  ultimate  impact  of  the  pandemic  is  still  unknown, including  how  long  economic  activities  will  be  impacted  and what effect the unprecedented levels of government fiscal and monetary  actions  will  have  on  the  economy  and  our  credit losses.\n\nAs described above, the process to determine the allowance for credit losses requires numerous estimates and assumptions, some of which require a high degree of judgment and  are  often  interrelated.  Changes  in  the  estimates  and assumptions can result in significant changes in the allowance for credit losses. Our process for determining the allowance for credit  losses  is  further  discussed  in Note  1  -  Summary  of Significant Accounting Principles and Note 5 - Outstanding Loans\n\nand Leases and Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Fair Value of Financial Instruments\n\nUnder  applicable  accounting  standards,  we  are  required  to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable  inputs  in  measuring  fair  value.  We  classify  fair value measurements of financial instruments and MSRs based on  the  three-level  fair  value  hierarchy  in  the  accounting standards.\n\nThe  fair  values  of  assets  and  liabilities  may  include adjustments, such as market liquidity and credit quality, where appropriate.  Valuations  of  products  using  models  or  other techniques are sensitive to assumptions used for the significant inputs.  Where  market  data  is  available,  the  inputs  used  for valuation  reflect  that  information  as  of  our  valuation  date. Inputs to valuation models are considered unobservable if they are  supported  by  little  or  no  market  activity.  In  periods  of extreme volatility, lessened liquidity or in illiquid markets, there may  be  more  variability  in  market  pricing  or  a  lack  of  market data  to  use  in  the  valuation  process.  In  keeping  with  the prudent application of estimates and management judgment in determining the fair value of assets and liabilities, we have in place  various  processes  and  controls  that  include:  a  model validation policy that requires review and approval of quantitative  models  used  for  deal  pricing,  financial  statement fair  value  determination  and  risk  quantification;  a  trading product  valuation  policy  that  requires  verification  of  all  traded product valuations; and a periodic review and substantiation of daily  profit  and  loss  reporting  for  all  traded  products.  Primarily through  validation  controls,  we  utilize  both  broker  and  pricing service inputs which can and do include both market-observable and  internally-modeled  values  and/or  valuation  inputs.  Our reliance on this information is affected by our understanding of how the broker and/or pricing service develops its data with a higher degree of reliance applied to those that are more directly observable  and  lesser  reliance  applied  to  those  developed through their own internal modeling. For example, broker quotes in less active markets may only be indicative and therefore less reliable. These processes and controls are performed independently of the business. For more information, see Note 20 - Fair Value Measurements and Note 21 - Fair Value Option to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Level 3 Assets and Liabilities\n\nFinancial  assets  and  liabilities,  and  MSRs,  where  values  are based on valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable  and  are  significant  to  the  overall  fair  value measurement  are  classified  as  Level  3  under  the  fair  value hierarchy  established  in  applicable  accounting  standards.  The fair  value  of  these  Level  3  financial  assets  and  liabilities  and MSRs is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques for which the determination of  fair  value  requires  significant  management  judgment  or estimation.\n\nLevel 3 financial instruments may be hedged with derivatives classified as Level 1 or 2; therefore, gains or losses associated with  Level  3  financial  instruments  may  be  offset  by  gains  or losses associated with financial instruments classified in other levels of the fair value hierarchy. The Level 3 gains and losses recorded  in  earnings  did  not  have  a  significant  impact  on  our liquidity  or  capital.  We  conduct  a  review  of  our  fair  value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis. Transfers into or out  of  Level  3  are  made  if  the  significant  inputs  used  in  the financial  models  measuring  the  fair  values  of  the  assets  and\n\nBank of America 2020\n\n109",

We  currently  file  income  tax  returns  in  more  than  100 jurisdictions  and  consider  many  factors,  including  statutory, judicial  and  regulatory  guidance,  in  estimating  the  appropriate accrued income taxes for each jurisdiction.\n\nNet deferred tax assets, reported as a component of other assets  on  the  Consolidated  Balance  Sheet,  represent  the  net decrease in taxes expected to be paid in the future because of net  operating  loss  (NOL)  and  tax  credit  carryforwards  and because  of  future  reversals  of  temporary  differences  in  the bases  of  assets  and  liabilities  as  measured  by  tax  laws  and their bases as reported in the financial statements. NOL and tax credit carryforwards result in reductions to future tax liabilities, and  many  of  these  attributes  can  expire  if  not  utilized  within certain periods. We consider the need for valuation allowances to  reduce  net  deferred  tax  assets  to  the  amounts  that  we estimate are more likely than not to be realized.\n\nConsistent  with  the  applicable  accounting  guidance,  we monitor  relevant  tax  authorities  and  change  our  estimates  of accrued  income  taxes  and/or  net  deferred  tax  assets  due  to changes  in  income  tax  laws  and  their  interpretation  by  the courts  and  regulatory  authorities.  These  revisions  of  our estimates, which also may result from our income tax planning and  from  the  resolution  of  income  tax  audit  matters,  may  be material to our operating results for any given period.\n\nSee Note  19  -  Income  Taxes to  the  Consolidated  Financial Statements  for  a  table  of  significant  tax  attributes  and additional information. For more information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors of our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Goodwill and Intangible Assets\n\nThe nature of and accounting for goodwill and intangible assets are  discussed  in Note  1  -  Summary  of  Significant  Accounting Principles , and Note  7  -  Goodwill  and  Intangible  Assets to  the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n110\n\nBank of America 2020\n\nWe  completed  our  annual  goodwill  impairment  test  as  of June 30, 2020. In performing that test, we compared the fair value  of  each  reporting  unit  to  its  estimated  carrying  value  as measured  by  allocated  equity.  We  estimated  the  fair  value  of each  reporting  unit  based  on  the  income  approach  (which utilizes  the  present value of cash flows to estimate fair value) and  the  market  multiplier  approach  (which  utilizes  observable market prices and metrics of peer companies to estimate fair value).\n\nOur  discounted  cash  flows  were  generally  based  on  the Corporation's  three-year  internal  forecasts  with  a  long-term growth  rate  of  3.68  percent.  Our  estimated  cash  flows considered  the  current  challenging  global  industry  and  market conditions  related  to  the  pandemic,  including  the  low  interest rate environment. The cash flows were discounted using rates that ranged from 9 percent to 12 percent, which were derived from a capital asset pricing model that incorporates the risk and uncertainty in the cash flow forecasts, the financial markets and industries similar to each of the reporting units.\n\nUnder the market multiplier approach, we estimated the fair value  of  the  individual  reporting  units  utilizing  various  market multiples,  primarily  various  pricing  multiples,  from  comparable publicly-traded  companies in industries similar to the reporting unit  and  then  factored  in  a  control  premium  based  upon observed  comparable  premiums  paid  for  change-in-control transactions for financial institutions.\n\nBased on the results of the test, we determined that each reporting  unit's  estimated  fair  value  exceeded  its  respective carrying value and that the goodwill assigned to each reporting unit was not impaired. The fair values of the reporting units as a percentage of their carrying values ranged from 109 percent to 213 percent. It currently remains difficult to estimate the future economic  impacts  related  to  the  pandemic.  If  economic  and market  conditions  (both  in  the  U.S.  and  internationally) deteriorate,  our  reporting  units  could  be  negatively  impacted, which could change our key assumptions and related estimates and may result in a future impairment charge.\n\n## Certain Contingent Liabilities\n\nFor more information on the complex judgments associated with certain  contingent  liabilities,  see Note  12  -  Commitments  and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements.",

The  Corporation's  internal  control  over  financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to  the  maintenance  of  records  that,  in  reasonable  detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Corporation; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded  as  necessary  to  permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the Corporation are  being  made  only  in  accordance  with  authorizations  of management and directors of the Corporation; and (iii) provide reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention  or  timely  detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Corporation's  assets  that  could  have  a  material  effect  on  the financial statements.\n\nBecause  of  its  inherent  limitations,  internal  control  over financial  reporting  may  not  prevent  or  detect  misstatements. Also,  projections  of  any  evaluation  of  effectiveness  to  future periods  are  subject  to  the  risk  that  controls  may  become inadequate  because  of  changes  in  conditions,  or  that  the degree  of  compliance  with  the  policies  or  procedures  may deteriorate.\n\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of the Corporation's  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  as  of December 31, 2020 based on the framework set forth by the Committee  of  Sponsoring  Organizations  of  the  Treadway Commission in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) . Based on that assessment, management concluded that, as of December  31,  2020,  the  Corporation's  internal  control  over financial reporting is effective.\n\nThe Corporation's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP, an independent registered public accounting  firm,  as  stated  in  their  accompanying  report  which expresses  an  unqualified  opinion  on  the  effectiveness  of  the Corporation's  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  as  of December 31, 2020.\n\nBrian T.

We also have audited the Corporation's  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  as  of December 31, 2020, based on criteria  established  in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of  Sponsoring  Organizations  of  the  Treadway  Commission (COSO).\n\nIn our  opinion,  the  consolidated  financial  statements referred  to  above  present  fairly,  in  all  material  respects,  the financial position of the Corporation as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020  in  conformity  with  accounting  principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the  Corporation  maintained,  in  all  material  respects,  effective internal  control  over  financial  reporting  as  of  December  31, 2020,  based  on  criteria  established  in Internal  Control -Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\n\n## Change in Accounting Principle\n\nAs  discussed  in  Note  1  to  the  consolidated  financial statements,  the  Corporation  changed  the  manner  in  which  it accounts  for  credit  losses  on  certain  financial  instruments  in 2020.\n\n## Basis for Opinions\n\nThe  Corporation's  management  is  responsible  for  these consolidated  financial  statements,  for  maintaining  effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of  the  effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Corporation's consolidated financial statements and on the Corporation's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with  the  Public  Company  Accounting  Oversight  Board  (United States)  (PCAOB)  and  are  required  to  be  independent  with respect to the Corporation in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of  the  PCAOB.  Those  standards  require  that  we  plan  and perform  the  audits  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about whether  the  consolidated  financial  statements  are  free  of material  misstatement,  whether  due  to  error  or  fraud,  and whether  effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  was maintained  in  all  material  respects.  Our  audits  of  the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated  financial  statements,  whether  due  to  error  or fraud,  and  performing  procedures  that  respond  to  those  risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence\n\n118\n\nBank of America 2020\n\nregarding  the  amounts  and  disclosures  in  the  consolidated financial  statements.  Our  audits  also  included  evaluating  the accounting  principles  used  and  significant  estimates  made  by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the  consolidated  financial  statements.  Our  audit  of  internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and  evaluating  the  design  and  operating  effectiveness  of internal  control  based  on  the  assessed  risk.  Our  audits  also included  performing  such  other  procedures  as  we  considered necessary  in  the  circumstances.  We  believe  that  our  audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\n\n## Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nA  company's  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  is  a process  designed  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding the  reliability  of  financial  reporting  and  the  preparation  of financial  statements  for  external  purposes  in  accordance  with generally  accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control  over  financial  reporting  includes  those  policies  and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and  dispositions  of  the  assets  of  the  company;  (ii)  provide reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are  recorded  as necessary  to  permit  preparation  of  financial  statements  in accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles,  and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only  in  accordance  with  authorizations  of  management  and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention  or  timely  detection  of  unauthorized acquisition,  use,  or  disposition  of  the  company's  assets  that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause  of  its  inherent  limitations,  internal  control  over financial  reporting  may  not  prevent  or  detect  misstatements. Also,  projections  of  any  evaluation  of  effectiveness  to  future periods  are  subject  to  the  risk  that  controls  may  become inadequate  because  of  changes  in  conditions,  or  that  the degree  of  compliance  with  the  policies  or  procedures  may deteriorate.\n\n## Critical Audit Matters\n\nThe  critical  audit  matters  communicated  below  are  matters arising  from  the  current  period  audit  of  the  consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated  to  the  audit  committee  and  that  (i)  relate  to accounts  or  disclosures  that  are  material  to  the  consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit  matters  does  not  alter  in  any  way  our  opinion  on  the consolidated  financial  statements,  taken  as  a  whole,  and  we are  not,  by  communicating  the  critical  audit  matters  below, providing  separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\nAllowance  for  Loan  and  Lease  Losses - Commercial  and Consumer Card Loans\n\nAs  described  in  Notes  1  and  5  to  the  consolidated  financial statements, the allowance for loan and lease losses represents management's  estimate  of  the  expected  credit  losses  in  the Corporation's  loan  and  lease  portfolio,  excluding  loans  and unfunded  lending  commitments  accounted  for  under  the  fair value option. As of December 31, 2020, the allowance for loan and lease losses was $18.8 billion on total loans and leases of",

    },
    {
        "page_content": "$921.2  billion,  which  excludes  loans  accounted  for  under  the fair value option. For commercial and consumer card loans, the expected  credit  loss  is  estimated  using  quantitative  methods that  consider  a  variety  of  factors  such  as  historical  loss experience, the current credit quality of the portfolio as well as an  economic  outlook  over  the  life  of  the  loan.  In  its  loss forecasting  framework,  the  Corporation  incorporates  forward looking information through the use of macroeconomic scenarios applied over the forecasted life of the assets. These macroeconomic scenarios include variables that have historically  been  key  drivers  of  increases  and  decreases  in credit  losses.  These  variables  include,  but  are  not  limited  to, unemployment rates, real estate prices, gross domestic product levels  and  corporate  bond  spreads.  The  scenarios  that  are chosen  and  the  amount  of  weighting  given  to  each  scenario depend on a variety of factors including recent economic events, leading economic indicators, views of internal as well as thirdparty  economists  and  industry  trends.  Also  included  in  the allowance  for  loan  losses  are  qualitative  reserves  to  cover losses that are expected but, in the Corporation's assessment, may not be adequately reflected in the quantitative methods or the  economic  assumptions.  Factors  that  the  Corporation considers  include  changes  in  lending  policies  and  procedures, business  conditions,  the  nature  and  size  of  the  portfolio, portfolio  concentrations,  the  volume  and  severity  of  past  due loans and nonaccrual loans, the effect of external factors such as  competition,  and  legal  and  regulatory  requirements,  among others. Further, the Corporation considers the inherent uncertainty  in  quantitative  models  that  are  built  on  historical data.\n\nThe  principal  considerations  for  our  determination  that performing  procedures  relating  to  the  allowance  for  loan  and lease losses for the commercial and consumer card portfolios is a  critical  audit  matter  are  (i)  the  significant  judgment  and estimation  by  management  in  developing  lifetime  economic forecast  scenarios,  related  weightings  to  each  scenario  and certain qualitative reserves, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures  and  in  evaluating  audit  evidence  obtained,  and  (ii) the audit effort involved professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating certain audit evidence.\n\nAddressing  the  matter  involved  performing  procedures  and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion  on  the  consolidated  financial  statements.  These procedures  included  testing  the  effectiveness  of  controls relating  to  the  allowance  for  loan  and  lease  losses,  including controls  over  the  evaluation  and  approval  of  models,  forecast scenarios  and  related  weightings,  and  qualitative  reserves. These  procedures  also  included,  among  others,  testing management's  process  for  estimating  the  allowance  for  loan losses, including (i) evaluating the appropriateness of the loss forecast models and methodology, (ii) evaluating the reasonableness  of  certain macroeconomic  variables,  (iii) evaluating the reasonableness of management's development, selection and weighting of economic forecast scenarios used in the  loss  forecast  models,  (iv)  testing  the  completeness  and accuracy of data used in the estimate, and (v) evaluating certain qualitative  reserves  made  to  the  model  output  results  to determine the overall allowance for loan losses. The procedures\n\nalso included the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of certain  loss  forecast  models,  the  reasonableness  of economic  forecast  scenarios  and  related  weightings  and  the reasonableness of certain qualitative reserves.\n\n## Valuation of Certain Level 3 Financial Instruments\n\nAs  described  in  Notes  1  and  20  to  the  consolidated  financial statements, the Corporation carries certain financial instruments at fair value, which includes $10.0 billion of assets and  $7.4  billion  of  liabilities  classified  as  Level  3  fair  value measurements on a recurring basis and $1.7 billion of assets classified as Level 3 fair value measurements on a nonrecurring basis,  for  which  the  determination  of  fair  value  requires significant management judgment or estimation. The Corporation  determines  the  fair  value  of  Level  3  financial instruments  using  pricing  models,  discounted  cash  flow methodologies,  or  similar  techniques  that  require  inputs  that are  both  unobservable  and  are  significant  to  the  overall  fair value measurement.  Unobservable inputs, such as volatility or price, may be determined using quantitative-based extrapolations or other internal methodologies which incorporate management estimates and available market information.\n\nThe  principal  considerations  for  our  determination  that performing procedures relating to the valuation of certain Level 3  financial  instruments  is  a  critical  audit  matter  are  the significant  judgment  and  estimation  used  by  management  to determine the fair value of these financial instruments, which in turn  led  to  a  high  degree  of  auditor  judgment  and  effort  in performing procedures, including the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating certain audit evidence.\n\nAddressing  the  matter  involved  performing  procedures  and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion  on  the  consolidated  financial  statements.  These procedures  included  testing  the  effectiveness  of  controls relating  to  the  valuation  of  financial  instruments,  including controls  related  to  valuation  models,  significant  unobservable inputs,  and  data.  These  procedures  also  included,  among others,  the  involvement  of  professionals  with  specialized  skill and knowledge to assist in developing an independent estimate of fair value for a sample of these certain financial instruments and comparison of management's estimate to the independently developed estimate of fair value. Developing the independent  estimate  involved  testing  the  completeness  and accuracy  of  data  provided  by  management  and  evaluating  the reasonableness of management's assumptions used to develop the significant unobservable inputs.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCharlotte, North Carolina February 24, 2021\n\nWe have served as the Corporation's auditor since 1958.\n\nBank of America 2020\n\n119",

        "page_content": "## Bank of America Corporation and Subsidiaries\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## NOTE 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles\n\nBank  of  America  Corporation,  a  bank  holding  company  and  a financial holding company, provides a diverse range of financial services  and  products  throughout  the  U.S.  and  in  certain international  markets.  The  term  'the  Corporation'  as  used herein  may  refer  to  Bank  of  America  Corporation,  individually, Bank of America Corporation and its subsidiaries, or certain of Bank of America Corporation's subsidiaries or affiliates.\n\n## Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the  Corporation  and  its  majority-owned  subsidiaries  and  those variable  interest  entities  (VIEs)  where  the  Corporation  is  the primary  beneficiary.  Intercompany  accounts  and  transactions have  been  eliminated.  Results  of  operations  of  acquired companies are included from the dates of acquisition, and for VIEs,  from  the  dates  that  the  Corporation  became  the  primary beneficiary.  Assets  held  in  an  agency  or  fiduciary  capacity  are not  included  in  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements.  The Corporation accounts for investments in companies for which it owns a voting interest and for which it has the ability to exercise significant  influence  over  operating  and  financing  decisions using the equity method of accounting. These investments are included in other assets. Equity method investments are subject to  impairment  testing,  and  the  Corporation's  proportionate share of income or loss is included in other income.\n\nThe preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United  States  of  America  requires  management  to  make estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  reported  amounts  and disclosures.  Actual  results  could  materially  differ  from  those estimates and assumptions. Certain prior-period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.\n\n## New Accounting Standards\n\n## Accounting for Financial Instruments -- Credit Losses\n\nOn  January  1,  2020,  the  Corporation  adopted  the  new accounting  standard  that  requires  the  measurement  of  the allowance for credit losses to be based on management's best estimate of lifetime expected credit losses (ECL) inherent in the Corporation's  relevant  financial  assets.  Upon  adoption  of  the standard on January 1, 2020, the Corporation recorded a $3.3 billion,  or  32  percent,  increase  to  the  allowance  for  credit losses.  After  adjusting  for  deferred  taxes  and  other  adoption effects,  a  $2.4  billion  decrease  was  recorded  in  retained earnings  through  a  cumulative-effect  adjustment.  Prior  to January  1,  2020,  the  allowance  for  credit  losses  was determined  based  on  management's  estimate  of  probable incurred losses.\n\n## Reference Rate Reform\n\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued a new accounting  standard  in  March  2020,  which  was  subsequently amended  in  January  2021,  related  to  contracts  or  hedging relationships  that  reference  London  Interbank  Offered  Rate (LIBOR)  or  other  reference  rates  that  are  expected  to  be discontinued  due  to  reference  rate  reform.  The  new  standard provides  for  optional  expedients  and  other  guidance  regarding the  accounting  related  to  modifications  of  contracts,  hedging\n\n124\n\nBank of America 2020\n\nrelationships and other transactions affected by reference rate reform. The Corporation has elected to retrospectively adopt the new standard as of January 1, 2020. The adoption did not have a material accounting impact on the Corporation's consolidated financial position or results of operations; however, it did ease the  administrative  burden  in  accounting  for  certain  effects  of reference rate reform.\n\n## Significant Accounting Principles\n\n## Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, cash items in the  process  of  collection,  cash  segregated  under  federal  and other brokerage regulations, and amounts due from correspondent  banks,  the  Federal  Reserve  Bank  and  certain non-U.S. central banks. Certain cash balances are restricted as to withdrawal or usage by legally binding contractual agreements or regulatory requirements.\n\n## Securities Financing Agreements\n\nSecurities  borrowed  or  purchased  under  agreements  to  resell and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase (securities  financing  agreements)  are  treated  as  collateralized financing transactions except in instances where the transaction is required to be accounted for as individual sale and purchase transactions.  Generally,  these  agreements  are  recorded  at acquisition  or  sale  price  plus  accrued  interest,  except  for securities  financing  agreements  that  the  Corporation  accounts for  under  the  fair  value  option.  Changes  in  the  fair  value  of securities  financing  agreements  that  are  accounted  for  under the fair value option are recorded in market making and similar activities in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\nThe  Corporation's  policy  is  to  monitor  the  market  value  of the  principal  amount  loaned  under  resale  agreements  and obtain collateral from or return collateral pledged to counterparties when appropriate. Securities financing agreements  do  not  create  material  credit  risk  due  to  these collateral provisions; therefore, an allowance for loan losses is not necessary.\n\nIn transactions where the Corporation acts as the lender in a securities  lending  agreement  and  receives  securities  that  can be pledged or sold as collateral, it recognizes an asset on the Consolidated  Balance  Sheet  at  fair  value,  representing  the securities received, and a liability, representing the obligation to return those securities.\n\n## Collateral\n\nThe Corporation accepts securities and loans as collateral that it  is  permitted  by  contract  or  practice  to  sell  or  repledge.  At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the fair value of this collateral was $812.4 billion and $693.0 billion, of which $758.5 billion and $593.8 billion were sold or repledged. The primary source of  this  collateral  is  securities  borrowed  or  purchased  under agreements to resell.\n\nThe Corporation also pledges company-owned securities and loans  as  collateral  in  transactions  that  include  repurchase agreements, securities loaned, public and trust deposits, U.S. Treasury  tax  and  loan  notes,  and  short-term  borrowings.  This collateral, which in some cases can be sold or repledged by the counterparties  to  the  transactions,  is  parenthetically  disclosed on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nIn  certain  cases, the Corporation has transferred assets to consolidated  VIEs  where  those  restricted  assets  serve  as collateral for the interests issued by the VIEs. These assets are included  on  the  Consolidated  Balance  Sheet  in  Assets  of Consolidated VIEs.",

        "page_content": "In addition, the Corporation obtains collateral in connection with  its  derivative  contracts.  Required  collateral  levels  vary depending on the credit risk rating and the type of counterparty. Generally,  the  Corporation  accepts  collateral  in  the  form  of cash, U.S. Treasury securities and other marketable securities. Based  on  provisions  contained  in  master  netting  agreements, the Corporation nets cash collateral received against derivative assets.  The  Corporation  also  pledges  collateral  on  its  own derivative  positions  which  can  be  applied  against  derivative liabilities.\n\n## Trading Instruments\n\nFinancial instruments utilized in trading activities are carried at fair value. Fair value is generally based on quoted market prices for  the  same  or  similar  assets  and  liabilities.  If  these  market prices  are  not  available,  fair  values  are  estimated  based  on dealer quotes, pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies,  or  similar  techniques  where  the  determination of  fair  value  may  require  significant  management  judgment  or estimation. Realized gains and losses are recorded on a tradedate  basis.  Realized  and  unrealized  gains  and  losses  are recognized in market making and similar activities.\n\n## Derivatives and Hedging Activities\n\nDerivatives are entered into on behalf of customers, for trading or  to  support  risk  management  activities.  Derivatives  used  in risk  management  activities  include  derivatives  that  are  both designated  in  qualifying  accounting  hedge  relationships  and derivatives used to hedge market risks in relationships that are not  designated  in  qualifying  accounting  hedge  relationships (referred to as other risk management  activities). The Corporation manages  interest  rate  and  foreign  currency exchange  rate  sensitivity  predominantly  through  the  use  of derivatives.  Derivatives  utilized  by  the  Corporation  include swaps,  futures  and  forward  settlement  contracts,  and  option contracts.\n\nAll  derivatives  are  recorded  on  the  Consolidated  Balance Sheet  at  fair  value,  taking  into  consideration  the  effects  of legally  enforceable  master  netting  agreements  that  allow  the Corporation to settle positive and negative positions and offset cash collateral held with the same counterparty on a net basis. For  exchange-traded  contracts,  fair  value  is  based  on  quoted market  prices  in  active  or  inactive  markets  or  is  derived  from observable  market-based  pricing  parameters,  similar  to  those applied to over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives. For non-exchange traded contracts, fair  value  is  based  on  dealer  quotes,  pricing models,  discounted  cash  flow  methodologies  or  similar techniques for which the determination of fair value may require significant management judgment or estimation.\n\nValuations  of  derivative  assets  and  liabilities  reflect  the value of the instrument including counterparty credit risk. These values  also  take  into  account  the  Corporation's  own  credit standing.\n\n## Trading Derivatives and Other Risk Management Activities\n\nDerivatives held for trading purposes are included in derivative assets  or  derivative  liabilities  on  the  Consolidated  Balance Sheet with changes in fair value included in market making and similar activities.\n\nDerivatives  used  for  other  risk  management  activities  are included in derivative assets or derivative liabilities. Derivatives used  in  other  risk  management  activities  have  not  been designated in qualifying accounting hedge relationships because they did not qualify or the risk that is being mitigated pertains to an item that is reported at fair value through earnings so that\n\nthe effect of measuring the derivative instrument and the asset or liability to which the risk exposure pertains will offset in the Consolidated Statement of Income to the extent effective. The changes  in  the  fair  value  of  derivatives  that  serve  to  mitigate certain risks associated with mortgage servicing rights (MSRs), interest  rate  lock  commitments  (IRLCs)  and  first-lien  mortgage loans held-for-sale (LHFS) that are originated by the Corporation are  recorded  in  other  income.  Changes  in  the  fair  value  of derivatives that serve to mitigate interest rate risk and foreign currency  risk  are  included  in  market  making  and  similar activities. Credit derivatives are also used by the Corporation to mitigate the risk associated with various credit exposures. The changes  in  the  fair  value  of  these  derivatives  are  included  in market making and similar activities and other income.\n\n## Derivatives Used For Hedge Accounting Purposes (Accounting Hedges)\n\nFor  accounting  hedges,  the  Corporation  formally  documents  at inception  all  relationships  between  hedging  instruments  and hedged items, as well as the risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking various accounting hedges. Additionally,  the  Corporation primarily uses regression analysis at  the  inception  of  a  hedge  and  for  each  reporting  period thereafter  to  assess  whether  the  derivative  used  in  an accounting hedge transaction is expected to be and has been highly  effective  in  offsetting  changes  in  the  fair  value  or  cash flows  of  a  hedged  item  or  forecasted  transaction.  The Corporation discontinues hedge accounting when it is determined  that  a  derivative  is  not  expected  to  be  or  has ceased  to  be  highly  effective  as  a  hedge,  and  then  reflects changes  in  fair  value  of  the  derivative  in  earnings  after termination of the hedge relationship.\n\nFair value hedges are used to protect against changes in the fair  value  of  the  Corporation's  assets  and  liabilities  that  are attributable  to  interest  rate  or  foreign  exchange  volatility. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges  are  recorded  in  earnings,  together  and  in  the  same income statement line item with changes in the fair value of the related  hedged  item.  If  a  derivative  instrument  in  a  fair  value hedge  is  terminated  or  the  hedge  designation  removed,  the previous adjustments to the carrying value of the hedged asset or liability are subsequently accounted for in the same manner as  other  components  of  the  carrying  value  of  that  asset  or liability. For interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, such adjustments are amortized to earnings over the remaining life of the respective asset or liability.\n\nCash  flow  hedges  are  used  primarily  to  minimize  the variability  in  cash  flows  of  assets  and  liabilities  or  forecasted transactions  caused  by  interest  rate  or  foreign  exchange  rate fluctuations.  The  Corporation  also  uses  cash  flow  hedges  to hedge  the  price  risk  associated  with  deferred  compensation. Changes  in  the  fair  value  of  derivatives  used  in  cash  flow hedges  are  recorded  in  accumulated  other  comprehensive income  (OCI)  and  are  reclassified  into  the  line  item  in  the income statement in which the hedged item is recorded in the same period the hedged item affects earnings. Components of a derivative that are excluded in assessing hedge effectiveness are  recorded  in  the  same  income  statement  line  item  as  the hedged item.\n\nNet  investment  hedges  are  used  to  manage  the  foreign exchange  rate  sensitivity  arising  from  a  net  investment  in  a foreign operation. Changes in the spot prices of derivatives that are designated as net investment hedges of foreign operations are  recorded  as  a  component  of  accumulated  OCI.  The remaining  components  of  these  derivatives  are  excluded  in\n\nBank of America 2020\n\n125",

Their  classification  is  dependent  on  the purpose for which the securities were acquired. Debt securities purchased  for  use  in  the  Corporation's  trading  activities  are reported in trading account assets at fair value with unrealized gains  and  losses  included  in  market  making  and  similar activities.  Substantially  all  other  debt  securities  purchased  are used in the Corporation's asset and liability management (ALM) activities  and  are  reported  on  the  Consolidated Balance Sheet as  either  debt  securities  carried  at  fair  value  or  as  held-tomaturity  (HTM)  debt  securities.  Debt  securities  carried  at  fair value are either available-for-sale (AFS) securities with unrealized gains and losses net-of-tax included in accumulated OCI  or  carried  at  fair  value  with  unrealized  gains  and  losses reported  in  market  making  and  similar  activities.  HTM  debt securities are debt securities that management has the intent and  ability  to  hold  to  maturity  and  are  reported  at  amortized cost.\n\nThe Corporation evaluates each AFS security where the value has declined below amortized cost. If the Corporation intends to sell or believes it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the debt security, it is written down to fair value through earnings.  For  AFS  debt  securities  the  Corporation  intends  to hold,  the  Corporation  evaluates  the  debt  securities  for  ECL except  for  debt  securities  that  are  guaranteed  by  the  U.S. Treasury, U.S. government agencies or sovereign entities of high credit  quality  where  the  Corporation  applies  a  zero  credit  loss assumption.  For  the  remaining  AFS  debt  securities,  the Corporation  considers  qualitative  parameters  such  as  internal and external credit ratings and the value of underlying collateral. If an AFS debt security fails any of the qualitative parameters, a discounted  cash  flow  analysis  is  used  by  the  Corporation  to determine  if  a  portion  of  the  unrealized  loss  is  a  result  of  an expected credit loss. The Corporation will then recognize either credit loss expense or a reversal of credit loss expense in other income for the amount necessary to adjust the debt securities valuation  allowance  to  its  current  estimate  of  excepted  credit losses.  Cash  flows  expected  to  be  collected  are  estimated using  all  relevant  information  available  such  as  remaining payment terms, prepayment speeds, the financial  condition  of the  issuer,  expected  defaults  and  the  value  of  the  underlying collateral. If any of the decline in fair value is related to market factors,  that  amount  is  recognized  in  accumulated  OCI.  In certain instances, the credit loss may exceed the total decline in fair value, in which case, the allowance recorded is limited to the difference between the amortized cost and the fair value of the asset.\n\nThe Corporation separately evaluates its HTM debt securities for  any  credit  losses,  of  which  substantially  all  qualify  for  the zero  loss  assumption.  For  the  remaining  securities,  the Corporation  performs  a  discounted  cash  flow  analysis  to estimate any credit losses which are then recognized as part of the allowance for credit losses.\n\nInterest on  debt  securities,  including  amortization  of premiums  and  accretion  of  discounts,  is  included  in  interest income. Premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted to interest income at a constant effective yield over the contractual lives of the securities. Realized gains and losses from the sales of debt securities are determined using the specific identification method.\n\n126\n\nBank of America 2020\n\nEquity  securities  with  readily  determinable  fair  values  that are not held for trading purposes are carried at fair value with unrealized  gains  and  losses  included  in  other  income.  Equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values are recorded  at  cost  less  impairment,  if  any,  plus  or  minus qualifying  observable  price  changes.  These  securities  are reported in other assets.\n\n## Loans and Leases\n\nLoans, with the exception of loans accounted for under the fair value  option,  are  measured  at  historical  cost  and  reported  at their  outstanding  principal  balances  net  of  any  unearned income,  charge-offs,  unamortized  deferred  fees  and  costs  on originated loans,  and  for  purchased  loans,  net  of  any unamortized premiums or discounts. Loan origination fees and certain  direct  origination  costs  are  deferred  and  recognized  as adjustments  to  interest  income  over  the  lives  of  the  related loans. Unearned income, discounts and premiums  are amortized  to  interest  income  using  a  level  yield  methodology. The  Corporation  elects  to  account  for  certain  consumer  and commercial  loans  under  the  fair  value  option  with  interest reported in interest income and changes in fair value reported in market making and similar activities or other income.\n\nUnder applicable accounting guidance, for reporting purposes, the loan and lease portfolio is categorized by portfolio segment  and,  within  each  portfolio  segment,  by  class  of financing receivables. A portfolio segment is defined as the level at  which  an  entity  develops  and  documents  a  systematic methodology to determine the allowance for credit losses, and a class  of  financing  receivables  is  defined  as  the  level  of disaggregation  of  portfolio  segments  based  on  the  initial measurement  attribute,  risk  characteristics  and  methods  for assessing risk. The Corporation's three portfolio segments are Consumer  Real  Estate,  Credit  Card  and  Other  Consumer,  and Commercial.  The  classes  within  the  Consumer  Real  Estate portfolio  segment  are  residential  mortgage  and  home  equity . The classes within the Credit Card and Other Consumer portfolio segment  are  credit  card,  direct/indirect  consumer  and  other consumer. The classes within the Commercial portfolio segment are  U.S.  commercial,  non-U.S.  commercial,  commercial  real estate,  commercial  lease  financing  and  U.S.  small  business commercial.\n\n## Leases\n\nThe Corporation provides equipment financing to its customers through  a  variety  of  lessor  arrangements.  Direct  financing leases  and  sales-type  leases  are  carried  at  the  aggregate  of lease payments receivable plus the estimated residual value of the leased property less unearned income, which is accreted to interest  income  over  the  lease  terms  using  methods  that approximate  the  interest  method.  Operating  lease  income  is recognized  on  a  straight-line  basis.  The  Corporation's  lease arrangements generally do not contain non-lease components.\n\n## Allowance for Credit Losses\n\nThe allowance for credit losses includes both the allowance for loan  and  lease  losses  and  the  reserve  for  unfunded  lending commitments  and  represents  management's  estimate  of  the ECL  in  the  Corporation's  loan  and  lease  portfolio,  excluding loans and unfunded lending commitments accounted for under the  fair  value  option.  The  ECL  on  funded  consumer  and commercial loans and leases is referred to as the allowance for loan and lease losses and is reported separately as a contraasset to loans and leases on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The  ECL  for  unfunded  lending  commitments,  including  home",

The provision for credit losses related to the loan and lease portfolio  and  unfunded lending commitments is reported in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\nFor  loans  and  leases,  the  ECL  is  typically  estimated  using quantitative methods that consider a variety of factors such as historical  loss  experience,  the  current  credit  quality  of  the portfolio  as  well  as  an  economic  outlook  over  the  life  of  the loan. The life of the loan for closed-ended products is based on the  contractual  maturity  of  the  loan  adjusted  for  any  expected prepayments.  The  contractual  maturity  includes  any  extension options that are at the sole discretion of the borrower. For openended  products  (e.g.,  lines  of  credit),  the  ECL  is  determined based on the maximum repayment term associated with future draws  from  credit  lines  unless  those  lines  of  credit  are unconditionally cancellable (e.g., credit cards) in which case the Corporation does not record any allowance.\n\nIn its loss forecasting framework, the Corporation incorporates  forward-looking  information  through  the  use  of macroeconomic scenarios applied over the forecasted life of the assets. These macroeconomic scenarios include variables that have historically been key drivers of increases and decreases in credit  losses.  These  variables  include,  but  are  not  limited  to, unemployment rates, real estate prices, gross domestic product levels  and  corporate  bond  spreads.  As  any  one  economic outlook  is  inherently  uncertain,  the  Corporation  leverages multiple scenarios. The scenarios that are chosen each quarter and the weighting given to each scenario depend on a variety of factors  including  recent  economic  events,  leading  economic indicators,  views  of  internal  and  third-party  economists  and industry trends.\n\nThe estimate of credit losses includes expected recoveries of amounts previously charged off (i.e., negative allowance). If a loan has been charged off, the expected cash flows on the loan are not limited by the current amortized cost balance. Instead, expected cash flows can be assumed up to the unpaid principal balance immediately prior to the charge-off.\n\nThe  allowance  for  loan  and  lease  losses  for  troubled  debt restructurings (TDR) is measured based on the present value of projected  future  lifetime  principal  and  interest  cash  flows discounted  at  the  loan's  original  effective  interest  rate,  or  in cases  where  foreclosure  is  probable  or  the  loan  is  collateral dependent,  at  the  loan's  collateral  value  or  its  observable market  price,  if  available.  The  measurement  of  ECL  for  the renegotiated consumer credit card TDR portfolio is based on the present  value  of  projected  cash  flows  discounted  using  the average  TDR  portfolio  contractual  interest  rate,  excluding promotionally  priced  loans,  in  effect  prior  to  restructuring. Projected cash flows for TDRs use the same economic outlook as  discussed  above.  For  purposes  of  computing  this  specific loss  component  of  the  allowance,  larger  impaired  loans  are evaluated individually and smaller impaired loans are evaluated as a pool.\n\nAlso included in the allowance for loan and lease losses are qualitative reserves to cover losses that are expected but, in the Corporation's assessment, may not be adequately reflected in the quantitative methods  or  the  economic  assumptions described  above.  For  example,  factors  that  the  Corporation considers  include  changes  in  lending  policies  and  procedures, business  conditions,  the  nature  and  size  of  the  portfolio, portfolio  concentrations,  the  volume  and  severity  of  past  due loans and nonaccrual loans, the effect of external factors such as  competition,  and  legal  and  regulatory  requirements,  among\n\nothers. Further, the Corporation considers the inherent uncertainty  in  quantitative  models  that  are  built  on  historical data.\n\nWith the exception of the Corporation's credit card portfolio, the Corporation does not include reserves for interest receivable in  the  measurement  of  the  allowance  for  credit  losses  as  the Corporation generally classifies consumer loans as nonperforming  at  90  days  past  due  and  reverses  interest income for these loans at that time. For credit card loans, the Corporation  reserves  for  interest  and  fees  as  part  of  the allowance for loan and lease losses. Upon charge-off of a credit card loan, the Corporation reverses the interest and fee income against the income statement line item where it was originally recorded.\n\nThe  Corporation  has  identified  the  following  three  portfolio segments and measures the allowance for credit losses using the following methods.\n\n## Consumer Real Estate\n\nTo estimate ECL for consumer loans secured by residential real estate, the Corporation estimates the number of loans that will default  over  the  life  of  the  existing  portfolio,  after  factoring  in estimated prepayments, using quantitative modeling methodologies.  The  attributes  that  are  most  significant  in estimating the Corporation's ECL include refreshed loan-to-value (LTV) or, in the case of a subordinated lien, refreshed combined LTV (CLTV), borrower credit score, months since origination and geography,  all  of  which  are  further  broken  down  by  present collection  status  (whether  the  loan  is  current,  delinquent,  in default,  or  in  bankruptcy).  The  estimates  are  based  on  the Corporation's  historical  experience  with  the  loan  portfolio, adjusted  to  reflect  the  economic  outlook.  The  outlook  on  the unemployment  rate  and  consumer  real  estate  prices  are  key factors that impact the frequency and severity of loss estimates. The  Corporation  does  not  reserve  for  credit  losses  on  the unpaid  principal  balance  of  loans  insured  by  the  Federal Housing  Administration  (FHA)  and  long-term  standby  loans,  as these loans are fully insured. The Corporation records a reserve for unfunded lending commitments for the ECL associated with the  undrawn  portion  of  the  Corporation's  HELOCs,  which  can only be canceled by the Corporation if certain criteria are met. The ECL associated with these unfunded lending commitments is calculated using the same models and methodologies noted above  and  incorporate  utilization  assumptions  at  time  of default.\n\nFor  loans  that  are  more  than  180  days  past  due  and collateral-dependent TDRs, the Corporation bases the allowance on the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral as of the reporting date less costs to sell. The fair value of the collateral securing  these  loans  is  generally  determined  using  an automated valuation model (AVM) that estimates the value of a property  by  reference  to  market  data  including  sales  of comparable  properties  and  price  trends  specific  to  the Metropolitan Statistical Area in which the property being valued is located. In the event that an AVM value is not available, the Corporation  utilizes  publicized  indices  or  if  these  methods provide less reliable valuations, the Corporation uses appraisals or  broker  price  opinions  to  estimate  the  fair  value  of  the collateral. While  there  is  inherent  imprecision  in  these valuations, the Corporation believes that they are representative of this portfolio in the aggregate.\n\nFor  loans  that  are  more  than  180  days  past  due  and collateral-dependent TDRs, with the exception of the Corporation's fully insured portfolio, the outstanding balance of loans  that  is  in  excess  of  the  estimated  property  value  after\n\nBank of America 2020\n\n127",

        "page_content": "adjusting  for  costs  to  sell  is  charged  off.  If  the  estimated property  value  decreases  in  periods  subsequent  to  the  initial charge-off,  the  Corporation  will  record  an  additional  charge-off; however,  if  the  value  increases  in  periods  subsequent  to  the charge-off, the Corporation will adjust the allowance to account for the increase but not to a level above the cumulative chargeoff amount.\n\n## Credit Cards and Other Consumer\n\nCredit  cards  are  revolving  lines  of  credit  without  a  defined maturity date. The estimated life of a credit card receivable is determined  by  estimating  the  amount  and  timing  of  expected future payments  (e.g., borrowers  making  full  payments, minimum payments or somewhere in between) that it will take for  a  receivable  balance  to  pay  off.  The  ECL  on  the  future payments  incorporates  the  spending  behavior  of  a  borrower through  time  using  key  borrower-specific  factors  and  the economic outlook described above. The Corporation applies all expected  payments  in  accordance  with  the  Credit  Card Accountability  Responsibility  and  Disclosure  Act  of  2009  (i.e., paying  down  the  highest  interest  rate  bucket  first).  Then forecasted future payments are prioritized to pay off the oldest balance  until  it  is  brought  to  zero  or  an  expected  charge-off amount.  Unemployment  rate  outlook,  borrower  credit  score, delinquency status and historical payment behavior are all key inputs  into  the  credit  card  receivable  loss  forecasting  model. Future draws on the credit card lines are excluded from the ECL as they are unconditionally cancellable.\n\nThe  ECL  for  the  consumer  vehicle  lending  portfolio  is  also determined  using  quantitative  methods  supplemented  with qualitative  analysis.  The  quantitative  model  estimates  ECL giving  consideration  to  key  borrower  and  loan  characteristics such  as  delinquency  status,  borrower  credit  score,  LTV  ratio, underlying collateral type and collateral value.\n\n## Commercial\n\nThe ECL on commercial loans is forecasted using models that estimate  credit  losses  over  the  loan's  contractual  life  at  an individual  loan  level.  The  models  use  the  contractual  terms  to forecast  future  principal  cash  flows  while  also  considering expected  prepayments.  For  open-ended  commitments  such  as revolving lines of credit, changes in funded balance are captured by forecasting a borrower's draw and payment behavior over the remaining life of the commitment. For loans collateralized with commercial real estate and for which the underlying asset is the primary  source  of  repayment,  the  loss  forecasting  models consider  key  loan  and  customer  attributes  such  as  LTV  ratio, net operating income and debt service coverage, and captures variations in behavior according to property type and region. The outlook on the unemployment rate, gross domestic product, and forecasted real estate prices are utilized to determine indicators such  as  rent  levels  and  vacancy  rates,  which  impact  the  ECL estimate.  For  all  other  commercial  loans  and  leases,  the  loss forecasting  model  determines  the  probabilities  of  transition  to different credit risk ratings or default at each point over the life of the asset based on the borrower's current credit risk rating, industry sector, size of the exposure and the geographic market. The  severity  of  loss  is  determined  based  on  the  type  of collateral securing the exposure, the size of the exposure, the borrower's  industry  sector,  any  guarantors  and  the  geographic market.  Assumptions  of  expected  loss  are  conditioned  to  the economic  outlook,  and  the  model  considers  key  economic variables such as unemployment rate, gross domestic product, corporate bond spreads, real estate and other asset prices and equity market returns.\n\n128\n\nBank of America 2020\n\nIn  addition to the allowance for loan and lease losses, the Corporation  also  estimates  ECL  related  to  unfunded  lending commitments  such  as  letters  of  credit,  financial  guarantees, unfunded bankers acceptances and binding loan commitments, excluding  commitments  accounted  for  under  the  fair  value option. Reserves are estimated for the unfunded exposure using the  same  models  and  methodologies  as  the  funded  exposure and are reported as reserves for unfunded lending commitments.\n\n## Nonperforming Loans and Leases, Charge-offs and Delinquencies\n\nNonperforming  loans  and  leases  generally  include  loans  and leases  that  have  been  placed  on  nonaccrual  status.  Loans accounted  for  under  the  fair  value  option  and  LHFS  are  not reported as nonperforming.\n\nIn accordance with the Corporation's policies, consumer real estate-secured loans, including residential mortgages and home equity  loans,  are  generally  placed  on  nonaccrual  status  and classified  as  nonperforming  at  90  days  past  due  unless repayment  of  the  loan  is  insured  by  the  FHA  or  through individually  insured  long-term  standby  agreements  with  Fannie Mae (FNMA) or Freddie Mac (FHLMC) (the fully-insured portfolio). Residential mortgage loans in the fully-insured portfolio are not placed on nonaccrual status and, therefore, are not reported as nonperforming.  Junior-lien  home  equity  loans  are  placed  on nonaccrual  status  and  classified  as  nonperforming  when  the underlying  first-lien  mortgage  loan  becomes  90  days  past  due even if the junior-lien loan is current. The outstanding balance of real  estate-secured  loans  that  is  in  excess  of  the  estimated property value less costs to sell is charged off no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due unless the loan is fully insured, or for loans in bankruptcy, within 60  days  of  receipt  of  notification  of  filing,  with  the  remaining balance classified as nonperforming.\n\nConsumer  loans  secured  by  personal  property,  credit  card loans and other unsecured consumer loans are not placed on nonaccrual  status  prior  to  charge-off  and,  therefore,  are  not reported  as  nonperforming  loans,  except  for  certain  secured consumer loans, including those that have been modified in a TDR. Personal property-secured loans (including auto loans) are charged  off  to  collateral  value  no  later  than  the  end  of  the month  in  which  the  account  becomes  120  days  past  due,  or upon repossession of an auto or, for loans in bankruptcy, within 60 days of receipt of notification of filing. Credit card and other unsecured customer loans are charged off no later than the end of the month in which the account becomes 180 days past due, within  60  days  after  receipt  of  notification  of  death  or bankruptcy, or upon confirmation of fraud.\n\nCommercial  loans  and  leases,  excluding  business  card loans,  that  are  past  due  90  days  or  more  as  to  principal  or interest,  or  where  reasonable  doubt  exists  as  to  timely collection,  including  loans  that  are  individually  identified  as being impaired, are generally placed on nonaccrual status and classified  as  nonperforming  unless  well-secured  and  in  the process of collection.\n\nBusiness card loans are charged off in the same manner as consumer credit card loans. Other commercial loans and leases are generally charged off when all or a portion of the principal amount is determined to be uncollectible.\n\nThe entire balance of a consumer loan or commercial loan or lease is contractually delinquent if the minimum payment is not received  by  the  specified  due  date  on  the  customer's  billing statement.  Interest  and  fees  continue  to  accrue  on  past  due loans and leases until the date the loan is placed on nonaccrual",

Interest collections on nonaccruing loans and leases for which the ultimate collectability of principal is uncertain are applied as principal reductions; otherwise, such collections are credited to income  when  received.  Loans  and  leases  may  be  restored  to accrual status when all principal and interest is current and full repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest is expected.\n\n## Troubled Debt Restructurings\n\nConsumer and commercial loans and leases whose contractual terms  have  been  restructured  in  a  manner  that  grants  a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties  are classified  as  TDRs.  Concessions  could  include  a  reduction  in the  interest  rate  to  a  rate  that  is  below  market  on  the  loan, payment  extensions,  forgiveness  of  principal,  forbearance  or other actions designed to maximize collections. Loans that are carried at fair value and LHFS are not classified as TDRs.\n\nLoans  and  leases  whose  contractual  terms  have  been modified in a TDR and are current at the time of restructuring may  remain  on  accrual  status  if  there  is  demonstrated performance prior to the restructuring and payment in full under the  restructured  terms  is  expected.  Otherwise,  the  loans  are placed  on  nonaccrual  status  and  reported  as  nonperforming, except for fully-insured consumer real estate loans, until there is sustained  repayment  performance  for  a  reasonable  period, generally  six  months.  If  accruing  TDRs  cease  to  perform  in accordance  with  their  modified  contractual  terms,  they  are placed  on  nonaccrual  status  and  reported  as  nonperforming TDRs.\n\nSecured  consumer  loans  that  have  been  discharged  in Chapter  7  bankruptcy  and  have  not  been  reaffirmed  by  the borrower are classified as TDRs at the time of discharge. Such loans are placed on nonaccrual status and written down to the estimated collateral value less costs to sell no later than at the time  of  discharge.  If  these  loans  are  contractually  current, interest collections are generally recorded in interest income on a cash basis. Consumer real estate-secured loans for which a binding  offer  to  restructure  has  been  extended  are  also classified as TDRs. Credit card and other unsecured consumer loans that have been renegotiated in a TDR generally remain on accrual status until the loan is either paid in full or charged off, which occurs no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due or, for loans that have been placed on a fixed payment plan, 120 days past due.\n\nA  loan  that  had  previously  been  modified  in  a  TDR  and  is subsequently refinanced under current underwriting standards at a market rate with no concessionary terms is accounted for as a new loan and is no longer reported as a TDR.\n\n## COVID-19 Programs\n\nThe  Corporation  has  implemented  various  consumer  and commercial loan modification programs to provide its borrowers relief from the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic (the pandemic). In accordance with the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act), the Corporation has elected to not apply TDR classification to eligible COVID-19 related loan modifications that were performed after March 1, 2020 to loans that were current as of December 31, 2019. Accordingly, these restructurings are not classified as TDRs. The availability of this election expires upon the earlier of January 1, 2022 or 60 days after  the national emergency related to COVID-19 terminates. In\n\naddition, for loans modified in response to the pandemic that do not  meet  the  above  criteria  (e.g.,  current  payment  status  at December 31, 2019), the Corporation is applying the guidance included  in  an  interagency  statement  issued  by  the  bank regulatory agencies. This guidance states that loan modifications performed in light of the pandemic, including loan payment  deferrals  that  are  up  to  six  months  in  duration,  that were  granted  to  borrowers  who  were  current  as  of  the implementation  date  of  a  loan  modification  program  or modifications granted under government mandated modification programs, are not TDRs. For loan modifications that include a payment deferral and are not TDRs, the borrowers' past due and nonaccrual  status  have  not  been  impacted  during  the  deferral period. The Corporation has continued to accrue interest during the deferral period using a constant effective yield method. For most mortgage, HELOC and commercial loan modifications, the contractual  interest  that  accrued  during  the  deferral  period  is payable  at  the  maturity  of  the  loan.  The  Corporation  includes these  amounts  with  the  unpaid  principal  balance  when computing  its  allowance  for  credit  losses.  Amounts  that  are subsequently  deemed  uncollectible  are  written  off  against  the allowance for credit losses.\n\n## Loans Held-for-sale\n\nLoans  that  the  Corporation  intends  to  sell  in  the  foreseeable future,  including  residential  mortgages,  loan  syndications,  and to  a  lesser  degree,  commercial  real  estate,  consumer  finance and  other  loans,  are  reported  as  LHFS  and  are  carried  at  the lower of aggregate cost or fair value. The Corporation accounts for certain LHFS, including residential mortgage LHFS, under the fair value option. Loan origination costs for LHFS carried at the lower of cost or fair value are capitalized as part of the carrying value of the loans and, upon the sale of a loan, are recognized as part of the gain or loss in noninterest income. LHFS that are on  nonaccrual  status  and  are  reported  as  nonperforming,  as defined  in  the  policy  herein,  are  reported  separately  from nonperforming loans and leases.\n\n## Premises and Equipment\n\nPremises and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation  and  amortization.  Depreciation  and  amortization are recognized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Estimated lives range up to 40 years for  buildings,  up  to  12  years  for  furniture  and  equipment,  and the shorter of lease term or estimated useful life for leasehold improvements.\n\n## Other Assets\n\nFor  the  Corporation's  financial  assets  that  are  measured  at amortized cost and are not included in debt securities or loans and leases on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Corporation evaluates  these  assets  for  ECL  using  various  techniques.  For assets  that  are  subject  to  collateral  maintenance  provisions, including  federal  funds  sold  and  securities  borrowed  or purchased  under  agreements  to  resell,  where  the  collateral consists  of  daily  margining  of  liquid  and  marketable  assets where  the  margining  is  expected  to  be  maintained  into  the foreseeable  future,  the  expected  losses  are  assumed  to  be zero. For all other assets, the Corporation performs qualitative analyses,  including  consideration  of  historical  losses  and current  economic  conditions,  to  estimate  any  ECL  which  are then  included  in  a  valuation  account  that  is  recorded  as  a contra-asset  against  the  amortized  cost  basis  of  the  financial asset.\n\nBank of America 2020\n\n129",

        "page_content": "## Lessee Arrangements\n\nSubstantially  all  of  the  Corporation's  lessee  arrangements  are operating  leases.  Under  these  arrangements,  the  Corporation records  right-of-use  assets  and  lease  liabilities  at  lease commencement.  Right-of-use  assets  are  reported  in  other assets  on  the  Consolidated  Balance  Sheet,  and  the  related lease  liabilities  are  reported  in  accrued  expenses  and  other liabilities. All leases are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet except leases with an initial term less than 12 months for which  the  Corporation  made  the  short-term  lease  election. Lease  expense  is  recognized  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  the lease  term  and  is  recorded  in  occupancy  and  equipment expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\nThe  Corporation  made  an  accounting  policy  election  not  to separate lease and non-lease components of a contract that is or contains a lease for its real estate and equipment leases. As such,  lease  payments  represent  payments  on  both  lease  and non-lease components. At lease commencement,  lease liabilities  are  recognized  based  on  the  present  value  of  the remaining lease payments and discounted using the Corporation's  incremental  borrowing  rate.  Right-of-use  assets initially equal the lease liability, adjusted for any lease payments made  prior  to  lease  commencement  and  for  any  lease incentives.\n\n## Goodwill and Intangible Assets\n\nGoodwill  is  the  purchase  premium  after  adjusting  for  the  fair value  of  net  assets  acquired.  Goodwill  is  not  amortized  but  is reviewed for potential impairment on an annual basis, or when events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment, at the reporting  unit  level.  A  reporting  unit  is  a  business  segment  or one level below a business segment.\n\nThe  Corporation  assesses  the  fair  value  of  each  reporting unit against its carrying value, including goodwill, as measured by allocated equity. For purposes of goodwill impairment testing, the  Corporation  utilizes  allocated  equity  as  a  proxy  for  the carrying  value  of  its  reporting  units.  Allocated  equity  in  the reporting units is comprised of allocated capital plus capital for the portion of goodwill and intangibles specifically assigned to the reporting unit.\n\nIn performing its goodwill impairment testing, the Corporation  first  assesses  qualitative  factors  to  determine whether  it  is  more  likely  than  not  that  the  fair  value  of  a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Qualitative factors include, among  other  things,  macroeconomic  conditions, industry  and  market  considerations,  financial  performance  of the  respective  reporting  unit  and  other  relevant  entityand reporting-unit specific considerations.\n\nIf  the  Corporation  concludes  it  is  more  likely  than  not  that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative assessment is performed. The Corporation has an unconditional  option  to  bypass  the  qualitative  assessment  for any  reporting  unit  in  any  period  and  proceed  directly  to performing  the  quantitative  goodwill  impairment  test.  The Corporation may resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period.\n\nWhen  performing  the  quantitative  assessment,  if  the  fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the  reporting  unit  would  not  be  considered  impaired.  If  the carrying  value  of  the  reporting  unit  exceeds  its  fair  value,  a goodwill impairment loss would be recognized for the amount by which the reporting unit's allocated equity exceeds its fair value. An  impairment  loss  recognized  cannot  exceed  the  amount  of goodwill  assigned  to  a  reporting  unit.  An  impairment  loss establishes  a  new  basis  in  the  goodwill,  and  subsequent\n\n130\n\nBank of America 2020\n\nreversals of goodwill impairment losses are not permitted under applicable accounting guidance.\n\nFor intangible assets subject to amortization, an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying value of the intangible asset is not recoverable and exceeds fair value. The carrying value of the intangible asset is considered not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset. Intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives are not subject to amortization. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying value of the intangible asset with an indefinite life exceeds its fair value.\n\n## Variable Interest Entities\n\nA  VIE  is  an  entity  that  lacks  equity  investors  or  whose  equity investors do not have a controlling financial interest in the entity through their equity investments. The Corporation consolidates a VIE if it has both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and  an  obligation  to  absorb  losses  or  the  right  to  receive benefits  that  could  potentially  be  significant  to  the  VIE.  On  a quarterly basis, the Corporation reassesses its involvement with the  VIE  and  evaluates  the  impact  of  changes  in  governing documents  and  its  financial  interests  in  the  VIE.  The consolidation  status  of  the  VIEs  with  which  the  Corporation  is involved may change as a result of such reassessments.\n\nThe  Corporation  primarily  uses  VIEs  for  its  securitization activities, in which the Corporation transfers whole loans or debt securities into a trust or other vehicle. When the Corporation is the  servicer  of  whole  loans  held  in  a  securitization  trust, including non-agency residential mortgages, home equity loans, credit cards, and other loans, the Corporation has the power to direct the most significant activities of the trust. The Corporation generally does not have the power to direct the most significant activities of a residential mortgage agency trust except in certain circumstances in which the Corporation holds substantially all of the issued securities and has the unilateral right to liquidate the trust.  The  power  to  direct  the  most  significant  activities  of  a commercial mortgage securitization trust is typically held by the special  servicer  or  by  the  party  holding  specific  subordinate securities which embody  certain controlling rights. The Corporation  consolidates  a  whole-loan  securitization  trust  if  it has the power to direct the most significant activities and also holds  securities  issued  by  the  trust  or  has  other  contractual arrangements, other than standard representations and warranties, that could potentially be significant to the trust.\n\nThe Corporation may also transfer trading account securities and  AFS  securities  into  municipal  bond  or  resecuritization trusts.  The  Corporation  consolidates  a  municipal  bond  or resecuritization trust if it has control over the ongoing activities of the trust such as the remarketing of the trust's liabilities or, if there are no ongoing activities, sole discretion over the design of  the  trust,  including  the  identification  of  securities  to  be transferred in and the structure of securities to be issued, and also  retains  securities  or  has  liquidity  or  other  commitments that could potentially be significant to the trust. The Corporation does not consolidate a municipal bond or resecuritization trust if one  or  a  limited  number  of  third-party  investors  share responsibility for the design of the trust or have control over the significant  activities  of  the  trust  through  liquidation  or  other substantive rights.\n\nOther  VIEs  used  by  the  Corporation  include  collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), investment vehicles created on behalf of  customers  and  other  investment  vehicles.  The  Corporation does  not  routinely  serve  as  collateral  manager  for  CDOs  and, therefore,  does  not  typically  have  the  power  to  direct  the",

        "page_content": "activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of a CDO. However, following an event of default, if the Corporation is a majority holder of senior securities issued by  a  CDO  and  acquires  the  power  to  manage  its  assets,  the Corporation consolidates the CDO.\n\nThe Corporation consolidates a customer or other investment vehicle if it has control over the initial design of the vehicle or manages the assets in the vehicle and also absorbs potentially significant gains or losses through an investment in the  vehicle,  derivative  contracts  or  other  arrangements.  The Corporation  does  not  consolidate  an  investment  vehicle  if  a single  investor  controlled  the  initial  design  of  the  vehicle  or manages the assets in the vehicles or if the Corporation does not have a variable interest that could potentially be significant to the vehicle.\n\nRetained interests in securitized assets are initially recorded at  fair  value.  In  addition,  the  Corporation  may  invest  in  debt securities  issued  by  unconsolidated  VIEs.  Fair  values  of  these debt securities, which are classified as trading account assets, debt securities carried at fair value or HTM securities, are based primarily on quoted market prices in active or inactive markets. Generally,  quoted  market  prices  for  retained  residual  interests are  not  available;  therefore,  the  Corporation  estimates  fair values based on the present value of the associated expected future cash flows.\n\n## Fair Value\n\nThe  Corporation  measures  the  fair  values  of  its  assets  and liabilities,  where  applicable,  in  accordance  with  accounting guidance that requires an entity to base fair value on exit price. Under this guidance, an entity is required to maximize the use of  observable  inputs  and  minimize  the  use  of  unobservable inputs  in  measuring  fair  value.  Under  applicable  accounting standards, fair value measurements are categorized into one of three levels based on the inputs to the valuation technique with the highest priority given to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets  and  the  lowest  priority  given  to  unobservable  inputs. The  Corporation  categorizes  its  fair  value  measurements  of financial instruments based on this three-level hierarchy.\n\nLevel 1 Unadjusted  quoted  prices  in  active  markets  for identical  assets  or  liabilities.  Level  1  assets  and liabilities include  debt  and  equity  securities  and derivative  contracts  that  are  traded  in  an  active exchange  market,  as  well  as  certain  U.S.  Treasury securities that are highly liquid and are actively traded in OTC markets.\n\nLevel 2\n\nObservable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted  prices  for  similar  assets  or  liabilities,  quoted prices  in  markets  that  are  not  active,  or  other  inputs that are  observable  or  can  be  corroborated  by observable market data for substantially the full term of  the  assets  or  liabilities.  Level  2  assets  and liabilities  include  debt  securities  with  quoted  prices that  are  traded  less  frequently  than  exchange-traded instruments and derivative contracts where fair value is determined using a pricing model with inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. This category  generally  includes  U.S.  government  and agency  mortgage-backed  (MBS)  and  asset-backed securities  (ABS),  corporate  debt  securities,  derivative contracts, certain loans and LHFS.\n\nLevel 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market  activity  and  that  are  significant  to  the  overall\n\nfair  value  of  the  assets  or  liabilities.  Level  3  assets and  liabilities  include  financial  instruments  for  which the  determination  of  fair  value  requires  significant management judgment or estimation. The fair value for such  assets  and  liabilities  is  generally  determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies  or  similar  techniques  that  incorporate the  assumptions  a  market  participant  would  use  in pricing  the  asset  or  liability.  This  category  generally includes  retained  residual  interests  in  securitizations, consumer  MSRs,  certain  ABS,  highly  structured, complex  or  long-dated  derivative  contracts,  certain loans  and  LHFS,  IRLCs  and  certain  CDOs  where independent pricing information cannot be obtained for a significant portion of the underlying assets.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nThere are two components of income tax expense: current and deferred. Current income tax expense reflects taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period. Deferred income tax expense results  from  changes  in  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities between periods. These gross deferred tax assets and liabilities represent decreases or increases in taxes expected to be paid in the  future  because  of  future  reversals  of  temporary differences in the bases of assets and liabilities as measured by  tax  laws  and  their  bases  as  reported  in  the  financial statements.  Deferred  tax  assets  are  also  recognized  for  tax attributes  such  as  net  operating  loss  carryforwards  and  tax credit  carryforwards.  Valuation  allowances  are  recorded  to reduce  deferred  tax  assets  to  the  amounts  management concludes are more likely than not to be realized.\n\nIncome  tax  benefits  are  recognized  and  measured  based upon a two-step model: first, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained based solely on its technical merits in order to be recognized, and second, the benefit is measured as the largest dollar amount of that position that is more likely than not  to  be  sustained  upon  settlement.  The  difference  between the  benefit  recognized  and  the  tax  benefit  claimed  on  a  tax return  is  referred  to  as  an  unrecognized  tax  benefit.  The Corporation records income tax-related interest and penalties, if applicable, within income tax expense.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nThe following summarizes the Corporation's revenue recognition accounting policies for certain noninterest income activities.\n\n## Card Income\n\nCard income includes annual, late and over-limit fees as well as interchange,  cash  advances  and  other  miscellaneous  items from  credit  and  debit  card  transactions  and  from  processing card transactions for merchants. Card income is presented net of direct costs. Interchange fees are recognized upon settlement  of  the  credit  and  debit  card  payment  transactions and are generally determined on a percentage basis for credit cards and  fixed rates for debit cards based  on  the corresponding  payment  network's  rates.  Substantially  all  card fees are recognized at the transaction date, except for certain time-based fees such as annual fees, which are recognized over 12  months.  Fees  charged  to  cardholders  and  merchants  that are estimated to be uncollectible are reserved in the allowance for  loan  and  lease  losses.  Included  in  direct  cost  are  rewards and credit card partner payments. Rewards paid to cardholders are  related  to  points  earned  by  the  cardholder  that  can  be redeemed  for  a  broad  range  of  rewards  including  cash,  travel and gift cards. The points to be redeemed are estimated based on  past  redemption  behavior,  card  product  type,  account\n\nBank of America 2020\n\n131",

The Corporation also makes payments to credit card partners. The payments are based on revenue-sharing agreements that are generally driven by cardholder transactions and partner sales volumes. As part of  the  revenue-sharing  agreements,  the  credit  card  partner provides the Corporation exclusive rights to market to the credit card  partner's  members  or  customers  on  behalf  of  the Corporation.\n\n## Service Charges\n\nService  charges  include  deposit  and  lending-related  fees. Deposit-related  fees  consist  of  fees  earned  on  consumer  and commercial deposit activities and are generally recognized when the transactions occur or as the service is performed. Consumer fees  are  earned  on  consumer  deposit  accounts  for  account maintenance  and  various  transaction-based  services,  such  as ATM  transactions,  wire  transfer  activities,  check  and  money order  processing  and  insufficient  funds/overdraft  transactions. Commercial  deposit-related  fees  are  from  the  Corporation's Global Transaction Services business and consist of commercial deposit  and  treasury  management  services,  including  account maintenance  and  other  services,  such  as  payroll,  sweep account and other cash management services. Lending-related fees generally represent transactional fees earned from certain loan commitments, financial guarantees and SBLCs.\n\n## Investment and Brokerage Services\n\nInvestment and brokerage services consist of asset management and brokerage fees. Asset management fees are earned  from  the  management  of  client  assets  under  advisory agreements or the full discretion of the Corporation's financial advisors (collectively  referred  to  as  assets  under  management (AUM)). Asset management fees are earned as a percentage of the client's AUM and generally range from 50 basis points (bps) to 150 bps of the AUM. In cases where a third party is used to obtain a client's investment allocation, the fee remitted to the third party is recorded net and is not reflected in the transaction price, as the Corporation is an agent for those services.\n\nBrokerage  fees  include  income  earned  from  transactionbased  services  that  are  performed  as  part  of  investment management services and are based on a fixed price per unit or as a percentage of the total transaction amount. Brokerage fees also  include  distribution  fees  and  sales  commissions  that  are primarily in the Global Wealth & Investment Management ( GWIM ) segment and are earned over time. In addition, primarily in the Global  Markets segment, brokerage fees  are  earned  when  the Corporation fills customer orders to buy or sell various financial products  or  when  it  acknowledges,  affirms,  settles  and  clears transactions and/or submits trade information to the appropriate  clearing  broker.  Certain  customers  pay  brokerage, clearing  and/or  exchange  fees  imposed  by  relevant  regulatory bodies or exchanges in order to execute or clear trades. These fees are recorded net and are not reflected in the transaction price, as the Corporation is an agent for those services.\n\n## Investment Banking Income\n\nInvestment  banking  income  includes  underwriting  income  and financial advisory services income. Underwriting consists of fees earned  for  the  placement  of  a  customer's  debt  or  equity securities.  The  revenue  is  generally  earned  based  on  a percentage  of  the  fixed  number  of  shares  or  principal  placed. Once  the  number  of  shares  or  notes  is  determined  and  the service is completed, the underwriting fees are recognized. The Corporation incurs certain out-of-pocket expenses, such as legal costs,  in  performing  these  services.  These  expenses  are\n\n132\n\nBank of America 2020\n\nrecovered through the revenue the Corporation earns from the customer and are included in operating expenses. Syndication fees  represent  fees  earned  as  the  agent  or  lead  lender responsible for structuring,  arranging  and  administering  a  loan syndication.\n\nFinancial  advisory  services  consist  of  fees  earned  for assisting  clients  with  transactions  related  to  mergers  and acquisitions and  financial restructurings. Revenue  varies depending on the size of the transaction and scope of services performed and is generally contingent on successful completion of  the  transaction.  Revenue  is  typically  recognized  once  the transaction is completed and all services have been rendered. Additionally, the Corporation may earn a fixed fee in merger and acquisition transactions to provide a fairness opinion, with the fees recognized when the opinion is delivered to the client.\n\n## Other Revenue Measurement and Recognition Policies\n\nThe  Corporation  did  not  disclose  the  value  of  any  open performance  obligations  at  December  31,  2020,  as  its contracts with customers generally have a fixed term that is less than one year, an open term with a cancellation period that is less than one year, or provisions that allow the Corporation to recognize revenue at the amount it has the right to invoice.\n\n## Earnings Per Common Share\n\nEarnings per common share (EPS) is computed by dividing net income  allocated  to  common  shareholders  by  the  weightedaverage  common  shares  outstanding,  excluding  unvested common  shares  subject  to  repurchase  or  cancellation.  Net income  allocated  to  common  shareholders  is  net  income adjusted  for  preferred  stock  dividends  including  dividends declared,  accretion  of  discounts  on  preferred  stock  including accelerated accretion when preferred stock is repaid early, and cumulative dividends related to the current dividend period that have not been declared as of period end, less income allocated to participating securities. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing income  allocated  to  common  shareholders  plus  dividends  on dilutive convertible preferred stock and preferred stock that can be  tendered  to  exercise  warrants,  by  the  weighted-average common  shares  outstanding  plus  amounts  representing  the dilutive  effect  of  stock  options  outstanding,  restricted  stock, restricted  stock  units  (RSUs),  outstanding  warrants  and  the dilution  resulting  from  the  conversion  of  convertible  preferred stock, if applicable.\n\n## Foreign Currency Translation\n\nAssets,  liabilities  and  operations  of  foreign  branches  and subsidiaries  are  recorded  based  on  the  functional  currency  of each entity. When the functional currency of a foreign operation is  the  local  currency,  the  assets,  liabilities  and  operations  are translated,  for  consolidation  purposes,  from  the  local  currency to  the  U.S.  dollar  reporting  currency  at  period-end  rates  for assets and liabilities and generally at average rates for results of  operations.  The  resulting  unrealized  gains  and  losses  are reported as a component of accumulated OCI, net-of-tax. When the  foreign  entity's  functional  currency  is  the  U.S.  dollar,  the resulting  remeasurement  gains  or  losses  on  foreign  currencydenominated assets or liabilities are included in earnings.\n\n## Paycheck Protection Program\n\nThe  Corporation  is  participating  in  the  Paycheck  Protection Program (PPP), which is a loan program that originated from the CARES  Act  and  was  subsequently  expanded  by  the  Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act. The PPP is  designed  to  provide  U.S.  small  businesses  with  cash-flow assistance  through  loans  fully  guaranteed  by  the  Small",

If  the  borrower  meets  certain criteria and  uses  the  proceeds  towards  certain  eligible expenses,  the  borrower's  obligation  to  repay  the  loan  can  be forgiven  up  to  the  full  principal  amount  of  the  loan  and  any accrued interest. Upon borrower forgiveness, the SBA pays the Corporation for the principal and accrued interest owed on the loan. If the full principal of the loan is not forgiven, the loan will operate  according  to  the  original  loan  terms  with  the  100 percent SBA guaranty remaining. As of December 31, 2020, the\n\nCorporation  had  approximately  332,000  PPP  loans  with  a carrying value of $22.7 billion. As compensation for originating the loans, the Corporation received lender processing fees from the  SBA,  which  are  capitalized,  along  with  the  loan  origination costs,  and  will  be  amortized  over  the  loans'  contractual  lives and recognized as interest income. Upon forgiveness of a loan and  repayment  by  the  SBA,  any  unrecognized  net  capitalized fees and costs related to the loan will be recognized as interest income in that period.\n\n## NOTE 2 Net Interest Income and Noninterest Income\n\nThe table below presents the Corporation's net interest income and noninterest income disaggregated by revenue source for 2020, 2019  and  2018.

(ISDA)  master  netting  agreements  or  similar agreements with substantially all of the Corporation's derivative counterparties. Where legally enforceable, these master netting agreements give the Corporation, in the event of default by the counterparty, the right to liquidate securities held as collateral and  to  offset  receivables  and  payables  with  the  same counterparty. For purposes of the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the  Corporation  offsets  derivative  assets  and  liabilities  and cash  collateral  held  with  the  same  counterparty  where  it  has such a legally enforceable master netting agreement.\n\nThe following table presents derivative instruments included in derivative assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance\n\nSheet at December 31, 2020 and 2019 by primary risk (e.g., interest rate risk) and the platform, where applicable, on which these derivatives are transacted. Balances are presented on a gross  basis,  prior  to  the  application  of  counterparty  and  cash collateral  netting.  Total  gross  derivative  assets  and  liabilities are adjusted on an aggregate basis to take into consideration the  effects  of  legally  enforceable  master  netting  agreements which include reducing the balance for counterparty netting and cash collateral received or paid.\n\nFor  more  information  on  offsetting  of  securities  financing agreements,  see Note  10  -  Federal  Funds  Sold  or  Purchased, Securities  Financing  Agreements,  Short-term  Borrowings  and Restricted Cash .\n\nBank of America 2020\n\n135",

Interest  rate,  foreign  exchange,  equity,  commodity and credit  contracts  are  utilized  in  the  Corporation's  ALM  and risk management activities.\n\nThe  Corporation  maintains  an  overall  interest  rate  risk management strategy that incorporates the use of interest rate contracts,  which  are  generally  non-leveraged  generic  interest rate  and  basis  swaps,  options,  futures  and  forwards,  to minimize significant fluctuations in earnings caused by interest rate volatility. The Corporation's goal is to manage interest rate sensitivity and volatility so that movements in interest rates do not significantly adversely affect earnings or capital. As a result of  interest  rate  fluctuations,  hedged  fixed-rate  assets  and liabilities appreciate or depreciate in fair value. Gains or losses on  the  derivative  instruments  that  are  linked  to  the  hedged fixed-rate  assets  and  liabilities  are  expected  to  substantially offset this unrealized appreciation or depreciation.\n\nMarket risk, including interest rate risk, can be substantial in the mortgage business. Market risk in the mortgage business is the  risk  that  values  of  mortgage  assets  or  revenues  will  be adversely  affected  by  changes  in  market  conditions  such  as interest  rate  movements.  To  mitigate  the  interest  rate  risk  in mortgage  banking  production  income,  the  Corporation  utilizes\n\n136\n\nBank of America 2020\n\nforward loan sale commitments and other derivative instruments,  including  purchased  options,  and  certain  debt securities.  The  Corporation  also  utilizes  derivatives  such  as interest  rate  options,  interest  rate  swaps,  forward  settlement contracts and eurodollar futures to hedge certain market risks of MSRs.\n\nThe Corporation uses foreign exchange contracts to manage the  foreign  exchange  risk  associated  with  certain  foreign currency-denominated  assets  and  liabilities,  as  well  as  the Corporation's investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries. Exposure to loss  on  these  contracts  will  increase  or  decrease  over  their respective  lives  as  currency  exchange  and  interest  rates fluctuate.\n\nThe  Corporation  purchases  credit  derivatives  to  manage credit  risk  related  to  certain  funded  and  unfunded  credit exposures.  Credit  derivatives  include  credit  default  swaps (CDS), total return swaps and swaptions. These derivatives are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in other income.\n\n## Derivatives Designated as Accounting Hedges\n\nThe Corporation uses various types of interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts to protect against changes in the fair  value  of  its  assets  and  liabilities  due  to  fluctuations  in interest  rates  and  exchange  rates  (fair  value  hedges).  The Corporation  also  uses  these  types  of  contracts  to  protect against changes in the cash flows of its assets and liabilities,",

For  terminated  cash  flow  hedges,  the  time  period  over which the majority of the forecasted transactions are hedged is approximately  3  years,  with  a  maximum  length  of  time  for certain forecasted transactions of 16 years.\n\n## Gains and Losses on Derivatives Designated as Cash Flow and Net Investment Hedges\n\n|                                                 | Gains (Losses) Recognized in  Accumulated OCI on Derivatives   | Gains (Losses) Recognized in  Accumulated OCI on Derivatives   | Gains (Losses) Recognized in  Accumulated OCI on Derivatives   | Gains (Losses) in Income  Reclassified from Accumulated OCI   | Gains (Losses) in Income  Reclassified from Accumulated OCI   | Gains (Losses) in Income  Reclassified from Accumulated OCI   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n| (Dollars in millions, amounts pretax)           | 2020                                                           | 2019                                                           | 2018                                                           | 2020                                                          | 2019                                                          | 2018                                                          |\n| Cash flow hedges                                |                                                                |                                                                |                                                                |                                                               |                                                               |                                                               |\n| Interest rate risk on variable-rate assets  (1) | $ 763                                                          | $ 671                                                          | $ (159)                                                        | $ (7)                                                         | $ (104)                                                       | $ (165)                                                       |\n| Price risk on forecasted MBS purchases  (1)     | 241                                                            | -                                                              | -                                                              | 9                                                             | -                                                             | -                                                             |\n| Price risk on certain compensation plans  (2)   | 85                                                             | 34                                                             | 4                                                              | 12                                                            | (2)                                                           | 27                                                            |\n| Total                                           | $ 1,089                                                        | $ 705                                                          | $ (155)                                                        | $ 14                                                          | $ (106)                                                       | $ (138)                                                       |\n| Net investment hedges                           |                                                                |                                                                |                                                                |                                                               |                                                               |                                                               |\n| Foreign exchange risk  (3)                      | $ (834)                                                        | $ 22                                                           | $ 989                                                          | $ 4                                                           | $ 366                                                         | $ 411                                                         |\n\nBank of America 2020\n\n137",

        "page_content": "## Other Risk Management Derivatives\n\nOther risk management derivatives are used by the Corporation to  reduce  certain  risk  exposures  by  economically  hedging various assets and liabilities. The following table presents gains (losses) on these derivatives for 2020, 2019 and 2018. These gains  (losses)  are  largely  offset  by  the  income  or  expense recorded on the hedged item.\n\n## Gains and Losses on Other Risk Management Derivatives\n\n| (Dollars in millions)                                           | 2020    | 2019   | 2018     |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------|----------|\n| Interest rate risk on mortgage activities  (1, 2)               | $ 446   | $ 315  | $  (107) |\n| Credit risk on loans  (2)                                       | (68)    | (58)   | 9        |\n| Interest rate and foreign currency risk on  ALM activities  (3) | (2,971) | 1,112  | 3,278    |\n| Price risk on certain compensation plans  (4)                   | 700     | 943    | (495)    |\n\n## Transfers  of  Financial  Assets  with  Risk  Retained through Derivatives\n\nThe  Corporation  enters  into  certain  transactions  involving  the transfer  of  financial  assets  that  are  accounted  for  as  sales where  substantially  all  of  the  economic  exposure  to  the transferred financial assets is retained through derivatives (e.g., interest rate and/or credit), but the Corporation does not retain control over the assets transferred. At both December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Corporation had transferred $5.2 billion of nonU.S.  government-guaranteed  mortgage-backed  securities  to  a third-party trust and  retained  economic  exposure  to  the transferred  assets  through  derivative  contracts.  In  connection with  these  transfers,  the  Corporation  received  gross  cash proceeds of $5.2 billion as of both transfer dates. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the fair value of the transferred securities was $5.5 billion and $5.3 billion.\n\n## Sales and Trading Revenue\n\nThe Corporation enters into trading derivatives to facilitate client transactions and to manage risk exposures arising from trading account assets and liabilities.  It  is  the  Corporation's  policy  to include  these  derivative  instruments  in  its  trading  activities, which  include  derivatives  and  non-derivative  cash  instruments. The  resulting  risk  from  these  derivatives  is  managed  on  a portfolio  basis  as  part  of  the  Corporation's Global  Markets business  segment.  The  related  sales  and  trading  revenue generated within Global Markets is  recorded in various income statement  line  items,  including  market  making  and  similar activities  and  net  interest  income  as  well  as  other  revenue categories.\n\nSales and trading revenue includes changes in the fair value and realized gains and losses on the sales of trading and other assets, net interest income, and fees primarily from commissions on equity securities. Revenue is generated by the difference in the client price for an instrument and the price at which  the  trading  desk  can  execute  the  trade  in  the  dealer market. For equity securities, commissions related to purchases and sales are recorded in the 'Other' column in the Sales and Trading  Revenue  table.  Changes  in  the  fair  value  of  these securities are included in market making and similar activities. For  debt  securities,  revenue,  with  the  exception  of  interest associated  with  the  debt  securities,  is  typically  included  in\n\n138\n\nBank of America 2020\n\nmarket  making  and  similar  activities.  Unlike  commissions  for equity  securities,  the  initial  revenue  related  to  broker-dealer services for debt securities is typically included in the pricing of the instrument rather than being charged through separate fee arrangements.  Therefore,  this  revenue  is  recorded  in  market making and similar activities as part of the initial mark to fair value. For derivatives, the majority of revenue  is  included  in market making and similar activities. In transactions where the Corporation  acts  as  agent,  which  include  exchange-traded futures and options, fees are recorded in other income.\n\nThe following table, which includes both derivatives and nonderivative  cash  instruments,  identifies  the  amounts  in  the respective  income  statement  line  items  attributable  to  the Corporation's  sales  and  trading  revenue  in Global  Markets , categorized  by  primary  risk,  for  2020,  2019  and  2018.  This table  includes  debit  valuation  adjustment  (DVA)  and  funding valuation  adjustment  (FVA)  gains  (losses). Global  Markets results  in Note  23  -  Business  Segment  Information are presented  on  a  fully  taxable-equivalent  (FTE)  basis.

Credit  derivatives  derive  value  based  on  an underlying  third-party  referenced  obligation  or  a  portfolio  of referenced obligations and generally require the Corporation, as the  seller  of  credit  protection,  to  make  payments  to  a  buyer upon the occurrence of a  predefined  credit  event.  Such  credit events  generally  include  bankruptcy  of  the  referenced  credit entity  and  failure  to  pay  under  the  obligation,  as  well  as acceleration  of  indebtedness  and  payment  repudiation  or",

For  credit  derivatives  based  on  a  portfolio  of referenced credits or credit indices, the Corporation may not be required to make payment until a specified amount of loss has occurred and/or may only be required to make payment up to a specified amount.\n\nCredit  derivatives  are  classified  as  investment  and  noninvestment grade based on the credit quality of the underlying referenced obligation. The Corporation considers ratings of BBB-\n\nor  higher  as  investment  grade.  Non-investment  grade  includes non-rated credit derivative instruments. The Corporation discloses internal categorizations of investment grade and noninvestment grade consistent with how risk is managed for these instruments.\n\nCredit  derivative  instruments  where  the  Corporation  is  the seller of credit protection and their expiration at December 31, 2020 and 2019 are summarized in the following table.\n\n## Credit Derivative Instruments\n\n|                             | Less than  One Year     | One to  Three Years     | Three to  Five Years    | Over Five  Years        | Total                   |\n|-----------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| (Dollars in millions)       | Carrying Value          | Carrying Value          | Carrying Value          | Carrying Value          | Carrying Value          |\n| Credit default swaps:       |                         |                         |                         |                         |                         |\n| Investment grade            | $ -

However, the  Corporation  does  not  monitor  its  exposure  to  credit derivatives  based  solely  on  the  notional  amount  because  this measure  does  not  take  into  consideration  the  probability  of occurrence.  As  such,  the  notional  amount  is  not  a  reliable indicator  of  the  Corporation's  exposure  to  these  contracts. Instead, a risk framework is used to define risk tolerances and establish  limits  so  that  certain  credit  risk-related  losses  occur\n\nwithin acceptable, predefined limits.\n\nCredit-related notes in the table above include investments in securities issued by CDO, collateralized loan obligation (CLO) and credit-linked note vehicles. These instruments are primarily classified  as  trading  securities.  The  carrying  value  of  these instruments  equals  the  Corporation's  maximum  exposure  to loss. The Corporation is not obligated to make any payments to the entities under the terms of the securities owned.\n\nBank of America 2020\n\n139",

        "page_content": "## Credit-related Contingent Features and Collateral\n\nThe Corporation executes the majority of its derivative contracts in the OTC market with large, international financial institutions, including broker-dealers and, to a lesser degree, with a variety of non-financial  companies.  A  significant  majority  of  the derivative  transactions  are  executed  on  a  daily  margin  basis. Therefore, events such as a credit rating downgrade (depending on  the  ultimate  rating  level)  or  a  breach  of  credit  covenants would typically  require  an  increase  in  the  amount  of  collateral required of the counterparty, where applicable, and/or allow the Corporation  to  take  additional  protective  measures  such  as early termination of all trades. Further, as previously discussed on  page  135,  the  Corporation  enters  into  legally  enforceable master  netting  agreements  that  reduce  risk  by  permitting closeout and netting of transactions with the same counterparty upon the occurrence of certain events.\n\nCertain  of  the  Corporation's  derivative  contracts  contain credit  risk-related  contingent  features,  primarily  in  the  form  of ISDA master netting agreements and credit support documentation  that  enhance  the  creditworthiness  of  these instruments  compared  to  other  obligations  of  the  respective counterparty with whom the Corporation has transacted. These contingent features may be for the benefit of the Corporation as well  as  its  counterparties  with  respect  to  changes  in  the Corporation's creditworthiness and the mark-to-market exposure under the derivative  transactions.  At  December  31,  2020  and 2019,  the  Corporation  held  cash  and  securities  collateral  of $96.5 billion and $84.3 billion and posted cash and securities collateral of $88.6 billion and $69.1 billion in the normal course of  business  under  derivative  agreements,  excluding  crossproduct  margining  agreements  where  clients  are  permitted  to margin on a net basis for both derivative and secured financing arrangements.\n\nIn connection with certain OTC derivative contracts and other trading agreements, the Corporation can be required to provide additional  collateral  or  to  terminate  transactions  with  certain counterparties in the event of a downgrade of the senior debt ratings of the Corporation or certain subsidiaries. The amount of additional  collateral  required  depends  on  the  contract  and  is usually a fixed incremental amount and/or the market value of the exposure.\n\nAt December 31, 2020, the amount of collateral, calculated based on the terms of the contracts, that the Corporation and certain subsidiaries could be required to post to counterparties but  had  not  yet  posted  to  counterparties  was  $2.6  billion, including $1.2 billion for Bank of America, National Association (BANA).\n\nSome  counterparties  are  currently  able  to  unilaterally terminate  certain  contracts,  or  the  Corporation  or  certain subsidiaries may be required to take other action such as find a suitable  replacement  or  obtain  a  guarantee.  At  December  31, 2020  and  2019,  the  liability  recorded  for  these  derivative contracts was not significant.\n\nThe  following  table  presents  the  amount  of  additional collateral  that  would  have  been  contractually  required  by derivative contracts and other trading agreements at December 31, 2020 if the rating agencies had downgraded their long-term  senior  debt  ratings  for  the  Corporation  or  certain subsidiaries  by  one  incremental  notch  and  by  an  additional second incremental notch.\n\n140\n\nBank of America 2020\n\n## Additional Collateral Required to be Posted Upon Downgrade at December 31, 2020\n\n| (Dollars in millions)                       |   One  incremental  notch | Second  incremental  notch   |\n|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------|\n| Bank of America Corporation                 |                       300 | $ 735                        |\n| Bank of America, N.A. and subsidiaries  (1) |                        61 | 570                          |\n\nThe  following  table  presents  the  derivative  liabilities  that would be subject to unilateral termination by counterparties and the  amounts  of  collateral  that  would  have  been  contractually required  at  December  31,  2020  if  the  long-term  senior  debt ratings  for  the  Corporation  or  certain  subsidiaries  had  been lower  by  one  incremental  notch  and  by  an  additional  second incremental notch.\n\n## Derivative Liabilities Subject to Unilateral Termination Upon Downgrade at December 31, 2020\n\n| (Dollars in millions)   | One  incremental  notch   | Second  incremental  notch   |\n|-------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------|\n| Derivative liabilities  | $ 45                      | $ 1,035                      |\n| Collateral posted       | 23                        | 544                          |\n\n## Valuation Adjustments on Derivatives\n\nThe  Corporation  records  credit  risk  valuation  adjustments  on derivatives  in  order  to  properly  reflect  the  credit  quality  of  the counterparties  and  its  own  credit  quality.  The  Corporation calculates  valuation  adjustments  on  derivatives  based  on  a modeled  expected  exposure  that  incorporates  current  market risk  factors.  The  exposure  also  takes  into  consideration  credit mitigants such as enforceable master netting agreements and collateral.  CDS  spread  data  is  used  to  estimate  the  default probabilities  and  severities  that  are  applied  to  the  exposures. Where  no  observable  credit  default  data  is  available  for counterparties, the Corporation uses proxies and other market data to estimate default probabilities and severity.\n\nThe table below presents credit valuation adjustment (CVA), DVA and FVA gains (losses) on derivatives (excluding the effect of  any  related  hedge  activities),  which  are  recorded  in  market making and similar activities,  for  2020,  2019  and  2018.  CVA gains  reduce  the  cumulative  CVA  thereby  increasing  the derivative  assets  balance.  DVA  gains  increase  the  cumulative DVA  thereby  decreasing  the  derivative  liabilities  balance.  CVA and DVA losses have the opposite impact. FVA gains related to derivative assets reduce the cumulative FVA thereby increasing the  derivative  assets  balance.  FVA  gains  related  to  derivative liabilities  increase  the  cumulative  FVA  thereby  decreasing  the derivative  liabilities  balance.  FVA  losses  have  the  opposite impact.\n\n## Valuation Adjustments Gains (Losses) on Derivatives (1)\n\n| (Dollars in millions)               | 2020    | 2019   | 2018   |\n|-------------------------------------|---------|--------|--------|\n| Derivative assets (CVA)             | $ (118) | $ 72   | $ 77   |\n| Derivative assets/liabilities (FVA) | (24)    | (2)    | (15)   |\n| Derivative liabilities (DVA)        | 24      | (147)  | (19)   |",

categorizes  consumer  real  estate  loans  as core and non-core based on loan and customer characteristics such  as  origination  date,  product  type,  LTV,  Fair  Isaac Corporation (FICO) score and delinquency status consistent with its current consumer and mortgage servicing strategy. Generally, loans  that  were  originated  after  January  1,  2010,  qualified under  government-sponsored  enterprise  (GSE)  underwriting guidelines,  or  otherwise  met  the  Corporation's  underwriting guidelines in place in 2015 are characterized as core loans. All other  loans  are  generally  characterized  as  non-core  loans  and represent runoff portfolios.\n\nThe Corporation has entered into long-term credit protection agreements with FNMA and FHLMC on loans totaling $9.0 billion and $7.5 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, providing full credit  protection  on  residential  mortgage  loans  that  become severely delinquent. All of these loans are individually insured, and therefore the Corporation does not record an allowance for credit losses related to these loans.\n\n## Nonperforming Loans and Leases\n\nCommercial  nonperforming  loans  increased  to  $2.2  billion  at December 31, 2020 from $1.5 billion at December 31, 2019 with broad-based increases across multiple industries. Consumer  nonperforming  loans  increased  to  $2.7  billion  at December 31, 2020 from $2.1 billion at December 31, 2019 driven  by  deferral  activity,  as  well  as  the  inclusion  of $144 million of certain loans that were previously classified as purchased credit-impaired loans and accounted for under a pool basis.\n\nThe  table  below  presents  the  Corporation's  nonperforming loans  and  leases  including  nonperforming  TDRs,  and  loans accruing past due 90 days or more at December 31, 2020 and 2019.  Nonperforming  LHFS  are  excluded  from  nonperforming loans and leases as they are recorded at either fair value or the lower of cost or fair value. For information on the Corporation's interest accrual policies, delinquency status for loan modifications  related  to  the  pandemic  and  the  criteria  for classification  as  nonperforming,  see Note  1  -  Summary  of Significant Accounting Principles.\n\nBank of America 2020\n\n145",

For  more  information  on  the  portfolio  segments,  see Note 1 Summary  of  Significant  Accounting  Principles . Within the Consumer  Real  Estate  portfolio  segment,  the  primary  credit quality  indicators  are  refreshed  LTV  and  refreshed  FICO  score. Refreshed  LTV  measures  the  carrying  value  of  the  loan  as  a percentage  of  the  value  of  the  property  securing  the  loan, refreshed  quarterly.  Home  equity  loans  are  evaluated  using CLTV,  which  measures  the  carrying  value  of  the  Corporation's loan and available line of credit combined with any outstanding senior liens against the property as a percentage of the value of the property securing the loan, refreshed quarterly. FICO score measures  the  creditworthiness  of  the  borrower  based  on  the financial  obligations  of  the  borrower  and  the  borrower's  credit history.  FICO scores  are  typically  refreshed  quarterly or more\n\n146\n\nBank of America 2020\n\nfrequently.  Certain  borrowers  (e.g.,  borrowers  that  have  had debts discharged in a bankruptcy proceeding) may not have their FICO  scores  updated.  FICO  scores  are  also  a  primary  credit quality  indicator  for  the  Credit  Card  and  Other  Consumer portfolio  segment  and  the  business  card  portfolio  within  U.S. small  business  commercial.  Within  the  Commercial  portfolio segment, loans are evaluated using the internal classifications of  pass  rated  or  reservable  criticized  as  the  primary  credit quality indicators. The term reservable criticized refers to those commercial loans that are internally classified or listed  by  the Corporation as Special Mention, Substandard or Doubtful, which are  asset  quality  categories  defined  by  regulatory  authorities. These  assets  have  an  elevated  level  of  risk  and  may  have  a high probability of default or total loss. Pass rated refers to all loans not considered reservable criticized. In addition to these primary  credit  quality  indicators,  the  Corporation  uses  other credit quality indicators for certain types of loans.\n\nThe following tables present certain credit quality indicators for  the  Corporation's  Consumer  Real  Estate,  Credit  Card  and Other  Consumer,  and  Commercial  portfolio  segments  by  class of  financing  receivables  and  year  of  origination  for  term  loan balances at December 31, 2020, including revolving loans that converted  to  term  loans  without  an  additional  credit  decision after origination or through a TDR.",

asset quality weakened during 2020. Commercial reservable criticized utilized  exposure  increased  to  $38.7  billion  at  December  31, 2020 from $11.5 billion (to 7.31 percent from 2.09 percent of total commercial reservable utilized exposure) at December 31, 2019  with  increases  spread  across  multiple  industries, including  travel and entertainment.\n\n## Troubled Debt Restructurings\n\nThe Corporation has been entering into loan modifications with borrowers in response to the pandemic, most of which are not classified  as  TDRs,  and  therefore  are  not  included  in  the discussion  below.  For  more  information  on  the  criteria  for classifying loans as TDRs, see Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Principles .\n\n## Consumer Real Estate\n\nModifications  of  consumer  real  estate  loans  are  classified  as TDRs when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and a  concession  has  been  granted.  Concessions  may  include reductions in interest rates, capitalization of past due amounts, principal  and/or  interest  forbearance,  payment  extensions, principal  and/or  interest  forgiveness,  or  combinations  thereof. Prior to permanently modifying a loan, the Corporation may enter into  trial  modifications  with  certain  borrowers  under  both government  and  proprietary  programs.  Trial  modifications generally  represent  a  three- to  four-month  period  during  which the  borrower  makes  monthly  payments  under  the  anticipated\n\n148\n\nBank of America 2020\n\nmodified  payment  terms.  Upon  successful  completion  of  the trial  period,  the  Corporation  and  the  borrower  enter  into  a permanent modification. Binding trial modifications are classified as TDRs when the trial offer is made and continue to be classified as TDRs regardless of whether the borrower enters into a permanent modification.\n\nConsumer real estate loans of $372 million that have been discharged  in  Chapter  7  bankruptcy  with  no  change  in repayment  terms  and  not  reaffirmed  by  the  borrower  were included in TDRs at December 31, 2020, of which $102 million were  classified  as  nonperforming  and  $68  million  were  loans fully insured.\n\nConsumer real estate TDRs are measured primarily based on the net present value of the estimated cash flows discounted at the loan's original effective interest rate. If the carrying value of a TDR exceeds this amount, a specific allowance is recorded as a  component  of  the  allowance  for  loan  and  lease  losses. Alternatively, consumer real estate TDRs that are considered to be dependent solely on the collateral for repayment (e.g., due to the  lack  of  income  verification)  are  measured  based  on  the estimated  fair  value  of  the  collateral,  and  a  charge-off  is recorded  if  the  carrying  value  exceeds  the  fair  value  of  the collateral. Consumer real estate loans that reach 180 days past due prior to modification are charged off to their net realizable value,  less  costs  to  sell,  before  they  are  modified  as  TDRs  in accordance with established policy. Subsequent declines in the fair  value  of  the  collateral  after  a  loan  has  reached  180  days past  due  are  recorded  as  charge-offs.  Fully-insured  loans  are",

Consumer real estate foreclosed properties totaled $123 million and  $229  million  at  December  31,  2020  and  2019.  The carrying  value  of  consumer  real  estate  loans,  including  fullyinsured loans, for which formal foreclosure proceedings were in process at December 31, 2020 was $1.2 billion. Although the Corporation  has  paused  formal  loan  foreclosure  proceedings and foreclosure sales for occupied properties, during 2020, the Corporation  reclassified  $182  million  of  consumer  real  estate\n\nloans completed or which were in process prior to the pause in foreclosures, to foreclosed properties or, for properties acquired upon  foreclosure  of  certain  government-guaranteed  loans (principally FHA-insured loans), to other assets.

The Corporation classifies other  secured  consumer  loans  that  have  been  discharged  in Chapter  7  bankruptcy  as  TDRs,  which  are  written  down  to collateral  value  and  placed on nonaccrual status no later than the time of discharge.\n\nThe  table  below  provides  information  on  the  Corporation's Credit  Card  and  Other  Consumer  TDR  portfolio  including  the December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 unpaid principal balance, carrying  value,  and  average  pre- and  post-modification  interest rates of loans that were modified in TDRs during 2020, 2019 and 2018.\n\n## Credit Card and Other Consumer - TDRs Entered into During 2020, 2019 and 2018 (1)\n\nPost-\n\n|                          | Unpaid Principal  Balance   | Carrying  Value  (2)   | Pre-Modification  Interest Rate   | Modification  Interest Rate   |\n|--------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| (Dollars in millions)    | December 31, 2020           | December 31, 2020      | December 31, 2020                 | December 31, 2020             |\n| Credit card              | $ 269                       | $ 277                  | 18.16 %                           | 5.63 %                        |\n| Direct/Indirect consumer | 52                          | 37                     | 5.83                              | 5.83                          |\n| Total                    | $ 321                       | $ 314                  | 16.70                             | 5.65                          |\n|                          | December 31, 2019           | December 31, 2019      | December 31, 2019                 | December 31, 2019             |\n| Credit card              | $ 340                       | $ 355                  | 19.18 %                           | 5.35 %                        |\n| Direct/Indirect consumer | 40                          | 21                     | 5.23                              | 5.21                          |\n| Total                    | $ 380                       | $ 376                  | 18.42                             | 5.34                          |\n|                          | December 31, 2018           | December 31, 2018      | December 31, 2018                 | December 31, 2018             |\n| Credit card              | $ 278                       | $ 292                  | 19.49 %                           | 5.24 %                        |\n| Direct/Indirect consumer | 42                          | 23                     | 5.10                              | 4.95                          |\n| Total                    | $ 320                       | $ 315                  | 18.45                             | 5.22                          |\n\nThe table below presents the December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 carrying value for Credit Card and Other Consumer loans that were modified in a TDR during 2020, 2019 and 2018, by program type.\n\n## Credit Card and Other Consumer - TDRs by Program Type at December 31 (1)\n\n| (Dollars in millions)   | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   |\n|-------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Internal programs       | $ 225  | $ 247  | $ 199  |\n| External programs       | 73     | 108    | 93     |\n| Other                   | 16     | 21     | 23     |\n| Total                   | $ 314  | $ 376  | $ 315  |\n\nCredit card and other consumer loans are deemed to be in payment default during the quarter in which a borrower misses the second of two consecutive payments. Payment defaults are one of the factors considered when projecting future cash flows in the calculation of the allowance for loan and lease losses for credit card and other consumer. Based on historical experience, the  Corporation  estimates  that  13  percent  of  new  credit  card TDRs and 19 percent of new direct/indirect consumer TDRs may be in payment default within 12 months after modification.\n\n## Commercial Loans\n\nModifications  of  loans  to  commercial  borrowers  that  are experiencing  financial  difficulty  are  designed  to  reduce  the Corporation's loss exposure while providing the borrower with an opportunity to work through financial difficulties, often to avoid foreclosure  or  bankruptcy.  Each  modification  is  unique  and reflects the individual circumstances of the borrower. Modifications  that  result  in  a  TDR  may include extensions of\n\n150\n\nBank of America 2020\n\nmaturity  at  a  concessionary  (below  market)  rate  of  interest, payment forbearances or other actions designed to benefit the borrower  while  mitigating  the  Corporation's  risk  exposure. Reductions in interest rates are rare. Instead, the interest rates are  typically  increased,  although  the  increased  rate  may  not represent  a  market  rate  of  interest.  Infrequently,  concessions may  also  include  principal  forgiveness  in  connection  with foreclosure, short sale or other settlement agreements leading to termination or sale of the loan.\n\nAt  the  time  of  restructuring,  the  loans  are  remeasured  to reflect the impact, if any, on projected cash flows resulting from the  modified  terms.  If  a  portion  of  the  loan  is  deemed  to  be uncollectible,  a  charge-off  may  be  recorded  at  the  time  of restructuring. Alternatively, a charge-off may have already been recorded in a previous period such that no charge-off is required at the time of modification.

        "page_content": "At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Corporation had $1.7 billion  and  $2.2  billion  of  commercial  TDRs  with  remaining commitments  to  lend  additional  funds  to  debtors  of  $402 million  and  $445  million.  The  balance  of  commercial  TDRs  in payment  default  was  $218  million  and  $207  million  at December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n\n## Loans Held-for-sale\n\nThe Corporation had LHFS of $9.2 billion at both December 31, 2020 and 2019. Cash and non-cash proceeds from sales and paydowns  of  loans  originally  classified  as  LHFS  were  $20.1 billion,  $30.6  billion  and  $29.2  billion  for  2020,  2019  and 2018, respectively. Cash used for originations and purchases of LHFS  totaled  approximately  $19.7  billion,  $28.9  billion  and $28.1 billion for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n\n## Accrued Interest Receivable\n\nAccrued interest receivable for loans and leases and loans heldfor-sale at December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $2.4 billion and $2.6 billion and is reported in customer and other receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nOutstanding  credit  card  loan  balances  include  unpaid principal, interest and fees. Credit card loans are not classified as nonperforming but are charged off no later than the end of the month in which the account becomes 180 days past due, within  60  days  after  receipt  of  notification  of  death  or bankruptcy,  or  upon  confirmation  of  fraud.  During  2020,  the Corporation  reversed  $512  million  of  interest  and  fee  income against the income statement line item in which it was originally recorded upon charge-off of the principal balance of the loan.\n\nFor  the  outstanding  residential  mortgage,  home  equity, direct/indirect consumer  and  commercial  loan balances classified  as  nonperforming  during  2020,  the  Corporation reversed $44 million of interest and fee income at the time the loans  were  classified  as  nonperforming  against  the  income statement line item in which it was originally recorded. For more information  on  the  Corporation's  nonperforming  loan  policies, see Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Principles .\n\n## Allowance for Credit Losses\n\nOn  January  1,  2020,  the  Corporation  adopted  the  new accounting  standard  that  requires  the  measurement  of  the allowance for credit losses to be based on management's best estimate of lifetime ECL inherent in the Corporation's relevant financial assets. Upon adoption of the new accounting standard, the Corporation recorded a $3.3 billion, or 32 percent, increase in  the  allowance  for  credit  losses  on  January  1,  2020,  which was comprised of a net increase of $2.9 billion in the allowance for  loan  and  lease  losses  and  a  $310  million  increase  in  the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. The net increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses was primarily driven by a  $3.1  billion  increase  in  credit  card  as  the  Corporation  now reserves  for  the  life  of  these  receivables.  The  increase  in  the reserve  for  unfunded  lending  commitments  included  $119 million  in  the  consumer  portfolio  for  the  undrawn  portion  of HELOCs and $191 million in the commercial portfolio. For more information on the Corporation's credit loss accounting policies including the allowance for credit losses see Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Principles .\n\nThe  allowance  for  credit losses is estimated  using quantitative  and  qualitative  methods  that  consider  a  variety  of factors,  such  as  historical  loss  experience,  the  current  credit\n\nquality of the portfolio and an economic outlook over the life of the  loan.  Qualitative  reserves  cover  losses  that  are  expected but,  in  the  Corporation's  assessment,  may  not  be  adequately reflected in the quantitative methods  or  the  economic assumptions.  The  Corporation  incorporates  forward-looking information through the use of several macroeconomic scenarios  in  determining  the  weighted  economic  outlook  over the forecasted life of the assets. These scenarios include key macroeconomic  variables  such  as  gross  domestic  product, unemployment  rate,  real  estate  prices  and  corporate  bond spreads.  The  scenarios  that  are  chosen  each  quarter  and  the weighting given to each scenario depend on a variety of factors including recent economic events, leading economic indicators, internal and third-party economist views, and industry trends.\n\nAs of January 1, 2020, to determine the allowance for credit losses, the Corporation used a series of economic outlooks that resulted in an economic outlook that was weighted towards the potential  of  a  recession  with  some  expectation  of  tail  risk similar to the severely adverse scenario used in stress testing. Various economic outlooks were also used in the December 31, 2020  estimate  for  allowance  for  credit  losses  that  included consensus  estimates,  multiple  downside  scenarios  which assumed a significantly longer period until economic recovery, a tail risk scenario similar to the severely adverse scenario used in stress testing and an upside scenario to reflect the potential for  continued  improvement  in  the  consensus  outlooks.  The weighted economic outlook assumes that the U.S. unemployment  rate  at  the  end  of  2021  would  be  relatively consistent with the level as of December 2020, slightly above 6.5 percent.  Additionally, in this economic outlook, U.S. gross domestic product returns to pre-pandemic levels in the early part of 2022. The allowance for credit losses considers the impact of enacted  government  stimulus,  including  the  COVID-19 Emergency  Relief  Act  of  2020,  and  continues  to  factor  in  the unprecedented nature of the current health crisis.\n\nThe  Corporation  also  factored  into  its  allowance  for  credit losses  an  estimated  impact  from  higher-risk  segments  that included  leveraged  loans  and  industries  such  as  travel  and entertainment,  which  have  been  adversely  impacted  by  the effects  of  COVID-19,  as  well  as  the  energy  sector.  The Corporation  also  holds  additional  reserves  for  borrowers  who requested  deferrals that take into account  their credit characteristics and payment behavior subsequent to deferral.\n\nThe allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2020 was $20.7  billion,  an  increase  of  $7.2  billion  compared  to January 1, 2020. The increase in the allowance for credit losses was  driven  by  the  deterioration  in  the  economic  outlook resulting  from  the  impact  of  COVID-19.  The  increase  in  the allowance for credit losses was comprised of a net increase of $6.4 billion  in  the  allowance  for  loan  and  lease  losses  and  a $755  million  increase  in  the  reserve  for  unfunded  lending commitments. The increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses  was  attributed  to  $418  million  in  the  consumer  real estate  portfolio,  $1.8  billion  in  the  credit  card  and  other consumer portfolio, and $4.2 billion in the commercial portfolio.\n\nOutstanding loans and leases excluding loans accounted for under  the  fair  value  option  decreased  $53.9  billion  in  2020, driven  by  consumer  loans,  which  decreased  $37.1  billion primarily due to a decline in credit card loans from reduced retail spending and higher payments.\n\nBank of America 2020\n\n151",

The  Corporation  routinely  securitizes  loans  and  debt securities using VIEs as a source of funding for the Corporation and as a means of transferring the economic risk of the loans or debt securities to third parties. The assets are transferred into a trust  or  other  securitization  vehicle  such  that  the  assets  are legally isolated from the creditors of the Corporation and are not available  to  satisfy  its  obligations.  These  assets  can  only  be used  to  settle  obligations  of  the  trust  or  other  securitization vehicle. The Corporation also administers, structures or invests in  other  VIEs  including  CDOs,  investment  vehicles  and  other entities. For more information on the Corporation's use of VIEs, see Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Principles.\n\nThe tables in this Note present the assets and liabilities of consolidated  and  unconsolidated  VIEs  at  December  31,  2020 and  2019  in  situations  where  the  Corporation  has  continuing involvement  with  transferred  assets  or  if  the  Corporation otherwise  has  a  variable  interest  in  the  VIE. The tables also\n\n152\n\nBank of America 2020\n\npresent the Corporation's maximum loss exposure at December 31,  2020  and  2019  resulting  from  its  involvement  with consolidated  VIEs  and  unconsolidated  VIEs  in  which  the Corporation  holds  a  variable  interest.  The  Corporation's maximum loss exposure is based on the unlikely event that all of  the  assets  in  the  VIEs  become  worthless  and  incorporates not  only  potential  losses  associated  with  assets  recorded  on the  Consolidated  Balance  Sheet  but  also  potential  losses associated  with  off-balance  sheet  commitments,  such  as unfunded liquidity commitments and other contractual arrangements. The Corporation's maximum loss exposure does not include losses previously recognized through write-downs of assets.\n\nThe  Corporation  invests  in  ABS  issued  by  third-party  VIEs with which it has no other form of involvement and enters into certain commercial  lending  arrangements  that  may  also incorporate  the  use  of  VIEs,  for  example  to  hold  collateral. These securities and loans are included in Note 4 - Securities or Note 5 - Outstanding Loans and Leases and Allowance for Credit Losses. In addition, the Corporation has used VIEs in connection with its funding activities.",

Securitization  usually  occurs  in conjunction with or shortly after origination or purchase, and the Corporation  may  also  securitize  loans  held  in  its  residential mortgage portfolio. In addition, the Corporation may, from time to  time,  securitize  commercial  mortgages  it  originates  or purchases from other entities. The Corporation typically services the  loans  it  securitizes.  Further,  the  Corporation  may  retain beneficial  interests  in  the  securitization  trusts  including  senior and  subordinate  securities  and  equity  tranches  issued  by  the trusts.  Except  as  described  in Note  12  -  Commitments  and Contingencies ,  the  Corporation  does  not  provide  guarantees  or recourse  to  the  securitization  trusts  other  than  standard representations and warranties.\n\nThe  table  below  summarizes  select  information  related  to first-lien mortgage securitizations for 2020, 2019 and 2018.\n\n## First-lien Mortgage Securitizations\n\n|                                             | Residential Mortgage - Agency   | Residential Mortgage - Agency   | Residential Mortgage - Agency   | Commercial Mortgage   | Commercial Mortgage   | Commercial Mortgage   |\n|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n| (Dollars in millions)                       | 2020                            | 2019                            | 2018                            | 2020                  | 2019                  | 2018                  |\n| Proceeds from loan sales  (1)               | $ 15,823                        | $ 6,858                         | $ 5,801                         | $ 5,084               | $ 8,661               | $ 6,991               |\n| Gains on securitizations  (2)               | 728                             | 27                              | 62                              | 61                    | 103                   | 101                   |\n| Repurchases from securitization trusts  (3) | 436                             | 881                             | 1,485                           | -                     | -                     | -                     |\n\nThe Corporation recognizes consumer MSRs from the sale or securitization  of  consumer  real  estate  loans.  The  unpaid principal  balance  of  loans  serviced  for  investors,  including residential  mortgage  and  home  equity  loans,  totaled  $160.4 billion  and  $192.1  billion  at  December  31,  2020  and  2019. Servicing  fee  and  ancillary  fee  income  on  serviced  loans  was $474 million, $585 million and $710 million during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Servicing advances on serviced loans, including loans  serviced  for  others  and  loans  held  for investment, were $2.2 billion and $2.4 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019. For more information on MSRs, see Note 20 Fair Value Measurements .\n\nDuring  2020,  the  Corporation  completed  the  sale  of  $9.3 billion  of  consumer  real  estate  loans  through  GNMA  loan securitizations.  As  part  of  the  securitizations,  the  Corporation retained  $8.4  billion  of  MBS,  which  are  classified  as  debt securities  carried  at  fair  value  on  the  Consolidated  Balance Sheet. Total gains on loan sales of $704 million were recorded in other income in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\nThe following table summarizes select information related to first-lien mortgage securitization trusts in which the Corporation held a variable interest at December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n\nBank of America 2020\n\n153",

        "page_content": "events  depend  on  the  undrawn  portion  of  the  HELOCs, performance of the loans, the amount of subsequent draws and the timing of related cash flows.\n\n## Credit Card Securitizations\n\nThe Corporation securitizes originated and purchased credit card loans.  The  Corporation's  continuing  involvement  with  the securitization trust includes servicing the receivables, retaining an undivided interest (seller's interest) in the receivables, and holding certain retained interests including subordinate interests in accrued interest and fees on the securitized receivables and cash reserve accounts.\n\nDuring 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Corporation issued  new senior  debt  securities  to  third-party  investors  from  the  credit card  securitization  trust  of  $1.0  billion,  $1.3  billion  and  $4.0 billion, respectively.\n\nAt  December  31,  2020  and  2019,  the  Corporation  held subordinate  securities  issued  by  the  credit  card  securitization trust with a notional principal amount of $6.8 billion and $7.4 billion. These securities serve as a form of credit enhancement to the senior debt securities and have a stated interest rate of zero  percent.  During  2020,  2019  and  2018,  the  credit  card securitization trust issued $161 million, $202 million and $650 million, respectively, of these subordinate securities.\n\n## Resecuritization Trusts\n\nThe  Corporation  transfers  securities,  typically  MBS,  into resecuritization  VIEs  generally  at  the  request  of  customers seeking securities with specific characteristics. Generally, there are no significant ongoing activities performed in a resecuritization trust,  and  no  single  investor  has  the  unilateral ability to liquidate the trust.\n\nThe  Corporation  resecuritized  $39.0  billion,  $24.4  billion and  $22.8  billion  of  securities  during  2020,  2019  and  2018, respectively.  Securities  transferred  into  resecuritization  VIEs were measured at fair value with changes in fair value recorded\n\nin market making and similar activities prior to the resecuritization  and,  accordingly,  no  gain  or  loss  on  sale  was recorded. Securities received from the resecuritization VIEs were recognized  at  their  fair  value  of  $6.1  billion,  $5.2  billion  and $4.1 billion during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. In 2019 and 2018, substantially all of the securities were classified as trading  account  assets.  All  of  the  securities  received  as resecuritization proceeds during 2020 were classified as trading account assets. Of the securities received as resecuritizations proceeds during 2020, $2.4 billion, $2.1 billion and $1.7 billion were  classified  as  trading  account  assets,  debt  securities carried at fair value and  HTM  securities, respectively. Substantially  all  of  the  trading  account  securities  and  debt securities  carried  at  fair  value  were  categorized  as  Level  2 within the fair value hierarchy.\n\n## Municipal Bond Trusts\n\nThe  Corporation  administers  municipal  bond  trusts  that  hold highly-rated,  long-term,  fixed-rate  municipal  bonds.

CDOs  are generally  managed  by  third-party  portfolio  managers.  The Corporation  typically  transfers  assets  to  these  CDOs,  holds securities  issued  by  the  CDOs  and  may  be  a  derivative\n\nBank of America 2020\n\n155",

The  Corporation's  maximum  loss exposure  to  consolidated  and  unconsolidated  CDOs  totaled $298  million  and  $304  million  at  December  31,  2020  and 2019.\n\n## Investment VIEs\n\nThe  Corporation  sponsors,  invests  in  or  provides  financing, which may be in connection with the sale of assets, to a variety of investment VIEs that hold loans, real estate, debt securities or other financial instruments and are designed to provide the desired  investment  profile  to  investors  or  the  Corporation.  At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Corporation's consolidated investment  VIEs  had  total  assets  of  $494  million  and  $104 million. The Corporation also held investments in unconsolidated VIEs with total assets of $5.4 billion and $5.1 billion  at  December  31,  2020  and  2019.  The  Corporation's maximum loss exposure associated with both consolidated and unconsolidated  investment  VIEs  totaled  $1.5  billion  and  $1.6 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019 comprised primarily of on-balance sheet assets less non-recourse liabilities.\n\n## Leveraged Lease Trusts\n\nThe  Corporation's  net  investment  in  consolidated  leveraged lease  trusts  totaled  $1.7  billion  at  both  December  31,  2020 and  2019.  The  trusts  hold  long-lived  equipment  such  as  rail cars, power  generation  and  distribution  equipment,  and commercial  aircraft.  The  Corporation  structures  the  trusts  and holds  a  significant  residual  interest.  The  net  investment represents  the  Corporation's  maximum  loss  exposure  to  the trusts in the unlikely event that the leveraged lease investments become worthless. Debt issued by the leveraged lease trusts is non-recourse to the Corporation.\n\n## Tax Credit VIEs\n\nThe  Corporation  holds  investments  in  unconsolidated  limited partnerships  and  similar  entities  that  construct,  own  and operate  affordable  housing,  wind  and  solar  projects.  An unrelated third party is typically the general partner or managing member and has control over the significant activities of the VIE. The Corporation earns a return primarily through the receipt of tax  credits  allocated  to  the  projects.  The  maximum  loss exposure included in the Other VIEs table was $22.0 billion and $18.9  billion at December  31,  2020  and  2019.  The Corporation's  risk  of  loss  is  generally  mitigated  by  policies requiring  that  the  project  qualify  for  the  expected  tax  credits prior to making its investment.\n\nThe Corporation's investments in affordable housing partnerships,  which  are  reported  in  other  assets  on  the Consolidated  Balance  Sheet,  totaled  $11.2  billion  and  $10.0 billion,  including  unfunded  commitments  to  provide  capital contributions of $5.0 billion and $4.3 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019. The unfunded commitments are expected to be paid over the next five years. During 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Corporation  recognized tax  credits and  other  tax\n\n156\n\nBank of America 2020\n\nbenefits from investments in affordable housing partnerships of $1.2 billion, $1.0 billion and $981 million and reported pretax losses in other income of $1.0 billion, $882 million and $798 million,  respectively.  Tax  credits  are  recognized  as  part  of  the Corporation's  annual  effective  tax  rate  used  to  determine  tax expense in a given quarter. Accordingly, the portion of a year's expected tax benefits recognized in any given quarter may differ from  25  percent.  The  Corporation  may  from  time  to  time  be asked  to  invest  additional  amounts  to  support  a  troubled affordable  housing  project.  Such  additional  investments  have not been and are not expected to be significant.\n\n## NOTE 7 Goodwill and Intangible Assets\n\n## Goodwill\n\nThe  table  below  presents  goodwill  balances  by  business segment and All  Other at  December 31, 2020 and 2019.

During 2020,  the  Corporation  recognized  a  $585  million  intangible asset,  which  is  being  amortized  over  a  10-year  life,  related  to the merchant contracts that were distributed to the Corporation from its merchant servicing joint venture. For more information, see Note 12 - Commitments and Contingencies .\n\nAt  both  December  31,  2020  and  2019,  intangible  assets included $1.6 billion of intangible assets associated with trade names,  substantially  all  of  which  had  an  indefinite  life  and, accordingly, are not being amortized. Amortization of intangibles expense  was  $95  million,  $112  million  and  $538  million  for 2020, 2019 and 2018.",

Generally,  these  options  do  not impact  the  lease  term  because  the  Corporation  is  not reasonably certain that it will exercise the options.\n\nThe  following  table  provides  information  on  the  right-of-use assets,  lease  liabilities  and  weighted-average  discount  rates and lease terms at December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n\n## Lessee Arrangements\n\n|                                                                                                   | December 31   | December 31   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| (Dollars in millions)                                                                             | 2020          | 2019          |\n| Right-of-use asset                                                                                | $ 10,000      | $ 9,735       |\n| Lease liabilities                                                                                 | 10,474        | 10,093        |\n| Weighted-average discount rate used to  calculate present value of future minimum  lease payments | 3.38 %        | 3.68 %        |\n| Weighted-average lease term (in years)                                                            | 8.4           | 8.2           |\n| Lease Cost and Supplemental Information:                                                          |               |               |\n| Operating lease cost                                                                              | $ 2,149       | $ 2,085       |\n| Variable lease cost  (1)                                                                          | 474           | 498           |\n| Total lease cost  (2)                                                                             | $ 2,623       | $ 2,583       |\n| Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for  new operating lease liabilities  (3)                | $ 851         | $ 931         |\n| Operating cash flows from operating  leases  (4)                                                  | 2,039         | 2,009         |\n\n## Maturity Analysis\n\nThe maturities of lessor and lessee arrangements outstanding at December 31, 2020 are presented in the table below based on undiscounted cash flows.\n\n## Maturities of Lessor and Lessee Arrangements\n\n|                                         | Lessor            | Lessor                                        | Lessee  (1)       |\n|-----------------------------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------|\n|                                         | Operating  Leases | Sales-type and  Direct Financing  Leases  (2) | Operating  Leases |\n| (Dollars in millions)                   | December 31, 2020 | December 31, 2020                             | December 31, 2020 |\n| 2021                                    | $ 843             | $ 5,424                                       | $ 1,927           |\n| 2022                                    | 748               | 4,934                                         | 1,715             |\n| 2023                                    | 630               | 3,637                                         | 1,454             |\n| 2024                                    | 479               | 2,089                                         | 1,308             |\n| 2025                                    | 339               | 1,143                                         | 1,087             |\n| Thereafter                              | 886               | 1,668                                         | 4,609             |\n| Total undiscounted  cash flows          | $ 3,925           | 18,895                                        | 12,100            |\n| Less: Net present  value adjustment (3) |                   | 1,268                                         | 1,626             |\n| Total                                   |                   | $ 17,627                                      | $ 10,474          |\n\n## NOTE 9 Deposits\n\nThe  table  below  presents  information  about  the  Corporation's  time  deposits  of  $100,000  or  more  at  December  31,  2020  and 2019.

Substantially all of the Corporation's securities  financing  activities  are  transacted  under  legally enforceable master repurchase agreements or legally enforceable master securities lending agreements that give the Corporation, in the event of default by the counterparty, the right\n\n158\n\nBank of America 2020\n\nto  liquidate  securities  held  and  to  offset  receivables  and payables  with  the  same  counterparty.  The  Corporation  offsets securities financing transactions with the same counterparty on the  Consolidated  Balance  Sheet  where  it  has  such  a  legally enforceable  master  netting  agreement  and  the  transactions have the same maturity date.\n\nThe Securities Financing Agreements table presents securities  financing  agreements  included  on  the  Consolidated Balance Sheet in federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased  under  agreements  to  resell,  and  in  federal  funds purchased and securities  loaned  or  sold  under  agreements  to repurchase  at  December  31,  2020  and  2019.  Balances  are presented  on  a  gross  basis,  prior  to  the  application  of counterparty  netting.  Gross  assets  and  liabilities  are  adjusted on an aggregate basis to take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable  master  netting  agreements.

        "page_content": "Under repurchase agreements, the Corporation is required to post collateral with a market value equal to or in excess of the principal  amount  borrowed.  For  securities  loaned  transactions, the Corporation receives collateral in the form of cash, letters of credit  or  other  securities.  To  determine  whether  the  market value of the underlying collateral remains sufficient, collateral is generally valued daily, and the Corporation may be required to deposit additional collateral  or  may  receive  or  return  collateral pledged when  appropriate. Repurchase agreements and securities  loaned  transactions  are  generally  either  overnight, continuous (i.e., no stated term) or short-term. The Corporation manages liquidity risks related to these agreements by sourcing\n\nfunding  from  a  diverse  group  of  counterparties,  providing  a range  of  securities  collateral  and  pursuing  longer  durations, when appropriate.\n\n## Restricted Cash\n\nAt  December  31,  2020  and  2019,  the  Corporation  held restricted  cash  included  within  cash  and  cash  equivalents  on the  Consolidated  Balance  Sheet  of  $7.0  billion  and  $24.4 billion,  predominantly related to cash held on deposit with the Federal  Reserve  Bank  and  non-U.S.  central  banks  to  meet reserve  requirements  and  cash  segregated  in  compliance  with securities regulations.\n\n## NOTE 11 Long-term Debt\n\nLong-term debt consists of borrowings having an original maturity of one year or more.

The notes may be denominated in U.S. dollars or foreign currencies. At December 31, 2020 and 2019,  the  amount  of  foreign  currency-denominated  debt translated into U.S. dollars included in total long-term debt was $54.6 billion and $49.6 billion. Foreign currency contracts may be  used  to  convert  certain  foreign  currency-denominated  debt into U.S. dollars.\n\nAt December 31, 2020, long-term debt of consolidated VIEs in  the  table  above  included  debt  from  credit  card,  residential mortgage,  home  equity  and  other  VIEs  of  $6.3  billion,  $491 million, $178 million and $111 million, respectively. Long-term debt of VIEs is collateralized by the assets of the VIEs. For more information,  see Note  6  -  Securitizations  and  Other  Variable Interest Entities.",

The  Corporation's  ALM  activities maintain an overall interest rate risk management strategy that incorporates  the  use  of  interest  rate  contracts  to  manage fluctuations  in  earnings  caused  by  interest  rate  volatility.  The Corporation's goal is to manage interest rate sensitivity so that movements in interest rates do not have a significantly adverse effect on earnings and capital. The weighted-average rates are the contractual interest rates on the debt and do not reflect the impacts of derivative transactions.\n\nDebt outstanding of $4.8 billion at December 31, 2020 was issued  by  BofA  Finance LLC, a consolidated finance subsidiary\n\nof Bank of America Corporation, the parent company, and is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the parent company.\n\nThe  table  below  shows  the  carrying  value  for  aggregate annual contractual maturities of long-term debt as of December 31, 2020. Included in the table are certain structured notes issued by the Corporation that contain provisions whereby the borrowings are redeemable at the option of the holder (put options)  at  specified  dates  prior  to  maturity.  Other  structured notes  have  coupon  or  repayment  terms  linked  to  the performance of debt or equity securities, indices, currencies or commodities, and the maturity may be accelerated based on the value  of  a  referenced  index  or  security.  In  both  cases,  the Corporation  or  a  subsidiary  may  be  required  to  settle  the obligation  for  cash  or  other  securities  prior  to  the  contractual maturity  date.  These  borrowings  are  reflected  in  the  table  as maturing at their contractual maturity date.\n\n## Long-term Debt by Maturity\n\n| (Dollars in millions)                    | 2021     | 2022     | 2023     | 2024     | 2025     | Thereafter   | Total     |\n|------------------------------------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|--------------|-----------|\n| Bank of America Corporation              |          |          |          |          |          |              |           |\n| Senior notes                             | $ 8,888  | $ 15,380 | $ 23,872 | $ 21,407 | $ 15,723 | $ 105,903    | $ 191,173 |\n| Senior structured notes                  | 469      | 2,034    | 597      | 190      | 549      | 13,194       | 17,033    |\n| Subordinated notes                       | 371      | 393      | -        | 3,351    | 5,537    | 14,484       | 24,136    |\n| Junior subordinated notes                | -        | -        | -        | -        | -        | 739          | 739       |\n| Total Bank of America Corporation        | 9,728    | 17,807   | 24,469   | 24,948   | 21,809   | 134,320      | 233,081   |\n| Bank of America, N.A.                    |          |          |          |          |          |              |           |\n| Senior notes                             | 1,340    | 975      | 511      | -        | -        | 8            | 2,834     |\n| Subordinated notes                       | -        | -        | -        | -        | -        | 1,883        | 1,883     |\n| Advances from Federal Home Loan Banks    | 502      | 3        | 1        | -        | 18       | 75           | 599       |\n| Securitizations and other Bank VIEs  (1) | 4,056    | 1,241    | 977      | -        | -        | 22           | 6,296     |\n| Other                                    | 112      | 16       | 189      | -        | 279      | 87           | 683       |\n| Total Bank of America, N.A.              | 6,010    | 2,235    | 1,678    | -        | 297      | 2,075        | 12,295    |\n| Other debt                               |          |          |          |          |          |              |           |\n| Structured Liabilities                   | 4,613    | 2,414    | 2,221    | 655      | 859      | 6,030        | 16,792    |\n| Nonbank VIEs  (1)                        | 1        | -        | -        | -        | -        | 756          | 757       |\n| Other                                    | -        | -        | -        | -        | -        | 9            | 9         |\n| Total other debt                         | 4,614    | 2,414    | 2,221    | 655      | 859      | 6,795        | 17,558    |\n| Total long-term debt                     | $ 20,352 | $ 22,456 | $ 28,368 | $ 25,603 | $ 22,965 | $ 143,190    | $ 262,934 |\n\n## NOTE 12 Commitments and Contingencies\n\nIn the normal course of business, the Corporation enters into a number of off-balance sheet commitments. These commitments expose the Corporation to varying degrees of credit and market risk  and  are  subject  to  the  same  credit  and  market  risk limitation  reviews  as  those  instruments  recorded  on  the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n## Credit Extension Commitments\n\nThe Corporation enters into commitments to extend credit such as loan commitments, SBLCs and commercial letters of credit to  meet  the  financing  needs  of  its  customers.  The  following table includes the notional amount of unfunded legally binding lending commitments  net of amounts distributed (i.e., syndicated  or  participated)  to  other  financial  institutions.  The distributed  amounts  were  $10.5  billion  and  $10.6  billion  at December  31,  2020  and  2019.  The  carrying  value  of  these commitments  at  December  31,  2020  and  2019,  excluding commitments  accounted  for  under  the  fair  value option, was\n\n$1.9  billion  and  $829  million,  which  primarily  related  to  the reserve  for  unfunded  lending  commitments.  The  carrying  value of  these  commitments  is  classified  in  accrued  expenses  and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nLegally binding commitments to extend credit generally have\n\nspecified  rates  and  maturities.  Certain  of  these  commitments have  adverse  change  clauses  that  help  to  protect  the Corporation against deterioration in the borrower's ability to pay. The table below includes the notional amount of commitments of $4.0 billion and $4.4 billion at December 31, 2020  and  2019  that  are  accounted  for  under  the  fair  value option. However, the table excludes cumulative net fair value of $99 million and $90 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019 on these commitments, which is classified in accrued expenses and  other  liabilities.  For  more  information  regarding  the Corporation's  loan  commitments  accounted  for  under  the  fair value option, see Note 21 - Fair Value Option.\n\nBank of America 2020\n\n161",

These commitments generally expire within the next 12 months.\n\nAt  December  31,  2020  and  2019,  the  Corporation  had  a commitment  to  originate  or  purchase  up  to  $3.9  billion  and $3.3  billion  on  a  rolling  12-month  basis,  of  auto  loans  and leases  from  a  strategic  partner.  This  commitment  extends through November 2022 and can be terminated with 12 months prior notice.\n\n## Other Guarantees\n\n## Bank-owned Life Insurance Book Value Protection\n\nThe Corporation sells products that offer book value protection to  insurance carriers who offer group life insurance policies to corporations,  primarily  banks.  At  December  31,  2020  and 2019,  the  notional  amount  of  these  guarantees  totaled  $7.1 billion and $7.3 billion. At both December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Corporation's maximum  exposure  related to these guarantees  totaled  $1.1  billion,  with  estimated  maturity  dates between 2033 and 2039.\n\n162\n\nBank of America 2020\n\n## Indemnifications\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Corporation enters into various  agreements that contain indemnifications, such as tax indemnifications,  whereupon  payment  may  become  due  if certain external events occur, such as a change in tax law. The indemnification  clauses  are  often  standard  contractual  terms and were entered into in the normal course of business based on an assessment that the risk of loss would be remote. These agreements  typically  contain  an  early  termination  clause  that permits  the  Corporation  to  exit  the  agreement  upon  these events. The maximum  potential future payment under indemnification  agreements  is  difficult  to  assess  for  several reasons,  including  the  occurrence  of  an  external  event,  the inability  to  predict  future  changes  in  tax  and  other  laws,  the difficulty in determining how such laws would apply to parties in contracts, the absence of exposure limits contained in standard contract  language  and  the  timing  of  any  early  termination clauses. Historically, any payments made  under  these guarantees  have  been  de  minimis.  The  Corporation  has assessed the probability of making such payments in the future as remote.\n\n## Merchant Services\n\nPrior to July 1, 2020, a significant portion of the Corporation's merchant processing activity was performed by a joint venture in which the Corporation held a 49 percent ownership interest. On July 29, 2019, the Corporation gave notice to the joint venture partner  of  the  termination  of  the  joint  venture  upon  the conclusion of its current term on June 30, 2020. Effective July 1,  2020,  the  Corporation  received  its  share  of  the  joint venture's  merchant  contracts  and  began  performing  merchant processing services for these merchants. While merchants bear responsibility  for  any  credit  or  debit  card  charges  properly reversed  by  the  cardholder,  the  Corporation,  in  its  role  as merchant acquirer, may be held liable for any reversed charges that  cannot  be  collected  from  the  merchants  due  to,  among other things, merchant fraud or insolvency.",

        "page_content": "The  Corporation,  as  a  card  network  member  bank,  also sponsors  other  merchant  acquirers,  principally  its  former  joint venture  partner  with  respect  to  merchant  contracts  distributed to  that  partner  upon  the  termination  of  the  joint  venture.  If charges are properly reversed after a purchase and cannot be collected from either the merchants or merchant acquirers, the Corporation may be held liable for these reversed charges. The ability  to  reverse  a  charge  is  primarily  governed  by  the applicable regulatory and card network rules, which include, but are not limited to, the type of charge, type of payment used and time limits. For the six-months ended December 31, 2020, the Corporation  processed  an  aggregate  purchase  volume  of $339.2  billion.  The  Corporation's  risk  in  this  area  primarily relates  to  circumstances  where  a  cardholder  has  purchased goods or services for future delivery. The Corporation mitigates this risk by requiring cash deposits, guarantees, letters of credit or  other  types  of  collateral  from  certain  merchants.  The Corporation's  reserves  for  contingent  losses  and  the  losses incurred  related  to  the  merchant  processing  activity  were  not significant. The Corporation continues to monitor its exposure in this area due to the potential economic impacts of COVID-19.\n\n## Exchange and Clearing House Member Guarantees\n\nThe Corporation is a member of various securities and derivative exchanges  and  clearinghouses,  both  in  the  U.S.  and  other countries. As a member, the Corporation may be required to pay a  pro-rata  share  of  the  losses  incurred  by  some  of  these organizations as a result of another member default and under other  loss  scenarios.  The  Corporation's  potential  obligations may be limited to its membership interests in such exchanges and  clearinghouses,  to  the  amount  (or  multiple)  of  the Corporation's  contribution  to  the  guarantee  fund  or,  in  limited instances, to the full pro-rata share of the residual losses after applying  the  guarantee  fund.  The  Corporation's  maximum potential  exposure  under  these  membership  agreements  is difficult to estimate; however, the Corporation has assessed the probability of making any such payments as remote.\n\n## Prime Brokerage and Securities Clearing Services\n\nIn connection with its prime brokerage and clearing businesses, the  Corporation  performs  securities  clearance  and  settlement services  with  other  brokerage  firms  and  clearinghouses  on behalf of its clients. Under these arrangements, the Corporation stands ready to meet the obligations of its clients with respect to securities transactions. The Corporation's obligations in this respect are secured by the assets in the clients' accounts and the  accounts  of  their  customers  as  well  as  by  any  proceeds received  from  the  transactions  cleared  and  settled  by  the Corporation  on  behalf  of  clients  or  their  customers.  The Corporation's maximum  potential exposure under these arrangements is difficult to estimate; however, the potential for the  Corporation  to  incur  material  losses  pursuant  to  these arrangements is remote.\n\n## Fixed Income Clearing Corporation Sponsored Member Repo Program\n\nThe  Corporation  acts  as  a  sponsoring  member  in  a  repo program  whereby  the  Corporation  clears  certain  eligible  resale and repurchase agreements through the Government Securities Division  of  the  Fixed  Income  Clearing  Corporation  on  behalf  of clients  that  are  sponsored  members  in  accordance  with  the Fixed  Income  Clearing  Corporation's  rules.  As  part  of  this program, the Corporation guarantees the payment  and performance  of  its  sponsored  members  to  the  Fixed  Income Clearing Corporation. The Corporation's guarantee obligation is\n\nsecured by a security interest in cash or high-quality securities collateral placed by clients with the clearinghouse and therefore, the  potential  for  the  Corporation  to  incur  significant  losses under this arrangement is remote. The Corporation's maximum potential exposure, without taking into consideration the related collateral, was $22.5 billion and $9.3 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n\n## Other Guarantees\n\nThe Corporation has entered into additional guarantee agreements and commitments, including sold risk participation swaps,  liquidity  facilities,  lease-end  obligation  agreements, partial  credit  guarantees  on  certain  leases,  real  estate  joint venture  guarantees,  divested  business  commitments  and  sold put  options  that  require  gross  settlement.  The  maximum potential future payments  under  these  agreements  are approximately  $8.8  billion  and  $8.7  billion  at  December  31, 2020  and  2019.  The  estimated  maturity  dates  of  these obligations  extend  up  to  2049.  The  Corporation  has  made  no material payments under these guarantees. For more information  on  maximum  potential  future  payments  under  VIErelated liquidity commitments, see Note 6 - Securitizations and Other Variable Interest Entities .\n\nIn the normal course of business, the Corporation periodically guarantees  the  obligations  of  its  affiliates  in  a  variety  of transactions  including  ISDA-related  transactions  and  non-ISDA related  transactions  such  as  commodities  trading,  repurchase agreements, prime brokerage agreements and other transactions.\n\n## Guarantees of Certain Long-term Debt\n\nThe Corporation, as the parent company, fully and unconditionally  guarantees  the  securities  issued  by  BofA Finance LLC, a consolidated finance subsidiary of the Corporation, and effectively provides for the full and unconditional  guarantee  of  trust  securities  issued  by  certain statutory trust companies that are 100 percent owned finance subsidiaries of the Corporation.\n\n## Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees\n\nThe Corporation securitizes first-lien residential mortgage loans generally  in  the  form  of  RMBS  guaranteed  by  the  GSEs  or  by GNMA  in  the  case  of  FHA-insured,  VA-guaranteed  and  Rural Housing Service-guaranteed mortgage loans, and sells pools of first-lien residential mortgage loans in the form of whole loans. In  addition,  in  prior  years,  legacy  companies  and  certain subsidiaries  sold  pools  of  first-lien  residential  mortgage  loans and home equity loans as private-label securitizations or in the form of whole loans. In connection with these transactions, the Corporation  or  certain  of  its  subsidiaries  or  legacy  companies make and have made various representations  and  warranties. Breaches of these representations and warranties have resulted in and may continue to result in the requirement to repurchase mortgage  loans  or  to  otherwise  make  whole  or  provide indemnification  or  other  remedies  to  sponsors,  investors, securitization  trusts,  guarantors,  insurers  or  other  parties (collectively, repurchases).\n\n## Unresolved Repurchase Claims\n\nUnresolved  representations  and  warranties  repurchase  claims represent  the  notional  amount  of  repurchase  claims  made  by counterparties, typically the outstanding principal balance or the unpaid principal balance at the time of default. In the case of first-lien  mortgages,  the  claim  amount  is  often  significantly\n\nBank of America 2020\n\n163",

        "page_content": "greater  than  the  expected  loss  amount  due  to  the  benefit  of collateral and, in some cases, mortgage insurance or mortgage guarantee payments.\n\nThe  notional  amount  of  unresolved  repurchase  claims  at December  31,  2020  and  2019  was  $8.5  billion  and  $10.7 billion. These balances included $2.9 billion and $3.7 billion at December  31,  2020  and  2019  of  claims  related  to  loans  in specific private-label securitization groups or tranches where the Corporation owns substantially all of the outstanding securities or  will  otherwise  realize  the  benefit  of  any  repurchase  claims paid.\n\nDuring  2020,  the  Corporation  received  $89  million  in  new repurchase  claims  that  were  not  time-barred.  During  2020, $2.4 billion  in  claims  were  resolved,  including  $168  million  of claims that were deemed time-barred.\n\n## Reserve and Related Provision\n\nThe reserve for representations and warranties obligations and corporate  guarantees  was  $1.3  billion  and  $1.8  billion  at December  31,  2020  and  2019  and  is  included  in  accrued expenses  and  other  liabilities  on  the  Consolidated  Balance Sheet and the related provision is included in other income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. The representations and warranties  reserve  represents  the  Corporation's  best  estimate of  probable  incurred  losses,  is  based  on  its  experience  in previous negotiations, and is subject to judgment, a variety of assumptions,  and  known  or  unknown  uncertainties.  Future representations and warranties losses may occur in excess of the  amounts  recorded  for  these  exposures;  however,  the Corporation does not expect such amounts to be material to the Corporation's financial condition and liquidity. See Litigation and Regulatory Matters below for the Corporation's combined range of  possible  loss  in  excess  of  the  reserve  for  representations and warranties and the accrued liability for litigation.\n\n## Litigation and Regulatory Matters\n\nIn  the  ordinary  course  of  business,  the  Corporation  and  its subsidiaries  are  routinely  defendants  in  or  parties  to  many pending  and  threatened  legal,  regulatory  and  governmental actions  and  proceedings.  In  view  of  the  inherent  difficulty  of predicting the outcome of such matters, particularly where the claimants  seek  very  large  or  indeterminate  damages  or  where the  matters  present  novel  legal  theories  or  involve  a  large number of parties, the Corporation generally cannot predict the eventual outcome of the pending matters, timing of the ultimate resolution of these matters, or eventual loss, fines or penalties related to each pending matter.\n\nAs  a  matter  develops,  the  Corporation,  in  conjunction  with any  outside  counsel  handling  the  matter,  evaluates  whether such matter presents a loss contingency that is  probable  and estimable, and, for the matters disclosed in this Note, whether a loss in excess of any accrued liability is reasonably possible in future periods. Once the loss contingency is deemed to be both probable  and  estimable,  the  Corporation  will  establish  an accrued liability and record a corresponding amount of litigationrelated  expense.  The  Corporation  continues  to  monitor  the matter for further developments that could affect the amount of the  accrued  liability  that  has  been  previously  established. Excluding  expenses  of  internal  and  external  legal  service providers,  litigation-related  expense  of  $823  million  and  $681 million was recognized in 2020 and 2019.\n\nFor  the  matters  disclosed  in  this  Note  for  which  a  loss  in future periods is reasonably possible and estimable (whether in excess  of  an  accrued  liability  or  where  there  is  no  accrued liability)  and  for  representations and warranties exposures, the Corporation's  estimated  range  of  possible  loss  is  $0  to  $1.3\n\n164\n\nBank of America 2020\n\nbillion in excess of the accrued liability, if any, as of December 31, 2020.\n\nThe  accrued  liability  and  estimated  range  of  possible  loss are  based  upon  currently  available  information  and  subject  to significant  judgment,  a  variety  of  assumptions  and  known  and unknown  uncertainties.  The  matters  underlying  the  accrued liability and estimated range of possible loss are unpredictable and may change from time to time, and actual losses may vary significantly from  the  current  estimate  and  accrual.  The estimated  range  of  possible  loss  does  not  represent  the Corporation's maximum loss exposure.\n\nInformation  is  provided  below  regarding  the  nature  of  the litigation  and  associated  claimed  damages.  Based  on  current knowledge, and taking into account accrued liabilities, management  does  not  believe  that  loss  contingencies  arising from  pending  matters,  including  the  matters  described  herein, will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition or liquidity of the Corporation. However, in light of the significant  judgment,  variety  of  assumptions  and  uncertainties involved  in  these  matters,  some  of  which  are  beyond  the Corporation's  control,  and  the  very  large  or  indeterminate damages sought in some of these matters, an adverse outcome in  one  or  more  of  these  matters  could  be  material  to  the Corporation's  business  or  results  of  operations  for  any particular  reporting  period,  or  cause  significant  reputational harm.\n\n## Ambac Bond Insurance Litigation\n\nAmbac  Assurance  Corporation  and  the  Segregated  Account  of Ambac Assurance Corporation (together, Ambac) have filed four separate lawsuits  against  the  Corporation  and  its  subsidiaries relating  to  bond  insurance  policies  Ambac  provided  on  certain securitized  pools  of  HELOCs,  first-lien  subprime  home  equity loans,  fixed-rate  second-lien  mortgage  loans  and  negative amortization pay option adjustable-rate mortgage loans. Ambac alleges  that  they  have  paid  or  will  pay  claims  as  a  result  of defaults in the underlying loans and asserts that the defendants misrepresented the characteristics of the underlying loans and/ or breached certain contractual representations and warranties regarding the underwriting and servicing of the loans. In those actions where the Corporation is named as a defendant, Ambac contends  the  Corporation  is  liable  on  various  successor  and vicarious  liability theories.  These  actions  are  at  various procedural stages with material developments provided below.\n\n## Ambac v. Countrywide I\n\nThe Corporation, and several Countrywide entities are named as defendants in  an  action  filed  on  September  28,  2010  in  New York  Supreme  Court.  Ambac  asserts  claims  for  fraudulent inducement as well as breach of contract and seeks damages in excess of $2.2 billion, plus punitive damages.\n\nOn May 16, 2017, the First Department issued its decisions on  the  parties'  cross-appeals  of  the  trial  court's  October  22, 2015  summary  judgment  rulings.  Ambac  appealed  the  First Department's  rulings  requiring  Ambac  to  prove  all  of  the elements of its fraudulent inducement claim, including justifiable reliance and loss causation; restricting Ambac's sole remedy  for  its  breach  of  contract  claims  to  the  repurchase protocol  of  cure,  repurchase  or  substitution  of  any  materially defective loan; and dismissing Ambac's claim for reimbursements of attorneys' fees. On June 27, 2018, the New York Court of Appeals affirmed the First Department rulings that Ambac appealed.",

        "page_content": "On  December  4,  2020,  the  New  York  Supreme  Court dismissed  Ambac's  fraudulent  inducement  claim.  Ambac appealed the dismissal.\n\n## Ambac v. Countrywide II\n\nOn December 30, 2014, Ambac filed a complaint in New York Supreme  Court  against  the  same  defendants,  claiming fraudulent inducement against Countrywide, and successor and vicarious liability against the Corporation. Ambac  seeks damages in excess of $600 million, plus punitive damages.\n\n## Ambac v. Countrywide IV\n\nOn July 21, 2015, Ambac filed an action in New York Supreme Court  against  Countrywide  asserting  the  same  claims  for fraudulent  inducement  that  Ambac  asserted  in  the  nowdismissed  Ambac  v.  Countrywide  III.  The  complaint  seeks damages in excess of $350 million, plus punitive damages. On December  8,  2020,  the  New  York  Supreme  Court  dismissed Ambac's complaint. Ambac appealed the dismissal.\n\n## Ambac v. First Franklin\n\nOn April  16,  2012,  Ambac  filed  an  action  against  BANA,  First Franklin  and  various  Merrill  Lynch  entities,  including  Merrill Lynch,  Pierce,  Fenner  &  Smith  Incorporated,  in  New  York Supreme Court  relating  to  guaranty  insurance  Ambac  provided on a First Franklin securitization sponsored by Merrill Lynch. The complaint alleges fraudulent inducement and breach of contract, including breach of contract claims against BANA based upon its servicing  of  the  loans  in  the  securitization.  Ambac  seeks  as damages hundreds of millions of dollars that Ambac alleges it has paid or will pay in claims.\n\n## Deposit Insurance Assessment\n\nOn January 9, 2017, the FDIC filed suit against BANA in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging failure to pay a December  15,  2016  invoice  for  additional  deposit  insurance assessments and interest in the amount of $542 million for the quarters  ending  June  30,  2013  through  December  31,  2014. On  April  7,  2017,  the  FDIC  amended  its  complaint  to  add  a claim  for  additional  deposit  insurance  and  interest  in  the amount of $583 million for the quarters ending March 31, 2012 through March 31, 2013. The FDIC asserts these claims based on  BANA's  alleged  underreporting  of  counterparty  exposures that  resulted  in  underpayment  of  assessments  for  those quarters  and  its  Enforcement  Section  is  also  conducting  a parallel investigation related to the same alleged reporting error. BANA disagrees with the FDIC's interpretation of the regulations as they existed during the relevant time period and is defending itself against the FDIC's claims. Pending final resolution, BANA has  pledged  security  satisfactory  to  the  FDIC  related  to  the disputed additional assessment amounts. On March 27, 2018, the  U.S.  District  Court  for  the  District  of  Columbia  denied BANA's partial motion to dismiss certain of the FDIC's claims.\n\n## LIBOR, Other Reference Rates, Foreign Exchange (FX) and Bond Trading Matters\n\nGovernment  authorities  in  the  U.S.  and  various  international jurisdictions  continue  to  conduct  investigations  of,  to  make inquiries of, and to pursue proceedings against, the Corporation\n\nand its subsidiaries regarding FX and other reference rates as well as government, sovereign, supranational and agency bonds in  connection  with  conduct  and  systems  and  controls.  The Corporation is cooperating with these inquiries and investigations, and responding to the proceedings.\n\n## LIBOR\n\nThe  Corporation,  BANA  and  certain  Merrill  Lynch  entities  have been named as defendants along with most of the other LIBOR panel banks in a number of individual and putative class actions by persons alleging they sustained losses on U.S. dollar LIBORbased  financial  instruments  as  a  result  of  collusion  or manipulation by defendants regarding the setting of U.S. dollar LIBOR. Plaintiffs  assert  a  variety  of  claims,  including  antitrust, Commodity  Exchange  Act,  Racketeer  Influenced  and  Corrupt Organizations (RICO), Securities Exchange Act of 1934, common law fraud and breach of contract claims, and seek compensatory,  treble  and  punitive  damages,  and  injunctive relief. All but one of the cases naming the Corporation and its affiliates  relating  to  U.S.  dollar  LIBOR  are  pending  in  the  U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.\n\nThe  District  Court  has  dismissed  all  RICO  claims,  and dismissed  all  manipulation  claims  against  Bank  of  America entities based on alleged trader conduct. The District Court has also  substantially  limited  the  scope  of  antitrust,  Commodity Exchange Act and various other claims, including by dismissing in  their  entirety  certain  individual  and  putative  class  plaintiffs' antitrust claims for lack of standing and/or personal jurisdiction. Plaintiffs whose antitrust claims were dismissed by the District Court  are  pursuing  appeals  in  the  Second  Circuit.  Certain individual and putative class actions remain pending against the Corporation, BANA and certain Merrill Lynch entities.\n\nOn February 28, 2018, the District Court granted certification of a class of persons that purchased OTC swaps and notes that referenced U.S. dollar LIBOR from one of the U.S. dollar LIBOR panel banks, limited to claims under Section 1 of the Sherman Act.  The  U.S.  Court  of  Appeals  for  the  Second  Circuit subsequently  denied  a  petition  filed  by  the  defendants  for interlocutory appeal of that ruling.\n\n## U.S.  Bank - Harborview  and  SURF/OWNIT  Repurchase Litigation\n\nBeginning in 2011, U.S. Bank, National Association (U.S. Bank), as trustee for the HarborView Mortgage Loan Trust 2005-10 and various SURF/OWNIT RMBS trusts filed complaints against the Corporation,  Countrywide  entities,  Merrill  Lynch  entities  and other affiliates in New York Supreme Court alleging breaches of representations  and  warranties.  The  defendants  and  certain certificate-holders  in  the  trusts  agreed  to  settle  the  respective matters in amounts not material to the Corporation, subject to acceptance  by  U.S.  Bank.  The  litigations  have  been  stayed pending finalization of the settlements.\n\nBank of America 2020\n\n165",

The  suspension  of  the  Corporation's  repurchases  did  not include repurchases to offset shares awarded under its equitybased compensation plans.\n\nDuring  2020, the Corporation repurchased and retired  227 million  shares  of  common  stock,  which  reduced  shareholders' equity by  $7.0 billion.\n\nDuring 2020, in connection with employee stock plans, the Corporation issued 66 million shares of its common stock and, to  satisfy  tax  withholding  obligations,  repurchased  26  million shares  of  its  common  stock.  At  December  31,  2020,  the Corporation  had  reserved  513  million  unissued  shares  of common  stock  for  future  issuances  under  employee  stock plans, convertible notes and preferred stock.\n\n## Preferred Stock\n\nThe  cash  dividends  declared  on  preferred  stock  were  $1.4 billion, $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n\nOn January 24, 2020, the Corporation issued 44,000 shares of Fixed-to-Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series MM for $1.1 billion. Dividends are paid semi-annually during the\n\n166\n\nBank of America 2020\n\nfixed-rate  period,  then  quarterly  during  the  floating-rate  period. The Series MM preferred stock has a liquidation preference of $25,000 per share and is subject to certain restrictions in the event the Corporation fails to declare and pay full dividends.\n\nOn  October  29,  2020,  the  Corporation  issued  44,000 shares  of  4.375%  Non-Cumulative  Preferred  Stock,  Series  NN for $1.1 billion, with quarterly dividend payments commencing in February 2021. The Series NN preferred stock has a liquidation preference  of  $25,000  per  share  and  is  subject  to  certain restrictions in the event the Corporation fails to declare and pay full dividends.\n\nOn January 28, 2021, the Corporation issued 36,000 shares of  4.125%  Non-Cumulative  Preferred  Stock,  Series  PP  for $915  million,  with  quarterly  dividends  commencing  in  May 2021.  The  Series  PP  preferred  stock  has  a  liquidation preference  of  $25,000  per  share  and  is  subject  to  certain restrictions in the event the Corporation fails to declare and pay full dividends.\n\nIn  2020, the Corporation fully redeemed Series Y preferred stock  for  $1.1  billion.  Additionally,  on  January  29,  2021,  the Corporation fully redeemed Series CC preferred stock for $1.1 billion.\n\nAll series of preferred stock in the Preferred Stock Summary table have a par value of $0.01 per share, are not subject to the operation of a sinking fund, have no participation rights, and with  the  exception  of  the  Series  L  Preferred  Stock,  are  not convertible.  The  holders  of  the  Series  B  Preferred  Stock  and Series  1  through  5  Preferred  Stock  have  general  voting  rights and  vote  together  with  the  common  stock.  The  holders  of  the other series included in the table have no general voting rights. All outstanding series of preferred stock of the Corporation have preference over the Corporation's common stock with respect to the payment of dividends and distribution of the Corporation's assets  in  the  event  of  a  liquidation  or  dissolution.  With  the exception  of  the  Series  B,  F,  G  and  T  Preferred  Stock,  if  any dividend payable on these series is in arrears for three or more semi-annual  or  six  or  more  quarterly  dividend  periods,  as applicable  (whether  consecutive  or  not),  the  holders  of  these series and any other class or series of preferred stock ranking equally as to payment of dividends and upon which equivalent voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable (voting as a  single  class)  will  be  entitled  to  vote  for  the  election  of  two additional  directors.  These  voting  rights  terminate  when  the Corporation  has  paid  in  full  dividends  on  these  series  for  at least  two  semi-annual  or  four  quarterly  dividend  periods,  as applicable, following the dividend arrearage.\n\nThe  7.25%  Non-Cumulative  Perpetual  Convertible  Preferred Stock, Series L (Series L Preferred Stock) does not have early redemption/call  rights.  Each  share  of  the  Series  L  Preferred Stock may be converted at any time, at the option of the holder, into 20 shares of the Corporation's common stock plus cash in lieu of fractional shares. The Corporation may cause some or all of the Series L Preferred Stock, at its option, at any time or from time to time, to be converted into shares of common stock at the then-applicable conversion rate if, for 20 trading days during any period of 30 consecutive trading days, the closing price of common  stock  exceeds  130  percent  of  the  then-applicable conversion price of the Series L Preferred Stock. If a conversion of Series L Preferred Stock occurs at the option of the holder, subsequent to a dividend record date but prior to the dividend payment  date,  the  Corporation  will  still  pay  any  accrued dividends payable.",

For  2018,  average  options  to  purchase  four  million shares of common stock were outstanding but not included in the  computation  of  EPS  because  the  result  would  have  been antidilutive  under  the  treasury  stock  method.  For  2019  and 2018,  average  warrants  to  purchase  three  million  and  136 million shares of common stock, respectively, were included in the  diluted  EPS  calculation  under  the  treasury  stock  method. Substantially all of these warrants were exercised on or before their expiration date of January 16, 2019.\n\n## NOTE 16 Regulatory Requirements and Restrictions\n\nThe Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC)  and  FDIC  (collectively,  U.S.  banking  regulators)  jointly establish  regulatory  capital  adequacy  rules,  including  Basel  3, for U.S. banking organizations. As a financial holding company, the Corporation is subject to capital adequacy rules issued by\n\nthe Federal Reserve. The Corporation's banking entity affiliates are subject to capital adequacy rules issued by the OCC.\n\nThe  Corporation  and  its  primary  banking  entity  affiliate, BANA, are Advanced approaches institutions under Basel 3. As Advanced  approaches  institutions,  the  Corporation  and  its banking  entity  affiliates  are  required  to  report  regulatory  riskbased  capital  ratios  and  risk-weighted  assets  under  both  the Standardized  and  Advanced  approaches.  The  approach  that yields  the  lower  ratio  is  used  to  assess  capital  adequacy, including under the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework.\n\nThe  Corporation  is  required  to  maintain  a  minimum supplementary  leverage  ratio  (SLR)  of  3.0  percent  plus  a leverage  buffer  of  2.0  percent  in  order  to  avoid  certain restrictions  on  capital  distributions  and  discretionary  bonus payments.  The  Corporation's  insured  depository  institution subsidiaries  are  required  to  maintain  a  minimum  6.0  percent SLR to be considered well capitalized under the PCA framework.\n\nThe  following  table  presents  capital  ratios  and  related information  in  accordance  with  Basel  3  Standardized  and Advanced approaches as measured at December 31, 2020 and 2019 for the Corporation and BANA.\n\n## Regulatory Capital under Basel 3\n\n|                                                      | Bank of America Corporation    | Bank of America Corporation   | Bank of

        "page_content": "The  capital  adequacy  rules  issued  by  the  U.S.  banking regulators require institutions to meet the established minimums  outlined  in  the  table  above.  Failure  to  meet  the minimum  requirements  can  lead  to  certain  mandatory  and discretionary  actions  by  regulators  that  could  have  a  material adverse  impact  on  the  Corporation's  financial  position.  At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Corporation and its banking entity affiliates were well capitalized.\n\nIn  response  to  the  uncertainty  arising  from  the  pandemic, the Federal Reserve required all large banks to suspend share repurchase programs during the second half of 2020, except for repurchases  to  offset  shares  awarded  under  equity-based compensation  plans,  and  to  limit  common  stock  dividends  to existing rates that did not exceed the average of the last four quarters' net income. In December 2020, the Federal Reserve announced  that  beginning  in  the  first  quarter  of  2021,  large banks  would  be  permitted  to  pay  common  stock  dividends  at existing  rates  and  to  repurchase  shares  in  an  amount  that, when  combined  with  dividends  paid,  does  not  exceed  the average  of  net  income  over  the  last  four  quarters.  For  more information, see Note 13 - Shareholders' Equity .\n\n## Other Regulatory Matters\n\nThe Federal Reserve requires the Corporation's bank subsidiaries  to  maintain  reserve  requirements  based  on  a percentage  of  certain  deposit  liabilities.  The  average  daily reserve  balance  requirements,  in  excess  of  vault  cash, maintained  by  the  Corporation  with  the  Federal  Reserve  Bank were  $3.8  billion  for  2020,  reflecting  the  Federal  Reserve's reduction of the reserve requirement to zero in the first quarter due to COVID-19, and $14.6 billion for 2019. At December 31, 2020  and  2019,  the  Corporation  had  cash  and  cash equivalents in the amount of $4.9 billion and $6.3 billion, and securities  with  a  fair  value  of  $16.8  billion  and  $14.7  billion that were segregated in compliance with securities regulations. Cash  held  on  deposit  with  the  Federal  Reserve  Bank  to  meet reserve requirements and cash and cash equivalents segregated  in  compliance  with  securities  regulations  are components of restricted cash. For more information, see Note 10  -  Federal  Funds  Sold  or  Purchased,  Securities  Financing Agreements,  Short-term  Borrowings  and  Restricted  Cash . In addition, at December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Corporation had cash deposited with clearing organizations of $10.9 billion and $7.6  billion primarily recorded  in  other  assets  on  the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n## Bank Subsidiary Distributions\n\nThe  primary  sources  of  funds  for  cash  distributions  by  the Corporation to its shareholders are capital distributions received from  its  bank  subsidiaries,  BANA  and  Bank  of  America California, N.A. In 2020, the Corporation received dividends of $10.3 billion from BANA and $62 million from Bank of America California, N.A.\n\nThe amount of dividends that a subsidiary bank may declare in a calendar year without OCC approval is the subsidiary bank's net profits for that year combined with its retained net profits for the preceding two years. Retained net profits, as defined by the OCC, consist of net income less dividends declared during the period.  In  2021,  BANA  can  declare  and  pay  dividends  of approximately $10.3 billion to the Corporation plus an additional amount equal to its retained net profits for 2021 up to the date\n\n170\n\nBank of America 2020\n\nof  any  such  dividend  declaration.  Bank  of  America  California, N.A.  can  pay  dividends  of  $198  million  in  2021  plus  an additional amount equal to its retained net profits for 2021 up to the date of any such dividend declaration.\n\n## NOTE 17 Employee Benefit Plans\n\n## Pension and Postretirement Plans\n\nThe  Corporation  sponsors  a  qualified  noncontributory  trusteed pension plan (Qualified Pension Plan), a number of noncontributory nonqualified pension plans, and postretirement health  and  life  plans  that  cover  eligible  employees.  Non-U.S. pension plans sponsored by the Corporation vary based on the country and local practices.\n\nThe Qualified Pension Plan has a balance guarantee feature for  account  balances  with  participant-selected  investments, applied  at  the  time  a  benefit  payment  is  made  from  the  plan that  effectively  provides  principal  protection  for  participant balances  transferred  and  certain  compensation  credits.  The Corporation  is  responsible  for  funding  any  shortfall  on  the guarantee feature.\n\nBenefits earned under the Qualified Pension Plan have been frozen. Thereafter, the cash balance accounts continue to earn investment  credits  or  interest  credits  in  accordance  with  the terms of the plan document.\n\nThe Corporation has an annuity contract that guarantees the payment  of  benefits  vested  under  a  terminated  U.S.  pension plan (Other Pension Plan). The Corporation, under a supplemental agreement, may be responsible for or benefit from actual  experience  and  investment  performance  of  the  annuity assets.  The  Corporation  made  no  contribution  under  this agreement in 2020 or 2019. Contributions may be required in the future under this agreement.\n\nThe  Corporation's  noncontributory,  nonqualified  pension plans are unfunded and provide supplemental defined pension benefits to certain eligible employees.\n\nIn  addition  to  retirement  pension  benefits,  certain  benefitseligible employees may become eligible to continue participation as retirees in health care and/or life insurance plans sponsored by  the  Corporation.  These  plans  are  referred  to  as  the Postretirement Health and Life Plans.\n\nThe Pension and Postretirement Plans table summarizes the changes  in  the  fair  value  of  plan  assets,  changes  in  the projected benefit obligation (PBO), the funded status of both the accumulated  benefit  obligation  (ABO)  and  the  PBO,  and  the weighted-average  assumptions  used  to  determine  benefit obligations  for  the  pension  plans  and  postretirement  plans  at December  31,  2020  and  2019.  The  estimate  of  the Corporation's  PBO  associated  with  these  plans  considers various actuarial assumptions,  including  assumptions  for mortality rates and discount rates. The discount rate assumptions are derived from a cash flow matching technique that  utilizes  rates  that  are  based  on  Aa-rated  corporate  bonds with cash flows that match estimated benefit payments of each of  the  plans.  The  decreases  in  the  weighted-average  discount rates  in  2020  and  2019  resulted  in  increases  to  the  PBO  of approximately  $1.9  billion  and  $2.2  billion  at  December  31, 2020  and  2019.  Significant  gains  and  losses  related  to changes in the PBO for 2020 and 2019 primarily resulted from changes in the discount rate.",

Net  periodic  postretirement  health  and  life  expense  was determined using the 'projected  unit  credit'  actuarial  method. For the Postretirement Health and Life Plans, 50 percent of the unrecognized  gain  or  loss  at  the  beginning  of  the  year  (or  at subsequent  remeasurement)  is  recognized  on  a  level  basis during the year.\n\nAssumed health care cost trend rates affect the postretirement  benefit  obligation  and  benefit  cost  reported  for the Postretirement Health and Life Plans. The assumed health care  cost  trend  rate  used  to  measure  the  expected  cost  of benefits covered by the Postretirement Health and Life Plans is 6.25  percent  for  2021,  reducing  in  steps  to  5.00  percent  in 2026 and later years.\n\nThe Corporation's net periodic benefit cost (income) recognized  for  the  plans  is  sensitive  to  the  discount  rate  and expected return on plan assets. For the Qualified Pension Plan, Non-U.S. Pension Plans, Nonqualified and Other Pension Plans, and  Postretirement  Health  and  Life  Plans,  a  25  bp  decline  in discount  rates  and  expected  return  on  assets  would  not  have had  a  significant  impact  on  the  net  periodic  benefit  cost  for 2020.\n\n## Pretax Amounts included in Accumulated OCI and OCI\n\n|                                                               | Qualified  Pension Plan   | Qualified  Pension Plan   | Non-U.S.  Pension Plans   | Non-U.S.  Pension Plans   | Nonqualified  and Other  Pension Plans   | Nonqualified  and Other  Pension Plans   | Postretirement  Health and  Life Plans   | Postretirement  Health and  Life Plans   | Total   | Total   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| (Dollars in millions)                                         | 2020                      | 2019                      | 2020                      | 2019                      | 2020                                     | 2019                                     | 2020                                     | 2019                                     | 2020    | 2019    |\n| Net actuarial loss (gain)                                     | $ 3,912                   | $ 3,865                   | $ 628                     | $  559                    | $ 987                                    | $ 1,008                                  | $ 66                                     | $ 48                                     | $ 5,593 | $ 5,480 |\n| Prior service cost (credits)                                  | -                         | -                         | 18                        | 18                        | -                                        | -                                        | (4)                                      | (6)                                      | 14      | 12      |\n| Amounts recognized in accumulated OCI                         | $ 3,912                   | $ 3,865                   | $ 646                     | $  577                    | $ 987                                    | $ 1,008                                  | $ 62                                     | $ 42                                     | $ 5,607 | $ 5,492 |\n| Current year actuarial loss (gain)                            | $ 219                     | $  (385)                  | $ 79                      | $  110                    | $ 29                                     | $  130                                   | $ 47                                     | $ 99                                     | $ 374   | $  (46) |\n| Amortization of actuarial gain (loss) and  prior service cost | (173)                     | (135)                     | (12)                      | (7)                       | (50)                                     | (34)                                     | (27)                                     | 26                                       | (262)   | (150)   |\n| Current year prior service cost (credit)                      | -                         | -                         | 3                         | 2                         | -                                        | -                                        | -                                        | -                                        | 3       | 2       |\n| Amounts recognized in OCI                                     | $  46                     | $ (520)                   | $ 70                      | $  105                    | $ (21)                                   | $ 96                                     | $ 20                                     | $  125                                   | $ 115   | $ (194) |\n\n172\n\nBank of America 2020",

The  Corporation's  policy  is  to  invest  the  trust assets  in  a  prudent  manner  for  the  exclusive  purpose  of providing  benefits  to  participants  and  defraying  reasonable expenses  of  administration.  The  Corporation's  investment strategy is designed to provide a total return that, over the long term,  increases  the  ratio  of  assets  to  liabilities.  The  strategy attempts to maximize the investment return on assets at a level of risk deemed appropriate by the Corporation while complying with  ERISA  and  any  applicable  regulations  and  laws.  The investment  strategy  utilizes  asset  allocation  as  a  principal determinant  for  establishing  the  risk/return  profile  of  the assets.  Asset  allocation  ranges  are  established,  periodically reviewed and adjusted as funding levels and liability characteristics change. Active and passive investment managers are employed to help enhance the risk/return profile of  the  assets.  An  additional  aspect  of  the  investment  strategy used to minimize risk (part of the asset allocation plan) includes matching  the  exposure  of  participant-selected  investment measures.\n\nThe  assets  of  the  Non-U.S.  Pension  Plans  are  primarily attributable  to  a  U.K.  pension  plan.  This  U.K.  pension  plan's assets are invested prudently so that the benefits promised to members  are  provided  with  consideration  given  to  the  nature and  the  duration  of  the  plans'  liabilities.  The  selected  asset\n\nallocation strategy is designed to achieve a higher return than the lowest risk strategy.\n\nThe expected rate of return on plan assets assumption was developed  through  analysis  of  historical  market  returns, historical asset class volatility and correlations, current market conditions, anticipated future asset allocations, the funds' past experience and expectations on potential future market returns. The expected return on plan assets assumption is determined using  the  calculated  market-related  value  for  the  Qualified Pension Plan and the Other Pension Plan and the fair value for the Non-U.S. Pension Plans and Postretirement Health and Life Plans.  The  expected  return  on  plan  assets  assumption represents a long-term average view of the performance of the assets  in  the  Qualified  Pension  Plan,  the  Non-U.S.  Pension Plans,  the  Other  Pension  Plan,  and  Postretirement  Health  and Life Plans, a return that may or may not be achieved during any one calendar year. The Other Pension Plan is invested solely in an annuity contract, which is primarily invested in fixed-income securities  structured  such  that  asset  maturities  match  the duration of the plan's obligations.\n\nThe  target  allocations  for  2021  by  asset  category  for  the Qualified Pension Plan, Non-U.S. Pension Plans, and Nonqualified  and  Other  Pension  Plans  are  presented  in  the following table. Equity securities for the Qualified Pension Plan include  common  stock  of  the  Corporation  in  the  amounts  of $274  million  (1.26  percent  of  total  plan  assets)  and  $315 million  (1.55  percent  of  total  plan  assets)  at  December  31, 2020 and 2019.\n\n## 2021 Target Allocation\n\n|                   | Percentage              | Percentage              | Percentage                             |\n|-------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Asset Category    | Qualified  Pension Plan | Non-U.S.  Pension Plans | Nonqualified  and Other  Pension Plans |\n| Equity securities | 15 - 50%                | 0 - 25%                 | 0 - 5%                                 |\n| Debt securities   | 45 - 80%                | 40 - 70%                | 95 - 100%                              |\n| Real estate       | 0 - 10%                 | 0 - 15%                 | 0 - 5%                                 |\n| Other             | 0-5%                    | 10-40%                  | 0-5%                                   |\n\n## Fair Value Measurements\n\nFor more information on fair value measurements, including descriptions of Level 1, 2 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy and the valuation methods employed by the Corporation, see Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Note 20 - Fair Value Measurements .

The Corporation recorded expense of $1.2 billion, $1.0 billion and $1.0 billion in 2020, 2019 and 2018 related to the qualified defined contribution plans. At both December  31,  2020  and  2019,  189  million  shares  of  the Corporation's  common  stock  were  held  by  these  plans. Payments  to  the  plans  for  dividends  on  common  stock  were $138 million, $133 million and $115 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n\nCertain  non-U.S.  employees  are  covered  under  defined contribution  pension  plans  that  are  separately  administered  in accordance with local laws.\n\n## NOTE 18 Stock-based Compensation Plans\n\nThe Corporation administers a number of equity compensation plans, with awards being granted predominantly from the Bank of  America  Key  Employee  Equity  Plan  (KEEP).  Under  this  plan, 600  million  shares  of  the  Corporation's  common  stock  are authorized to be used for grants of awards.\n\nDuring 2020 and 2019, the Corporation granted 86 million and  94  million  RSU  awards  to  certain  employees  under  the KEEP.  These  RSUs  were  authorized  to  settle  predominantly  in shares of common stock of the Corporation. Certain RSUs will be settled in cash or contain settlement provisions that subject these  awards  to  variable  accounting  whereby  compensation expense is adjusted to fair value based on changes in the share price of the Corporation's common stock up to the settlement date. Of the RSUs granted in 2020 and 2019, 61 million and 71  million  will  vest  predominantly  over  three  years  with  most vesting  occurring  in  one-third  increments  on  each  of  the  first three anniversaries of the grant date provided that the employee remains continuously employed with the Corporation during that time, and will be expensed ratably over the vesting period, net of  estimated  forfeitures,  for  non-retirement  eligible  employees based  on  the  grant-date  fair  value  of  the  shares.  For  RSUs granted  to  employees  who  are  retirement  eligible,  the  awards are deemed authorized as of the beginning of the year preceding the  grant  date  when  the  incentive  award  plans  are  generally approved.  As  a  result, the estimated value is expensed ratably over the year preceding the grant date. Additionally, 25 million and 23 million of the RSUs granted in 2020 and 2019 will vest predominantly  over  four  years  with  most  vesting  occurring  in one-fourth increments on each of the first four anniversaries of the grant date provided that the employee remains continuously employed  with  the  Corporation  during  that  time,  and  will  be expensed  ratably  over  the  vesting  period,  net  of  estimated forfeitures, based on the grant-date fair value of the shares.\n\nThe compensation cost for the stock-based plans was $2.1 billion, $2.1 billion and $1.8 billion, and the related income tax benefit  was  $505  million,  $511  million  and  $433  million  for\n\n2020,  2019  and  2018,  respectively.  At  December  31,  2020, there  was  an  estimated  $2.0  billion  of  total  unrecognized compensation cost related to certain share-based compensation awards that is expected to be recognized over a period of up to four years, with a weighted-average period of 2.2 years.\n\n## Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units\n\nThe total fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units vested in 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $2.3 billion, $2.6 billion and  $2.3  billion,  respectively.  The  table  below  presents  the status  at  December  31,  2020  of  the  share-settled  restricted stock and restricted stock units and changes during 2020.\n\n## Stock-settled Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units\n\n|                                  | Shares/Units   | Weighted- average Grant  Date Fair Value   |\n|----------------------------------|----------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| Outstanding at January 1, 2020   | 157,909,315    | $ 27.93                                    |\n| Granted                          | 83,604,782     | 33.01                                      |\n| Vested                           | (68,578,284)   | 27.38                                      |\n| Canceled                         | (4,982,584)    | 30.88                                      |\n| Outstanding at December 31, 2020 | 167,953,229    | 30.60                                      |\n\n## Cash-settled Restricted Units\n\nAt December 31, 2020, approximately two million cash-settled restricted units remain outstanding. In 2020, 2019 and 2018, the  amount  of  cash  paid  to  settle  the  RSUs  that  vested  was $81 million, $84 million and $1.3 billion, respectively.\n\n## NOTE 19 Income Taxes\n\nThe  components  of  income  tax  expense  for  2020,  2019  and 2018 are presented in the table below.\n\n## Income Tax Expense\n\n| (Dollars in millions)       | 2020    | 2019    | 2018    |\n|-----------------------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Current income tax expense  |         |         |         |\n| U.S. federal                | $ 1,092 | $ 1,136 | $ 816   |\n| U.S. state and local        | 1,076   | 901     | 1,377   |\n| Non-U.S.                    | 670     | 852     | 1,203   |\n| Total current expense       | 2,838   | 2,889   | 3,396   |\n| Deferred income tax expense |         |         |         |\n| U.S. federal                | (799)   | 2,001   | 2,579   |\n| U.S. state and local        | (233)   | 223     | 240     |\n| Non-U.S.                    | (705)   | 211     | 222     |\n| Total deferred expense      | (1,737) | 2,435   | 3,041   |\n| Total income tax expense    | $ 1,101 | $ 5,324 | $ 6,437 |\n\nTotal income tax expense does not reflect the tax effects of items  that  are  included  in  OCI  each  period.

The majority of the Corporation's U.K. net deferred tax assets, which consist primarily of NOLs, are expected to be realized by certain subsidiaries over an extended number of years. Management's conclusion is supported by financial results, profit forecasts for the  relevant  entities  and  the  indefinite  period  to  carry  forward NOLs.  However,  a  material  change  in  those  estimates  could lead  management  to  reassess  such  valuation  allowance conclusions.\n\nAt  December 31, 2020, U.S. federal income taxes had not been  provided  on  approximately  $5.0  billion  of  temporary\n\ndifferences associated with investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries  that  are  essentially  permanent  in  duration.  If  the Corporation were to record the associated deferred tax liability, the amount would be approximately $1.0 billion.\n\n## NOTE 20 Fair Value Measurements\n\nUnder applicable accounting standards, fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to  transfer  a  liability  (an  exit  price)  in  the  principal  or  most advantageous  market  for  the  asset  or  liability  in  an  orderly transaction  between  market  participants  on  the  measurement date. The Corporation determines the fair values of its financial instruments under applicable accounting standards that require an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The Corporation categorizes its financial instruments into three levels based on the established fair value hierarchy and conducts a review of fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis. Transfers into or out of fair value hierarchy classifications are made if the significant inputs used  in  the  financial  models  measuring  the  fair  values  of  the assets and liabilities become unobservable or observable in the current  marketplace.  For  more  information  regarding  the  fair value  hierarchy  and  how  the  Corporation  measures  fair  value, see Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Principles . The Corporation accounts for certain financial instruments under the fair value option. For more information, see Note 21 - Fair Value Option .\n\n## Valuation Techniques\n\nThe  following  sections  outline  the  valuation  methodologies  for the  Corporation's  assets  and  liabilities.  While  the  Corporation believes  its  valuation  methods  are  appropriate  and  consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies  or  assumptions  to  determine  the  fair  value  of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date.\n\nDuring 2020, there were no significant changes to valuation approaches or techniques that had, or are expected to have, a material  impact  on  the  Corporation's  consolidated  financial position or results of operations.\n\n## Trading Account Assets and Liabilities and Debt Securities\n\nThe  fair  values  of  trading  account  assets  and  liabilities  are\n\nprimarily  based  on  actively  traded  markets  where  prices  are based on either direct market quotes or observed transactions. The fair values of debt securities are generally based on quoted market prices or market prices for similar assets. Liquidity is a significant  factor  in  the  determination  of  the  fair  values  of trading  account  assets  and  liabilities  and  debt  securities. Market  price  quotes  may  not  be  readily  available  for  some positions  such  as  positions  within  a  market  sector  where trading  activity  has  slowed  significantly  or  ceased.  Some  of these  instruments  are  valued  using  a  discounted  cash  flow model,  which  estimates  the  fair  value  of  the  securities  using internal  credit  risk,  and  interest  rate  and  prepayment  risk models that incorporate management's best estimate of current key  assumptions  such  as  default  rates,  loss  severity  and prepayment  rates.  Principal  and  interest  cash  flows  are discounted  using  an  observable  discount  rate  for  similar instruments  with  adjustments  that  management  believes  a market participant would consider in determining fair value for the specific security. Other instruments are valued using a net asset  value  approach  which  considers  the  value  of  the underlying  securities.  Underlying  assets  are  valued  using external  pricing  services,  where  available,  or  matrix  pricing\n\nBank of America 2020\n\n177",

        "page_content": "based  on  the  vintages  and  ratings.  Situations  of  illiquidity generally  are  triggered  by  the  market's  perception  of  credit uncertainty  regarding  a  single  company  or  a  specific  market sector.  In  these  instances,  fair  value  is  determined  based  on limited available market information and other factors, principally from reviewing the issuer's financial statements and changes in credit ratings made by one or more rating agencies.\n\n## Derivative Assets and Liabilities\n\nThe fair values of derivative assets and liabilities traded in the OTC  market  are  determined  using  quantitative  models  that utilize multiple market inputs including interest rates, prices and indices  to  generate  continuous  yield  or  pricing  curves  and volatility  factors  to  value  the  position.  The  majority  of  market inputs are actively quoted and can be validated through external sources, including brokers, market transactions and third-party pricing services. When third-party pricing services are used, the methods  and  assumptions  are  reviewed  by  the  Corporation. Estimation  risk  is  greater  for  derivative  asset  and  liability positions  that  are  either  option-based  or  have  longer  maturity dates where observable market inputs are less readily available, or are unobservable, in which case, quantitative-based extrapolations  of  rate,  price  or  index  scenarios  are  used  in determining fair values. The fair values of derivative assets and liabilities  include  adjustments for market liquidity, counterparty credit  quality  and  other  instrument-specific  factors,  where appropriate. In addition, the Corporation incorporates within its fair value  measurements  of  OTC  derivatives  a  valuation adjustment  to  reflect  the  credit  risk  associated  with  the  net position. Positions are netted by counterparty, and fair value for net long exposures is adjusted for counterparty credit risk while the  fair  value  for  net  short  exposures  is  adjusted  for  the Corporation's own credit risk. The Corporation also incorporates FVA within its fair value measurements to include funding costs on  uncollateralized  derivatives  and  derivatives  where  the Corporation is not permitted to use the collateral it receives. An estimate of severity of loss is also used in the determination of fair value, primarily based on market data.\n\n## Loans and Loan Commitments\n\nThe  fair  values  of  loans  and  loan  commitments  are  based  on market  prices,  where  available,  or  discounted  cash  flow analyses using market-based credit spreads of comparable debt instruments  or  credit  derivatives  of  the  specific  borrower  or comparable  borrowers.  Results  of  discounted  cash  flow analyses  may  be  adjusted,  as  appropriate,  to  reflect  other market conditions or the perceived credit risk of the borrower.\n\n## Mortgage Servicing Rights\n\nThe  fair  values  of  MSRs  are  primarily  determined  using  an option-adjusted  spread  valuation  approach,  which  factors  in prepayment  risk  to  determine  the  fair  value  of  MSRs.  This approach  consists  of  projecting  servicing  cash  flows  under multiple  interest  rate  scenarios  and  discounting  these  cash flows using risk-adjusted discount rates.\n\n178\n\nBank of America 2020\n\n## Loans Held-for-sale\n\nThe  fair  values  of  LHFS  are  based  on  quoted  market  prices, where  available,  or  are  determined  by  discounting  estimated cash flows using interest rates approximating the Corporation's current origination rates for similar loans adjusted to reflect the inherent credit risk. The  borrower-specific  credit  risk  is embedded  within  the  quoted  market  prices  or  is  implied  by considering loan performance when selecting comparables.\n\n## Short-term Borrowings and Long-term Debt\n\nThe Corporation issues structured liabilities that have coupons or repayment terms linked to the performance of debt or equity securities,  interest  rates,  indices,  currencies  or  commodities. The fair values of these structured liabilities are estimated using quantitative  models  for  the  combined  derivative  and  debt portions  of  the  notes.  These  models  incorporate  observable and, in some instances, unobservable inputs including security prices,  interest  rate  yield  curves,  option  volatility,  currency, commodity or equity rates and correlations among these inputs. The  Corporation  also  considers  the  impact  of  its  own  credit spread  in  determining  the  discount  rate  used  to  value  these liabilities.  The  credit  spread  is  determined  by  reference  to observable spreads in the secondary bond market.\n\n## Securities Financing Agreements\n\nThe  fair  values  of  certain  reverse  repurchase  agreements, repurchase  agreements  and  securities  borrowed  transactions are determined using quantitative models, including discounted cash flow models that require the use of multiple market inputs including  interest  rates  and  spreads  to  generate  continuous yield  or  pricing  curves,  and  volatility  factors.  The  majority  of market inputs are actively quoted and can be validated through external  sources,  including  brokers,  market  transactions  and third-party pricing services.\n\n## Deposits\n\nThe  fair  values  of  deposits  are  determined  using  quantitative models, including discounted cash flow models that require the use  of  multiple  market  inputs  including  interest  rates  and spreads  to  generate  continuous  yield  or  pricing  curves,  and volatility  factors.  The  majority  of  market  inputs  are  actively quoted and can be validated through external sources, including brokers,  market  transactions  and  third-party  pricing  services. The Corporation considers the impact of its own credit spread in the valuation of these liabilities. The credit risk is determined by reference  to  observable  credit  spreads  in  the  secondary  cash market.\n\n## Asset-backed Secured Financings\n\nThe fair values of asset-backed secured financings are based on external  broker  bids,  where  available,  or  are  determined  by discounting estimated cash flows using interest rates approximating  the  Corporation's  current  origination  rates  for similar loans adjusted to reflect the inherent credit risk.",

Transfers into Level 3  occur  primarily  due  to  decreased  price  observability,  and\n\ntransfers out of Level 3 occur primarily due to increased price observability.  Transfers  occur  on  a  regular  basis  for  long-term debt instruments due to changes in the impact of unobservable inputs on the value of the embedded derivative in relation to the instrument as a whole.\n\n## Level 3 -

        "page_content": "In  the  previous  tables,  instruments  backed  by  residential and commercial real estate assets include RMBS, commercial MBS, whole loans and mortgage CDOs. Commercial loans, debt securities  and  other  include  corporate  CLOs  and  CDOs, commercial loans and bonds, and securities backed by non-real estate  assets.  Structured  liabilities  primarily  include  equitylinked notes that are accounted for under the fair value option.\n\nThe Corporation uses multiple market approaches in valuing certain of its Level 3 financial instruments. For example, market comparables and discounted cash flows are used together. For a  given  product,  such  as  corporate  debt  securities,  market comparables  may  be  used  to  estimate  some  of  the unobservable inputs and then these inputs are incorporated into a  discounted  cash  flow  model.  Therefore,  the  balances disclosed encompass both of these techniques.\n\nThe  level  of  aggregation  and  diversity  within  the  products disclosed in the tables result in certain ranges of inputs being wide  and  unevenly  distributed  across  asset  and  liability categories.\n\n## Uncertainty of Fair Value Measurements from Unobservable Inputs\n\n## Loans and Securities\n\nA  significant  increase  in  market  yields,  default  rates,  loss severities or duration would have resulted in a significantly lower fair  value  for  long  positions.  Short  positions  would  have  been impacted in a directionally opposite way. The impact of changes in prepayment speeds would have resulted in differing impacts depending on the seniority of the instrument and, in the case of CLOs,  whether  prepayments  can  be  reinvested.  A  significant increase  in  price  would  have  resulted  in  a  significantly  higher fair  value  for  long  positions,  and  short  positions  would  have been impacted in a directionally opposite way.\n\n## Structured Liabilities and Derivatives\n\nFor  credit  derivatives,  a  significant  increase  in  market  yield, upfront  points  (i.e.,  a  single  upfront payment  made  by  a\n\nprotection  buyer  at  inception),  credit  spreads,  default  rates  or loss severities would have resulted in a significantly lower fair value for  protection  sellers  and  higher  fair  value  for  protection buyers.  The  impact  of  changes  in  prepayment  speeds  would have resulted in differing impacts depending on the seniority of the instrument.\n\nStructured credit derivatives are impacted by credit correlation. Default correlation is a parameter that describes the degree of dependence among credit default rates within a credit portfolio  that  underlies  a  credit  derivative  instrument.  The sensitivity of this input on the fair value varies depending on the level  of  subordination  of  the  tranche.  For  senior  tranches  that are net purchases of protection, a significant increase in default correlation  would  have  resulted  in  a  significantly  higher  fair value. Net short protection positions would have been impacted in a directionally opposite way.\n\nFor  equity  derivatives,  commodity  derivatives,  interest  rate derivatives  and  structured  liabilities,  a  significant  change  in long-dated rates and volatilities and correlation inputs (i.e., the degree of correlation between an equity security and an index, between  two  different  commodities,  between  two  different interest  rates,  or  between  interest  rates  and  foreign  exchange rates)  would  have  resulted  in  a  significant  impact  to  the  fair value;  however,  the  magnitude  and  direction  of  the  impact depend  on  whether  the  Corporation  is  long  or  short  the exposure. For structured liabilities, a significant increase in yield or decrease in price would have resulted in a significantly lower fair value.\n\n## Nonrecurring Fair Value\n\nThe Corporation holds certain assets that are measured at fair value  only  in  certain  situations  (e.g.,  the  impairment  of  an asset),  and  these  measurements  are  referred  to  herein  as nonrecurring. The amounts below represent assets still held as of  the  reporting  date  for  which  a  nonrecurring  fair  value adjustment was recorded during 2020, 2019 and 2018.\n\n## Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis\n\n|                               | December 31, 2020   | December 31, 2020   | December 31, 2019   | December 31, 2019   |\n|-------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| (Dollars in millions)         | Level 2             | Level 3             | Level 2             | Level 3             |\n| Assets                        |                     |                     |                     |                     |\n| Loans held-for-sale           | $ 1,020             | $ 792               | $ 53                | $ 102               |\n| Loans and leases  (1)         | -                   | 301                 | -                   | 257                 |\n| Foreclosed properties  (2, 3) | -                   | 17                  | -                   | 17                  |\n| Other assets                  | 323                 | 576                 | 178                 | 646                 |\n\n|                       | Gains (Losses)   | Gains (Losses)   | Gains (Losses)   |\n|-----------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n|                       | 2020             | 2019             | 2018             |\n| Assets                |                  |                  |                  |\n| Loans held-for-sale   | $ (79)           | $ (14)           | $ (18)           |\n| Loans and leases  (1) | (73)             | (81)             | (202)            |\n| Foreclosed properties | (6)              | (9)              | (24)             |\n| Other assets          | (98)             | (2,145)          | (64)             |\n\nBank of America 2020\n\n185",

Lending commitments are actively managed and, as appropriate,  credit  risk  for  these  lending  relationships  may  be mitigated  through  the  use  of  credit  derivatives,  with  the Corporation's  public  side  credit  view  and  market  perspectives determining  the  size  and  timing  of  the  hedging  activity.  These credit derivatives do not meet the requirements for designation as  accounting  hedges  and  therefore  are  carried  at  fair  value. The fair value option allows the Corporation to carry these loans and loan commitments at fair value, which is more consistent with  management's  view  of  the  underlying  economics  and  the manner in which they are managed. In addition, the fair value option allows the Corporation to reduce the accounting volatility that  would  otherwise  result  from  the  asymmetry  created  by accounting  for  the  financial  instruments  at  historical  cost  and the credit derivatives at fair value.\n\n## Loans Held-for-sale\n\nThe  Corporation  elects  to  account  for  residential  mortgage LHFS, commercial mortgage LHFS and certain other LHFS under the  fair  value  option.  These  loans  are  actively  managed  and monitored and, as appropriate, certain market risks of the loans may  be  mitigated  through  the  use  of  derivatives.  The Corporation  has  elected  not  to  designate  the  derivatives  as qualifying accounting hedges, and therefore, they are carried at fair  value.  The  changes  in  fair  value  of  the loans are largely\n\n186\n\nBank of America 2020\n\noffset  by  changes  in  the  fair  value  of  the  derivatives.  The  fair value  option  allows  the  Corporation  to  reduce  the  accounting volatility that would otherwise result from the asymmetry created by accounting for the financial instruments at the lower of cost or  fair  value  and  the  derivatives  at  fair  value.  The  Corporation has not elected to account for certain other LHFS under the fair value  option  primarily  because  these  loans  are  floating-rate loans that are not hedged using derivative instruments.\n\n## Loans Reported as Trading Account Assets\n\nThe Corporation elects to account for certain loans that are held for the purpose of trading and are risk-managed on a fair value basis under the fair value option.\n\n## Other Assets\n\nThe Corporation elects to account for certain long-term fixed-rate margin  loans  that  are  hedged  with  derivatives  under  the  fair value  option.  Election  of  the  fair  value  option  allows  the Corporation  to  reduce  the  accounting  volatility  that  would otherwise result from the asymmetry created by accounting for the financial instruments at historical cost and the derivatives at fair value.\n\n## Securities Financing Agreements\n\nThe  Corporation  elects  to  account  for  certain  securities financing agreements, including resale and repurchase agreements, under the fair value option. These elections include certain  agreements  collateralized  by  the  U.S.  government  and its agencies, which are generally short-dated and have minimal interest rate risk.",

Election of the fair value option allows  the  Corporation  to  reduce  the  accounting  volatility  that would  otherwise  result  from  the  asymmetry  created  by accounting  for  the  financial  instruments  at  historical  cost  and the derivatives at fair value. The Corporation has not elected to carry other long-term deposits at fair value because they are not hedged using derivatives.\n\n## Short-term Borrowings\n\nThe  Corporation  elects  to  account  for  certain  short-term borrowings, primarily short-term structured liabilities, under the fair  value  option  because  this  debt  is  risk-managed  on  a  fair value basis.\n\nThe  Corporation  elects  to  account  for  certain  asset-backed secured  financings,  which  are  also  classified  in  short-term borrowings, under the fair value option. Election of the fair value option allows the Corporation to reduce the accounting volatility\n\nthat  would  otherwise  result  from  the  asymmetry  created  by accounting for the asset-backed secured financings at historical cost  and  the  corresponding  mortgage  LHFS  securing  these financings at fair value.\n\n## Long-term Debt\n\nThe  Corporation  elects  to  account  for  certain  long-term  debt, primarily  structured  liabilities,  under  the  fair  value  option.  This long-term  debt  is  either  risk-managed  on  a  fair  value  basis  or the related hedges do not qualify for hedge accounting.\n\n## Fair Value Option Elections\n\nThe  following  tables  provide  information  about  the  fair  value carrying  amount  and  the  contractual  principal  outstanding  of assets and liabilities accounted for under the fair value option at December 31, 2020 and 2019, and information about where changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities accounted for under  the  fair  value  option  are  included  in  the  Consolidated Statement of Income for 2020, 2019 and 2018.\n\n## Fair Value Option Elections\n\nDecember 31, 2020\n\nDecember 31, 2019\n\n| (Dollars in millions)                                                                 | Fair Value  Carrying  Amount   | Contractual  Principal  Outstanding   | Fair Value  Carrying Amount  Less Unpaid  Principal   | Fair Value  Carrying  Amount   | Contractual  Principal  Outstanding   | Fair Value  Carrying  Amount Less  Unpaid Principal   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|\n| Federal funds sold and securities borrowed or  purchased under agreements to resell   | $ 108,856                      | $ 108,811                             | $ 45                                                  | $ 50,364                       | $ 50,318                              | $ 46                                                  |\n| Loans reported as trading account assets  (1)                                         | 7,967                          | 17,372                                | (9,405)                                               | 6,989                          | 14,703                                | (7,714)                                               |\n| Trading inventory -

Certain  loans,  deposits,  long-term  debt, unfunded lending commitments and other financial instruments are  accounted  for  under  the  fair  value  option.  For  more information,  see Note  21  -  Fair  Value  Option. The  following disclosures include financial instruments that are not carried at fair  value  or  only  a  portion  of  the  ending  balance  is  carried  at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n## Short-term Financial Instruments\n\nThe carrying value of short-term financial instruments, including cash  and  cash  equivalents,  certain  time  deposits  placed  and other short-term investments, federal funds sold and purchased,\n\n188\n\nBank of America 2020\n\ncertain  resale  and  repurchase  agreements  and  short-term borrowings,  approximates  the  fair  value  of  these  instruments. These financial instruments generally expose the Corporation to limited credit risk and have no stated maturities or have shortterm  maturities  and  carry  interest  rates  that  approximate market.  The  Corporation  accounts  for  certain  resale  and repurchase agreements under the fair value option.\n\nUnder  the  fair  value  hierarchy,  cash  and  cash  equivalents are classified as Level 1. Time deposits placed and other shortterm  investments,  such  as  U.S.  government  securities  and short-term commercial paper, are classified as Level 1 or Level 2. Federal funds sold and purchased are classified as Level 2. Resale  and  repurchase  agreements  are  classified  as  Level  2 because  they  are  generally  short-dated  and/or  variable-rate instruments  collateralized  by  U.S.  government  or  agency securities. Short-term borrowings are classified as Level 2.",

Consumer  Banking product offerings include traditional  savings  accounts,  money  market  savings  accounts, CDs and IRAs, checking accounts, and investment accounts and products,  as  well  as  credit  and  debit  cards,  residential mortgages and home equity loans, and direct and indirect loans to  consumers  and  small  businesses  in  the  U.S. Consumer Banking includes the impact of servicing residential mortgages and home equity loans in the core portfolio.\n\n## Global Wealth & Investment Management\n\nGWIM provides a high-touch client experience through a network of financial advisors focused on clients with over $250,000 in total  investable  assets,  including  tailored  solutions  to  meet clients'  needs  through  a  full  set  of  investment  management, brokerage,  banking  and  retirement  products. GWIM also provides comprehensive wealth management solutions targeted to  high  net  worth  and  ultra  high  net  worth  clients,  as  well  as customized  solutions  to  meet  clients'  wealth  structuring, investment  management,  trust  and  banking  needs,  including specialty asset management services.\n\n## Global Banking\n\nGlobal Banking provides a wide range of lending-related products and  services,  integrated  working  capital  management  and treasury  solutions,  and  underwriting  and  advisory  services through  the  Corporation's  network  of  offices  and  client relationship  teams. Global  Banking also  provides  investment banking  products  to  clients. The  economics  of  certain investment  banking  and  underwriting  activities  are  shared primarily between Global Banking and Global Markets under an internal  revenue-sharing  arrangement. Global  Banking clients generally  include  middle-market  companies,  commercial  real estate firms, not-for-profit companies, large global corporations, financial  institutions,  leasing  clients,  and  mid-sized  U.S.-based businesses requiring customized and integrated financial advice and solutions.\n\n## Global Markets\n\nGlobal  Markets offers  sales  and  trading  services  and  research services  to  institutional  clients  across  fixed-income,  credit, currency,  commodity  and  equity  businesses. Global  Markets provides market-making, financing, securities clearing, settlement and custody services globally to institutional investor clients in support of their investing and trading activities. Global Markets product  coverage  includes  securities  and  derivative products  in  both  the  primary  and  secondary  markets. Global Markets also  works  with  commercial  and  corporate  clients  to provide  risk  management  products.  As  a  result  of  marketmaking  activities, Global  Markets may  be  required  to  manage risk  in  a  broad  range  of  financial  products.  In  addition,  the economics  of  certain  investment  banking  and  underwriting activities  are  shared  primarily  between Global  Markets and Global Banking under an internal revenue-sharing arrangement.\n\n## All Other\n\nAll  Other consists  of  ALM  activities,  equity  investments,  noncore mortgage  loans  and  servicing  activities,  liquidating businesses  and  certain  expenses  not  otherwise  allocated  to business segments. ALM activities encompass certain residential mortgages, debt securities, interest rate and foreign currency  risk  management  activities.  Substantially  all  of  the results  of  ALM  activities  are  allocated  to  the  business segments.\n\n## Basis of Presentation\n\nThe  management  accounting  and  reporting  process  derives segment and business results by utilizing allocation methodologies  for  revenue  and  expense.  The  net  income derived for the businesses is dependent upon revenue and cost allocations using an activity-based costing model, funds transfer pricing, and other methodologies and assumptions management believes are appropriate to reflect the results of the business.\n\nTotal revenue, net of interest expense, includes net interest income  on  an  FTE  basis  and  noninterest  income.  The adjustment of net interest income to an FTE basis results in a corresponding  increase  in  income  tax  expense.  The  segment results also reflect certain revenue and expense methodologies that  are  utilized  to  determine  net  income.  The  net  interest income  of  the  businesses  includes  the  results  of  a  funds transfer pricing process that matches assets and liabilities with similar  interest  rate  sensitivity  and  maturity  characteristics.  In segments  where  the  total  of  liabilities  and  equity  exceeds assets,  which  are  generally  deposit-taking  segments,  the Corporation  allocates  assets  to  match  liabilities.  Net  interest income of the business segments also includes an allocation of\n\nBank of America 2020\n\n189",

The Corporation's goal is to manage interest rate sensitivity so  that  movements  in  interest  rates  do  not significantly adversely affect earnings and capital. The results of substantially all of the Corporation's ALM activities are allocated to the  business  segments  and  fluctuate  based  on  the performance  of  the  ALM  activities.

The  non-U.S. business activities are largely conducted in Europe, the Middle East  and  Africa  and  in  Asia.  The  Corporation  identifies  its geographic  performance  based  on  the  business  unit  structure used to manage the capital or expense deployed in the region\n\nas  applicable.  This  requires  certain  judgments  related  to  the allocation  of  revenue  so  that  revenue  can  be  appropriately matched  with  the  related  capital  or  expense  deployed  in  the region.  Certain  asset,  liability,  income  and  expense  amounts have been allocated to arrive at total assets, total revenue, net of  interest  expense,  income  before  income  taxes  and  net income by geographic area as presented below.\n\n| (Dollars in millions)  (3)      |      | Total Assets at  Year End (1)   | Total Revenue,  Net of Interest  Expense (2)   | Income Before  Income Taxes   | Net Income   |\n|---------------------------------|------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------|\n| U.S.                            | 2020 | $  2,490,247                    | $ 75,576                                       | $ 18,247                      | $ 16,692     |\n|                                 | 2019 | 2,122,734                       | 81,236                                         | 30,699                        | 25,937       |\n|                                 | 2018 |                                 | 80,777                                         | 31,904                        | 26,407       |\n| Asia                            | 2020 | 99,283                          | 4,232                                          | 1,051                         | 788          |\n|                                 | 2019 | 102,440                         | 3,491                                          | 765                           | 570          |\n|                                 | 2018 |                                 | 3,507                                          | 865                           | 520          |\n| Europe, Middle East and Africa  | 2020 | 202,701                         | 4,491                                          | (596)                         | 264          |\n|                                 | 2019 | 178,889                         | 5,310                                          | 921                           | 672          |\n|                                 | 2018 |                                 | 5,632                                          | 1,543                         | 1,126        |\n| Latin America and the Caribbean | 2020 | 27,396                          | 1,229                                          | 293                           | 150          |\n|                                 | 2019 | 30,016                          | 1,207                                          | 369                           | 251          |\n|                                 | 2018 |                                 | 1,104                                          | 272                           | 94           |\n| Total Non-U.S.                  | 2020 | 329,380                         | 9,952                                          | 748                           | 1,202        |\n|                                 | 2019 | 311,345                         | 10,008                                         | 2,055                         | 1,493        |\n|                                 | 2018 |                                 | 10,243                                         | 2,680                         | 1,740        |\n| Total Consolidated              | 2020 | $  2,819,627                    | $ 85,528                                       | $ 18,995                      | $ 17,894     |\n|                                 | 2019 | 2,434,079                       | 91,244                                         | 32,754                        | 27,430       |\n|                                 | 2018 |                                 | 91,020                                         | 34,584                        | 28,147       |\n\n- (1) Total assets include long-lived assets, which are primarily located in the U.S.\n- (2) There were no material intercompany revenues between geographic regions for any of the periods presented.\n- (3) Substantially reflects the U.S.\n\n194\n\nBank of America 2020",

        "page_content": "## Glossary\n\nAlt-A  Mortgage -  A  type  of  U.S.  mortgage  that  is  considered riskier than A-paper, or 'prime,' and less risky than 'subprime,' the riskiest category. Typically, Alt-A mortgages are characterized  by  borrowers  with  less  than  full  documentation, lower credit scores and higher LTVs.\n\nAssets  Under  Management  (AUM) -  The  total  market  value  of assets under the investment advisory and/or discretion of GWIM which generate asset management fees based on a percentage of  the  assets'  market  values.  AUM  reflects  assets  that  are generally  managed  for  institutional,  high  net  worth  and  retail clients, and are distributed through various investment products including mutual funds, other commingled vehicles and separate accounts.\n\nBanking  Book -  All onand  off-balance  sheet  financial instruments of the Corporation except for those positions that are held for trading purposes.\n\nBrokerage  and  Other  Assets -  Non-discretionary  client  assets which are held in brokerage accounts or held for safekeeping.\n\nCommitted Credit Exposure - Any funded portion of a facility plus the unfunded portion of a facility on which the lender is legally bound  to  advance  funds  during  a  specified  period  under prescribed conditions.\n\nCredit Derivatives -Contractual  agreements  that  provide protection  against  a  specified  credit  event  on  one  or  more referenced obligations.\n\nCredit  Valuation  Adjustment  (CVA) - A portfolio adjustment required to properly reflect the counterparty credit risk exposure as part of the fair value of derivative instruments.\n\nDebit  Valuation  Adjustment  (DVA) -  A  portfolio  adjustment required  to  properly  reflect  the  Corporation's  own  credit  risk exposure as part of the fair value of derivative instruments and/ or structured liabilities.\n\nFunding  Valuation  Adjustment  (FVA) -  A  portfolio  adjustment required to include funding costs on uncollateralized derivatives and derivatives  where  the  Corporation  is  not  permitted  to  use the collateral it receives.\n\nInterest  Rate  Lock  Commitment  (IRLC) - Commitment with a loan  applicant  in  which  the  loan  terms  are  guaranteed  for  a designated period of time subject to credit approval.\n\nLetter of Credit - A document issued on behalf of a customer to a third party promising to pay the third party upon presentation of specified documents. A letter of credit effectively substitutes the issuer's credit for that of the customer.\n\nLoan-to-value (LTV) - A commonly used credit quality metric. LTV is  calculated  as  the  outstanding  carrying  value  of  the  loan divided by the estimated value of the property securing the loan.\n\nMargin Receivable -An extension of credit secured by eligible securities in certain brokerage accounts.\n\nMatched  Book -  Repurchase  and  resale  agreements  or securities  borrowed  and  loaned  transactions  where  the  overall asset  and  liability  position  is  similar  in  size  and/or  maturity. Generally,  these  are  entered  into  to  accommodate  customers where the Corporation earns the interest rate spread.\n\nMortgage  Servicing  Rights  (MSR) - The  right to service a mortgage loan when the underlying loan is sold or securitized. Servicing includes collections for principal, interest and escrow payments  from  borrowers  and  accounting  for  and  remitting principal and interest payments to investors.\n\nNonperforming Loans and Leases -  Includes  loans  and  leases that have  been  placed  on  nonaccrual  status,  including nonaccruing loans whose  contractual terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties.\n\nPrompt Corrective Action (PCA) - A framework established by the U.S.  banking  regulators  requiring  banks  to  maintain  certain levels  of  regulatory  capital  ratios,  comprised  of  five  categories of  capitalization:  'well  capitalized,'  'adequately  capitalized,' 'undercapitalized,' 'significantly undercapitalized' and 'critically undercapitalized.' Insured depository institutions that fail  to  meet  certain  of  these  capital  levels  are  subject  to increasingly strict limits on their activities, including their ability to  make  capital  distributions,  pay  management  compensation, grow assets and take other actions.\n\nSubprime  Loans -  Although  a  standard  industry  definition  for subprime  loans  (including  subprime  mortgage  loans)  does  not exist,  the  Corporation  defines  subprime  loans  as  specific product offerings for higher risk borrowers.\n\nTroubled Debt Restructurings (TDRs) - Loans whose contractual terms  have  been  restructured  in  a  manner  that  grants  a concession  to  a  borrower  experiencing  financial  difficulties. Certain consumer loans for which a binding offer to restructure has been extended are also classified as TDRs.\n\nValue-at-Risk (VaR) - VaR is a model that simulates the value of a  portfolio  under  a  range  of  hypothetical  scenarios  in  order  to generate  a  distribution  of  potential  gains  and  losses.  VaR represents the loss the portfolio is expected to experience with a given confidence level based on historical data. A VaR model is an effective tool in estimating ranges of potential gains and losses on our trading portfolios.\n\nBank of America 2020\n\n195",
