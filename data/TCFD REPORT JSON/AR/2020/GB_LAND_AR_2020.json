        "page_content": "## Responding to the present, planning for the future\n\nThe past year brought unprecedented challenges for everyone. In response, we focused on two clear outcomes. The /first was to do everything we could to ensure Landsec emerged from Covid-19 in as strong a position as possible.\n\nThe second was to re-examine the purpose, strategy and culture that will position us to achieve growth and make the most of Landsec's undoubted potential. Here we describe what we did in these two areas of focus.\n\nA global pandemic may not seem the best time to reconsider strategy, but Covid-19 has accelerated trends in retail and o/ffices that otherwise may have taken many years to play out. We have formed a strategy that responds to these trends, and we have already started to implement it.\n\nBut while we planned for the future at Landsec, we also focused on the present challenges of Covid-19. Our response for our customers was rapid, /flexible and always with safety at its heart. Inevitably, the impact on our customers and our business was still signi/ficant. Our like-for-like net rental income was down 30.4% and revenue pro/fit was 39.4% lower at \u00a3251m. However, the action we have taken means our business remains healthy, we have retained strong relationships with our customers, and have a clear strategy for growth.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## OUR PEOPLE\n\nThe health and wellbeing of our people remains our priority. Communication is crucial, so we established a business resilience team to guide our people during the year, with regular updates on how our o/ffices and assets would operate, mental health and wellbeing support, additional advice for line managers to help them support their teams, and resource planning to ensure everyone could take their holidays and not miss out on vital family time. Throughout the pandemic, our recruitment remained focused on maintaining an inclusive workplace.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## OUR COMMUNITIES\n\nWe continued with our community employment and education programmes throughout the last year. In addition, we gave grants totalling \u00a3500,000 to our\n\nexisting charity partners who were most in need.\n\nOur directors waived 20% of their base salaries or fees for three months of the year, and we used this money to supplement these grants.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## OUR PARTNERS\n\nOur on-site developments are controlled and operated by our contractors. We remained in constant communication with them throughout the year, to ensure our developments could progress while maintaining the safety of their people. We provided /financial help too, paying \u00a30.9m in topped-up furlough funds to service partners to allow them to pay 100% of wages.\n\n## OUR RESPONSE TO COVID/hyphen.case19\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## OUR CUSTOMERS\n\nWe were in regular contact with our customers to support them through the pandemic. We provided information packs and advice on how to establish safe working environments, and we explained what we would do to ensure our assets were Covid-secure. At each phase of lockdown and subsequent easing of restrictions, we worked with our customers to help them respond and operate in a safe and e/ffective way.\n\nIn early April 2020, we established a customer support fund of \u00a380m for occupiers who most needed our help to survive. To date, we have agreed \u00a342m of rent concessions for customers. In other cases, we allowed some customers to pay their rent monthly to help with cash /flow, or deferred payment to a later date.",

By working towards these priorities, we will position Landsec for growth.\n\n## \u2026AND HAVE THE RIGHT TEAM AND CULTURE IN PLACE\n\nCulture is as important as strategy - after all, it is our people who will pursue the strategy and our culture that will enable them to do so. We/uni00A0have engaged with our people to create a culture that/uni00A0is authentic, supportive and built on empowerment and/uni00A0accountability.\n\nOrganisational structure is also important. We have created a leaner, more agile organisation with a /flatter structure; one which promotes cross-functional team work, collaboration and innovation. And we have established an Executive Leadership Team (ELT) to oversee the execution of our strategy.\n\nRead more about\n\nthe/uni00A0ELT on pages 88-89",

In a year when a single virus created global disruption, the vulnerability of our planet and the important role we all play in protecting it, became all too clear. It also brought home to us the inequalities in society, with the vulnerable and low-paid su/ffering disproportionately, and therefore how important our role is in connecting communities. We are proud of our record on ESG and always strive to act in an ethical and sustainable way. But it is more than ethics - businesses that integrate sustainability into the way they behave, and the way they connect with their customers, partners and the communities where they operate, will have a 'sustainable', long-term future and, ultimately, will outperform.\n\nWe continue to be a leader in ESG within Europe and globally. We were the /first commercial real estate company in the world to have a carbon emission target approved by the Science Based Targets initiative and, in 2019, we set ourselves ambitious targets in line with limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C - a demanding but essential task.\n\nThis year, in addition to the /financial support we have given to our charity partners, we've continued many of our employment and education programmes virtually. And we continue to engage with our communities, providing help and volunteering on issues including mental health, youth education, employability skills for prison leavers and support for people su/ffering domestic abuse. In all, we have created \u00a36.5m of social value this year.\n\nWe have also made sure we have supported our people, not only in relation to the challenges posed by Covid-19, but with training and our approach to diversity and inclusion (D&I). We have developed our /first D&I strategy. We recognise we still have more to do in this area, but we are committed to being an inclusive employer.\n\nRead more on pages 56-63\n\n## LEADER\n\nin ESG within Europe and globally.\n\n## BENCHMARK\n\n## LATEST PERFORMANCE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| GRESB 2020 \u203a Real Estate Sector leader - 5 star rated  entity and Regional Listed Sector Leader  for Europe within Diversi/fied - O/ffice/Retail  (score 85%) \u203a Global Listed Development Sector Leader  for O/ffice (score 94%)   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| CDP 2020 \u203a A-list (top 2.8%) for the fourth consecutive year \u203a Inclusion on the 2020 Supplier Engagement  Leaderboard (top 7%) DJSI 2020 \u203a Score 85/top 99 th  percentile \u203a                                                        |\n| 4 th /uni00A0globally \u203a Silver Class distinction in the S&P Global  Sustainability Awards WDI Awards \u203a WDI Award winner   (most complete overall response)  \u203a Contingent Workforce Data Award winner \u203a                             |\n\nThe pandemic has further raised the importance of wellbeing and sustainability in our assets.

Starting with The Forge, all our future developments will be net zero carbon. And to show our commitment to healthy o/ffice environments, we aim to achieve a WELL portfolio rating across our entire London o/ffice portfolio.\n\nDuring 2020, we published our net zero carbon pathway and participated in a number of net zero initiatives and consultations.\n\nOur drive and commitment to ESG will ensure our portfolio meets the needs of today's customers while satisfying increasingly demanding environmental standards over time. To us, this is simply the right way to run our business.\n\nIt means providing the right space and environments for our customers, communities and employees; maintaining the long-term sustainability of our business; achieving above-market returns; and contributing to managing the long-term health of the planet.",

The Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in tragic loss of life, and caused widespread economic and social disruption. As our /financial year closed however, we could see that the UK vaccination programme had already allowed for a relaxation of controls, and it is possible to see a path to more normal life going forward.\n\nOur business has been a/ffected in many ways by the pandemic, and the lockdown restrictions imposed across the UK. Most of our buildings have had usage restrictions for the majority of this /financial year, as retail and hospitality venues were required to shut and workers encouraged to work from home where possible. Clearly these restrictions have had a serious /financial impact on many of our customers, especially those dependent on consumer footfall. You will see in this report the impact that this has had on our /financial results, and like many of our peers our share price has also been a/ffected.\n\nFor Landsec this has also been a year of signi/ficant management change. At the start of it we welcomed Mark Allan as our new CEO, and after many years as CFO Martin Greenslade leaves us after the end of the /financial year, handing over to Vanessa Simms who joined Landsec in May. Under Mark the Executive Leadership team has been rede/fined, with new faces from inside and outside Landsec taking up roles at this level. It has been exciting to see how our new leaders have already created fresh momentum in the business, despite the challenges of working remotely for much of the year.\n\n## LANDSEC'S RESPONSE\n\nA crisis like the Covid-19 pandemic tests the culture and resilience of any business, and it has been heartening to see how well Landsec has responded.\n\nThroughout the last year the company has been very focused on how it can help customers and other stakeholders to mitigate the impact of the pandemic. We have worked with customers across the portfolio to help restructure leases where appropriate, and at the start of the pandemic set up an \u00a380m customer support fund to help the most vulnerable.\n\nTo support our long term charitable partners we created a dedicated charitable support fund of \u00a30.5m, partly funded by the reduction in salary taken by our Executive Directors and the Board. Where restrictions allowed we have continued our",

        "page_content": "employment and education programmes virtually. Piccadilly Lights has been used to help communicate key messages from charities and public bodies, and we have given over \u00a32m worth of free advertising to registered charities at the Lights this year.\n\nThe Board has been proud of how the management team and our colleagues have shown resilience and creativity in response to all the issues they have faced.\n\nThe health and wellbeing\n\nof our sta/ff is always very important to us, and working remotely has been di/fficult for many. We have tried hard to help colleagues address issues around physical wellbeing and mental health, and it has been heartening to see the mutual support that our sta/ff have shown, through the networks we\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nhave, and in more informal ways. I would like to thank all our sta/ff for the commitment and resilience they have shown through this challenging year.\n\n## REFOCUSING FOR THE FUTURE\n\nDuring the /first half of the year Mark led a strategic review of our business, presenting a new vision and strategy for Landsec in October. The Board was closely involved in this review, and over several months discussed market evolution and its implications for Landsec's portfolio and strategy for the future. While the structural changes in both the retail and o/ffice market will continue, it is clear that Landsec will be best positioned for the future by focusing on what our customers want. Stakeholder engagement will be more important than ever.\n\nAcross our o/ffice customers, while most have managed working remotely surprisingly well, the bene/fits of collaborative working have become more fully appreciated. While customers will undoubtedly adapt how they use o/ffice space, surveys show that most employees welcome a physical return to the o/ffice for part of the week. We remain committed to providing our customers with safe, /flexible and modern space as their working practices adapt.\n\nAs retail starts to re-open across the UK many of the lasting impacts of the pandemic are not yet fully understood. However, across the portfolio we are focusing on developing a realistic view of sustainable rents, rethinking our guest experience and reshaping the size of our retail footprint.\n\nWith our new strategic priorities clear, there are parts of the portfolio that are no longer core to our business, and when we can realise appropriate values for these assets they will be sold. We will also continue to recycle capital from more mature assets into o/ffice and mixed-use development projects.\n\nLandsec's culture and values are key to the successful implementation of our new\n\nstrategy. As we have seen clearly over the last year our corporate culture is a great strength, especially in adversity. However, the Board supports Mark's aim to re-invigorate our culture to make the business more responsive, and help our employees to feel more empowered to make the right decisions quickly.\n\nWe remain very committed to the targets we have already set out to help Landsec become carbon net zero by 2030. The long-term e/ffects of climate change will be more signi/ficant for business than the pandemic has been, and we are working to understand the impacts on Landsec more fully, and adapt accordingly. You can read more about our progress in this area on page 64. Our desire to have a positive impact on the wider communities and environments in which we have a presence remains, and elsewhere in this report we show case studies of how we create social value around our developments.\n\nIt remains our goal to make our Board, senior leadership team and employee base a truly diverse re/flection of the customers and communities we work with. We will continue to drive our recruitment, training, remuneration and promotion policies towards this, whilst ensuring that they remain fair and transparent to all our colleagues.\n\n## BOARD CHANGES\n\nAs I have already mentioned, we welcomed Mark to the Board at the start of April, and his impact is already clear, despite the restrictions of virtual working for much of the year. The appointment of Vanessa Simms as our new CFO was announced in October. Vanessa joined the Board in May and we look forward to working with her.\n\nMartin has been CFO of Landsec since 2005 and has made a signi/ficant contribution to our business over his long tenure. He will be missed by the Board and more widely across the business, and we have all valued his clarity of thought, his deep knowledge\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nof Landsec and his great sense of humour. I am personally particularly grateful to him for becoming interim CEO at the start of the pandemic for a short period that was more eventful than either of us had anticipated! We wish him all the best for the future.\n\nWe welcomed Manjiry Tamhane to the Board as the year came to a close. Manjiry's experience in data management and strategy and evolving consumer behaviour is particularly relevant to our business at this time. Stacey Rauch, who has served as a Director for over nine years will step down before the AGM, and will be much missed. Stacey is a valued and insightful colleague, and we have particularly bene/fited from her strategic perspectives and human insights.\n\n## LOOKING FORWARD\n\nOverall, as we emerge from the pandemic, the Board is con/fident that Landsec is in a robust position with a strategy that is /fit for the future. We have clear priorities for all parts of our business, building on our strengths. We are con/fident that we will be ready to respond to the challenges we will undoubtedly face in our markets and have a /firm base on which to build shareholder value for the future. Thank you for your continued support.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCRESSIDA HOGG CHAIRMAN",

However, from the very outset of the /first lockdown we have been focused on ensuring that the business emerges from the pandemic in as strong a position as possible. The positive e/ffects of this decisive action will become clearer in the years ahead.\n\nLockdowns meant that the vast majority of our portfolio was either closed or substantially unoccupied for over half of the year. Social distancing and other restrictions meant that, even when open, capacity and utilisation across all assets was still heavily impacted. Our key priorities throughout were (i) ensuring the safety of our employees and visitors to our properties; (ii) working collaboratively with our customers to support their businesses as e/ffectively as possible; and (iii) maintaining our /financial strength and /flexibility. Our success and progress against each of these objectives, in the face of heightened uncertainty and persistent challenges, has gone some way to o/ffset the signi/ficant negative /financial impact of the pandemic. We did not bene/fit from any Government sponsored /financial assistance.\n\nWe are now entering the recovery phase.

As a result, despite the valuation weakness, our Group LTV only increased marginally to 32.2%. Our balance sheet remains in a strong position.\n\nRevenue pro/fit for the year was \u00a3251m, down 39.4% relative to the prior year. The decline was almost entirely attributable to Covid-19, either as a result of lower operating income (such as rent on turnover leases) or as a result of rent concessions granted and bad debt provisioning.\n\nThis strategy is captured in four strategic priorities, set out below, and each is covered in more detail later in the Operating and portfolio review, together with a clear update on progress made to date and more detail on near-term objectives.\n\n- 1    OPTIMISE CENTRAL LONDON\n- 2    REIMAGINE RETAIL\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3    GROW THROUGH URBAN OPPORTUNITIES\n- 4    REALISE CAPITAL FROM SUBSCALE SECTORS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn line with our strategy, we intend to increase portfolio recycling in the near term to e/ffect our desired reallocation of capital and are prepared to take, in a considered way, more operational risk to create value and drive returns, with /financial leverage managed accordingly. We have earmarked approximately \u00a34bn of assets for disposal over the next few years, focused initially on high quality but defensive prime central\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPerformance in the coming year will be determined by the shape of economic recovery from Covid-19 and the early signs are positive.\n\nWe are proposing a /final dividend for the year of 9.0p per share which, together with interim dividends already paid, makes for total dividends of 27.0p per share for the full year.\n\n## STRATEGY, CULTURE AND PEOPLE\n\nWe launched our new strategy in October 2020, con/firming our intention to focus on creating long-term value for shareholders, as measured by total business return. We will achieve this by concentrating our activities and our capital on those sectors and opportunities where we believe we have sustainable or attainable competitive advantage. Importantly, it is a strategy grounded in a clear purpose - Sustainable Places. Connecting Communities. Realising Potential - which aims to create sustainable value for all our stakeholders.\n\nLondon assets and, in due course, assets in Subscale sectors where we have little or no competitive advantage (hotels, leisure and retail parks).\n\nWhen reinvesting capital from this portfolio recycling programme, we have identi/fied two main areas of focus - value add opportunities in central London and\n\nurban mixed-use regeneration projects. We also believe that opportunities could begin to emerge in the retail sector in the short to medium term following the very substantial downward correction in asset values in that sector over the past few years.\n\nCulture is as important as strategy. Successful execution of our strategy will be built on a reinvigorated culture at Landsec to ensure that we make the most of the considerable capability and expertise of our people and look to augment it in a targeted way. Clarity of strategic direction, coupled with a properly aligned organisational design, will allow us to foster a culture of greater empowerment and accountability. As a result, we will be better placed to assess and manage risk, make decisions more quickly and drive better returns. Where we judge that new or additional skills are required, for example in elements of our retail business or in regeneration and placemaking, we are moving quickly to address those needs.\n\nBridging both strategy and culture for Landsec are /five key performance drivers that will underpin our competitive advantage for the long term: customer centricity; data-driven decisions; ESG leadership; capital discipline and development expertise. Our level of existing capability in each area is varied development expertise and ESG leadership are already key strengths on which we can build further. Our capital discipline - both in the sourcing and allocation of capital can be sharper and customer centricity and data-driven decisions are both areas where signi/ficant progress is needed. But these are areas where the wider real estate sector itself is not particularly strong and so both still represent opportunities to establish competitive advantage if we move quickly.\n\nThe past twelve months have been challenging for everyone. Across Landsec, as with many organisations, our teams have had to adapt quickly to ever changing conditions and have had to work harder than ever to balance the pressures of their roles with other priorities. It is testament, therefore, to their skill and dedication that so much has been achieved, and so much value protected, despite these persistent challenges. I have been deeply impressed by both the performance and potential of my new colleagues.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n## STRATEGIC PRIORITY: OPTIMISE CENTRAL LONDON\n\nOur Central London business represents 68% of our portfolio by value and is characterised by the quality, resilience and liquidity of our London o/ffice assets. These assets are a clear example of the value creation capabilities inherent in the Landsec business, given that the majority have been developed or refurbished and leased by us in the past 15 years. However, a number of the assets now have limited further value creation potential and so we intend to increase asset disposals over the next few years and recycle our investment out of these high quality, more defensive assets and increase our exposure to assets that o/ffer greater upside, for example either through redevelopment or repositioning. This strategy better aligns our capital and capability, leading to greater value creation opportunities in the medium to longer term. Our sale of 1 & 2 New Ludgate for \u00a3552m in December and the subsequent acquisition of 55 Old Broad Street for \u00a387m demonstrate the progress we are already making.",

        "page_content": "## Chief Executive's statement\n\n## continued\n\nCentral London has been one of the areas hardest hit by the e/ffects of the pandemic and social distancing restrictions, with physical o/ffice occupancy for the portfolio as a whole ranging from 1% to 21% at di/fferent times across the year and footfall across our Central London portfolio down by around 82%. We expect physical o/ffice occupancy to recover substantially across the second and third quarters of 2021. However, with tourism likely to be constrained, future o/ffice working patterns still unclear and residual concern about the safety of public transport likely to persist for a while yet, it will take longer for central London footfall to recover fully.\n\nGiven the pandemic related challenges, our Central London performance was remarkably resilient in valuation terms, falling only 6.5% to \u00a37.3bn and re/flecting a like-for-like equivalent yield of 4.6%. Investor demand for long let, prime London assets was strong and we expect it to remain so, re/flecting both investors' willingness to look through near-term uncertainty and the relative value of London compared with other major cities around the world. Yields for prime assets appear well supported at current levels and we could even see some compression in the year ahead.\n\nThe nearer term prospects for o/ffice occupier markets are more di/fficult to judge. Vacancy rates are high but concentrated in second hand space. Hybrid working models are here to stay but the e/ffect on occupiers' space requirements is far from clear and will not be uniform. And demand seems likely to be strongest for prime space, the recent and speculative supply of which has been muted. Overall we expect some weakness in rent levels but for this to be most signi/ficant for secondary space, of which we have very little.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, there will be a clear opportunity for owners and occupiers to work together collaboratively to determine and deliver tailored requirements and this will o/ffer potential for investors, developers and occupiers alike. Landsec's long track record and deep, strategic relationships with its customers should translate into\n\nclear competitive advantage. Besides our high quality development programme, it is also a particularly interesting time for us to be broadening the range of propositions we can o/ffer to occupiers - our Myo, Customised and Blank Canvas o/fferings. Flexibility, adaptability and strong customer relationships are going to be critical attributes going forward.\n\nFrom a development perspective, we worked hard during the year to preserve optionality on our speculative projects for as long as possible, allowing us time to assess and better understand the outlook for the occupier market. Taking all of our analysis into account, and having stress tested prospective returns, we have now committed to three of our /five near-term o/ffice development opportunities and will be delivering them during 2022 and 2023. These three projects total 0.5 million sq ft and, including pre-let or pre-sold projects, take our total committed development programme to 1.1 million sq ft, of which 57% is either pre-let or pre-sold.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## STRATEGIC PRIORITY: REIMAGINE RETAIL\n\nThe pandemic has materially accelerated structural trends that were already underway in retail and, for most of the retail sector, it is clear that online is now the primary growth channel and will remain so. This does not, however, signal the end for retail property. Instead, it means that its role must change in an omnichannel world to o/ffer something su/fficiently compelling - either to be complementary to online or to o/ffer something that cannot be easily replicated online. It is this reality that underpins our 'Reimagine retail' vision and we are con/fident that, with e/ffective execution, we have a retail business that can thrive longer term.\n\nOur outlets portfolio (\u00a30.7bn value) serves a real purpose, o/ffering visitors the opportunity to enjoy a day out shopping a variety of brands, with a great value o/ffer and experience that isn't easily replicated online. The outlet model is fundamentally\n\nbased on collaborative partnerships with our brand partners, most obviously through turnover based leases. During the year, our outlets have been relatively resilient, but values fell 18.5% and like-for-like equivalent yields moved out to 6.8%. However, based on their strong relative performance after each lockdown, we expect outlets to perform strongly in the recovery.\n\nThe picture for shopping centres remains more complex. Over the year, the value of our regional shopping centres fell on average 38.2% to \u00a31.0bn, taking the decline from the peak to approximately 60%. The realities remain that going forward there will be fewer physical retail stores, rents will be lower and, in order to remain relevant, shopping centres will need to o/ffer a combination of attributes that are either complementary to online or not easily replicated online.\n\nMuch more of this is now re/flected in valuations than was the case a year ago, largely as a result of the accelerating e/ffect of the pandemic. The vast majority of our forecast 40% decline in rents from peak to achieve a sustainable level has now been recognised. It is of course currently di/fficult to assess rental values given the e/ffects of the pandemic and the increasing prevalence of turnover components to leases, and it is possible that the downward correction in rents overshoots in the short term. However, we remain con/fident in our sustainable rent forecasts overall.\n\nAll of this means that retail property will continue to become more operational in nature and our priorities re/flect this. To be successful in the long term we need to be able to combine strong, strategic relationships with brand partners, e/ffectively tailored guest experiences and deep asset management expertise. Landsec has always had strong asset management credentials but brand partner management and more tailored guest experiences are areas where we are targeting rapid enhancements. We have made good early progress and our appointment in December last year of Bruce Findlay as Managing Director - Retail, bringing considerable international retail experience from a range of global brands, is an important example of how we are enhancing the 'retailer perspective' in our approach.\n\nThe near-term outlook for retail remains challenging, particularly for shopping centres. We are likely to see a sharp increase in insolvency processes (such as CVAs, business restructurings or administrations) amongst occupiers as the Government's pandemic related support tapers o/ff and businesses that were",

        "page_content": "struggling before the pandemic continue to do so afterwards. As this happens, it will accelerate the fall in passing rents towards our forecast sustainable rent levels, increasingly re/flected in valuations already. It will also open up opportunities for new brands and di/fferent propositions, including digitally native ones, to take space instead and help improve longer-term prospects.\n\nOur longer-term view of retail is more positive. With the downward correction in rents and values now happening much more quickly than would have been the case before Covid-19, it represents an opportunity for the sector to recalibrate. Landsec's combination of a strong retail platform, deep asset management and development expertise and a strong balance sheet marks us out as increasingly unique in the sector and well positioned to take advantage of any appropriate opportunities should they emerge.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## STRATEGIC PRIORITY: GROW THROUGH URBAN OPPORTUNITIES\n\nOur Urban opportunities portfolio currently consists of /five suburban London shopping centres with signi/ficant repurposing potential in the medium to longer term. These assets o/ffer the raw material for mixed-use, multi-phase developments that can o/ffer a compelling blend of income, development and rental growth driven returns throughout their life. Well designed, mixed-use spaces can also cater for the increasing focus on the need for balanced communities and spaces that contribute positively to quality of life, both of which have been brought into sharper relief by the pandemic. With our existing development and asset management capabilities, we believe that Landsec is well placed to become a leading player in this sector, both through the realisation of existing opportunities within our own portfolio but also through targeted acquisitions.\n\nThe longer-term redevelopment potential of our Urban opportunities portfolio helped to support values during the year to some extent but they still saw a meaningful decline of 23.3% to \u00a30.4bn as a result of their predominantly existing retail nature. Our focus in the year ahead is on progressing our redevelopment plans, with the submission of a planning application on our /first project a key target. We are also actively evaluating potential new investment opportunities that can o/ffer the right blend of income, development and rental growth driven returns, ideally in a way that can accelerate the return pro/file of this segment of the business.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n## STRATEGIC PRIORITY: REALISE CAPITAL FROM SUBSCALE SECTORS\n\nSubscale sectors describes those parts of the portfolio where we have relatively little capital invested and judge ourselves to have little or no competitive advantage hotels, leisure assets and retail parks. Our objective remains to realise capital from these assets over time and to reinvest that capital into new value creation opportunities.\n\nOf course, these types of assets have been amongst the hardest hit by the pandemic, particularly hotels and leisure, and over the past 12 months the aggregate value of our investment in Subscale sectors fell 16.4% to \u00a31.3bn. We do, however, expect these assets to be well placed bene/ficiaries of a strong consumption led recovery in the months and years ahead and for values to grow meaningfully as a result. Our anticipated timescale for disposals re/flects this, with hotels and leisure assets unlikely to be sold for at least a couple of years so that we can capture a sensible proportion of the expected valuation upside ahead. Retail parks, which were more resilient in the pandemic and where investment markets have staged a recovery, may o/ffer sale opportunities sooner. In all cases, we will be working hard to maximise value creation opportunities across the portfolio in the meantime.\n\n## THE YEAR AHEAD\n\nPerformance in the coming year will be determined by the shape of economic recovery from Covid-19 and the early signs are positive. The 12 April re-opening of non-essential retail saw some very strong trading for retailers across our portfolio and highlighted the potential for a strong consumer-led recovery over the remainder of 2021 and 2022. Our retail, leisure and hotel assets are well placed to bene/fit from such a recovery and, after a period of material downward movements in retail valuations in particular, the outlook for this part of our portfolio now appears under signi/ficantly less pressure.\n\nWe expect activity in central London to recover more slowly, with o/ffice occupational markets remaining more subdued for the time being, which could translate into some rental weakness. The London investment market, conversely, seems likely to display continued resilience with a signi/ficant amount of capital seeking prime investment opportunities and this could go some way to o/ffsetting any rental weakness from a valuation perspective.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, we expect to make good progress in executing our strategy. We took advantage of strong investor demand for prime London o/ffice assets to make two disposals in the year, with combined proceeds of \u00a30.6bn, and more disposals are likely over the course of the next /financial year. With improving economic prospects, we can now pursue opportunities to reinvest this capital with con/fidence.\n\nOur reinvestment agenda includes our committed Central London development programme, but we also have capacity to pursue new acquisition opportunities in a targeted way. Our main target areas for investment are value add opportunities in central London and mixed-use, multi-phase urban regeneration projects, both of which o/ffer the potential for above average total returns for shareholders. In addition, we are carefully monitoring the retail sector to determine whether this could provide interesting opportunities at potentially compelling returns.\n\nOf course, our strategy is about more than capital allocation. We also intend to continue the reinvigoration of our culture in line with the principles of empowerment and accountability and to enhance some of the more operational and customeroriented foundations that we believe will be critical to our long-term success. These include the continued roll out of a wider range of propositions for our Central London o/ffice customers, further investment in strategic brand partnerships and guest experience capability in retail and proving our placemaking credentials in Urban opportunities.\n\nThe Landsec business is poised for recovery with a strategy that positions the business for long-term growth.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Some assets o/ffer exclusively o/ffice facilities, but typically an o/ffice building will usually incorporate a collection of space for retail, food and beverage, and ancillary services and amenities such as health services. O/ffice customers' needs are changing, with a greater demand for /flexible space, healthier working environments, sustainable buildings and more services and amenities.\n\nO/ffice space requires regular refurbishment, and buildings are de/fined as grade A new or recently refurbished space - and secondary - older space which needs investment. London is a global /financial centre with a dynamic o/ffice market that is constantly renewed by development. It is a cyclical market, from both an investment and occupier perspective, and sees periods of rental and valuation growth with periods of decline. Successful property companies manage their assets, time their investment and development activity, and consider risk in relation to the supply and demand conditions in the market. The cycle is a consideration when making investment and disposal decisions, but it should not\n\nconstrain a business from taking contrarian views when opportunities emerge.\n\nDespite the recent impact of Covid-19 on its investment and occupational markets, London will remain a global /financial centre, and its o/ffice market has long-term potential from both an asset-management and development perspective.\n\n## RETAIL\n\nRetail space ranges from individual units on the high street through to large, regionally dominant shopping centres. In addition, retail space can be designed to satisfy di/fferent reasons to shop: retail parks focus on the convenience-led trip, whereas large shopping centres are destinations that provide a mix of retail, food and beverage, and leisure activities such as cinemas.\n\nThe vast majority of retailers have an omnichannel strategy which uses online as well as physical space to market and deliver their products and services to their customers. Physical stores are destinations, but are also used to support online retail through click & collect and returns services. Retailers have adapted their store networks in response to this, and in many cases now operate from a smaller number of larger units. The type of product and service o/ffered by retailers ranges from the essential, such as food and healthcare, through to discretionary sectors such as luxury products and jewellery. Such a diverse range of products means particular parts of the retail sector can be a/ffected by economic cycles and consumers' disposable income.",

        "page_content": "## Our market continued\n\n## THE PAST 12 MONTHS\n\nThe last year has been dominated by the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, with retailers, food and beverage, leisure operators and the hotel industry particularly hard hit.\n\nThe vast majority of o/ffices in London remained open during the year, to provide a safe environment for those who could not work elsewhere. In addition, o/ffice occupiers continued to pay their rent during the year, with rent collection rates above 90% for the major o/ffice operators.\n\nOccupational demand in the London o/ffice market was below the long-term average (see chart right). There is a growing distinction between demand for new, prime o/ffice space - which meets wellbeing as well as branding and operational requirements for its occupiers - and secondary space, which is di/fficult to adapt to more progressive requirements. The pandemic has increased this divergence.\n\nThe London o/ffice investment market remained active over the last year, with demand for larger assets coming mainly from overseas investors. There was less demand for secondary assets, and these may become buying opportunities for o/ffice developers who can redevelop the space to meet the needs of today's customers.\n\nThe retail and leisure sectors were hit very hard by Covid-19, with non-essential retailers forced to close their stores for parts of the year during the lockdowns. The sector saw a number of retailers go into administration, including the Arcadia brands and Debenhams. Rent collection levels were signi/ficantly lower than normal, and landlords have provided support through rental payment holidays and deferrals where appropriate.\n\nThe impact of Covid-19 was not uniform across the retail sector. Outlets, retail parks and some suburban shopping centres with a larger proportion of essential retail were relatively resilient but still saw valuation declines in the year.\n\nIn contrast, central London retail, heavily dependent on tourism and o/ffice workers, was one of the most signi/ficantly a/ffected segments.\n\nEncouragingly, footfall recovered strongly when shopping centres were allowed to open but, with social-distancing measures in place, it was still below pre-Covid levels.\n\nThe food and beverage, cinema and hotels sectors were a/ffected by social-distancing restrictions and the lockdowns in similar ways to the retail sector. It is likely these sectors will rebound quickly when restrictions ease.\n\nOnline is now the primary growth channel for retailers.

Urban environments are changing and the way we live our lives is evolving, whether due to technology, changing demographics or adapting to a post-Covid-19 world.\n\nTo grow through urban opportunities does not/uni00A0necessarily involve speci/fic assets or sectors, but is about bringing people together - communities, businesses, government, providers of capital - to envisage, and ultimately deliver, the urban environments of the future. And we need to do this in harmony with the UK's sustainability agenda, not least its 2050 net zero carbon commitment.\n\nWe have a proven skillset. We have completed large mixed-use schemes in London. And our recent retail developments have included non-retail elements such as residential. We also have a number of assets within our portfolio that can o/ffer a blank sheet for designing new mixed-use communities, and we will look to augment these further.

It positions the business to take advantage of long-term macro trends. And it is built on a clear, authentic purpose, so it creates value not just for shareholders, but for all stakeholders. It also recognises that culture is as important as strategy. That's why we developed our strategy in conjunction with our purpose while establishing the culture to support our activity.\n\n## More details on pages 34-35\n\nSuccessful strategies are based on sources of sustainable competitive advantage. We have identi/fied six sources of competitive advantage that underpin our strategy (see right). The quality of our portfolio represents a strong foundation from which to build a growth-focused strategy. Our track record, reputation and the strong relationships we have established, are important as we pursue our strategy and increase our activity in urban mixed-use development. Our scale enables us to access and deploy capital quickly and cost e/ffectively. Our development expertise in creating mixed-use o/ffice-led schemes in London and large shopping centre developments across the UK, are relevant and transferable skills we can apply to other sectors. ESG leadership remains an essential strength, as occupiers and consumers increasingly expect our spaces to satisfy both sustainability and wellbeing credentials.\n\nFinally, it is our people who bring all of this together - unlocking potential in our portfolio, spotting new opportunities, building strategic relationships and achieving our strategy.\n\nWe developed our strategy at the same time as Covid-19 was a/ffecting our business in a very signi/ficant way. There have been many short-term challenges and there will continue to be for some time yet. And the longer-term implications are still unclear.\n\nImportantly, we entered the pandemic from a position of strength. We are managing the near-term challenges proactively.\n\nThrough our customer focus, we have supported our customers through these extraordinary circumstances, and have worked with them as we emerge from the pandemic.\n\nBut out of every crisis emerges opportunity, and this one will be no di/fferent. We intend to make sure we position Landsec to make the most of these opportunities, by building on our competitive advantages.\n\nThe previous pages described our four strategic priorities and the link to our purpose. The diagram right, shows how our purpose, our competitive advantage and the global forces of change (shown in our market on page 13) feed into our strategic priorities. We have also identi/fied /five key performance drivers that will be essential to achieving our strategy. Finally, we show what our strategy means for our stakeholders, and for our culture and organisation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## HOW DO WE THINK ABOUT RISK AND RETURN?\n\nPositioning the business for growth with an appropriate level of risk\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u203a We focus on total return through the cycle and position the business to deliver abovemarket returns.\n- \u203a Income is a key part of the property return, but is/uni00A0not the key/uni00A0driver.\n\n## GENERATING 'ALPHA'\n\n- \u203a A greater focus on value creation.\n- \u203a Taking on more risk but doing so in a managed, proactive way.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u203a Our tolerance for /financial leverage is guided by the/uni00A0level of operating risk in the business and our view of the cycle.\n- \u203a We operate in a cyclical market.\n- \u203a Understanding and responding to the cycle is a key part of/uni00A0generating and/uni00A0protecting alpha.",

Our expertise lends itself to large, complex, long-term projects that can meet the needs of multiple customer segments. We also take an innovative approach to design, manufacture and assembly.\n\n## CAPITAL DISCIPLINE\n\n## Positioning our portfolio for growth\n\nWe are investing in sectors and assets that can thrive throughout the cycle to achieve a premium net asset valuation. We also consider managing property for fee income, or using attractively priced partner capital.\n\n## CUSTOMER CENTRICITY\n\n## Creating positive experiences based on/uni00A0understanding our customers\n\nCustomer centricity has always been important, but as our customers manage and respond to the challenges of Covid-19 and other changes in their needs, customer focus will be essential to ensure we /find mutually bene/ficial solutions.\n\n## DATA/hyphen.caseDRIVEN DECISION/hyphen.caseMAKING Making data a strategic asset for our/uni00A0business\n\nIt's not about how much data we have, but how we use it to enhance all aspects of our business. We will build data as a strategic asset for the long term, blending proprietary and public data to enable focused, strategic decision-making.\n\n## ESG LEADERSHIP\n\n## Leading the industry in pursuit of our science-based environmental targets\n\nWe take a proactive approach to our social and environmental impact, making investments which lead to positive employee and stakeholder experiences. This helps ensure our business remains attractive and relevant, and creates value in the long term.\n\n## More details at www.landsec.com\n\nOur new strategy brings a new approach to risk and return. Our business has the potential to add signi/ficant value through its portfolio and activities. We therefore intend to prioritise achieving above-market total returns through the cycle or, in market parlance, 'alpha'.\n\nIncome is, of course, a key component of our property return and will still be meaningful. But we do not believe it should be the key driver. As a result, we place a greater emphasis on true value creation.\n\nThis means taking more operational risk, but risk we understand, and doing so in a managed, proactive way. This higher level of operating risk will generally require a lower level of /financial leverage.\n\nNotwithstanding our focus on total return through the cycle, we do operate in a cyclical market and recognise that understanding and responding to the cycle is a key part of generating and protecting value.\n\nWith the quality of our existing portfolio as an e/ffective source of liquidity to fund growth, a team with an unrivalled record in creating value in its core markets, and a clear strategy to make the most of that strength through our culture and our approach to operational risk, we aim to achieve market-beating returns through the cycle.",

We did this by engaging our people to conduct a strategic review in parallel with an exercise to get clarity on our purpose, culture and organisational structure. Importantly, we ran all activities concurrently, with signi/ficant input from across our business. The result is a purpose that is authentic, a strategy owned by the whole business, and a culture our people recognise, support and unite within.\n\nThe strategy makes the most of Landsec's strengths and positions the business for growth. It is built around a clear, authentic and meaningful purpose, so it can create value not just for shareholders, but for all stakeholders. Our culture is key to successfully achieving our strategic ambitions, and we regard it as a source of competitive advantage.\n\nOur culture shapes how we achieve our strategy, it ensures we have the right organisational capability. It de/fines how we do things, how we behave, and how our leaders can inspire and motivate. Supported by our values, our culture provides a common language to enable our people to thrive and harness their potential. So our culture is as important as our strategy.\n\nIn addition to culture, it is important to have the right organisational structure. We have already established our Executive Leadership Team and are moving to a leaner, more nimble organisation with greater levels of both decision-making and accountability within our clear strategic framework.\n\nSee more about our Executive Leadership Team on pages 88-89\n\n## HOW WE ACHIEVE OUR PURPOSE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## OUR VALUES\n\nOur values guide us in everything we do, making us a team and helping to shape our culture. They guide our actions, inform our strategic decisions and de/fine our behaviours - driving us to support each other and to come together to create great experiences for people.\n\n- Determined: We have the courage to do the right thing for the long term.\n- Inclusive: We are caring, open and progressive.\n- Driven: We strive to be the best.\n- United: We achieve more together.\n\n## OUR CULTURAL BLUEPRINT\n\nSimply saying culture is important is not enough. That is why we have set out on a continual process of de/fining, measuring and evolving what it is like to work with and for Landsec. We started this during summer 2020 by engaging 273 people from right across our business in conversations about our purpose and culture. This led to the creation of our Cultural Blueprint (see right).\n\nAs a purpose-driven organisation, our focus is on the impact and value we bring. Our blueprint sets out our desired future culture, showing how we are trusted and empowered to make the right decisions for our customers, communities and our planet.\n\nAnd we haven't stopped there. In spring 2021, we went a step further with the /first annual review of how we are living up to our Cultural Blueprint. Once again, our people came together to tell us where we are performing well and where we have room for improvement. These /findings have informed the development of an ongoing plan to continually evolve our culture and positively support our purpose and strategy.",

This approach has been particularly important during the challenging environment we have operated in during the pandemic. Our focus during the year has been on supporting our customers and positioning our business to emerge from the pandemic in as strong a position as possible.\n\n## THE IMPACT OF COVID/hyphen.case19 AND OUR RESPONSE\n\nOur entire /financial year was impacted by the pandemic. Operationally, all areas of the business were a/ffected but the impact varied across the portfolio. Our o/ffice portfolio remained open throughout the year; occupation was signi/ficantly below pre-Covid-19 levels but we saw progressively higher levels of occupancy during each successive lockdown. In retail, leisure and hotels, the impact was more severe - during periods of lockdown, only essential retail and services could trade, with other operators limited to servicing online customers or providing takeout services. The /financial impact of Covid-19 was much more acute in the retail and hospitality segments of our business, where rent collection rates were signi/ficantly below pre-Covid-19 levels. Almost all of the rent due from our o/ffice occupiers was collected.\n\nOur priorities throughout the year have been: (i) colleague and visitor safety; (ii) proactively supporting our customers; and (iii) preserving /financial strength and /flexibility. We tailored our support to the speci/fic needs of each area of the business.\n\nIn o/ffices, we provided some /financial support to a very small number of occupiers whose businesses were particularly impacted by the pandemic, but the majority of our support related to ensuring the safety of our spaces and helping our customers to adapt their spaces to meet their speci/fic needs.\n\nIn retail and hospitality, our focus was on providing /financial support from our \u00a380m customer support fund, ensuring our assets allowed safe and easy navigation for guests, and providing marketing and operational support for our customers.\n\nFor our people, we provided regular updates from our business resilience team, increased the mental health and wellbeing support available for those who needed it and we made sure there was regular contact between teams while working from home. None of our people have been furloughed.\n\nWe took advantage of resilient investment markets in London to maintain /financial capacity and /flexibility through targeted disposals, and minimised the disruption to our committed developments while preserving optionality on our longer-term pipeline.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs the year progressed, and the path out of the pandemic became clearer, we focused on ensuring our portfolio and strategy were positioned appropriately for a post-Covid-19 world. Covid-19 has accelerated many existing trends which would otherwise have taken a number of years to play out. The range of o/ffice products we o/ffer will enable us to provide the space our customers need as they adapt to potentially di/fferent and more /flexible ways of operating, combining o/ffice and home-based working. Our Regional retail portfolio is well placed to provide the right mix of exciting retail brands, leisure and entertainment which will be essential for successful centres. And our hotels and leisure assets are well placed to bene/fit from the consumer-led recovery we expect to see as we emerge from lockdown restrictions.",

Rental value change excludes units materially altered during the year.\n\nThe 13.7% decline in the value of our Combined Portfolio is mostly due to a fall in the value of our retail and leisure assets, driven by reductions in rental values and expanding equivalent yields. Within the like-for-like portfolio, regional shopping centres and shops saw the largest reduction in values, down 38.2% overall as rental values reduced by 21.5% and yields moved out 140bps. London retail reduced in value by 26.7% as rental values declined by 25.2% and yields moved out by 26bps. Our leisure assets declined in value by 22.9% with rental values 7.1% lower and yields expanding by 118bps, while hotels were down by 13.4% due to the impact of Covid-19 on our turnover rents and a 34bps expansion in yields. Our o/ffice assets saw a more modest decrease in value of 4.3% as rental values declined by 1.9% and yields moved out slightly. The values of our other central\n\nLondon assets, principally Piccadilly Lights, W1, were down marginally.\n\nOutside the like-for-like portfolio, values in the development programme were broadly /flat, with the value of 21 Moor/fields, EC2 increasing as we approach completion of the development, o/ffset by declines at Lucent, W1 and n2, SW1 where expected rents have been slightly reduced and development costs increased. The 12.4% decline in the value of our proposed developments is due to Portland House, SW1 and Timber Square, SE1 where expected rents have reduced and costs on Portland House have increased.\n\nOur acquisitions fell in value by 5.4%, driven by a decline in value of the X-Leisure portfolio, where we acquired the remaining 5% in December 2019.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n## OPTIMISE OUR CENTRAL LONDON PORTFOLIO\n\nOur \u00a37.3bn Central London portfolio comprises o/ffices (85%), associated ground level retail (9%) and other assets (6%), the most signi/ficant of which is Piccadilly Lights, W1. The portfolio is characterised by its quality, resilience and liquidity and despite challenging market conditions, valuations were resilient with our o/ffice valuations declining by 4.1%. Our o/ffices remain almost fully let and rent collection remained strong, with almost all of the rent due now collected, re/flecting the strength of our occupier base.\n\nThe central London market has been signi/ficantly impacted by the pandemic but Landsec remains in a strong position with high levels of rent collection and a clear strategy to create value.",

We reviewed all properties based on a 'customer journey', to ensure users and visitors could meet social-distancing guidelines.\n\n## Clear communications at all/uni00A0times\n\nWe quickly designed and developed an easily accessible Covid-19 document centre, to provide building-speci/fic guidance, which we also distributed to all customers. This included interactive walkthrough videos and FAQs, all updated, sometimes daily, through the subsequent phases of lockdown. O/ffice customers have accessed these live documents over 25,000 times so far. In addition, we maintained a continuous programme of customer engagement, including webinars, weekly video meetings, and electronic messaging around buildings.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Dealing with con/firmed cases\n\nIn all, we had to deal with six on-site cases of Covid-19, /five of them over a short period. We had a step-bystep guide for people to respond, available company-wide and updated after each case. We also created a specially equipped fastresponse team to undertake a full deep-clean in line with Public Health England guidelines, ensuring all sites were safe again for 6am the following morning.\n\n## Working with our customers\n\nDuring this period, we were able to reduce service charges, adapting to lower occupancy levels, and reducing energy use. We liaised with all customers on matters such as security patrols, water /flushing on unoccupied /floors and resilience of critical communications systems. We were also able to improve shower facilities, increase cyclestorage capacity, and test air quality, UV monitoring of mail and other measures. We continue to track daily o/ffice occupancy levels across the portfolio, so we can react quickly to any changes as the country opens up gradually from lockdown.\n\nMore information on www.landsec.com\n\nCovid-19 impacted the London o/ffice market in two ways: low levels of occupation and a signi/ficant reduction in demand for new space. This, in turn, a/ffected the London retail and hospitality sectors which are dependent upon o/ffice workers and tourism for the majority of their custom. Retail footfall in central London was down 82% year on year, re/flecting the challenging nature of this market.\n\nPhysical occupancy in our o/ffices portfolio was, on average, 6.2% re/flecting a combination of working from home and social distancing guidelines as employers imposed occupancy limits as part of maintaining a Covid-19 secure workplace. Central London o/ffice take-up in the 12 months to March 2021 was just 4.4 million sq ft - the lowest annual take-up rate for over 30 years. Availability across the market increased to 25.3 million sq ft, compared with the 10-year average of 14.8 million sq ft, driven by second-hand space as leases expired and some occupiers looked to sub-let excess o/ffice capacity. As a result, vacancy rates rose to 8.9%, the majority of which is second-hand space. Despite this, there continues to be demand for high-quality o/ffice space, with 39% of total take-up being of new space. One of the trends accelerated by Covid-19 is demand for sustainable, healthy work environments. This is o/ffered by the best space and is likely to continue the bifurcation of the occupier market.\n\nInvestment market volumes in the 12 months to March 2021 were below the long-term average with transactions totalling \u00a37.2bn, re/flecting the logistical challenges of viewing assets particularly by overseas investors, but there was continued demand for long income, high-quality assets. London remains a global /financial centre and, with average prime yields of 3.75%, continues to o/ffer relative value compared with other major cities.",

The vast majority of our o/ffice customers' businesses were resilient throughout the year, but we used our customer support fund to help three who were particularly challenged. As customers start to plan for their return to the o/ffice, we are liaising closely with them to understand their intentions and help them return smoothly and safely.\n\nWhile some customers will review and potentially consolidate their requirements, there is ongoing demand for high quality o/ffice space, and we are seeing the bene/fit of working alongside our customers to understand their needs. For example, in Victoria, we are currently in active discussions with seven occupiers across 300,000 sq ft in /five buildings. This ranges from a 40% upsize to a 20% downsize. The outcome will be stronger customer relationships, re-geared leases, a more diverse product mix and reduced vacancy across the estate. This is not simply a function of upcoming lease events, it is being driven by strategic partnerships with our occupiers and a proactive approach to delivering the right solutions for them.\n\nWhile our o/ffice customers have remained resilient, the trading environment for central London retail and hospitality has been particularly challenged, and we expect this part of the market to take longer to recover. Through our customer support fund we have provided \u00a36m of concessions, together with longer-term support through turnover related leases for some customers. In addition to /financial support, we are helping customers with their reopening plans. Alongside targeted marketing, we have worked closely with local authorities to enable hospitality customers to extend their outside trading capacity, creating space for 680 additional covers.\n\nWe are seeing interest from occupiers in taking new space, but the market remains challenging. In Victoria, One Rebel expanded\n\ntheir footprint at Nova, we have good interest in the former Goldsmiths unit at Cardinal Place, and we are exploring upsize options for one of our existing brand partners. At One New Change, EC4, we completed the letting of the former Topshop unit to Zara as well as progressing renewal terms with a number of existing brand partners.\n\n## DISPOSALS\n\nIn line with our strategy to recycle capital out of assets where there are limited opportunities for us to add further value, we completed two disposals during the year. In September 2020, we sold 7 Soho Square, W1 for \u00a378m at a 4.0% yield and 4.3% above the March 2020 valuation, and in December, we sold 1 & 2 New Ludgate, EC4 for \u00a3552m at a 4.2% yield and 1.1% above the March 2020 valuation. Both assets attracted signi/ficant interest from bidders and demonstrate the continued demand for prime London o/ffice assets.\n\n## DEVELOPMENTS AND ACQUISITIONS\n\nDuring the year, our focus has been on progressing our committed development schemes and preserving optionality on the others. We maintained /flexibility in the pipeline while we assessed the long-term prospects of the London o/ffice market. Having completed our review in the /first quarter of 2021, we increased our speculative developments to 451,000 sq ft by adding n2, SW1 to our existing schemes at Lucent, W1 and The Forge, SE1. Alongside our pre-let to Deutsche Bank at 21 Moor/fields, EC2, this takes our committed activity to 1.1 million sq ft, with a further 1.0 million sq ft held for development.\n\nAt 21 Moor/fields, the contractor Sir Robert McAlpine, doubled the facilities space for construction workers in order to accommodate more people on site in a Covid-secure way. Weekend working was also introduced to mitigate some of the delays resulting from lower on-site capacity. However, as a result of the lower on-site capacity we now expect practical completion to be delayed to July 2022.\n\nAt Lucent, The Forge and n2, we negotiated break options ahead of entering into the main construction contracts. This enabled us to progress with building to grade and construction of the cores while maintaining optionality before committing to further work and capex. With con/fidence in the long-term prospects of the London o/ffice market, we fully committed to Lucent and The Forge in September and n2 in March. Completion dates at The Forge, Lucent and n2 are June 2022, December 2022 and June 2023 respectively.\n\nTo date, the additional costs resulting from the impact of Covid-19 have been accommodated within the contingency allowances of the schemes' total development costs (TDCs), but further disruption may put modest upward pressure on TDCs as projects complete. We continue to focus on mitigating the cost impact of Covid-19 wherever possible.\n\nDespite the current low levels of take-up in the market, we remain con/fident about the occupational markets we will deliver space into. Demand is expected to be strongest for prime, high-quality, sustainable space and our three speculative o/ffice schemes will meet this need in di/fferent locations in London, with phased completion dates.\n\nWe added to our development potential with two acquisitions during the year. In December, we purchased 55 Old Broad Street, EC2 for \u00a387m. The acquisition o/ffers signi/ficant marriage value as the site is adjacent to an existing Landsec asset, Dashwood. We also acquired the remaining undeveloped land on the Nova, SW1 island site from our joint venture for a consideration of \u00a313m. We now own 100% of the /final two phases at Nova (n2 and Nova Place) and we have recently satis/fied all of the Nova P1 planning obligations, meaning Nova Place is now an unencumbered site.",

        "page_content": "## POSITIONING OUR LONDON BUSINESS FOR A POST/hyphen.casePANDEMIC WORLD\n\nThe long-term impact of the pandemic on central London is not yet clear but it won't be uniform. We are likely to see some bifurcation of demand as quality of space and sustainability credentials become signi/ficant factors for customers. Some sectors, such as banking and professional services, may reduce their /floorspace. Others, such as tech, are not necessarily changing footprint size but are focused on quality of space and employee choice. We will work closely with our occupiers to understand and deliver their needs and the scale that is required.\n\nIt is clear that customers who are looking to consolidate want to occupy the best space. This plays to our strengths. Our portfolio and product range gives us the opportunity to tailor our customer conversations to meet upsize, downsize and servicing needs, which is leading to several positive regearing discussions. We are also working with some customers to consolidate into a smaller number of buildings, freeing up development opportunities in assets which otherwise would not have become vacant.\n\n## BUILDING ON THE PROGRESS MADE TO DATE, OUR OPTIMISE STRATEGY IS BASED ON FOUR OBJECTIVES:\n\n## \u278a Creating  value  through  development\n\nOur focus for the coming year will be on progressing our committed schemes while minimising the impact of Covid-19 on completion dates and costs. We are already seeing occupier interest in our three speculative schemes and we will continue to work towards securing pre-lets as activity in the occupational market increases.\n\nAt Portland House, SW1, strip out and design works continued through to the end of April. We are currently assessing the potential timing of the scheme and are likely to pause to manage development exposure.\n\nAt Timber Square, SE1, demolition of the existing building is due to commence by the end of May 2021 with a decision on development to be taken by the autumn. The earliest PC date is February 2024 and we will assess the expected demand levels and rental tone before committing to the scheme.\n\nAt 55 Old Broad Street, EC2, we will continue to work towards vacant possession in December 2024. In the meantime, we will be working up development plans while protecting short-term income.\n\n## \u278b Creating value through resilience\n\nOur high rent collection throughout the year demonstrates the resilience of income from our o/ffice portfolio and, despite the challenges of the pandemic, we renewed \u00a38m of leases during the year and secured \u00a31m of new lettings. As we look to position our portfolio for future growth, we are using data and insight to focus our activities and capital on sectors, locations and products that we believe will be successful for the long term.\n\nWe have three o/ffice products which enable us to meet the space requirements of existing and potential customers, large or small, established companies or new businesses. At 123 Victoria Street, SW1, Myo occupancy averaged 85% over the year, and we extended /five leases with existing customers. At 31 March 2021, occupancy dropped to 71% through lease expiries, but we are having positive discussions with new customers, as well as upsizing discussions with two existing customers. We are also trialling Covid-secure daily and weekly bookings at 123 Victoria Street.\n\nThe reduction in central London footfall signi/ficantly impacted the out-of-home advertising market in the year, with shortterm bookings at Piccadilly Lights, W1, 68% below 2019/20. However, we are starting to see evidence of the market recovering, with signi/ficant interest for summer bookings. We have demonstrated the long-term appeal of Piccadilly Lights, signing a new ten-year agreement with Samsung and we are in discussions with two other brands about longer-term agreements.\n\nWe will look to strengthen our resilience further through acquisitions. We have identi/fied a number of potential acquisitions within London providing a range of opportunities for us to add value.\n\n## \u278c Creating value through relentless customer focus\n\nWe are progressing the roll-out of our o/ffice products and continue to invest in delivering great customer experiences across our o/ffice portfolio. We have invested signi/ficantly into Dashwood, EC2 where a range of Myo, Customised and Blank Canvas spaces have been delivered in a single building. Myo Liverpool Street at Dashwood, provides /flexible o/ffice, meeting and amenity spaces on /floors 6 to 8, with delivery of /floor 9 to follow later this year. The Customised show /floor is complete on level 2, with further Customised /floors available to be delivered on demand. A visualisation tool has been created for customers to con/figure their space virtually to ensure it meets their speci/fic needs before physical work starts.\n\nCustomised is also being delivered at 55 Old Broad Street, EC2 and 30 Eastbourne Terrace, W2, with further expansion of this product planned to meet customer demand across our portfolio. Landsec lounge spaces have been completed at One New Change, EC4 and 6 New Street Square, EC4 to enhance the arrival experience and provide informal drop-in work and meeting spaces.\n\nWith a focus on delivering healthy and sustainable spaces, we are progressing our WELL Building portfolio accreditation, aiming to achieve accreditation across the entire o/ffice portfolio.\n\n## \u278d Realising value through disciplined capital recycling\n\nDisposals in the /financial year totalled \u00a30.6bn at an average yield of 4.1%.\n\nWe have indicated our intention to sell approximately \u00a32.5bn of central London assets with more limited asset management opportunities. We have made \u00a30.6bn of disposals since March 2020 and therefore expect to sell a further \u00a31.9bn over the next two to three years.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2\n\n## REIMAGINE OUR REGIONAL RETAIL PORTFOLIO\n\nOur \u00a31.8bn Regional retail portfolio comprises six regional shopping centres and /five outlets.\n\nCovid-19 has had a profound e/ffect on the retail sector. In addition to the short-term impact resulting from three lockdowns and social distancing restrictions, the pandemic has signi/ficantly accelerated the structural trends which were already changing how people shop. Online is now the primary growth channel across most areas of retail. For retail property to be relevant and thrive in an omnichannel world, it needs to be compelling in its own right, complementary to online or o/ffer something which cannot easily be replicated online.\n\nRetailers recognise the importance of physical retail to their omnichannel strategy, but there is too much of it in the UK and a lot of it is poor quality. 17% of retail space across the UK is currently vacant and this is expected to rise to 25% in 2025, equivalent to 158 million sq ft of excess or obsolete retail space.\n\nOutlets are one of the strongest retail formats as they o/ffer a service and experience which cannot be replicated online. The higher quality regional shopping centres are generally well placed to support and complement online - brand mix needs to evolve, but rents are approaching sustainable levels which will support store level pro/fitability.",

With 65% of the retail sector deemed nonessential, we still had to ensure our 'essential' retailers could continue to trade. Naturally our highest priority was the health and safety of all sta/ff and guests.\n\nSo as well as adhering to Government guidelines, we worked closely with our brand partners and colleagues on all necessary planning, ensuring a consistent approach across our shopping centres and outlets. At Bluewater, White Rose and all four of our suburban London properties, we continued to operate, providing a critical service to each local community.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLITTLE DID WE KNOW, BUT THE EVER/hyphen.caseEVOLVING CHALLENGE OF THIS/uni00A0FIRST LOCKDOWN PHASE, AND GEARING UP FOR THE INITIAL 15 JUNE AND 4 JULY REOPENINGS, WAS HELPING PREPARE US FOR SUBSEQUENT LOCKDOWNS AND REOPENINGS.

Minds again turned to planning the reopenings of 12 April 2021 and beyond, which included a 71% increase in external seating to support the hospitality sector.\n\nThroughout the year we ran individual meetings with our brand partners, and our Commercial O/ffice and Retail teams combined their experiences to produce printed and online guidelines, or host explanatory webinars. This ensured all brand partners were able, at all times, to o/ffer an appropriate balance between doing business and maintaining safety when welcoming their guests back.\n\nRent collection was signi/ficantly impacted by Covid-19 throughout the year. We have now collected 58% of the net rent due on 25 March 2021. For the four quarters to 25 March 2021, 71% of the net rent due has been collected. The rent moratorium, which remains in place, restricted our ability to enforce rent collections. With lockdown measures easing and operators re-opening, we hope to see a return to timely rent payments and settlement of arrears.\n\nThe scale and pace of retail and leisure CVAs and administrations has increased signi/ficantly during the year, and some high-pro/file names have disappeared from the retail landscape. During the year, \u00a341m of annualised rental income was subject to CVA or administration, of which we lost \u00a329m. This compares with \u00a39m of annualised rental income in 2019/20. 360 units across 58 brand partners were impacted, with 48 units falling void as a result. Like-for-like voids across the portfolio were 7.5% (31 March 2020: 4.7%) and units in administration were 5.8% (31 March 2020: 2.1%).\n\nWe have engaged with a number of brand partners during the year on opportunities to reduce their overall store portfolio, with some customers also seeking consensual rent reductions to reduce their occupancy costs. We remain committed to working alongside our customers to ensure rents are a/ffordable, and we welcome open and constructive dialogue. However, during the year we have also taken legal action where we believe insolvency processes have been used unfairly, or due legal process has not been followed.\n\n## SUPPORTING OUR RETAIL CUSTOMERS\n\nThe pandemic brought signi/ficant operational challenges for the portfolio and safety has always been our /first priority. The /first lockdown, starting on 23 March 2020, saw footfall at our regional shopping centres reduce signi/ficantly. Throughout each lockdown and reopening we have had a clear plan for each asset, and provided frequent communications to our brand partners and guests.",

This will help ensure our destinations remain the location of choice for our brand partners to deliver their physical and digital propositions to meet speci/fic needs of our guests.

There will not be a one-size-/fits-all solution on how we contract with our brand partners, but rather di/fferent models that enable all parties to share in the value of the physical store. We are currently developing a suite of four products to address evolving space needs.

        "page_content": "## CREATING VALUE THROUGH ASSET MANAGEMENT EXPERTISE\n\nThe last few years have demonstrated that some of our retail destinations are oversized, and we do not have the best occupier mix and usage of space at all our assets. We are underway designing a new approach to assessing and planning the right use and mix of space at our destinations. The approach is underpinned by data; catchment insight, economic forecasts and predictions of social trends all contribute to determining how our assets can be best placed to maximise future growth and de-risk returns.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3\n\n## GROW THROUGH URBAN OPPORTUNITIES\n\nUrban opportunities are essentially mixeduse, multi-phase regeneration projects rooted in a need to redevelop parts of the built environment that are no longer /fit for purpose. Retail is the most prominent example, and our Urban opportunities portfolio comprises /five suburban London projects with redevelopment potential over 1.6 million sq ft with the potential to extend to around 8.0 million sq ft of mixed-use space.\n\nThese urban development projects can o/ffer a compelling blend of income, development upside and rental growth throughout their lives. And development can be phased, enabling risk and capital investment to be spread over the life of the projects.\n\nAt our most advanced scheme, Finchley Road, NW3, consultations have taken place with a further phase of consultation due in early summer as we progress our master planning and design. We remain on track to submit our planning application this coming /financial year. Our other projects are all progressing through concept and design during the pre-development phase. Our large mixed-use schemes will embrace local communities and placemaking to deliver the most suitable and sustainable developments in line with our purpose to provide sustainable places and connect communities. We have engaged external agencies to help develop our overall vision for our Urban opportunities. And we have progressed discussions with a number of leisure operators to trade rent reductions for lease break points and /flexibility as we progress towards vacant possession.\n\nThe redevelopment potential and more convenience-led nature of these assets has meant that valuations have been more resilient than shopping centres but were still down 23.3% to \u00a30.4bn. Across our /five schemes, 45% of retailers remained open throughout the third lockdown, signi/ficantly ahead of the rest of the retail assets in our portfolio. This re/flects the local convenience nature of our /five schemes and demonstrates that these assets already play an important role within their local communities.\n\nThe timeline for these projects is long but the right opportunities can start delivering balanced returns in the near future. We are also evaluating opportunities to add to our portfolio, ideally with projects that o/ffer an accelerated returns horizon.\n\nSo, looking forward, our strategy will be to progress planning and delivery strategies for our existing portfolio of projects and to evaluate and ideally secure new complementary opportunities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n## REALISE CAPITAL FROM SUBSCALE SECTORS\n\nOur \u00a31.3bn Subscale sectors portfolio comprises hotels, leisure parks and retail parks, which we intend to divest over the medium term.\n\nThe \u00a30.4bn hotel portfolio has been impacted by the periods of lockdown during the pandemic with the majority of our hotels closed for 20 weeks on average over the year. The portfolio is let on turnover based leases and income has been signi/ficantly lower during the year, down 90%. As lockdown restrictions ease, we expect to see a recovery in the hotel sector and our portfolio of two and three-star hotels is well placed to bene/fit.\n\nOur leisure portfolio comprises assets typically anchored by cinemas and leisure and F&B operators. Social distancing measures have impacted the performance at these assets. Cinemas were closed for 41 weeks of the year and the F&B industry has been particularly challenged. This was re/flected in valuations which were down 23.0% to \u00a30.5bn. These assets, like the hotels, are well placed to bene/fit from the expected consumer-led recovery. We continue to work on asset management initiatives across the portfolio to ensure it is well positioned for sale.\n\nOur ten retail parks performed more strongly, bene/fiting from their open-air design and increased spending on home and leisure products. However, the portfolio was not immune from the challenges faced by the wider market and values declined by 10.1% to \u00a30.4bn. The valuation declines in retail parks are less pronounced than other retail assets, and there has been increased investor demand for stronger retail parks in recent months.\n\nThe F&B segment of both portfolios has been challenged but we have responded quickly to replace operators. In response to Pizza Hut entering CVA, we replaced three units with Canadian fast food operator Tim Hortons on 15 year leases. In addition, Tim Hortons will convert these units into drive-thrus. We have also completed two deals with both KFC and Burger King. At six sites, we have replaced units previously occupied by Chiquito, Frankie and Benny's and Bella Italia with foodhall operator Gourmet4 - their concept reverses the classic restaurant model with a delivery business supported by a strong eat-in operation.",

While conditions are now improving and we look forward to a full re-opening of the UK economy, the e/ffect of Covid-19 on our business and /financial performance has been signi/ficant.\n\nIn early April, we were quick to acknowledge the e/ffect of lockdown on our occupiers by setting up our \u00a380m customer support fund for those most in need. At about the same time, the Government introduced a temporary rent collection moratorium which has severely impacted our ability to enforce rent collection. With the moratorium still in place, there has been little incentive for our retail and leisure occupiers to make payments or even agree and document rent concessions from our customer support fund when they are able to withhold rent payments without consequences. While much rent due from leisure and retail occupiers has been withheld, it would be a mistake not to acknowledge those occupiers who have paid their rent and service charge in full, despite being negatively impacted by the pandemic. Hopefully, as retailers and leisure operators can now see a way out of the pandemic towards full re-opening, we will see a return to timely rent payments and agreement on how outstanding amounts will be settled.\n\nThe impact on our results from unpaid rent and service charges has been signi/ficant. During the year we have made bad debt provisions of \u00a3127m on top of the \u00a323m we provided in last year's results against quarterly rent due on 25 March 2020. This is an unprecedented level of provisions and is based on a cautious assessment of the impact of concessions, CVAs and business failures on how much rent we will collect. Time will tell whether we have been too cautious or optimistic in our assessment of these factors but it is our best estimate today based on our knowledge of each individual occupier. In total, we have provided for approximately 38% of the retail and leisure rent for the year. Covid-19 and lockdown has also led to a sharp decline in turnover related income from our hotels, car parks and outlets. The impact of reduced income and higher bad debt provisions is behind the decline in revenue pro/fit to \u00a3251m (2020: \u00a3414m).",

Over the year, our assets declined in value by 13.7% or \u00a31,646m (including our proportionate share of subsidiaries and joint ventures) compared with a \u00a31,179m decline last year. This decline in the value of our assets is behind our loss before tax of \u00a31,393m (2020: \u00a3837m loss) and the reduction in our EPRA net tangible assets per share in the year, down 17.4% to 985p.\n\n\u00a3(1,393)m\n\nLoss before tax (2020: \u00a3(837)m)\n\n1\n\n## Presentation of /financial information\n\nOur property portfolio is a combination of properties that are wholly owned by the Group, part owned through joint arrangements and those owned by the Group but where a third party holds a non-controlling interest. Internally, management reviews the results of the/uni00A0Group on a basis that adjusts for these forms of ownership to present a/uni00A0proportionate share. The Combined Portfolio, with assets totalling \u00a310.8bn, is an example of this approach, re/flecting the economic interest we have in our properties regardless of our/uni00A0ownership structure. We consider this presentation provides additional information to stakeholders on the activities and performance of the Group, as it aggregates the results of all/uni00A0the Group's property interests which under IFRS are required to be presented across a number of line items in the statutory /financial statements.\n\nThe same approach is applied to many of the other measures we discuss and, accordingly, a number of our /financial measures include the results of our joint/uni00A0ventures and subsidiaries on a proportionate basis. Measures that are/uni00A0described as being presented on a proportionate basis include the Group's share of joint ventures on a line-by-line basis but exclude the non-owned elements of our subsidiaries. This is in/uni00A0contrast to the Group's statutory /financial statements, where the Group's interest in joint ventures is presented as/uni00A0one line on the income statement\n\n## INCOME STATEMENT\n\nOur income statement has two key components: the income we generate from leasing our investment properties net of associated costs (including /finance expense), which we refer to as revenue pro/fit, and items not directly related to the underlying rental business, principally valuation changes, pro/fits or losses on the disposal of properties and /finance charges related to bond repurchases, which we call Capital and other items.\n\nWe present two measures of earnings per share: the IFRS measure of basic earnings per share, which is derived from the total pro/fit or loss for the year attributable to shareholders, and adjusted diluted earnings per share, which is based on tax-adjusted revenue pro/fit, referred to as adjusted earnings.\n\nand balance sheet, and all subsidiaries are consolidated at 100% with any non-owned element being adjusted as/uni00A0a/uni00A0non-controlling interest or redemption liability, as appropriate. Our/uni00A0joint operations are presented on/uni00A0a/uni00A0proportionate basis in all /financial/uni00A0measures.\n\nMeasures presented on a proportionate basis are alternative performance measures as they are not de/fined under IFRS. Where appropriate, the measures we use are based on best practice reporting recommendations published by EPRA. For further details see table 113 in the Business analysis section.\n\nDuring the year, following the strategy review, we changed how we report /financial information to better re/flect the way we manage our assets. Assets have been reallocated by strategic priority into one of four new segments: Central London, Regional retail, Urban opportunities and Subscale sectors.\n\nThe sector breakdown within our Combined Portfolio analysis disclosure has been re-ordered to re/flect the new/uni00A0segments and the level of detail reported in the CPA for the o/ffice assets has been reduced to re/flect the fact that all the London o/ffice assets are managed in a consistent manner irrespective of their location. The prior year has been restated in the new format and a reconciliation to the previous presentation has been provided on our website.\n\n| Income statement  Table                  | Year ended 31 March  2021  \u00a3m        | Table 8 Year ended 31 March  2020 \u00a3m   |\n|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Revenue pro/fit                          | /two.tf/five.tf/one.tf               | /four.tf/one.tf/four.tf                |\n| Capital and other  items /one.tf/five.tf | (/one.tf,/six.tf/four.tf/four.tf)    | (/one.tf,/two.tf/five.tf/one.tf)       |\n| Loss before tax                          | (/one.tf,/three.tf/nine.tf/three.tf) | (/eight.tf/three.tf/seven.tf)          |\n| Taxation                                 | -                                    | /five.tf                               |\n| Loss attributable  to shareholders       | (/one.tf,/three.tf/nine.tf/three.tf) | (/eight.tf/three.tf/two.tf)            |\n| Basic loss per  share                    | (/one.tf/eight.tf/eight.tf./two.tf)p | (/one.tf/one.tf/two.tf./four.tf)p      |\n| Adjusted diluted  earnings per share     | /three.tf/three.tf./nine.tfp         | /five.tf/five.tf./nine.tfp             |",

The loss per share this year was 188.2p, compared with a loss per share of 112.4p in the prior year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share decreased by 39.4%, from 55.9p to 33.9p\n\nthis year, as a result of the decrease in revenue pro/fit from \u00a3414m to \u00a3251m. There is no di/fference between our adjusted diluted earnings per share and the EPRA measure.\n\nThe reasons behind the movements in revenue pro/fit and Capital and other items are discussed in more detail below.\n\n## REVENUE PROFIT\n\nRevenue pro/fit is our measure of underlying pre-tax pro/fit, presented on a proportionate basis. A full de/finition of revenue pro/fit is given in the Glossary. Revenue pro/fit decreased by \u00a3163m to \u00a3251m for the year ended 31 March 2021 (2020: \u00a3414m) as set out in the table below.\n\n| Revenue pro/fit                 |                 |                          |                          |                   |                      |                           |                           |                          |                 |                        |                            | Table 9                     |\n|---------------------------------|-----------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------|----------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------|------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------|\n|                                 | Chart           | Central  London  \u00a3m      | Regional  retail \u00a3m      | Urban  opps \u00a3m    | Subscale  sectors \u00a3m | Total  \u00a3m                 | Central  London  \u00a3m       | Regional  retail \u00a3m      | Urban  opps \u00a3m  | Subscale  sectors \u00a3m   | Total  \u00a3m                  | Change \u00a3m                   |\n| Gross rental income /one.tf     |                 | /three.tf/zero.tf/six.tf | /one.tf/five.tf/seven.tf | /two.tf/six.tf    | /eight.tf/zero.tf    | /five.tf/six.tf/nine.tf   | /three.tf/two.tf/seven.tf | /one.tf/nine.tf/three.tf | /two.tf/nine.tf | /one.tf/one.tf/four.tf | /six.tf/six.tf/three.tf    | (/nine.tf/four.tf)          |\n| Net service charge expense      |                 | -                        | (/three.tf)              | -                 | (/two.tf)            | (/five.tf)                | /one.tf                   | (/three.tf)              | -               | (/two.tf)              | (/four.tf)                 | (/one.tf)                   |\n| Net direct property expenditure |                 | (/nine.tf)               | (/one.tf/three.tf)       | (/four.tf)        | (/six.tf)            | (/three.tf/two.tf)        | (/one.tf/three.tf)        | (/one.tf/nine.tf)        | (/four.tf)      | (/seven.tf)            | (/four.tf/three.tf)        | /one.tf/one.tf              |\n| Bad and doubtful debts expense  |                 | (/one.tf/seven.tf)       | (/six.tf/nine.tf)        | (/one.tf/zero.tf) | (/three.tf/one.tf)   | (/one.tf/two.tf/seven.tf) | (/five.tf)                | (/one.tf/eight.tf)       | (/three.tf)     | (/seven.tf)            | (/three.tf/three.tf)       | (/nine.tf/four.tf)          |\n| Segment net rental income       | /one.tf/zero.tf | /two.tf/eight.tf/zero.tf | /seven.tf/two.tf         | /one.tf/two.tf    | /four.tf/one.tf      | /four.tf/zero.tf/five.tf  | /three.tf/one.tf/zero.tf  | /one.tf/five.tf/three.tf | /two.tf/two.tf  | /nine.tf/eight.tf      | /five.tf/eight.tf/three.tf | (/one.tf/seven.tf/eight.tf) |\n| Net indirect expenses           |                 |                          |                          |                   |                      | (/eight.tf/zero.tf)       |                           |                          |                 |                        | (/seven.tf/four.tf)        | (/six.tf)                   |\n| Revenue pro/fit before interest |                 |                          |                          |                   |                      | /three.tf/two.tf/five.tf  |                           |                          |                 |                        | /five.tf/zero.tf/nine.tf   | (/one.tf/eight.tf/four.tf)  |\n| Net /finance expense            | /one.tf/one.tf  |                          |                          |                   |                      | (/seven.tf/four.tf)       |                           |                          |                 |                        | (/nine.tf/five.tf)         | /two.tf/one.tf              |\n| Revenue pro/fit                 |                 |                          |                          |                   |                      | /two.tf/five.tf/one.tf    |                           |                          |                 |                        | /four.tf/one.tf/four.tf    | (/one.tf/six.tf/three.tf)   |\n\n- /one.tf.

        "page_content": "Like-for-like net rental income was down \u00a3165m, with increased bad and doubtful debts accounting for \u00a394m of the decline. Further information on our rent collections and bad debt provisions is set out below. Like-for-like net rental income before bad debt provisions was down \u00a371m largely due to a reduction in short-term and turnover related income of \u00a356m and CVAs and administrations of \u00a322m, partly o/ffset by an \u00a311m reduction in direct property expenditure. Income from our Accor hotel portfolio, which is all linked to turnover, was down \u00a324m, while car park income reduced by \u00a315m. Turnover related top-ups, principally in our outlet portfolio, declined by \u00a311m and Piccadilly Lights, W1 saw a \u00a36m reduction from short-term advertising campaigns.\n\nOutside the like-for-like portfolio, there was a \u00a39m reduction in net rental income from proposed developments, driven by Portland House, SW1, which reached vacant possession of the o/ffice space in March 2020. There was also a \u00a39m reduction in net rental income following the disposal of 1 & 2 New Ludgate, EC4 and 7 Soho Square, W1 in the current year and Poole retail park in the prior year. The \u00a32m increase in non-property related income largely re/flects the release of a provision following an agreement which ended our obligations under one of our last remaining Land/flex leases.\n\n## Net indirect expenses\n\nNet indirect expenses represent the indirect costs of the Group including joint ventures. In total, net indirect expenses were \u00a380m (2020: \u00a374m). The \u00a36m increase is partly due to higher uncapitalised developmentrelated expenditure and professional and consultancy fees.\n\n## Net /finance expense (included in revenue pro/fit)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1.  Including our proportionate share of subsidiaries and joint ventures, as explained in the Presentation of /financial information above.\n\nOur net /finance expense has decreased by \u00a321m to \u00a374m due to reductions in interest payable following debt management exercises carried out last year, lower base rates and an increase in interest capitalised on our developments in the year.\n\n## Recent rent collections and related provisions\n\nIn early April, soon after the start of the /first national lockdown, we established a customer support fund of \u00a380m for occupiers most in need of our assistance with a focus on our retail and leisure portfolios. During the year, we have worked with our occupiers to agree rent concessions out of the fund and the payment of any outstanding balances. We also agreed with some occupiers for rents to be paid on a monthly basis, or to be deferred to later quarters to assist with cash /flow management.\n\n\u00a3110m of rent was due on the 25 March 2021 quarter day, including the Group's share of joint venture debtors. While this rent almost entirely relates to the 2021/22 /financial year, we are still required to assess its recoverability at 31 March 2021. The table below shows the amount and percentage of this rent collected to date after adjusting for the impact of customers having entered CVAs and administrations, concessions agreed out of the fund and agreed monthly and deferred payment terms. A similar analysis is shown for the rents which were due between 25 March 2020 and 24 March 2021.\n\nTable 13\n\n| Rent collections   25 March 202/one.tf quarter   |                           |                     |                |                            |                                  |                                |                              | Table 12                    |\n|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------|----------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n|                                                  | Gross                     | Impact of  CVAs and |                |                            | Agreed changes in  payment terms |                                |                              |                             |\n|                                                  | amounts  due  25 March \u00a3m | admins \u00a3m           | Concessions \u00a3m | Monthly  payment  terms \u00a3m | Deferred  payments \u00a3m            | Net  amounts  due  25 March \u00a3m | Amounts  received to date \u00a3m | Amounts  received to date % |\n| O/ffices                                         | /six.tf/three.tf          | -

Following legislation introduced as a result of the pandemic, the options available to landlords to recover outstanding amounts have been signi/ficantly\n\nreduced. As a result, there is limited incentive for those who can a/fford to pay rent to do so and for those who are in di/fficulty to agree and document concessions.\n\nGiven this situation, we have assessed the outstanding debtors for recoverability and provided \u00a3127m for bad debts in the year.\n\nThe provision includes \u00a342m for occupiers where we have agreed concessions out of our customer support fund and \u00a313m against tenant lease incentive balances. More detail on the amounts provided, including the impact on revenue pro/fit for the year, is included in the table below.\n\n| Provisions for bad and doubtful debts /one.tf           | Group \u00a3m               | Joint  ventures \u00a3m   | Table 14 Total \u00a3m       |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|\n| Provisions related to customer support fund concessions | /three.tf/seven.tf     | /five.tf             | /four.tf/two.tf         |\n| Other provisions for rents receivable                   | /five.tf/zero.tf       | /eight.tf            | /five.tf/eight.tf       |\n| Provisions for service charge receivables               | /one.tf/two.tf         | /two.tf              | /one.tf/four.tf         |\n| Tenant lease incentive provisions                       | /one.tf/one.tf         | /two.tf              | /one.tf/three.tf        |\n| Bad debt expense charged to revenue pro/fit in the year | /one.tf/one.tf/zero.tf | /one.tf/seven.tf     | /one.tf/two.tf/seven.tf |\n\n- /one.tf.

Nevertheless, we have taken what we believe to be a cautious view on provisions as we recognise the challenge of a gradual exit from lockdown, ongoing social\n\ndistancing and the risk of further CVAs and administrations. Of the total amount of rent outstanding at 31 March 2021, around 60% was covered by a doubtful debt provision.\n\n## CAPITAL AND OTHER ITEMS\n\n| Capital and other items /one.tf                     | Table          | Year ended  31 March  2021 \u00a3m     | Table 15 Year ended  31 March  2020 \u00a3m   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| Valuation and pro/fit on disposals                  |                |                                   |                                          |\n| Valuation de/ficit                                  | /seven.tf      | (/one.tf,/six.tf/four.tf/six.tf)  | (/one.tf,/one.tf/seven.tf/nine.tf)       |\n| Pro/fit/(loss) on disposal of investment properties |                | /five.tf                          | (/six.tf)                                |\n| (Loss)/pro/fit on disposal of trading properties    |                | (/one.tf)                         | /seven.tf                                |\n| Net /finance expense                                | /one.tf/six.tf | (/three.tf)                       | (/six.tf/eight.tf)                       |\n| Other items                                         |                |                                   |                                          |\n| Pro/fit from long-term development contracts        |                | -                                 | /three.tf                                |\n| Gain on settlement of liability                     |                | /four.tf                          | -                                        |\n| Other                                               |                | /one.tf                           | (/three.tf)                              |\n| Exceptional items                                   |                | (/four.tf)                        | (/five.tf)                               |\n| Capital and other items                             |                | (/one.tf,/six.tf/four.tf/four.tf) | (/one.tf,/two.tf/five.tf/one.tf)         |\n\n- /one.tf.

A description of market conditions and a breakdown of valuation movements by category are set out in the Operating and portfolio review (table 7).\n\n## Pro/fit/(loss) on disposals\n\nThe net pro/fit on disposals of \u00a34m in the year (2020: \u00a31m) relates to the sale of both investment and trading properties. We recognised a \u00a32m pro/fit on the disposal of 7 Soho Square, W1, in September 2020 and a \u00a35m pro/fit on the disposal of 1 & 2 New Ludgate, EC4 in December 2020.\n\nPartly o/ffsetting this was our \u00a32m share of the Nova joint venture's loss on disposal of Nova Place, SW1 and n2, SW1, which were acquired by the Group in the year, and a \u00a31m loss on trading properties.\n\n## Net /finance expense (included in Capital and other items)\n\nIn the year ended 31 March 2021, we incurred \u00a33m of net /finance expense that is excluded from revenue pro/fit principally due to premiums paid on the redemption of medium term notes.\n\n| Net /finance expense /one.tf                         | Net /finance expense /one.tf   | Table 16                      |\n|------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n|                                                      | Year ended  31 March  2021 \u00a3m  | Year ended  31 March  2020 \u00a3m |\n| Premium on  redemption of  medium term notes  (MTNs) | /three.tf                      | /five.tf/nine.tf              |\n| Fair value  movement on  interest-rate swaps         | /one.tf                        | /nine.tf                      |\n| Other net /finance  income                           | (/one.tf)                      | -                             |\n| Total                                                | /three.tf                      | /six.tf/eight.tf              |\n\n- /one.tf. Including our proportionate share of subsidiaries and joint ventures, as explained in the Presentation of /financial information above.\n\n## Gain on settlement of liability\n\nWe recognised a \u00a34m gain this year after settling the s106 liability at Nova, SW1, at a lower value than the previously anticipated cost of ful/filling the obligations.\n\n## Exceptional items\n\nWe incurred \u00a34m (2020: \u00a35m) of impairment charges during the year which have been classi/fied as exceptional. As a result of a decline in the value of Bluewater, Kent, an impairment test of the intangible asset related to the management rights for the centre was carried out. This resulted in impairment charges of \u00a34m in the year (2020: \u00a34m) against the intangible asset we hold in the balance sheet and \u00a3nil (2020: \u00a31m) against the related goodwill. At the year end, our intangible asset was \u00a32m and the related goodwill was \u00a31m.\n\n## TAXATION\n\nAs a REIT, our income and capital gains from qualifying activities are exempt from corporation tax. 90% of this income must be distributed as a Property Income Distribution and is taxed at the shareholder level to give a similar tax position to direct property ownership. Non-qualifying activities, such as sales of trading properties, are subject to corporation tax.\n\nThis year, there was no net tax charge (2020: credit of \u00a35m).\n\nThe Group has met all the REIT requirements, including the payment by 31 March 2021 of the minimum Property Income Distribution (PID) for the year ended 31 March 2020. The forecast minimum PID for the year ended 31 March 2021 is \u00a3143m, which must be paid by 31 March 2022. The Group has already made PID dividends relating to 31 March 2021 of \u00a349m, leaving \u00a394m to be paid in the coming year.\n\nOur latest tax strategy can be found on our corporate website. In the year, the total taxes we incurred and collected were \u00a369m (2020: \u00a3171m), of which \u00a325m (2020: \u00a347m) was directly borne by the Group including environmental taxes, business rates and stamp duty land tax. The Group has a low tax risk rating from HMRC.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Including our proportionate share of subsidiaries and joint ventures, as explained in the Presentation of /financial information above.\n\nNet cash in/flow from operating activities was \u00a3249m. Capital expenditure on investment properties was \u00a3220m, largely related to our development programme, with a further \u00a395m spent on acquiring investment properties, principally 55 Old Broad Street, EC2. Net cash /flow from disposals totalled \u00a3634m, with \u00a3550m received from the sale of 1 & 2 New Ludgate, EC4, \u00a378m from the sale of 7 Soho Square, W1 and \u00a34m from trading properties.\n\nThe most widely used gearing measure in our industry is loan-to-value (LTV). We focus most on Group LTV, presented on a proportionate basis, which increased from 30.7% at 31 March 2020 to 32.2% at 31 March 2021, due to the decline in the value of our assets partly o/ffset by the reduction in net debt. Our Security Group LTV also increased, from 32.5% to 32.7%, but to a lesser extent as we moved additional assets into the Security Group.\n\n## FINANCING\n\nAt 31 March 2021, our committed revolving facilities totalled \u00a32,715m (31 March 2020: \u00a32,715m). The pricing of our facilities which fall due in more than one year range from LIBOR +65 basis points to LIBOR +75 basis points. Borrowings under our commercial paper programme typically have a maturity of less than three months, currently carry a weighted average interest rate of LIBOR +11 basis points and are unsecured.\n\nThe total amount of drawn bank debt was \u00a3209m (31 March 2020: \u00a31,944m) with \u00a3906m of commercial paper in issue (31 March 2020: \u00a3977m). At 31 March 2021, we did not have any cash on hand (31 March 2020: cash balances of \u00a31,345m). During the year, the sterling bond and commercial paper markets normalised, having been e/ffectively closed to new issuance at March 2020. As a result, during the early part of the year, we repaid the cash balances we were holding as a liquidity bu/ffer at 31 March 2020. At 31 March 2021, we had \u00a31.6bn of available undrawn facilities, net of our outstanding commercial paper.\n\nThe weighted average maturity of our debt has increased to 11.5 years following a reduction at 31 March 2020 to 9.6 years after we drew down on our facilities. The weighted average cost of our debt at 31 March 2021 was 2.2% (31 March 2020: 1.8%). The weighted average cost of our net debt at 31 March 2021, which recognises the minimal interest income on cash deposits, was also 2.2% (31 March 2020: 2.4%).\n\n## DIVIDEND\n\nDuring the year we reinstated quarterly dividends, having suspended them due to the pandemic. We did not declare a /first quarterly dividend, but paid a second quarterly dividend of 12.0p per share which we viewed as a combined /first and second quarterly dividend at a level of 6.0p per quarter. A third quarterly dividend of 6.0p per share was paid on 30 March 2021. We are now recommending a /final dividend of 9.0p per share to be paid on 23 July 2021 to shareholders registered at the close of business on 18 June 2021. Together with the /final dividend, our full year dividend is 27.0p or \u00a3200m, up 16.4%. The /first quarterly dividend, payable in October 2021, will be announced nearer the time.\n\nAt 31 March 2021, the Company had distributable reserves of \u00a32.7bn. We do not anticipate that the level of distributable reserves will limit distributions for the foreseeable future.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMARTIN GREENSLADE\n\nCHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER\n\n<!-- image -->",

We will consider updating our materiality assessment in the coming year.\n\nWe set, and have already achieved, ambitious targets. For instance, in 2016 we became the /first commercial property company in the world to have its carbon emissions target approved by the Science Based Targets initiative. In 2019, having achieved our original science-based target (SBT) 11 years early, we increased our ambition and aligned it with a 1.5\u00baC scenario. Reducing operational carbon emissions in line with our SBT is the /first step towards achieving our commitment to becoming a net zero company by 2030.\n\nThrough our social sustainability programme, we're creating opportunities for people in our local communities, supporting those furthest from the job market in their search for employment, inspiring young people from diverse backgrounds about careers in our industry, and working with our communities to address important societal issues. Since 2019 we have created over \u00a311m of social value through these programmes.\n\nYou can /find further information on pages 56-67\n\n## SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS\n\nIn 2015, the UN General Assembly adopted a blueprint for building a sustainable future for all by 2030: the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

        "page_content": "## Social review\n\nThe pandemic has accentuated the inequalities in society and highlighted the importance of our social initiatives. In the short term, it accelerated the need to adapt our ways of working, training, volunteering and ensuring the safety of our people, partners, occupiers, visitors and local communities.\n\nIn the long term, many of the new ways we do things will prove to be better than the old, or o/ffer more /flexible options.\n\nExternally, events, protests and initiatives in wider society brought matters of equality and inclusion further into the spotlight, catalysing strategies and initiatives for education and change.\n\n## COMMUNITY RESPONSE TO COVID/hyphen.case19\n\nWithin communities around the UK, the pandemic has disproportionately a/ffected particular groups in society, with issues like poverty, unemployment, mental health and social inequality increasing. Our longstanding charity partners have experienced a huge increase in demand for their support. Given the impacts of Covid-19, businesses like ours have a heightened responsibility to make a meaningful commitment to long-term social sustainability in their communities. For us, this has meant increasing our focus on supporting those facing barriers including young people, prison leavers, and people experiencing homelessness and long-term unemployment - all areas we know will need continued support after the pandemic.\n\nWe set up a Covid-19 community support fund to provide both immediate and long-term assistance to our charity partners. To date, this fund has given over \u00a3500,000 of /financial support to the charities we work closely with, who do incredible work supporting vulnerable\n\npeople. This included a \u00a3100,000 donation to LandAid, the property industry's youth homelessness charity; we were proud to be a founding supporter of their emergency fund at the start of the pandemic.\n\nBeyond /financial support, we've used our resources, skills, people and spaces to help our local communities during Covid-19. We've been able to continue many of our employment and education programmes virtually, closely supported by our volunteers and partners. Our volunteers have helped with everything from employability mentoring, to inspiring students about careers in property, to giving pro-bono advice to our charity partners. We have had to work innovatively, launching projects to ensure our impact continues to be socially sustainable and bene/fits the people who most need support. This included our virtual mentoring programme with the Cardinal Hume Centre, our charity partner in Victoria. Landsec mentors have worked over several months with individuals facing barriers to work, to build their skills, con/fidence and motivation.\n\nIn London, our world-famous Piccadilly Lights became an important way for charities and public health bodies to run campaigns during lockdown. We were able to partner with a wide range of community organisations to raise awareness of important issues, including mental health, youth engagement and domestic abuse. We gave over \u00a32m worth of free advertising space to registered charities on Piccadilly Lights this /financial year.\n\n## SOCIAL VALUE\n\nSocial value is a way to describe the positive outcomes generated by businesses to bene/fit people, communities and society as a whole.\n\nAt the start of 2019, we set a corporate commitment to create \u00a325m worth of social value by 2025 through our four social sustainability programmes: community employment, education, charity partnerships and volunteering. At the end of the second year of our target, we've created over \u00a311m worth of social value through our programmes, with over \u00a36.5m of this in 2020/21 alone.\n\nFor more information about how we measure social value, please see our 2021 Sustainability Performance and Data Report\n\n## MEASURING SOCIAL VALUE\n\nEXAMPLES OF OUR REPORTING METRICS:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nJobs  created\n\n- Volunteer time and expertise given\n- Students  supported\n- Charity  donations\n- Space  given\n\nSkills  created\n\nThis year, despite the challenges of Covid-19, our charity partners around the UK have continued to provide exceptional support for our communities. We've continued to focus our investments on where we can have the greatest impact. Whether supporting people in /finding work, o/ffering career coaching to young people under-represented in the property sector, or opening up our spaces for charities to use, we want our impact to be targeted and sustainable.\n\n## SOCIAL VALUE IN OUR DEVELOPMENTS\n\nWe've also integrated the principles of social value measurement into our development process, so we can assess and understand the potential social value our upcoming projects create for local communities in addition to Section 106 obligations set by local authorities. This year, we began this for several development projects, including a local needs analysis for O2 Finchley Road to inform our planning consultation, a feasibility study in Lewisham to incorporate into our masterplan, and a social value statement to communicate to local stakeholders at Red Lion Court.",

Our programmes have helped 121 individuals who are further from the job market into work, and supported an additional 852 people with employability skills, creating \u00a31.7m worth of social value. We have continued to support people who face barriers such as homelessness, long-term unemployment and leaving prison, and young people with no previous work experience.\n\nWe've also expanded our wider support for our charity partners, to maximise their ability to engage local people. One example is Circle Collective based in Lewisham Shopping Centre, who help young people gain work experience and start their careers. This year we've helped the charity move to a larger unit within our shopping centre to create a community hub and reach even more young people in need of support.\n\nWe're also supporting the Government's Kickstart employment initiative, working with Circle Collective and our service partners in London. We're taking on a cohort of young people at risk of long-term unemployment as a result of Covid-19, helping them build work experience and skills for their future.\n\n## EDUCATION\n\nThis year, we've continued our commitment to helping young people from diverse backgrounds enter careers in property, in particular those who face barriers and risk becoming disengaged, running our education programmes virtually. Our aim is to provide role models for students, alongside transferable skills, industry insights and career opportunities. In turn, this helps us to bring more diverse young talent into our business and helps bring equal access to opportunities in real estate for young people from all backgrounds.\n\nIn London, we ran two Circl reverse coaching programmes, where over 30 Landsec employees coached - and were coached by - young people from diverse and under-represented backgrounds. Evidence shows this can increase a young person's chance of reaching their potential through employment, education or training. Circl not only supports young people in becoming future leaders through regular coaching by industry professionals, it also helps our workforce develop their own managerial and leadership skills.\n\nWe also ran our annual Future Property School with The Construction Youth Trust\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCIRCL REVERSE COACHING OUTCOMES\n\n## 75%\n\nof participants interested in a career at Landsec\n\n## 88%\n\nof Landsec employees involved say they now feel con/fident using coaching skills\n\n## 1,248\n\nhours of coaching training\n\n## 87%\n\nof young participants felt Circl helped them develop useful leadership skills\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCircl has really helped me to make a start on a range of personal goals - it feels like I/uni00A0have much more energy and/uni00A0focus in life now.'\n\nLANDSEC EMPLOYEE\n\nremotely for the /first time. This project works with 10 students from Victoria over three months, to learn about the di/fferent areas of our industry through weekly workshops with our volunteers and partners. At the end of the programme, students present their own ideas for sustainable developments at our 21 Moor/fields site in London. We've also joined Construction Youth Trust's Schools Partnerships programme to encourage students in Lewisham and across London to consider careers in property by meeting professionals from a range of exciting roles.\n\nOutside of London, our 'Made In' sustainability enterprise challenges at Bluewater, White Rose and Gunwharf Quays have continued. We've also started a new virtual employability project at our three Yorkshire retail sites - Trinity Leeds, Junction 32 and White Rose - with education social enterprise Ahead Partnership, to o/ffer local students careers awareness over lockdown.\n\n## Collaborating with/uni00A0the Cardinal Hume Centre\n\nThe Cardinal Hume Centre, one of our Victoria based charity partners, supports local young people, families and refugees at risk of poverty and homelessness. The pandemic has caused signi/ficant demand for this support. We work with the charity to help local people who face barriers, into sustained work, and this year, directly supporting 12 people into jobs. We also provided additional /financial support from our Covid-19 community support fund, helping them through this di/fficult period. Our volunteers have supported the centre this year, providing virtual work experience, pro-bono advice and a new employment mentoring initiative that has helped address the increase in people seeking employability support.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWithout my mentor, I wouldn't be on the right track - starting a new job, pursuing my education and dream.

We provided additional /financial and pro-bono support where needed, as charities have been hit by loss of funding and increased demand due to the pandemic. This year, we've given over \u00a34.7m worth of support to charities, including nearly \u00a34m of space in our assets and free advertising space on Piccadilly Lights.\n\nDespite Covid restrictions our teams have found innovative ways to engage visitors to our destinations in supporting causes important to our communities. At several shopping centres we've run Poppy Appeals and Giving Trees, which gave over \u00a3250,000 worth of support to local charities and people in need. Our local teams have also donated food, gifts and resources to help tackle the increased need.\n\nWe've launched new partnerships with several charities, including Providence Row, a leading East London homelessness charity, and with several Westminster charities through our work with the London Community Foundation, including St Andrew's Youth Club and Pursuing Independent Paths (PiP). We'll be supporting St Andrew's youth employability project, and at PiP we'll be helping young adults with learning di/fficulties gain life skills to help them /find work. Beyond this, we're expanding partnerships at our development sites to help local people access employment and training opportunities.\n\n## VOLUNTEERING\n\nOur volunteering programme helps our people and partners have a positive impact in our communities. We encourage all employees to take up to four workdays a year to use their professional skills and experience to support people and charities. This year, our workforce were just as enthusiastic, with working from home having a positive impact on participation. All our volunteering has taken place virtually this year, with technology helping us reach a wider audience in our communities and our workforce. We've\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nrun careers Q&As with employment charity partners including Key4Life, Bounce Back and Circle Collective, mentoring programmes with the Cardinal Hume Centre, mock interviews with Resurgo, industry insights sessions with students via Construction Youth Trust, work experience with Young Westminster Foundation and a signi/ficant amount of pro-bono volunteering through LandAid. In particular, pro-bono has enabled our sta/ff to use their business knowledge to help charities build their own resilience through the pandemic. We also know volunteering has a positive impact on our employees' own development and wellbeing, also important during the pandemic.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## FAIRNESS\n\n## REAL LIVING WAGE\n\nWe are committed to a fair wage at all levels of the business and fully support the UK Living Wage Foundation's approach of a hard day's work deserving a fair day's pay.\n\nWhile we continue to pay the Real Living Wage to all of our direct employees and partners across our London o/ffice portfolio, we have not been able to meet our 2020 Living Wage commitment fully across our retail portfolio. Recognising the impact the pandemic has had on businesses, particularly the retail sector, The Living Wage Foundation is allowing businesses to pause their accreditation during the pandemic. We will review our accreditation by November this year when there will be more certainty on the reopening of the UK economy.\n\n## ENGAGING OUR SUPPLY CHAIN\n\nThis year, we launched a new questionnaire to gain better insight into our suppliers' sustainability-related governance, performance and targets. The questionnaire has /five sections: policies and governance; labour and human rights; targets and performance; energy and carbon reporting; and collaboration, and asks for both current and forward-looking performance metrics.\n\nWe sent the questionnaire to all existing suppliers, and it now forms part of the onboarding process for new suppliers. Over 900 suppliers, representing over half of our total spend, have responded to the questionnaire. This primary supplier data has given us a much better understanding of our suppliers' sustainability performance, our collaborative impact, and key areas for improvement. Indeed, in March, Landsec was awarded the Supply Chain Data Award at the WDI's Inaugural Awards Ceremony.\n\nBuilding on the results of the questionnaire, in 2021 we will be increasing our work with high-risk suppliers and ensuring it continues to have an impact. Our aim is to work with our suppliers to reduce our collective environmental impact, improve the working conditions of those in our supply chain, and ultimately cascade this positive action throughout our supply chain.",

This covered a range of issues including debt bondage, labour exploitation, fair payment, health, safety and discrimination. We targeted high-risk areas of our supply chain, focusing on construction labour in the UK. Due to the pandemic, we had to postpone some surveys, but resumed in August 2020. We interviewed 91 individuals at three sites and found no instances of modern slavery.\n\nTo further improve our approach to identifying and managing modern slavery risk in our business and supply chain, this year we worked with not-for-pro/fit modernslavery specialist Stronger Together, who performed a gap analysis to identify areas for improvement. This reviewed all key business functions including procurement, risk, operations and development, and provided recommendations for improved governance, training, and management systems. We have collaborated with Stronger Together to develop a strategic implementation plan to address the recommendations.\n\nIn March 2021, we launched our new Modern Slavery Working Group, to provide practical insight and feedback on this, and continue to develop our policies, processes and resources.\n\n## DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION /parenleft.caseD&I/parenright.case\n\nWe strongly value diversity and aim to be an inclusive employer. We strive to attract, retain and promote employees from all backgrounds, regardless of their gender, race, religion, age or sexuality.\n\nWe recognise our sector still has work to do in fully embracing diversity and inclusion, and is not representative of the diverse communities we serve.\n\nWe also know the senior levels of our business do not re/flect the community, and we're working hard to address this.\n\nIn 2020, we focused on developing our internal structures and governance to help align our approach across our business. One of our /first steps involved developing our D&I strategy.\n\n## CHANGING AND CHALLENGING MINDSETS\n\nWe're galvanising our colleagues to challenge bias in themselves and others, and to take a zero-tolerance approach to discrimination in all our o/ffice and retail spaces.\n\nDuring the year our inclusive-leadership training was o/ffered to line managers and encompassed recognising bias, using inclusive-leadership principles to model inclusive behaviour, and planning an inclusive organisational culture.\n\nA number of senior leaders sponsor our a/ffinity networks, helping encourage inclusion from the top and interaction with a diverse range of colleagues. This includes our CEO sponsoring the disability and wellbeing network, Hand in Hand. We're also planning to o/ffer colleagues the opportunity to 'reverse-mentor' our senior management team, helping the team improve their understanding of the perspectives and experiences of a broad range of colleagues.\n\nWhile we are moving in the right direction, the Black Lives Matter protests of 2020 provided us and many businesses with a rude awakening. As a business, we re/flected on what we should do in response, and agreed on two things that would help contribute to building a fairer society.\n\n## Our D&I strategy focuses on four key areas:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBUILD  AND MAINTAIN/uni00A0A DIVERSE WORKFORCE AND TALENT PIPELINE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## INTEGRATE INCLUSIVE BEHAVIOUR AND VALUES IN OUR CULTURE\n\nPROVIDE INCLUSIVE SERVICES FOR OUR CUSTOMERS\n\nBUILD AN INCLUSIVE EMPLOYER BRAND\n\n- \u203a Ensure the recruitment process is fair, diverse and inclusive\n- \u203a Build a diverse talent pipeline\n- \u203a Provide inclusive learning opportunities for all/uni00A0employees\n- \u203a Host and attend events that promote Landsec as an inclusive employer and customer brand, so we can play our part in demonstrating the industry is a welcoming place for/uni00A0all\n- \u203a Enter appropriate industry awards and benchmarks\n\nTo oversee and keep us focused on this strategy, we've created a steering group, Landsec Includes, made up of key senior stakeholders from across the business and the leaders of our a/ffinity networks.\n\n- \u203a Support line managers in establishing inclusive behaviour\n- \u203a Promote inclusive network events\n- \u203a Promote work-life balance and wellbeing\n- \u203a Inclusive and accessible design\n- \u203a Inclusive policies, procurement and practices\n- \u203a Supplier diversity\n- \u203a Wellbeing",

Purple Tuesday in November was a highlight for the group. The aim  of Purple Tuesday is to improve customer experience for disabled  people. Run by the Purple Organisation, worldwide activities, this  year mainly run digitally, were launched by their CEO Mike Adams  and Landsec's CEO, Mark Allan, at Piccadilly Lights.

And, to /finding solutions that can help us build a balanced workforce for the long term.\n\nOur median gender pay gap narrowed from 34.3% in 2020 to 29.3% in 2021 and our mean gender pay gap narrowed from 37.7% to 36.6% over the same period.\n\nThis reduction in the gender pay gap is due to the average earnings of female starters being higher than female leavers, as well as more women in the upper middle income quartile, up from 42% in 2020 to 45% in 2021.\n\nIf we adjust our gender pay gap data to account for new starters and leavers that we already know about up to July 2021 the mean and median gender pay gap reduces to 32.7% and 28.4% respectively. The adjusted data includes 18 new starters up to July 21 (8 females and 10 males). The higher average hourly pay of male leavers compared to female joiners reduces the overall mean gender pay gap.\n\nOur ethnicity pay gap has been calculated using the same method as the gender pay gap. Of those included in the gender pay gap calculation 2% stated 'prefer not to say' for ethnicity and were excluded from the ethnicity pay gap reporting.\n\n## EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT\n\nThe impact of Covid-19 on ways of working was a focal point for employee feedback, which we gathered quarterly. We measured engagement on a scale of 1-10, with the average score being 7.6, and an average response rate of 58%. This relatively high engagement score was consistent throughout the year, employees appreciating Landsec's response to the pandemic, and the fact that no employees were furloughed.\n\n## GENDER PAY GAP\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTable 28\n\n| Quartile proportions         |                         |                     | Quartile split (hourly rate - mean)   | Quartile split (hourly rate - mean)               | Quartile split (hourly rate - mean)           | Quartile split (hourly rate - mean)             | Quartile split (hourly rate - mean)   |\n|------------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n|                              | No.                     | Male                | Female                                | Total Avg                                         | Male                                          | Female                                          | % Gap                                 |\n| Lower Income Quartile        | /one.tf/three.tf/six.tf | /three.tf/two.tf%   | /six.tf/eight.tf%                     | /sterling.tf/one.tf/six.tf./four.tf/seven.tf      | /sterling.tf/one.tf/five.tf./five.tf/eight.tf | /sterling.tf/one.tf/six.tf./eight.tf/eight.tf   | -/eight.tf./four.tf%                  |\n| Lower Middle Income Quartile | /one.tf/three.tf/six.tf | /four.tf/one.tf%    | /five.tf/nine.tf%                     | /sterling.tf/two.tf/five.tf./one.tf/zero.tf       | /sterling.tf/two.tf/five.tf./five.tf/eight.tf | /sterling.tf/two.tf/four.tf./seven.tf/seven.tf  | /three.tf./two.tf%                    |\n| Upper Middle Income Quartile | /one.tf/three.tf/six.tf | /five.tf/five.tf%   | /four.tf/five.tf%                     | /sterling.tf/three.tf/six.tf./four.tf/zero.tf     | /sterling.tf/three.tf/six.tf./four.tf/six.tf  | /sterling.tf/three.tf/six.tf./three.tf/three.tf | /zero.tf./four.tf%                    |\n| Upper Income Quartile        | /one.tf/three.tf/six.tf | /seven.tf/three.tf% | /two.tf/seven.tf%                     | /sterling.tf/seven.tf/seven.tf./seven.tf/seven.tf | /sterling.tf/eight.tf/two.tf./four.tf/four.tf | /sterling.tf/six.tf/five.tf./two.tf/seven.tf    | /two.tf/zero.tf./eight.tf%            |\n\n## ETHNICITY PAY GAP\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                              |                          |                    |                  |                                                |                                                |                                                | Table 30                            |\n|------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------|------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| Quartile proportions         |                          |                    |                  | Quartile split (hourly rate - mean)            | Quartile split (hourly rate - mean)            | Quartile split (hourly rate - mean)            | Quartile split (hourly rate - mean) |\n|                              | No.                      | White              | Ethnic  minority | Total Avg                                      | White                                          | Ethnic  minority                               | % Gap                               |\n| Lower Income Quartile        | /one.tf/three.tf/four.tf | /seven.tf/five.tf% | /two.tf/five.tf% | /sterling.tf/one.tf/six.tf./four.tf/seven.tf   | /sterling.tf/one.tf/six.tf./four.tf/four.tf    | /sterling.tf/one.tf/six.tf./five.tf/five.tf    | -/zero.tf./six.tf%                  |\n| Lower Middle Income Quartile | /one.tf/three.tf/four.tf | /seven.tf/six.tf%  | /two.tf/four.tf% | /sterling.tf/two.tf/five.tf./zero.tf/seven.tf  | /sterling.tf/two.tf/five.tf./zero.tf/five.tf   | /sterling.tf/two.tf/five.tf./one.tf/five.tf    | -/zero.tf./four.tf%                 |\n| Upper Middle Income Quartile | /one.tf/three.tf/four.tf | /eight.tf/five.tf% | /one.tf/five.tf% | /sterling.tf/three.tf/six.tf./four.tf/one.tf   | /sterling.tf/three.tf/six.tf./six.tf/three.tf  | /sterling.tf/three.tf/five.tf./zero.tf/nine.tf | /four.tf./two.tf%                   |\n| Upper Income Quartile        | /one.tf/three.tf/four.tf | /nine.tf/three.tf% | /seven.tf%       | /sterling.tf/seven.tf/eight.tf./zero.tf/two.tf | /sterling.tf/seven.tf/nine.tf./zero.tf/four.tf | /sterling.tf/six.tf/three.tf./nine.tf/three.tf | /one.tf/nine.tf./one.tf%            |",

        "page_content": "Working closely with our Employee Forum, we have adapted our approach to surveys this year, and the data has been vital to continuing to adapt our ways of working in response to the pandemic. We ran a full survey in May in response to the /first lockdown, followed by quarterly surveys in June, September and December.\n\nWe're also measuring readiness, as an indicator of how colleagues feel about returning to our o/ffices. The main concerns have been virus transmission and using public transport. We've addressed these as part of our Covid-19 response. Where we've communicated survey results, we've also said what we've done in response to previous surveys.\n\n## LEARNING AND DEVELOPMENT\n\nWe regard learning and development highly at Landsec, but are changing it from face-to-face to online. In September 2020, we introduced our online platform, Workday learning. Working with LinkedIn Learning and other providers, we added 20,000+ pieces of digital learning, now available to all employees round the clock, on demand, covering a variety of topics that apply to our business. This means we could carry on with even more relevant personal development, despite the pandemic.\n\nOur Thrive and Circl programmes are examples of our tailored programmes, aimed respectively at improving gender diversity and supporting our external community.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION\n\nThe rate of turnover reduced throughout 2020 to 14% from 27% in the previous year. Following the impact of Covid-19, leaver numbers reduced signi/ficantly throughout 2020, with voluntary turnover reduced from 12% in March 2020 to 6% in March 2021. In 2019/20, there were 77 voluntary leavers, whereas in 2020/21 there were 33 voluntary leavers.\n\nWe continue to improve retention by recruiting internally. Since last year, we have increased from 33% internal hires to 50%, with 27 people promoted in the last year (2019: 21).\n\n## INCLUSIVE RECRUITMENT\n\nThis year, our Sustainability team worked closely with our Diversity & Inclusion team and employee networks to increase diversity within our business and industry, and to increase inclusive behaviour throughout our community projects. We've set up a new inclusive recruitment project linking\n\nour community employment programme with our hiring managers, to better connect people facing barriers to career opportunities at Landsec. We've also collaborated with our Diaspora and Women's networks to establish a new mentoring programme with social enterprise Diverse Leaders Network, starting in 2021. This will target female and ethnic minority students from lower socio-economic backgrounds, to build their aspirations and careers awareness through regular sessions with Landsec mentors.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## HEALTH AND SAFETY\n\nOur goal is to provide healthy and safe places and communities that support our people and partners in realising their potential. We recognise we can only achieve this by working closely with our partners, including our supply chain, investors and enforcing authorities.\n\nHealth and safety considerations were central to our corporate response to the Covid-19 pandemic. In March 2020, we quickly established a taskforce to assess the impact of the virus on our operations, to interpret government guidance, and to develop and co-ordinate the rollout of new ways of working, so we could establish and maintain Covid-secure destinations and workplaces. The taskforce met regularly throughout the year to review and update our national and regional approach as the pandemic and the Government's requirements evolved.\n\nThe launch of our new corporate strategy prompted a review of our health and safety strategy and priorities. We consulted stakeholders from across the business to ensure we were addressing their needs and expectations for health and safety. Last year we changed our safety management system from the British Standard 18001 to the International Standard 45001. This year, our independent auditors conducted two rounds of remote auditing to maintain this accreditation. They found no non-conformances nor made any recommendations.\n\n## TRAINING\n\nWe run a comprehensive mandatory programme of health and safety training for all our employees and contingent workers, and this year we reviewed it to ensure it remains of high-quality, relevant, and up to date. The training is designed to ensure our people are aware of risk, and competent in identifying and managing our organisational risks. This year, we also launched a learning management system that has enabled us to provide most of\n\nthis training online, which improves where and when it can be completed. The system also simpli/fies booking and improves record-keeping and reporting.\n\n## FIRE SAFETY\n\nWe continue to enhance /fire safety across the business and ensure we meet new government initiatives and legislation. We have seven high-rise residential buildings above 18 metres in our portfolio, and independent /fire engineers are examining them all to ensure they remain safe for occupation and meet stringent new building regulations. If remediation is needed on the external walls, we will immediately implement interim safety measures such as changing the evacuation strategy, introducing waking watches, or installing temporary /fire-alarm systems. We will complete any remedial works as quickly as possible, with minimum disruption to tenants and local community.\n\nChecking we are achieving our high internal standards for health and safety is one of our key priorities. We have completed our full annual programme of 'Property health check' audits and client audits at all our development sites.\n\n## KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS\n\nWe introduced health and safety key performance indicators for our service partners and managing agents, that we review quarterly. We also undertook an internal audit during the year, to assess our /fire-safety systems and processes, and sought evidence of compliance to these arrangements in a sample of our operational buildings. We identi/fied and completed several improvements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## ANTI/hyphen.caseBRIBERY AND CORRUPTION\n\nWe are committed to the highest legal and ethical standards of conduct throughout every aspect of our business. Our relationships with all our stakeholders must be conducted in a fair, honest and open way. We have a zero tolerance for bribery and corruption of any sort and this is reinforced through our Code of Conduct. We also require our suppliers to have similar policies and practices in place. Over the summer of 2021, we will launch our new Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy and we have developed a compulsory training module which all our employees will be required to complete and will be part of the employee induction programme going forward.",

        "page_content": "## Environmental review\n\n2020 was a pivotal year. As the world came to a standstill following imposed lockdown restrictions across the globe, greenhouse gas (GHG) emission rates dropped. According to Science Magazine, there was approximately a 7% decline in the rate of GHG emissions.\n\n## CLIMATE CHANGE AND CARBON\n\nThis rate is actually what we would need year on year until 2050 to keep to the Paris Agreement. The reality, however, is that this was achieved while signi/ficant temporary disruption altered patterns of energy demand.\n\nDespite a drop in the rate of emissions, global temperatures kept rising due to the continuous emission of GHG globally, leading to unprecedented weather events, such as a record 38\u00baC recorded in June in the Russian tundra, north of the Arctic Circle.\n\nAmidst a pandemic, responding to climate change is still the top priority for governments and forward-looking businesses. Investor requirements for disclosure of climate change risks and opportunities kept increasing and our customers set ambitious climate commitments of their own, from sciencebased carbon reduction targets to net zero carbon commitments.\n\nThe Committee on Climate Change warned in its 2020 Progress Report to Parliament that emissions from the built environment have barely dropped in the UK, so a lot more progress is needed.\n\nDuring 2020, through thought leadership and advocacy, Landsec has been driving our industry forward in its response to the climate emergency. We've published our net zero carbon pathway, in line with the BBP Climate Change Commitment, participated in the UK Green Building Council net zero carbon\n\nframework development on renewable energy procurement and o/ffsets, and responded to the GLA New London Plan consultation and the Planning White Paper on sustainability.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## CLIMATE RESILIENCE\n\nLandsec considers climate change a principal risk and material issue. In line with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures' (TCFD) recommendations, since 2017 we've committed to assessing and reporting on material climate change risks across our portfolio, ensuring we have the appropriate strategy and mitigation plan in place. We provide our TCFD disclosure in the risk section on pages 76-77, with further details in the 2021 Sustainability Performance and Data Report.\n\nThis year, we have worked again with Willis Towers Watson in assessing and quantifying climate-related risks. This study has provided us with an updated view of these at portfolio and asset level, and allowed us to understand the potential /financial impact of transition risks, such as policy and legislation changes and shifts in market preferences. This is informing our approach to managing climate risks across our portfolio, including new developments.\n\nThrough our net zero carbon strategy, we're managing the transition risks, supporting our transition to a low carbon world. This strategy is helping ensure we remain resilient and relevant in the long term. Here we provide an update on how we are managing our net zero strategy, and progress to date.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs part of our Climate Change Commitment with the Better Buildings Partnership, in 2020, we published our Net Zero Carbon Pathway Framework, outlining our plans for net zero carbon for both our new and existing buildings. Our progress is as follows:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nREDUCE OPERATIONAL ENERGY USE AND CARBON EMISSIONS\n\n## a)  Progress towards our science-based target (SBT)\n\nThe /first step to achieving net zero is to reduce our operational carbon emissions. For that reason, as part of our net zero carbon strategy, in 2019 we increased the ambition of our SBT, aligning our carbon reductions with a 1.5\u00baC scenario. Our current target is to reduce our absolute carbon emissions by 70% by 2030 from a 2013/14 baseline. Our target includes scope 1, 2 and a portion of scope 3 emissions from downstream leased assets. This year we reduced our carbon emissions by 55%.\n\n## b)  Energy e/fficiency across our operational portfolio\n\nIt has been a turbulent year for energy management, and the lockdowns have naturally had an impact on how we operate buildings. With the fall in occupancy rates, we made an even bigger push towards lowering our energy use by maximising building e/fficiency while ensuring the health and safety of our occupants. To do this,",

        "page_content": "we use smart technology to gather data from our building management systems in several of our o/ffices, and having this detailed data helps us decide how we control energy-intensive service equipment in our buildings, and the services that we provide in our buildings are now running in line with occupancy. Consequently, this year we have been able to undertake various actions to improve the buildingmanagement systems at our London assets. For example, we have improved the e/fficiency and lifecycle of our cooling systems, as they now react more optimally to external temperatures. Our energy intensity has decreased considerably this year, by a further 29% compared with last year, and is now 43% below our 2013/14 baseline. Although this /figure suggests that we've already achieved our target to reduce energy intensity by 40% by 2030, we recognise that energy consumption has been signi/ficantly impacted by lower occupancy and operational hours due to Covid-19 restrictions and doesn't re/flect portfolio energy performance in normal conditions. For that reason, we'll continue tracking our performance against this 2030 target.\n\nIn addition, we acknowledge we must do more to further reduce our energy use and reach our net zero goal by 2030. We are therefore working to 'future-proof' our portfolio, so we can continue to operate in line with our ambition and meet the commitments we have made. To do this, we have mapped out the level of investment needed to reach our net zero target and identi/fied the priority projects needed.\n\nWe see increased customer engagement as having signi/ficant potential for energy savings. We are developing an engagement programme for increasing collaboration with our occupiers on initiatives to improve energy performance.\n\n## c)  Energy e/fficiency at new developments\n\nThe formal launch of NABERS UK in November 2020 was an important milestone, and Landsec has been supporting it over a number of years as Pioneers of the Design for Performance initiative led by the Better Buildings Partnership (BBP). NABERS UK is a new energy-e/fficiency rating scheme for in-use performance that will help commercial o/ffice developers and owners deliver and operate energy-e/fficient buildings and disclose their actual performance.\n\nWe've chosen Portland House and Timber Square as our two o/fficial Design for Performance Pioneer projects. Following the NABERS UK Design for Performance approach, the energy performance of our development projects has been independently veri/fied to targeted ratings. We're targeting operational energy performance for our new developments in line with those published by the UKGBC in its Net Zero Carbon Framework.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nINVEST IN RENEWABLE ENERGY\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSince 2016, all the electricity we procure is REGO-backed renewable through our corporate contract with Smartest Energy, and we are looking to move our procurement towards direct purchasing from renewable projects, through Power Purchase Agreements (PPA).\n\nWe also aim to increase the amount of renewable electricity we generate on our sites. Our current on-site renewable electricity capacity is 1.4 MW, and we are running feasibility studies for installing solar PV at three of our assets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## USE AN INTERNAL SHADOW PRICE OF CARBON\n\nAs part of our net zero strategy, we've set an internal shadow price of carbon to help us consider the cost of carbon emissions in our investment decisions. We established our price of carbon at \u00a380 per tCO 2 e based on the required investments in carbon and energy reduction to meet our science-based target. This price is also consistent with the United Nations Global Compact guidance on carbon pricing and the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy's forecast of carbon prices through to 2030.\n\nWe're using our internal shadow price to quantify /financially the long-term environmental risks associated with business decisions. For instance, deciding to redevelop an asset comes with a much larger environmental cost than keeping most of the building's structure. We will take a large number of implications into account, such as /financial returns, bene/fits to the local area and community, /flexibility o/ffered by the asset and overall quality of the experience; but it's crucial we quantify the environmental impact of our decisions and translate it into a well-understood metric - such as a /financial metric.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nREDUCE CONSTRUCTION I MPACTS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAcross our development pipeline, we've continued to prioritise reducing the embodied carbon in our supply chain.\n\nFrom early design to developed design, Timber Square demonstrated a 15% reduction in embodied carbon intensity, for an intensity just over half that of the typical benchmark. Timber Square uses an embodied-carbon Value Engineering schedule to track all proposed design decisions to the de/fined carbon budget set at developed design stage.",

        "page_content": "## Environmental review\n\n## continued\n\nPortland House will have an embodiedcarbon intensity of around 342 kgCO 2 /m 2 GIA, a third of embodied carbon compared to a typical new building, as we reposition the existing asset, retaining the existing structure. This approach reduces the extent of construction or demolition required and uses fewer materials, driving down both cost and carbon emissions. On our live development sites at 21 Moor/fields, Lucent, The Forge and n2, we've also been tracking closely the embodied carbon information arising from materials purchased and activities undertaken on site to date. We create this 'as-built' embodied carbon model for each project and match it against assumptions and speci/fications made at the design stage.\n\nWe measure supply chain carbon consistently, at every design stage and at regular points throughout the year for our projects on site. This allows us to see whether the procurement decisions made by our supply chain align with, or are better than, our contractual targets. That's how, for our four projects currently on site, we've been able to save more carbon through our procurement decisions than in the designstage speci/fications. Across the materials purchased to date, we've reduced 2,452 tonnes CO 2 more than anticipated. This represents a further 1.5% reduction across the four projects. While small given the limited scope to date, this will keep growing as works progress, and is further helping us meet our reduction targets.\n\nIn addition to monitoring the projects' carbon intensity, we also set for each project a reduction target for its design stage. Across our six live developments we are achieving a 15.6% reduction in embodied carbon from our design-stage baseline.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## OFFSET REMAINING CARBON\n\nTo be truly net zero carbon in construction, we will need to o/ffset emissions once we have minimised all those on site. We are buying our /first carbon o/ffsets for the Forge through a third-party provider. We ensure our o/ffsets meet the eight principles laid out by the UKGBC to safeguard the environmental integrity and guarantee the quality of the o/ffset.\n\n## WASTE MANAGEMENT\n\nWe continue to divert all our operational waste from land/fill, and have recycled 65% across our portfolio, performing below our target of 75% recycled and reused by 2020. Due to our diversi/fied portfolio, our waste management performance varies signi/ficantly across our assets. We have achieved this target across our o/ffice portfolio, outperforming it for the last two years, achieving 82% in 2020/21. In 2018/19, our shopping centres also outperformed our target, at 76.8%, leaving only the outsourced managed leisure and retail parks as the portfolio segments not achieving 75% recycled and reused.\n\nSince we set our waste target, we've seen a signi/ficant improvement in the accuracy of waste data. Using actual waste data rather than estimated data, and a better understanding of o/ffsite Material Recovery Facility (MRF) outputs, has resulted in a minor decrease in the reported recycling rates, especially within the retail portfolio.\n\nFinally, and most signi/ficantly, this year the recycling rate across our retail portfolio has decreased to 67% from 72% in 2019/20, as a direct consequence of Covid-19 restrictions. A reduction in recyclable materials produced by brand partners and F&B (such as packaging materials, cardboard and glass) and a change in operational procedures to minimise infection risk to operational sta/ff, has had a direct impact on the amount of waste collected as well as that recycled.\n\nThe 75% recycling target is still achievable, albeit challenging in the current climate. We are therefore extending our commitment for 75% recycling to 2030 to align with our expanded new construction-waste commitments announced last year. We will support this by working with our employees and customers to reduce, reuse and recycle waste, running campaigns and incentives across the business, building upon our successes of recent similar campaigns.\n\nAdditionally, we are running an in-depth waste auditing exercise at the third-party managed retail and leisure portfolio on sites that produce a signi/ficant amount of waste but are not achieving our recycling target. We will use this information when retendering for the waste service in this portfolio.\n\nAs part of our commitment to our community partners, we also donate any Surface Pros we no longer need to some of the charities we support.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## MATERIALS\n\nIn early 2020, we published our Prohibited Materials List. This sets the minimum requirements for sourcing materials on our projects. Since then, we have expanded its scope to provide guidance to design teams on materials that we would avoid, prefer and those that would be ideal. We circulate this guidance at the start of any project. From avoiding laminated glass to recommending air purifying paints, the list states clearly our expectation of highquality and thoughtful design.\n\nWith construction progressing on four of our sites, our procurement has been a lot more varied in 2020. Despite this, we remain on track to source 100% of our core construction materials with responsible sourcing certi/fication, and exclusively from the UK and Europe.\n\n## CIRCULAR ECONOMY INITIATIVES\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Closed-loop glass recycling\n\nGlass is in/finitely recyclable to its highest environmental value (that is, as glass) if it is segregated properly, so at Portland House we're working with our demolition contractors, Erith, to segregate it carefully. To date, we've removed just under 100 tonnes of glass from site, avoiding an estimated 29 tonnes of CO 2 . We anticipate recovering an estimated additional 200 tonnes of glass from the project as it progresses. The glass then goes on to a specialist contractor, eventually to be re-melted as /float glass. This improves on the traditional approach of mixing it with other waste to be used as aggregate.",

They're also typically wasted, discarded during strip-outs and demolition, only to be replaced by new tiles serving exactly the same function.\n\nThis is costly and environmentally wasteful, especially as the tiles will sit underneath a /floor covering. Tiles can be salvaged, cleaned, re-tested and re-installed. We work with one of the UK's largest recycling companies for raised /floors, developing a product where refurbished second-hand tiles can be painted with low-VOC paint, to ensure visual consistency on show /floors. We created a prototype during the works at Dashwood this year, which proved acceptable to many leasing and technical partners. We estimate the recycled tiles are at least 50% less carbon intensive than new ones which can signi/ficantly contribute to further reduce the embodied carbon of new developments.\n\n## WELLBEING\n\nHealth and wellbeing has been a central theme of our sustainability programme for a number of years, so we were well positioned to respond to the changes brought about by Covid-19.\n\nWe've formalised our approach by registering and assessing our live development schemes against the WELL Building Standard. This was a natural step as we have embedded health and wellbeing principles into our projects for a number of years.\n\nIn the past year, at Dashwood, we've also experimented with the WELL standard in our o/ffice products Blank Canvas, Customised and Myo, creating three wellness o/fferings to suit our customers' needs. For Blank Canvas, we are aiming to ensure any customer can achieve a WELL Core certi/fication if they wish. For Customised, we've created a speci/fic WELL /fit-out option for customers, including a handbook imparting the knowledge we have acquired over the years to help them ful/fil their own wellness aspirations. For Myo, we are hoping to be the /first /flexible o/ffice space in the City to achieve full WELL certi/fication.\n\nThis year we also committed to pursuing the WELL Portfolio Programme across our existing managed o/ffice portfolio, in addition to our new schemes. This will enable us to further improve the health and wellbeing of our customers by applying the 10 principles of the WELL Building Standard at scale. As part of this work stream we undertook an extensive review of our assets as well as our operational procedures which revealed a consistent level of quality. We will be testing our assets to establish their internal conditions and implement remedial measures where required to ensure the safety and wellness of our customers.\n\nWe've also created a comprehensive health and wellbeing brief for our commercial development projects and we're doing the same for our mixed-use Urban opportunities. These briefs set out the minimum\n\nrequirements we expect our design teams to meet, ensuring we maintain the same level of quality and diligence across all our development activities, from apartment layouts and daylight, to the design of the public realm.\n\n## BIODIVERSITY\n\nIn 2020, we expanded the scope of our Biodiversity Brief to include our mixed-use assets, and set an overarching goal to make our strategy more comprehensive across our entire portfolio. Our live developments remain on track to achieve signi/ficant biodiversity improvements in line with the brief.\n\nThis spring we also worked with an ecologist to conduct site visits to evaluate progress against our 2016 baseline. The results of this evaluation will help us identify further enhancements for the sites to help us reach our 2030 target.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## BUILDING CERTIFICATION BREEAM IN/hyphen.caseUSE\n\nThis year we undertook a pilot certi/fication of BREEAM In-Use at four key assets (Bluewater, Nova, 80-100 Victoria Street and One New Change). BREEAM In-Use assesses the operational impact of a building by key sustainability criteria including energy usage, environmental management, and health and wellbeing. All assets received a rating of 'Very Good', providing an e/ffective yet simple way to communicate the assets' sustainability credentials\n\nto customers and investors.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Digitising construction\n\nAs part of digitising our construction methods, we trialled QFlow, a cloud-based software, at the Forge. This automates site data collection and uses arti/ficial intelligence to provide accurate and immediate insights into waste and material movements to and from the construction site. It has proven extremely e/ffective at minimising environmental risk. We have set a number of responsible procurement targets at the Forge. Since starting on site, QFlow has identi/fied 159 risks early by /flagging any noncompliance at the site gate, removing any human handling errors and minimising the time needed to address them.\n\nIt has also given us insights into waste movements o/ff site, allowing us to think how we can manage our waste more e/fficiently. It is making our supply chain more transparent and has proven vital to staying on track to achieve our sustainability targets at the Forge. The trial was so successful we have extended it for the duration of the construction, and are now working with QFlow to increase use of their data in our reporting and planning.",

The Audit Committee supports the Board in the management of risk and is responsible for reviewing the e/ffectiveness of the risk management and internal control processes during the year.\n\n## IDENTIFICATION OF RISKS\n\nIdentifying risk is a continual process. We have established a network of risk champions across the business and we utilise this network, in conjunction with ongoing discussions with management, external agencies and stakeholders, to identify the risks facing our business. This forms the basis for the principal and emerging risks, which are challenged and validated by the Executive Leadership Team and the Audit Committee, before being presented to the Board. In addition, an in-depth risk session is held with the Board every two years, with the next review taking place in December 2021.\n\n## EVALUATION OF RISKS\n\nThe business considers both external and internal risks from the property business through to Group level. We use a risk scoring matrix to ensure risks are evaluated consistently. Our matrix considers likelihood, /financial impact to income and capital values and reputational impact. When we evaluate risk, we consider the inherent or gross risk (the level of the risk before any mitigating action) and the residual or net\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nrisk (the risk that remains after we consider the e/ffect of mitigating actions and controls). Where there is a relatively high inherent risk and relatively low residual risk, we know we have a high dependency on internal controls, which helps to focus the work of the Internal Audit function and other assurance providers.\n\n## MANAGEMENT OF RISKS\n\nOwnership and management of the risks are assigned to members of the Executive Leadership Team. They are responsible for ensuring the operating e/ffectiveness of the internal control systems and for implementing risk mitigation plans.\n\nThe Board undertakes an annual assessment of the principal risks, taking account of those that would threaten our business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity as well as the Group's strategic objectives. Our strategic review of the business over the course of 2020/21 had risk management as a fundamental part of the assessment criteria.\n\n## RISK APPETITE\n\nThe Board is responsible for de/fining the level and type of risk that the Group is willing to take and ensuring it remains in line with our strategy.\n\nThe Board regularly reviews the risk appetite of the business, reassesses the information available and the risk factors that are relevant. This ensures our risk exposure remains appropriate at any point in time and that risk is considered dynamic.\n\nOur risk appetite is cascaded throughout the organisation by being embedded within our policies, procedures and delegated authorities.",

        "page_content": "We formally report on the Group risks every six months to the Audit Committee and Board through a principal risk dashboard. This sets out risk appetite statements for each principal risk and risk tolerance ranges which explicitly align our risk appetite and the corresponding key risk indicators (KRIs) to our strategy and key performance indicators (KPIs).\n\nThe risk dashboard uses risk indicators to track whether our risk level is within our risk appetite. The risk indicators are a mixture of leading and lagging indicators, and internal and external indicators. The primary aim of the dashboard is to act as a catalyst for discussion about how the principal risks are moving, whether the risk tolerance ranges remain appropriate for the business circumstances, and whether further mitigating actions need to be taken in order to bring a risk back within the desired risk tolerance range. The KRIs are rated red, amber or green based on where the indicators sit in relation to our tolerance level.\n\nEach of the principal risks has a number of\n\nKRIs and we provide some examples of the KRIs against our principal risks in the table on pages 72-75. Any red rated KRIs will be discussed by the Executive Leadership Team and the relevant business units, with required actions agreed by the Executive Sponsor. These actions may be to refresh the risk tolerance range to re/flect a change in the business landscape and/or further mitigating actions. The agreed action will be noted in the Audit Committee and Board reports for /final approval by the Board. On an ongoing basis, we will continue to re/fine the tolerance ranges and to review regularly whether the KRIs continue to be the best indicators.\n\nOne of our successes this year has been to realign the principal risks to the new strategy and market segments. This was critical in ensuring that risk management was fully aligned to the changes to the organisational structure and that risk owners had full visibility and ownership of their risks. We provide further details on the changes to the principal risks below.\n\n## RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK\n\nAs shown in the diagram, we have an established risk management and control framework that enables us to e/ffectively identify, evaluate and manage our principal and emerging risks. Our approach is not to eliminate risk entirely, but to ensure we have the right structure to e/ffectively navigate the challenges and opportunities we face. We focus on being risk-aware, clearly de/fining our risk appetite, responding to changes to our risk pro/file quickly and having a strong risk culture among\n\nemployees. The Executive Leadership Team is responsible for the day-to-day management of risk. Senior managers also attend the Executive Leadership Team and the Audit Committee to discuss speci/fic risk areas, and will be accompanied by external advisers where relevant.\n\nSome of our speci/fic risk focus areas from this year included cyber security, data governance, /fire management strategies and contingency planning for a no-deal Brexit scenario. The Risk Management function, headed by the Director of Risk Management and Internal Audit, assists management with facilitating the risk discussions and provides challenge and insight where appropriate. The Risk Management function also oversees and provides support to a network of risk champions across the business. These risk\n\nchampions are critical in promoting a positive risk culture across the business and raising risk awareness.\n\nInternal Audit provides assurance to the Audit Committee and Executive Leadership Team in evaluating the design and operating e/ffectiveness of the risk management and internal control processes, through independent review. On a quarterly basis, management self-certify that the key controls within their area of responsibility have been operating e/ffectively. These results are independently validated by Internal Audit through sample testing. We continue to enhance and re/fine the key controls to ensure we have the most e/ffective set of key controls to mitigate our principal risks. An area of focus for 2021/22 is to update our assessment of the quality and completeness of assurance provided over each line of defence against a principal risk.\n\n## RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Risk Management team supported the business through the establishment of a workstream structure to assess and mitigate the myriad of risks facing the business as a result of the pandemic.\n\nThe Risk Management team also supported our Brexit no-deal risk planning, assessing the risks to the business and our supply chain that may have resulted from the UK leaving the EU with no trade deal by reference to three distinct workstreams: construction, operations and portfolio management. Upon conclusion of the negotiations and the /final trade deal being agreed, we have been focused on managing the operating risk of e/ffectively trading with partners who are based in the EU and ensuring we have robust processes in place to mitigate regulations around the movement of goods across borders.\n\nOur business resilience and risk planning has been tested over the past year in response to the pandemic and the business has responded very well to the challenges presented by the crisis. All levels of our organisation were rapidly mobilised to assess, plan, respond and mitigate the myriad of risks presented to the business by Covid-19.\n\nWe continue to operate a business recovery workstream and have detailed plans in place as we look towards a gradual easing of lockdown restrictions and a full reopening of the economy. The business is fully mobilised and ready to provide the best possible support to our customers, communities, employees and service partners during this transition back to normality.\n\nThe risk heatmap on the following page shows the principal risk positions for March 2021 before and after mitigating actions. It is important to note that our principal risks at 31 March 2020 re/flected the impact of Covid-19 with the UK under full national lockdown restrictions at this point and the majority of the economy already feeling the impact of the pandemic. As we look forward, our strategic priorities, market segments and key performance drivers have been carefully articulated in the strategy set out by the Board last year and we have realigned our principal risks and the risk owners to re/flect this strategic vision.\n\nThe long-term implications of Covid-19 are unclear and our strategy will continue to adapt to ensure we are managing near-term challenges proactively and focused on positioning the business for post-pandemic opportunities.\n\nIn 2021, we have split our Customer Risk into two segments to ensure that our risks are fully aligned to our new strategy; namely, Customer Risk - Retail & Hospitality (which includes London Retail) and Customer Risk - London O/ffice. At the same time we have absorbed key elements of the previous 'Disruption risk' into these two new segmental risks and accordingly, 'Disruption' will no longer be reported as a standalone principal risk.\n\n## CUSTOMER - Retail & hospitality is\n\nplaced in the top right quadrant of the heat map sitting in the position of the previous Customer Risk. This positioning re/flects the continued uncertainty around demand for this space and the outlook for these sectors. The pandemic impact on the retail sector has seen a notable increase in the switch to online shopping from physical stores as people stay at home to comply with government guidelines, and we expect some of this change is unlikely to reverse.\n\nCUSTOMER - London o/ffice is placed in the centre of our risk heat map re/flecting the overall lower risk pro/file of this segment of our business which has remained resilient through the pandemic and is supported by the successful introduction of our new /flexible o/ffice products. However, the reported success of workforces working from home provides ongoing uncertainty for this segment of our business with some companies reappraising their real estate options and how they plan to use the o/ffice going forward.\n\nThe change to our principal risks helps to clarify key market and organisational di/fferences in the way the risks are managed and addressed going forward. The risk table sets out further details of the nature of the risk and the mitigation actions we have taken as a business.",

The Committee meets quarterly and is the senior forum for developing and implementing sustainability strategy and commitments, assessing and managing climate-related risks, and reviewing performance.\n\n## STRATEGY\n\nAs a UK real estate company, our business is exposed to both physical and transitional risks and opportunities from climate change. We're committed to assessing and mitigating physical and /financial climate change adaptation risks that are material across our portfolio.\n\n## < 2 \u00ba C sce n a r io\n\n4 \u00ba C sce n a r io\n\nFor the third successive year, we have worked with Willis Towers Watson to identify and assess the impact of climate-related risks through quantitative and qualitative scenario analysis, considering short term until 2030, and long term beyond 2030 until 2100. Our analysis focuses on two distinct scenarios based on the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), which are used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to illustrate future concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere: a scenario where global average temperature increases by less than two degrees (RCP 2.6), and a scenario where temperatures increase by up to four degrees (RCP 8.5).\n\nIn line with the TCFD recommendations, our assessment covered both physical risks (i.e. physical impacts of climate change, such as /flooding events, windstorms, increase in temperature and sea level rise) and transition risks (i.e. risks related to the transition to a lower-carbon economy to avoid the worst physical impacts of climate change, such as policy and regulation changes).",

        "page_content": "Our analysis showed us that our current portfolio is not highly exposed to physical risks given the location of our assets and the impact of physical risks to our portfolio will only become more relevant in the long term, under a four-degree scenario. Conversely, transition risks are relevant in the short term as increasing mitigating actions to drive emissions reduction are expected, such as policy and regulation changes, as well as change in customer preference.\n\nOur strategy to address climate-related risks and opportunities spans all areas of our business including investment, development, operation and divestment. Through our Responsible Property Investment Policy, we assess climate risks when we buy an asset. In our development pipeline, we're designing and constructing high-quality buildings and spaces capable of delivering operational resilience over their lifetime, considering how the UK's climate will change in the coming decades. We're also transitioning towards all-electric solutions, scaling back fossil fuel-dependent boilers in favour of electric heating and cooling.\n\nAs part of our strategy to manage transition risks, we're committed to becoming a net zero carbon business by 2030 and we have a science-based carbon target to reduce our operational carbon emissions by 70% by 2030, aligned with a 1.5\u00baC scenario. In addition to reducing our operational emissions, by improving the energy e/fficiency in our assets, and committing to the procurement of renewable electricity, we've implemented an internal shadow carbon price to drive investment towards cleaner projects. We're also reducing carbon emissions across our construction activities by carefully designing and selecting every raw material we use. Further details on our net zero strategy is discussed on pages 64-66.\n\nOur analysis gives us con/fidence in the resilience of our strategy, as we're supporting the transition to a low-carbon world while managing the impact of climate-related risks to our portfolio.\n\n## KEY METRICS AND TARGETS\n\n| Climate-related Financial Metrics                                                                                                                    | 2020/21   | 2019/20   | Change   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|----------|\n| Percentage of revenues derived  from/uni00A0BREEAM certi/fied space                                                                                  | 62%       | 56%       | 11%      |\n| Percentage of portfolio which  is/uni00A0BREEAM certi/fied (by value)                                                                                | 57%       | 59%       | -3%      |\n| Percentage of portfolio which is  BREEAM certi/fied (by /floor area)                                                                                 | 44%       | 40%       | 11%      |\n| Percentage of portfolio with EPCs  rated F or G (by rental income) 1                                                                                 | 2%        | -         | -        |\n| Investment in energy e/fficiency  measures implemented in the year                                                                                   | \u00a31.6m     | \u00a31.2m     | 33%      |\n| Estimated annual savings from  energy/uni00A0e/fficiency measures  implemented in the year                                                           | \u00a30.8m     | \u00a30.5m     | 66%      |\n| Percentage value of portfolio located  in areas exposed to a 10% risk of  inland, coastal and /flash /flooding  in/uni00A0a/uni00A0ten-year period 2 | 7. 2 %    | 7. 4%     | -3%      |\n\nAdditional TCFD metrics and targets, including energy consumption and carbon emissions, are disclosed in our 2021 Sustainability Performance and Data Report at www.landsec.com/sustainability\n\n## RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nOur risk management and control framework enables us to e/ffectively identify, assess and manage climate-related risks. We recognise the importance of identifying and monitoring climate-related risks, which feature prominently on our principal risk register.\n\nOwnership and management of all risks is assigned to members of the Executive Leadership Team, who are responsible for ensuring the operating e/ffectiveness of the internal control systems and for implementing key risk mitigation plans. The Board undertakes an annual assessment of the principal risks. The Executive Leadership Team is supported by risk champions across the business, who are tasked with maintaining awareness of key risks and control measures.\n\nThe senior leader responsible for climaterelated risk is the Head of ESG and Sustainability. Our climate change principal risk includes both transition and physical climate risk and is monitored on a quarterly basis using a series of Key Risk Indicators. Both the senior leader and risk champion responsible for climate-related risk ensure appropriate mitigation actions are taken and integrated with the overall risk management process. Where climate-related risks correspond to other risks, these are discussed between the network of risk champions.\n\nOur risk management process to address our principal risks and uncertainties, including climate change is discussed further on pages 68-69.",

        "page_content": "## Going concern and viability\n\nThe Directors outline their assessment of the Group's ability to operate as a going concern and its long-term viability, taking into account the impact of the Group's principal risks.\n\n## GOING CONCERN\n\nThe Directors con/firm they have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for at least 12 months from the date of signing these /financial statements. This con/firmation is made after having reviewed assumptions about future trading performance, valuation projections, capital expenditure, asset sales and debt requirements contained within the period ending 31 May 2022 from the Group's current /five-year plan. The Directors also considered potential risks and uncertainties in the business, credit, market and liquidity risks, including the availability and repayment pro/file of bank facilities, as well as forecast covenant compliance. Further stress testing has been carried out to ensure the Group has su/fficient cash resources to continue in operation for at least the next 12 months following the deterioration in cash collections over the year ended 31 March 2021 as a result of Covid-19. This stress testing modelled a scenario with materially reduced levels of cash receipts over the next 12 months. Based on the above, together with available market information and the Directors' knowledge and experience of the Group's property portfolio and markets, the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts for the year ended 31 March 2021.\n\n## VIABILITY STATEMENT\n\n## THE VIABILITY ASSESSMENT PERIOD\n\nThe Directors have assessed the viability of the Group over a /five-year period to March 2026, taking account of the Group's current /financial position and the potential impact of our principal risks.\n\nThe Directors have determined /five years to be the most appropriate period for the viability assessment as it /fits well with the Group's development and leasing cycles and is broadly aligned to the maturity of the Group's /floating rate debt facilities.\n\n## PROCESS\n\nOur /financial planning process comprises a budget for the next /financial year, together with a plan for the following four /financial years. Generally, achievement of the oneyear budget has a greater level of certainty and is used to set near-term targets across the Group. Achievement of the /five-year plan is less certain than the budget, but provides a longer-term outlook against which strategic decisions can be made.\n\nThe /financial planning process considers the Group's pro/fitability, capital values, gearing, cash /flows and other key /financial metrics over the plan period. These metrics are subject to sensitivity analysis, in which a number of the main underlying assumptions are /flexed and tested to\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nconsider alternative macro-economic environments. Additionally, the Group also considers the impact of potential structural changes to the business in light of varying economic conditions, such as signi/ficant additional sales and acquisitions or re/financing. These assumptions are then adapted further to assess the impact of considerably worse macro-economic conditions than are currently expected, which forms the basis of the Group's 'Viability scenario'.\n\nGiven the signi/ficant impact of Covid-19 on the macro-economic conditions in which the Group has been operating, additional stress-testing has been carried out on the Group's ability to continue in operation under extremely unfavourable operating conditions. While the assumptions we have applied in these scenarios are possible, they do not represent our view of the likely outturn. The Directors have also considered reverse stress-test scenarios including one in which we are unable to collect any rent for an extended period of time. The results of these tests help to inform the Director's assessment of the viability of the Group.",

Good governance has been a critical foundation for Landsec's response to Covid, providing a framework for e/ffective decision-making, addressing the changing needs of our stakeholders and making sure that we emerge from the pandemic in as strong a position as possible.\n\n## PURPOSE, CULTURE AND GOVERNANCE\n\nWhen Mark joined as our CEO he emphasised that the culture of a business is as important as its strategy. Our culture will enable our people to execute on our strategy and we can only achieve our purpose when our culture and strategy are aligned. Our culture de/fines how we do things and how we behave and our governance framework plays a crucial role in this.\n\nIn a year of so much change, it has been particularly interesting for the Board to monitor the culture at Landsec, how the culture is being rede/fined under new leadership and how the existing culture has been tested through the challenges of remote working.\n\n## ENGAGEMENT WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS\n\nOur stakeholders' interests have changed as a result of the pandemic and therefore e/ffective communication with them has been more important than ever this year. The Board Strategy Day in January this year was centred around the long-term impact of Covid. We heard from medical and health policy experts, economists and customers. The Board enjoyed engaging directly with stakeholders, particularly our customers representing o/ffice, retail and leisure, to hear /first hand about the challenges that Covid has posed for them and what their priorities now are. You can read more about this on page 96.\n\nThe Board has been very conscious of the health and wellbeing of our employees given the impact of the pandemic and the challenges of adapting to remote working. The Board has received regular updates from the Executive Directors on the sentiment within the business and the initiatives being taken to promote health and wellbeing amongst the workforce. We look forward to more direct engagement with employees as we return to the o/ffice.\n\nDue to Covid restrictions, our 2020 Annual General Meeting had to be held as a closed meeting. This year, we are holding our /first hybrid AGM to ensure that we are able to e/ffectively engage with our shareholders whatever Covid restrictions may be in place at the time. Shareholders will be able to watch a live webcast with presentations from both Mark and me. We will cover our new strategy and business performance, and shareholders will then be able to ask questions and also vote remotely. Further information is set out in the Notice of AGM which is available at www.landsec.com/agm.\n\nAt our 2020 AGM, Edward Bonham Carter's re-election to the Board received 79.63% votes in favour, and as a result this resolution was added to the Investment Association's signi/ficant dissent list. Edward brings signi/ficant experience to the Board as our Senior Independent Director and a member of our Nomination and Remuneration Committees. It is clear that\n\nhis commitment to Landsec is not compromised by his other external appointments. However, we understand that some institutions apply their own guidelines in determining if a Director is overboarded. Ahead of Edward's re-election at the AGM in July, it is important to note that on 6 May 2021 Edward stepped down as Vice Chairman of the board of Jupiter Fund Management plc. He has taken up a new part time role at Jupiter focusing on stewardship and corporate responsibility, which is not a board position and will reduce Edward's time commitment.\n\n## BOARD ACTIVITIES\n\nIn addition to the scheduled eight meetings, the Board held three additional Board meetings during the year, one to discuss Landsec's immediate response to the pandemic at the beginning of the /financial year and two meetings to discuss our new strategy. Helping the executive management formulate the new strategy and responding to the challenges created by Covid were the main focus for the Board through the year. It was encouraging to see active capital recycling as outlined in the new strategy with the sale of 1 and 2 New Ludgate and the acquisition of 55 Old Broad Street. These transactions demonstrate the value that Landsec has created in its Central London portfolio and our commitment to optimising the Central London portfolio through the reinvestment of capital.\n\n## More information on the Board's activities during the year can be found on page 92\n\nI would like to conclude by thanking all members of the Board for their continued support and commitment over the past year. The majority of Board meetings have been held remotely with all Directors joining by video call. The Board has adapted well to this dynamic and its decision-making has not been a/ffected. However, the Board looks forward to the bene/fits of more informal engagement amongst the Board, the Executive Leadership Team and our employees that a return to the o/ffice will provide.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCRESSIDA HOGG CHAIRMAN",

        "page_content": "## CONFLICTS OF INTEREST AND EXTERNAL APPOINTMENTS\n\nThe Board has a policy to identify and manage Directors' con/flicts or potential con/flicts of interest and has delegated authority to the Nomination Committee to (i) approve or otherwise any such disclosed con/flicts, and (ii) determine any mitigating actions deemed appropriate to ensure that all matters in the Boardroom are considered solely with a view to promoting the success of Landsec. Directors' con/flicts of interest (which extend beyond third-party directorships and include close family) are reviewed by the Nomination Committee annually, with new con/flicts arising between meetings dealt with at the time between the Chairman and the Company Secretary. No new con/flicts were declared during the year.\n\n## OVERBOARDING\n\nWe follow the Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) proxy voting guidelines on overboarding and accordingly deem all our Non-executive Directors to be within these guidelines. We appreciate that other proxy bodies and institutional investors impose more stringent guidelines than ISS and that each individual's portfolio of appointments must be considered on a case-by-case basis, which the Board duly does before approving any appointments and then on an annual basis to assess whether each member of the Board is able to continue contributing e/ffectively. The Board was not asked to approve any additional external appointments for any of our Directors during the year.\n\n## EDWARD BONHAM CARTER'S COMMITMENTS\n\nAt our 2020 AGM, Edward Bonham Carter's re-election to the Board received a 79.63% vote in favour and, as a result, this resolution was added to the Investment Association's signi/ficant dissent list.\n\nLandsec identi/fied BlackRock as having cast the majority of votes against Edward's re-election and has engaged with BlackRock since to understand the rationale for its votes. BlackRock con/firmed that its voting decision was based on the concern that Edward was overboarded as a result of his position at Jupiter Fund Management plc (Jupiter) in addition to his appointments at Landsec and ITV.\n\nIn October 2020, it was announced that Edward would step down from Jupiter's board and relinquish his role as Vice Chairman in May 2021 in order to take up a new role within Jupiter focusing on its stewardship and corporate responsibility activities. This will be a non-board, part time role and therefore Edward's time commitment at Jupiter will signi/ficantly reduce.\n\nEdward attended all of the Company's Board meetings throughout the 2020/21 /financial year, and carried out his duties as Senior Independent Director which included additional time to run the internal Board evaluation process. Also this year, as a member of the Nomination Committee, Edward spent additional time on the appointment of the Company's new Chief Financial O/fficer and new Non-executive Director. Edward stepped down as Chair of the Remuneration Committee in May 2020 but is still the Senior Independent Director and a member of both the Remuneration and Nomination Committees.\n\nThe Board believes that Edward Bonham Carter brings signi/ficant experience to the Board and its Committees and continues to be in a position to dedicate su/fficient time to discharge his duties and responsibilities as a member of the Board and Senior Independent Director.\n\n## INDUCTION\n\nOur induction plan is delivered over the /first year of appointment. The aim is to enable a new Director to integrate into the Board as quickly as possible and feel able to contribute to business and strategy discussions, with su/fficient knowledge to provide e/ffective challenge.\n\nManjiry Tamhane started her induction in March 2021, prioritising on developing an understanding of Landsec's business and /financial position, strategy, culture, risks and opportunities and Board governance and dynamics. Key to this is spending time with the Chairman, the Executive Directors, other Non-executive Directors and the Executive Leadership Team. The induction will also cover the legal and regulatory obligations of a director of a listed company and the legal and regulatory environment in which the Group operates. More information on Manjiry's induction can be found on page 101.\n\n## TRAINING\n\nDirectors received regular updates in their Board papers, facilitating greater awareness and understanding of the Group's business and in particular the emerging strategy and the impact that the global pandemic has had on the business. In January the Board held a deep dive session into the long-term impact of Covid-19, hearing from medical experts, economists and our occupiers.

Flexibility and adaptability are key so that Landsec can emerge from Covid-19 in as strong a position as possible.\n\n## Executing the new strategy\n\nIn December 2020, the Board approved the sale of 1 & 2 New Ludgate for \u00a3552m. This was followed by the acquisition of 55 Old Broad Street for \u00a387m.\n\nThe transactions demonstrate the value that Landsec has created in its central London Portfolio and Landsec's commitment to optimising the Central London portfolio through the reinvestment of capital, as set out in our strategy. Our new strategy better aligns our capital and capability leading to greater value creation opportunities in the medium to/uni00A0longer term.\n\nMore detail on www.landsec.com\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## A YEAR OF CHANGE\n\nThis year, much of the focus of the Board has been listening to the views and perspectives of our new CEO Mark Allan, contributing to the refresh of the strategy and responding to the challenges posed by the pandemic. All Board decisions and matters have had to be viewed through a Covid-19 lens. Risks have had to be reassessed, the interests of our stakeholders have changed and had to be rebalanced and strategy has had to be re-contextualised. Flexibility and adaptability to long-term decision-making have never been more important. The Board continues to make decisions in a period of uncertainty which poses challenges but also opportunities.\n\n## BOARD MEETINGS\n\nThe Board attends eight scheduled Board meetings per year and will meet as required for additional discussions. This year, the Board held three additional Board meetings: one to discuss Landsec's immediate response to the pandemic at the beginning of April 2020; and two meetings to speci/fically discuss the new strategy.\n\nIf the Board needs to make decisions in between meetings, it can do so by unanimous approval by email but will only do so in such situations where the matter has been discussed at previous meetings so that Directors are fully appraised of the matter, have had the opportunity to ask questions and are therefore in a position to make a fully informed decision.\n\nThis year, the majority of Board meetings have been held virtually with all Directors dialling in by video call. The Board has adapted well to this change in dynamic and its operation and decision-making has not been a/ffected. However, the Board looks forward to the bene/fits of more informal engagement amongst the Board and employees that face-to-face meetings provide.\n\n## THE BOARD'S INPUT INTO THE STRATEGIC REVIEW\n\nThe Board held two additional meetings over the summer of 2020 to discuss the strategic review and resulting strategic plan. As part of this review, the Board considered the key concepts around which the strategy would be built: our heritage, our purpose, and global forces of change being the broad trends that will determine our focus and highlight the opportunities and challenges for Landsec. The resulting strategic priorities were discussed and approved by the Board after it had thoroughly considered what the strategy would mean for our investors, our other stakeholders, our culture and organisation and creating long-term sustainable value.",

This requires that Directors promote the success of the Company for the bene/fit of the members as a whole, having regard to the interest of stakeholders in their decision-making. Over the next few pages, we provide examples of how the Board engages with stakeholders and takes into account their interests when making decisions.\n\nAn introduction to our stakeholders can be found in our Strategic Report on pages 16-17.\n\n## STAKEHOLDERS AND BOARD DECISION/hyphen.caseMAKING\n\nOur stakeholders' interests have changed as a result of the pandemic and therefore e/ffective communication with our stakeholders so that we keep pace with their changing needs has been more important than ever. This, together with the combination of the consideration of long-term consequences of decisions and the maintenance of our reputation for high standards of business conduct, is integral to the way the Board operates and our overall governance.\n\nThe pandemic has created a number of situations where the opposing interests of stakeholders have had to be balanced and assessed in the Board's decision-making. For example, investors want to receive income by way of dividend but this had to be balanced with longer term interests of preserving cash during times of uncertainty and prioritising cash to be used to support our customers and communities most in need during the crisis. Short-term decisions such as suspending dividend payments and reducing Directors' pay had to be taken for the long-term bene/fit of Landsec and its stakeholders.\n\nWe have continued to embed stakeholder interests into the culture and operating model of our business. Papers presented to management committees always include an analysis of the impact of the decision on our various stakeholders.",

This was a great opportunity for the Board to engage directly with our stakeholders, particularly customers representing our o/ffice, retail and leisure portfolio, to hear /first hand the challenges that the pandemic has posed and their priorities as we emerge from the pandemic.\n\nAfter hearing from experts and/uni00A0our customers, the Board concluded the following:\n\n- \u278a We are going to be living with Covid-19 and the after-e/ffects for quite some time, particularly in a global context, and we need to plan accordingly.\n- \u278b There is huge value to be derived from staying close to our stakeholders and building and maintaining strong relationships.\n- \u278c Experience is everything. Whether it is employees in o/ffices, visitors to shopping centres or people in their homes, we need to understand what experience people want and deliver brilliantly.\n- \u278d With so much uncertainty ahead, /financial, strategic and operational /flexibility, agility and resilience are going to be key.\n\nThese points are going to remain fundamental considerations in the Board's decision-making going forward.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## WORKFORCE ENGAGEMENT\n\nFace-to-face interaction between the Board and the workforce was not possible this year but the Board was extremely conscious that the health and wellbeing of employees and the impact of the pandemic on Landsec's cultural journey was of increased importance during this challenging year. At every Board meeting, the Board has asked the Executive Directors for a report on the sentiment and mood within the business and was keen to /find out how employees were adjusting to the challenges of remote working and what actions were being taken to keep morale boosted and performance consistent.\n\nFive Employee Forum meetings were held during the year. Madeleine Cosgrave, one of our Non-executive Directors, attended the Employee Forum in December and discussed a number of topics including the impact of the pandemic on the workforce, our new strategy, the future of retail, culture and diversity. Madeleine reported back to the Board the outputs of her discussion with the Employee Forum and this was particularly useful to the Board to supplement its discussions on culture as it provided the Board with direct feedback as to how employees perceive culture and diversity at Landsec and what needs to change.\n\nChristophe Evain, as Chairman of our Remuneration Committee, met with the Employee Forum in March 2021 to discuss the proposed new Remuneration Policy and answered questions from the Employee Forum to ensure that the Policy was understood.\n\nMark Allan, our CEO, also meets regularly with the Employee Forum to answer any questions and get an indication of topical issues of importance to employees.\n\nThe Employee Forum reports back to the wider workforce on the outputs of their discussions with Board members, therefore e/ffecting a two-way dialogue.\n\nCressida Hogg, our Chairman, held a live Q&A session open to all employees to mark and raise awareness of International Women's Day. Cressida led a discussion on experiences and challenges of lockdown.\n\nWe are planning a series of employee and Non-executive Director engagement events to take place throughout the 2021/22 /financial year and will report on these in next year's Annual Report.",

The investor relations programme was conducted primarily using online meetings and conference calls due to the pandemic. Institutional investors were invited to attend our full year and half-yearly results virtual presentations. Over the summer, Mark Allan met with a number of institutions - a selection of holders and non-holders of our shares - to ensure their views were taken into consideration as part of the development of our new strategy. We held a Capital Markets Day in October which set out our new strategic priorities and information around our culture, capability and organisation. We extended our sustainability roadshow to two days and met with shareholders from the Netherlands and the UK. We engage with investors throughout the year on all aspects of environmental, social and governance matters.\n\n## INDUSTRY CONFERENCES\n\nIndustry conferences provide Executive Directors with a chance to meet a large number of investors on a formal and informal basis. Conferences attended this year included the UBS Global Property conference in London, the Kempen conferences in Amsterdam and New York, the Bank of America conferences in New York and London, the Citi conference in Florida, Barclays' real estate conference in London and Morgan Stanley's real estate conference in London. All conferences were virtual.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nInstitutional investors\n\n2,236\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur private investors are encouraged to give feedback and communicate with the Directors via the Company Secretary throughout the year.\n\n## 2020 ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING\n\nCovid-19 meant we had to hold a closed AGM. We invited shareholders to ask questions via email in advance of the meeting.\n\nAll resolutions put to the meeting received overwhelming support of investors with the exception of the re-election of Edward Bonham Carter which received just under 80% of votes in favour. See page 91 for further details. The results of the voting at all general meetings are published on our website: www.landsec.com/investors/ regulatory-news.\n\n## FIVE/hyphen.caseYEAR PRIVATE INVESTOR PLAN\n\nWe have a rolling /five-year private investor plan, the intention of which is to maintain an e/fficient share register, limited paper distributions, e/ffective communications and the provision of best-in-class service to our investors. Key activities under the plan that we have implemented this year include paying dividends by direct mandate only, (no longer by cheque), and a deemed consent mailing to reduce the number of hard copy communications.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## CREDIT SIDE INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS AND ANALYSTS\n\nOur treasury and property team held non-deal speci/fic meetings with credit side institutional investors and analysts after the half-yearly and full year results as well as answering any ad hoc queries from investors. Due to the pandemic these meetings were held online.\n\n## BANKS\n\nRegular dialogue is maintained with our key relationship banks, including at times weekly meetings or conference calls with our treasury team. Our treasury team also actively engaged with new and potential lenders.\n\n## CREDIT RATING AGENCIES\n\nDuring the year, business and /financial updates were provided by our treasury team, senior managers to Standard & Poor's, Fitch Ratings and Moody's as well as responding to ad hoc queries in relation to any signi/ficant press releases.

Mark Allan emphasised this upon his appointment as CEO at Landsec and this has triggered a focus on culture, in parallel with the establishment and execution of our new strategy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur culture is what makes Landsec a great place to work.\n\nRead more on www.landsec.com\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## HOW DOES CULTURE RELATE TO GOVERNANCE AND WHAT IS THE ROLE OF THE BOARD?\n\nAt Landsec we would like an authentic and supportive culture based on greater levels of empowerment and accountability. This will mean that we are better placed to assess and manage risk, make decisions and take action quicker and achieve better returns as a result.\n\nWhen driving cultural change, governance is a good place to start. An appropriate governance framework for decision-making, together with promoting an environment of trust, respect and accountability, are all fundamental to our culture. The Board plays an important role in monitoring and assessing our culture, particularly as we make a cultural shift.\n\nThis year, we started a journey to shape a culture we all want to be part of, which has involved input from employees throughout the business. Our employees told us that we need to be more agile in our decisionmaking, empower the right people to make decisions and become even more customer focused. Our culture will be underpinned by our values: inclusive, united, driven and determined.\n\nCulture is a speci/fic Board agenda item twice a year but discussed regularly as a key consideration in other Board discussions. This year's Board evaluation concluded that the Board is embedding culture into its mindset, not just when it is prompted to consider culture as an agenda item.\n\nSet out on the next page are four cultural themes that we feel are critical to operating our business model and executing our strategy. Each theme has a set of metrics that we reported on for the /first time last year and our assessment of our progress. These metrics are provided to the Board as context for its discussions on culture.",

It has also continued to assess the composition, succession plan and skills of the Board and its Committees, promote diversity through the business and have oversight of corporate governance.\n\n## BOARD AND COMMITTEE CHANGES\n\nMark Allan joined Landsec as CEO on 14 April 2020 and in October we announced the appointment of Vanessa Simms as our new Chief Financial O/fficer, following the announcement of Martin Greenslade's intention to retire from the Board.\n\nWe also appointed Manjiry Tamhane as a new Non-executive Director and Manjiry joined the Board at the beginning of March. You can read about the Committee's appointment process for both Vanessa and Manjiry on pages 103 and 102.\n\nStacey Rauch will step down on 24 June 2021, having served over nine years on the Board. Stacey remained on the Board post reaching her nine-year anniversary of appointment (January 2021) in order to help transition Manjiry Tamhane onto the Board.\n\nAs a result of Stacey's departure, we are making some changes to our committee composition. As of 1 June, Nicholas Cadbury joined the Nomination Committee, Christophe Evain joined the Audit Committee and Manjiry Tamhane joined the Remuneration Committee.\n\nI would like to take this opportunity to thank Stacey for her contribution to the Board over the past nine years. We have valued the depth of analytical thought that Stacey has brought to the Board together with considerable expertise of retail trends. Stacey has also been a great champion of diversity throughout the business. We will miss Stacey as a colleague and wish her all the best for the future.\n\nThe Committee is currently searching for one more Non-executive Director to join the Board to complement the Board's existing composition.",

We have also met the Parker Review target of one director of ethnicity on the Board by 2021.\n\n## INTERNAL BOARD EVALUATION\n\nThis year our Board evaluation was carried out internally. The evaluation concluded that the Board and its Committees continue to operate to a high standard and work e/ffectively. The Board believes it has added most value throughout the year in the strategic review and leadership transition. Areas of focus for the year ahead will be risk and opportunities coming out of the pandemic, people and talent pipeline and workforce engagement and culture.

Mark joined the Board and took over as Chief Executive with e/ffect from 14 April 2020.\n\nIn September 2020, Martin Greenslade, CFO, announced his intention to retire in 2021. In October 2020, Vanessa Simms was announced as Martin's successor. Vanessa joined the Board as CFO Designate on 4 May 2021 and became CFO on 1 June 2021 after Martin Greenslade stepped down from the Board on 31 May. More details on the recruitment process for Vanessa can be found on page 103.\n\n## NON/hyphen.caseEXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CHANGES\n\nThe Nomination Committee appointed Russell Reynolds, an independent executive search company with no connection to Landsec, to conduct a search for a Nonexecutive Director who had experience in data and analytics, which was a skills gap on the Board that had been identi/fied by the Committee. A short list of candidates was put forward by Russell Reynolds, and these candidates each met with all members of the Committee and also the CEO. The Committee concluded that Manjiry Tamhane would be an excellent addition to the Board, with a history of data analytics and also retail and therefore, recommended Manjiry's appointment to the Board. Manjiry was appointed to the Board on 1 March 2021.\n\n## DIVERSITY\n\nThe Board's policy on diversity establishes the importance of diversity in the broadest sense, not just gender or ethnicity but also experience, skills, professional background, tenure and also other di/fferentials between directors such as cognitive and personal strengths. The Board believes that diversity is crucial to create a high-performing, e/ffective Board, to provide a breadth of perspective and debate that aids decisionmaking and which supports and directs the business more e/ffectively.\n\nThe Nomination Committee works with executive search consultants to ensure they support our approach to diversity in providing a diverse selection of candidates for Board appointments and the selection can then be based upon merit and objective criteria.\n\nDiversity at Board level, sets the tone for diversity throughout the business. The Nomination Committee monitors our talent pipeline to ensure we have a diverse succession pool of talent being developed and maintained at all levels of the business. Maintaining a diverse workforce is as important as diverse recruitment and we continue to assess this.\n\nFurther information on diversity at Landsec can be found in the Social Review on page 59\n\n## INDEPENDENCE AND RE/hyphen.caseELECTION TO THE BOARD\n\nThe independence, e/ffectiveness and commitment of each of the Non-executive Directors has been reviewed by the Committee. The Committee is satis/fied with the contributions and time commitment of all the Non-executive Directors during the year. The Committee will always discuss the additional commitments of all Directors (including the Chairman) before recommending their approval to the Board. It considers potential con/flict issues as part of that assessment. The Committee is con/fident that each of the Non-executive Directors remains independent and will be in a position to discharge their duties and responsibilities in the coming year. From a governance perspective, the Board as a whole is independent.\n\nThe appointment of Mark Allan was rati/fied by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting (AGM) in July 2020. The appointment of Vanessa Simms and Manjiry Tamhane will be rati/fied by shareholders at the AGM in July 2021. Stacey Rauch will not be standing for re-election as she will be stepping down from the Board at the end of June. Martin Greenslade will not stand for re-election as he retired from the Board at the end of May. All the other Directors will stand for re-election with the support of the Board.",

Egon Zehnder has no connection with the Company or any of our individual Directors.\n\nThe key criteria for the search was technical competence (listed company CFO experience), customer focus, and preferably a real estate or consumer facing multi-site business experience.

Prior to that, Vanessa held a number of senior positions at other UK property companies, including Deputy CFO at The Unite Group PLC and UK /finance director at SEGRO plc.

As Senior Independent Director, Edward Bonham Carter conducted the Chairman's appraisal on behalf of the Board, having obtained views from the other Directors prior to this meeting.\n- \u203a Questionnaire: the Board completed an anonymous online questionnaire that addressed a broad range of issues and which enabled it to provide comments on a range of matters. The questions covered\n\nBoard performance, judgement and culture, the relationships between the Directors and the Executive, the content and scope of topics covered at Board meetings, and the nature and dynamic of Director contributions to meetings. Many questions were the same as last year to provide comparative results. This year we also added questions speci/fically to address the Board's contribution to the strategy review, the impact of Covid-19 on the business and the impact of Board meetings being held remotely.

Despite the challenging circumstances caused by the pandemic, the Board believes there has been a positive shift in its performance with the arrival of our new CEO, with greater emphasis on purpose and culture and a constructive contribution by the Board to the development of the new strategy. There were no material issues to report.\n\nIt feels like the mood around the Board table is positive, despite being di/fficult times, and the collaboration between the Executive and Nonexecutive Directors has become even closer during the year.'\n\nNON/hyphen.caseEXECUTIVE DIRECTOR\n\nThe Directors believe that leadership transition and strategy were the areas where the Board added most value during the year. Other areas of strength included the skills and experience of the Nonexecutive Directors both to challenge and support the Executive, and to contribute properly to Board discussion and decisionmaking. Directors believe that risk is well understood by the Board, and that culture and conversations in the Boardroom are positive and performance-enhancing. The Board would like more visibility of our sustainability agenda and this will be addressed in the year ahead.\n\nThe Board continues to be highperforming and adapted well to remote meetings. However, the informal discussions and interactions are missing and the Board will bene/fit in due time with the return to in-person meetings.'\n\n## NON/hyphen.caseEXECUTIVE DIRECTOR\n\nThe Board agreed that its dynamic had been adversely impacted by remote working and meetings held via video call and there was consensus that some of the informal face-to-face meeting time and the quality of interaction that this brings has been missed. This will be resolved once the Board is able to meet again in person and the Board looks forward to increasing its direct engagement between Board members and also with senior management.\n\nThe Non-executive Directors hold a private session at the end of each meeting to review the meeting, its performance, and discuss the agenda and set expectations for the next Board meeting.\n\n## OUTPUT OF 2020/21 BOARD EVALUATION: AREAS OF FOCUS FOR THE YEAR AHEAD\n\n## RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES COMING OUT OF GLOBAL PANDEMIC PEOPLE AND TALENT PIPELINE\n\n## WORKFORCE ENGAGEMENT AND/uni00A0CULTURE\n\nThe Board will increase its focus on risk particularly in the context of oversight of execution of the new strategy whilst coming out of the global pandemic and the risks and opportunities that this presents. The Board would bene/fit hearing more from external experts to talk about trends impacting the property sector.\n\nO u r o bj e c t i v e 21 /2 2\n\nThe Board would like more visibility of potential and talent coming up through senior management with greater exposure to the Executive Leadership Team and its direct reports both formally in meetings and through informal drinks, dinners and meetings on the /floor.\n\nThe Board would like more employee/NED events. These events will pick up on themes raised at the Employee Forum and will allow the NEDs to hear directly about matters that concern employees. Continued emphasis on workforce engagement will also enable the Board to gain a greater insight into culture at Landsec and the shift in culture that the business is striving to achieve.",

On behalf of the Board, the Committee manages the process by which risks are identi/fied, prioritised and managed.\n\nThere are two areas of key risk that the Committee has monitored over the year that I would like to note due to their importance: cyber security and /fire management. A risk management strategy has been established to identify and prioritise cyber security risks to improve cyber standards and practices across all our assets. Fire safety management is also being closely monitored by the Committee to ensure the correct measures are in place and risk management processes are being updated regularly.\n\nA global pandemic was not something most companies had identi/fied as a principal risk prior to 2020. The disruption caused by Covid-19 has illustrated how going forward we need to ensure that disruption risk is embedded into all our principal risks as appropriate. I am, however, reassured by Landsec's response to the pandemic which highlights how well embedded risk management is, the e/ffectiveness of the business resilience plan and how capable the business is in responding to a crisis.\n\n## FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nThe Group's /financial statements are of critical importance to investors and the Committee monitors the integrity of the Group's reporting process and /financial management. It scrutinises the full and half-yearly /financial statements before proposing them to the Board for approval. The Committee reviews in detail the work of the external auditor and external valuer and any signi/ficant /financial judgements and estimates made by management to ensure that it is satis/fied with the outcome.\n\nThe Financial Reporting Council (FRC) reviewed our 2020 Annual Report and Accounts and we were pleased that, based on its review, there were no questions or queries that it wished to raise nor any signi/ficant /findings. It was very useful, however, to receive some suggestions from the FRC as to how we could improve our",

        "page_content": "existing disclosures and we have addressed all the points raised in the preparation of this year's Annual Report. The FRC provides no assurance that our report and accounts are correct and its review was limited to considering compliance with the reporting requirements. The FRC accepts no liability for reliance on its letter by any third party, including but not limited to investors.\n\n## ASSET VALUATION\n\nThe valuation of our assets is an important constituent of our /financial results and measurement of our performance. We use CBRE, an industry-leading agency, to provide us with an external valuation of our portfolio twice a year. CBRE has extensive expertise and knowledge and uses this to provide us with a valuation prepared in accordance with the relevant industry standards. The valuation process is an extensive exercise that requires CBRE to evaluate the likely future /financial performance of each individual asset and apply recent, relevant transactional evidence in the market to determine an appropriate value at the period end. The Committee analyses, challenges and debates the valuations prepared by CBRE. Further, the external valuation process and the values ascribed to speci/fic assets are also reviewed independently by our auditor, Ernst & Young LLP (EY), as part of its audit scope. At 31 March 2021, the valuation contains a material uncertainty clause to re/flect the Covid-19 impact but only in respect of our hotel portfolio.\n\n## ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSALS\n\nDuring the year, in execution of its new strategy, Landsec sold 7 Soho Square, W1, 1 & 2 New Ludgate, EC4 and acquired 55 Old Broad Street, EC2. The Committee ensured that the accounting treatment of these material transactions was appropriate.\n\n## PROVISIONS FOR BAD DEBT\n\nOver the year, the Committee has closely monitored the cash collections of rents across the whole portfolio and we have seen a material reduction in cash collected this year. This indicates a likely increase in business failures and we are monitoring any customers in /financial distress, particularly with the end of the moratorium on enforcement action in June. This has resulted in increasing levels of outstanding debtor balances which we have assessed and made a judgement as to whether the balance is expected to be recovered, taking into account any concession agreements concluded and anticipating insolvency events. This analysis involves a signi/ficant amount of judgement and we therefore include provisions for bad debts as a signi/ficant /financial matter.\n\n## INTERNAL AUDIT\n\nLandsec has a combined risk management and internal audit function and the Committee believes that this works well based on the quality of the data and reporting from the Director of Risk Management and Internal Audit. The Committee reviews the scope, skills and competencies of this function each year and considers any recommendations for change. The knowledge, skills and resources of our own team remain appropriate and there is a bene/fit to having an internal team that has knowledge of how the business operates. This is coupled with a clear understanding that they may require and bene/fit from specialist external expertise from time to time. We believe that the combination of internal and external advisers continues to provide us with the best insight into areas of risk and appropriate controls, to ensure that the Committee receives clear advice and enables it to report to the Board that the systems of internal processes and controls are robust.\n\nThis year, the internal audit plan has reviewed matters including /fire safety management, outsourced service providers, purchase to pay, fraud risk and a 'Sarbanes-Oxley' readiness assessment. In the year ahead, the internal audit plan includes reviews for Piccadilly Lights, site cyber security, a major development, cultural framework and controls over Myo (our /flexible o/ffice product).\n\n## FAIR, BALANCED AND UNDERSTANDABLE\n\nThe Committee assessed and recommended to the Board that, taken as a whole, the Company's 2021 Annual Report is fair, balanced and understandable.\n\n## GOING CONCERN AND VIABILITY STATEMENT\n\nGiven the signi/ficant impact of Covid-19 on the macro-economic conditions in which the Group is operating, we continue to have a particular focus on the appropriateness of adopting the going concern assumption in preparing the /financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2021. The going concern statement is set out on page 78 and detail of the assessment can also be found under signi/ficant /financial matters on page 114. The viability statement, together with the rationale behind the chosen /five-year time horizon, is set out on page 78.\n\n## UK CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CODE/ FRC GUIDANCE ON AUDIT COMMITTEES\n\nThe Committee considered its compliance with the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code and the FRC Guidance on Audit Committees. We believe that we have addressed both the spirit and the requirements of each.\n\n## COMMITTEE EFFECTIVENESS\n\nThe Committee's performance was considered as part of the internal Board evaluation conducted this year. The conclusion is that we operate to a high standard, with clear priorities, well de/fined responsibilities and clarity around our work plan.\n\nThe composition of the Committee will change in June this year when Stacey Rauch steps down from the Board. I would like to express my thanks to Stacey for her contribution to the Audit Committee over the past nine years. On 1 June 2021, Christophe Evain became an Audit Committee member and I look forward to the perspective that Christophe will bring to the Committee.\n\nI would like to thank the other members of the Committee, together with management, CBRE and EY, for their support during a challenging year. I hope that you /find this review, and the report that follows, a helpful explanation of the work of the Committee.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNICHOLAS CADBURY CHAIRMAN, AUDIT COMMITTEE",

The terms of reference are available on our website: www.landsec.com/aboutcorporategovernance/board-committees.\n\nTo maintain e/ffective communication between all relevant parties, and in support of its activities, the Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive, Chief Financial O/fficer, Company Secretary, Director of Risk Management and Internal Audit, the partner and representatives of our external auditor, EY, and other members of the senior /finance team regularly attend Committee meetings.\n\nAll Directors are invited to attend meetings when the Group's external valuer, CBRE, presents its half-yearly property valuation.\n\nThe Committee has private sessions with the internal audit team. In addition, the Committee Chairman has private and informal sessions with the EY audit team and the CBRE valuation team to ensure that open lines of communication exist, in case they wish to raise any concerns outside of formal meetings.\n\nThe Committee members are all independent Non-executive Directors and collectively have a broad range of /financial, commercial and property sector expertise that enables them to provide oversight of both /financial and risk matters, and to advise the Board accordingly. The Board has determined that Nicholas Cadbury, as Chairman of the Committee, has recent and relevant /financial experience for the purposes of satisfying the UK Corporate Governance Code.

        "page_content": "The Committee works to a structured programme of activities and meetings to coincide with key events around our /financial calendar and, on behalf of the Board, to provide oversight of the Group's risk management process. Following each meeting or whenever it may be appropriate, the Committee Chairman reports on the main discussion points and /findings to the Board.\n\n## RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK\n\nThe Board is responsible for determining both the nature and extent of the Group's risk management framework and the risk appetite that is acceptable in seeking to achieve its strategic objectives. The Committee supports the Board in the management of risk and is responsible for reviewing the e/ffectiveness of risk management and internal control processes during the year.\n\nAn overview of the risk management process explaining the key elements of the approach to risk, any changes to the process over the course of the current year and the key risk management priorities for 2021/22 are described on page 68. This includes the risk management process, by which the Executive Leadership Team completes a detailed review of the business risks, controls and mitigation strategies which form the basis for the principal and emerging risks, before being assessed by the Audit Committee.\n\nThe risk dashboard uses indicators to track whether our risk level is within our risk appetite and this triggers discussion by the Committee as to how the principal risks are moving and whether the risk tolerance ranges remain appropriate.\n\nIn its year end assessment, the Audit Committee has determined that the market cyclicality risk remains high due to forecasts of a stronger UK recession resulting from the pandemic but has decreased since last year and our halfyearly results on the back of achieving a trade deal with the EU on the conclusion of Brexit negotiations.\n\nThe customer risk has been split into two segments, one for retail and hospitality and one for London o/ffice. Customer risk - retail and hospitality is placed at the top right quadrant of the heat map, in the position of the previous customer risk, re/flecting the continued uncertainty around demand for space and outlook for these sectors. Customer risk - London o/ffice, is placed in the centre of our heat risk map re/flecting the overall lower risk pro/file of this sector which has remained resilient through the pandemic but is subject to some uncertainty given the reported success of home working and companies reappraising how they use o/ffice space going forward.\n\nPrimary responsibility for operation of the Company's internal control and risk management systems, which extend to include /financial, operational and compliance controls (and accord with the FRC's 2014 'Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and Business Reporting'), has been delegated to management. These systems have been designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve the Group's business goals and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss.\n\n## RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nUnder the overall supervision of the Committee, there are several subcommittees and work groups that oversee and manage day-to-day risk within the business. The Group has a Director of Risk Management and Internal Audit (with a direct reporting line to the Audit Committee Chairman) who provides regular oversight of risk matters, evaluates emerging risks that may a/ffect the business and monitors compliance to ensure that any mitigating actions are properly managed and completed. The Committee, in consultation with management, agrees the annual work plan (including any assistance that may be required from external specialists) of the risk management and internal audit function to ensure alignment with the needs of the business and compliance with its governance charter. This work plan is assessed against the risk register and market practice.\n\n## INTERNAL CONTROL\n\nInternal audits carried out by the Group and reviewed by the Committee included /fire safety management, Sarbanes-Oxley readiness, fraud risk and the quality of our development process.\n\nThe Internal Audit team also provided assurance to the Committee on key controls and programme assurance and used its data analytics capability to improve the identi/fication of any issues in key /financial processes, such as accounts payable and service charge management.\n\n## The key elements of the Group's internal control are as follows:\n\n- \u203a an established organisation structure with clear lines of responsibility, approval levels and delegated authorities\n- \u203a a disciplined management and committee structure which facilitates regular performance review and decision-making\n- \u203a a comprehensive strategic review and annual planning process\n- \u203a a robust budgeting, forecasting and /financial reporting process\n- \u203a various policies, procedures and guidelines underpinning the development, asset management and /financing operations of the business, together with professional services support including legal, human resources, information technology, tax, company secretarial and health, safety and security\n- \u203a a compliance certi/fication process from management conducted in relation to the half-yearly and full year results, and business activities generally\n- \u203a a quarterly self-certi/fication by management con/firming that key internal controls within their area of responsibility have been operating e/ffectively\n- \u203a a risk management and internal audit function whose work spans the whole Group\n- \u203a a focused post-acquisition review and integration programme to ensure the Group's governance, procedures, standards and control environment are implemented e/ffectively and on time",

The EU has also commenced steps to recognise the UK as adequate and data transfers remain unhindered under the Brexit deal.\n\nAs with all organisations, Landsec is eager to understand the international data sharing strategy for the UK government post-Brexit and has participated in consultations with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and the ICO. Landsec also chairs a forum for data protection representatives from the property industry to discuss, learn, share and promote privacy practices in the industry.\n\n## FIRE SAFETY\n\nNew /fire safety legislation is expected to come into e/ffect during FY2021/22 as a result of the Fire Safety Bill and Building\n\nSafety Bill. These will introduce new duties on property owners and superior landlords of multi-occupied residential buildings relating to building design, construction and /fire risk management. Working with /fire safety experts, we are anticipating these changes and their potential impact on the design and management of new and existing buildings.\n\n## EXTERNAL AUDITOR\n\nEY are Landsec's external auditor and are engaged to conduct a statutory audit and express an opinion on the Company's and the Group's /financial statements. Their audit scope includes a review of the property valuation process and methodology using its own chartered surveyors (more details below), to the extent necessary to express an audit opinion.\n\nWhen carrying out its statutory audit work, EY also has access to a broader range of employees and di/fferent parts of the business. If it picks up any information as part of this process, it would report to the Audit Committee anything that it believes the Committee should know in order to ful/fil its duties and responsibilities. As audit partner, Kathryn Barrow is authorised to contact the Committee Chairman directly at any time to raise any matter of concern.\n\n## AUDIT PLAN\n\nEY presented its proposed audit plan (reviewed by senior management and the Director of Risk Management and Internal Audit) to the Committee for discussion. The objective was to ensure that the focus of its work remained aligned to the Group's structure and new strategy.\n\nThe Committee is keen to ensure that its auditor feels able to challenge",

These matters may be /financial or non-/financial and may be based on fact or opinion (including any concern over culture or behaviour). An example may be the use or adequacy of any controls used by the Company to detect any fraud or improper behaviour.\n\nEY is a/fforded such access through attendance at each Committee meeting, supported by other meetings held during the year with the Committee Chairman without management being present and the knowledge that it can raise any matter of concern to the Committee Chairman at any time without going through management. During the year, no issues were reported to the Committee.\n\n## INDEPENDENCE AND OBJECTIVITY\n\nThe Committee is responsible for monitoring and reviewing the objectivity and independence of the external auditor. In undertaking its annual assessment, the Committee took into account the new UK Ethical Independence Standards introduced by the FRC in December 2019 and e/ffective from 15 March 2020.\n\nThe Committee reviewed:\n\n- \u203a the con/firmation from EY that it maintains appropriate internal safeguards in line with applicable professional standards, together with an explanation of the due diligence process followed to provide such a con/firmation\n- \u203a the mitigation actions we take in seeking to safeguard EY's independent status, including the operation of policies designed to regulate the amount of non-audit services provided by EY and the employment of former EY employees\n- \u203a the tenure of the audit engagement partner (not being greater than /five years); Kathryn Barrow was appointed as EY audit partner to the Group in June 2018\n- \u203a the internal performance and e/ffectiveness review of EY referred to above.\n\nThe EY partner in charge of the valuation specialist team rotated during the year.\n\nNo Committee member has any connection with the current auditor.\n\nTaking the above review into account, the Committee concluded that EY remained objective and independent in its role as external auditor.\n\n## EFFECTIVENESS OF THE EXTERNAL AUDIT\n\nFollowing the issue of our Annual Report each year, the Director of Risk Management and Internal Audit conducts a performance evaluation and e/ffectiveness review of the external audit. This is conducted against structured guidelines in consultation with the Executive Directors and members of the senior /finance team. The Committee Chairman meets privately with the audit engagement partner before the Committee considers the results of the e/ffectiveness review. The Committee's preliminary view is that EY has again performed its audit services e/ffectively and to a high standard, and this is consistent with performance each year since appointment in 2013. Areas identi/fied for development will be shared with EY for inclusion in its audit and service delivery plans going forward.\n\n## AUDIT TENDERING\n\nEY was /first appointed to the o/ffice of auditor, following a competitive tender process, in respect of the 2013/14 /financial year.\n\nUnder current regulations, we are required to retender the audit by no later than the 2023/24 /financial year. Kathryn Barrow took over as audit engagement partner with e/ffect from June 2018. The Committee has assessed the quality, stability and continuity of the relationship with EY as the current auditor. It has recommended to the Board that it is in the best interests of the Company and shareholders to tender the audit contract by a date no later than that stipulated by the current regulations. There is no contractual obligation to remain with EY and the choice of audit /firm will remain a topic of consideration for the Audit Committee.\n\nOn the recommendation of the Audit Committee, the Board is proposing a resolution at this year's Annual General Meeting that EY be reappointed to o/ffice for a further year.\n\nThe Company has complied with the Statutory Audit Services Order 2014 for the year under review.\n\n## AUDIT FEE\n\nThe fees payable to EY for audit and assurance for 2020/21 (including the audit of the Group's joint ventures) are \u00a31.2m (2019/20: \u00a31.0m).\n\n## NON/hyphen.caseAUDIT SERVICES\n\nTo help safeguard EY's objectivity and independence, we operate a non-audit services policy that sets out the circumstances and /financial limits within which EY may be permitted to provide certain non-audit services.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It was decided that it would be in the interests of the Company to use EY for these services, recognising that the use of audit /firms for non-audit work should generally be kept to a minimum. Total fees for non-audit services, including the half-yearly review and other assurancerelated services, amounted to \u00a3190,000. Details of the fees charged by EY during the year can be found in note 8 to the /financial statements.\n\nThe total of \u00a3190,000 paid for non-audit services represented 17.9% of the Group audit fee payable to EY during the year (excluding the audit of the Group's joint ventures). No non-audit fees were approved or paid on a contingent basis.\n\n## EXTERNAL VALUATIONS AND VALUERS\n\nThe valuation of the Group's property portfolio, including properties held within the development programme and in joint arrangements, is undertaken by external valuers. The Group provides input, such as source data, and support to the valuation process. CBRE has been the Company's principal valuer since 2015 and was reappointed in 2019 for a further three-year period.\n\nThe valuation helps to determine a signi/ficant part of the Group's total property return and net asset value, which have consequential implications for the Group's reported performance and the level of variable remuneration received by senior management through bonus and long-term incentive schemes. Accordingly, the scrutiny of each valuation and the valuer's objectivity and e/ffectiveness represent an important part of the Committee's work.\n\nThe London Portfolio was inspected by CBRE as normal during the year and as a result of Covid-19, approximately 75% of our shopping centres and outlets were visited by CBRE and just under 50% of our leisure assets.\n\nValuations for the full and half-year were presented to the Committee by CBRE. These were reviewed and challenged by the Committee, with reference to CBRE's approach, methodology, valuation basis and underlying property and market assumptions. Other Non-executive Directors attended the full and half-year presentations. The Committee Chairman and other members of the Committee also\n\nhad separate meetings with CBRE as part of this process to provide an opportunity to test and challenge the valuation outcomes and the principles and evidence used in the determination.\n\nAdditionally, CBRE met with EY and exchanged information independently of management. EY has experienced chartered surveyors on its team who consider the valuer's quali/fications and assess and challenge the valuation approach, assumptions and judgements made by them. Their audit procedures are targeted at addressing the risks in respect of the valuations and the potential for any undue management in/fluence in arriving at them. This year EY identi/fied 39 properties (comprising 74% of the portfolio) for substantive review by its valuation experts primarily on the basis of their value, type, risk pro/file and location. A new valuation expert was brought onto the EY team to lead this year's valuation review. This year, EY was restricted in its ability to visit sites due to Covid-19 but did virtually visit two properties and completed analytical reviews over the input data for the valuations, comparing this to market data. The Committee reviewed the auditor's /findings.\n\nAn internal evaluation of CBRE's performance and e/ffectiveness will be conducted after the year-end results are /finalised with the results reported to the Committee.\n\nA /fixed-fee arrangement (subject to adjustment for acquisitions and disposals) is in place with CBRE for the valuation of the Group's properties and, given the",

The total valuation fees paid by the Company to CBRE during the year represented less than 5% of their total fee income for the year.\n\n## SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL MATTERS\n\nThe Committee reviewed four signi/ficant /financial matters in connection with the /financial statements, namely the valuation of the Group's property portfolio, revenue recognition, going concern in the context of the impact of Covid-19 and recovery of receivables and bad debt provisions. Further details are set out in the table on page 114.\n\nThese items were considered to be signi/ficant taking into account the level of materiality and the degree of judgement exercised by management and, in respect of the valuation, the external valuer. The Committee discussed these with both parties, as well as EY.\n\nIn addition, the Committee considered, took action and made onward recommendations to the Board, as appropriate, in respect of other key matters including accounting for property acquisitions and disposals, maintenance of the Group's REIT status and other speci/fic areas of individual property and audit focus.\n\nThe Committee was satis/fied that all issues had been fully and adequately addressed and that the judgements made were reasonable and appropriate and had been reviewed and debated with the external auditor who concurred with the approach taken by management.\n\n## NON/hyphen.caseFINANCIAL MATTERS\n\nThe Committee understands the level of reliance that is placed by shareholders on the statutory audit and the report of the external auditor. As noted in the Brydon Report, the purpose of the audit should go further than the /financial statements and help to establish and maintain deserved con/fidence in a company, in/uni00A0its directors and information for which they have responsibility in the Annual Report.\n\nWe report on alternative performance measures on page 227. The Committee debated and discussed these measures and agreed that they were appropriate for the business.\n\n## FAIR, BALANCED AND UNDERSTANDABLE\n\nThe Committee applied the same due diligence approach adopted in previous years in order to assess whether the Annual Report is fair, balanced and understandable, one of the key UK Corporate Governance Code requirements. The Committee received assurance from the veri/fication process carried out on the content of the Annual Report by the Executive Leadership Team to ensure consistent reporting and the existence of appropriate links between key messages and relevant sections of the Annual Report.\n\nTaking the above into account, together with the views expressed by EY, the Committee recommended, and in turn the Board con/firmed, that the 2021 Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the necessary information for shareholders to assess the Company's position, performance, business model and strategy.\n\n## WHISTLEBLOWING POLICY\n\nThe Board receives a whistleblowing report at each meeting and has overall responsibility for whistleblowing but the Audit Committee supports the Board in this respect. The Audit Committee reviews the Group's whistleblowing policy which allows employees to report concerns about suspected impropriety or wrongdoing (whether /financial or/uni00A0otherwise) on a con/fidential basis, and anonymously if preferred. This includes an independent third-party reporting facility comprising a telephone hotline and an alternative online process. Any matters reported are investigated by the Company Secretary, MD People and Corporate A/ffairs and the Director of Risk Management and Internal Audit and escalated to the Committee, as appropriate. During the year, no whistleblowing incidents were reported through the hotline, although one report\n\nwas received through a di/fferent channel, was fully investigated and no further action was deemed necessary. The report of the investigation was provided to the Board and the Committee.\n\nWe monitor whistleblowing awareness and remind employees that a dedicated hotline exists should they ever need to 'blow the whistle'. The arrangements also form part of the/uni00A0induction programme for new employees. Details of the whistleblowing hotline are included in our Sustainability Charter and procurement tender documentation.\n\n## ANTI/hyphen.caseBRIBERY AND CORRUPTION\n\nWe have updated our Bribery Risk Register during the year and anti-bribery controls have been assessed in a recent internal audit. In addition, we have reviewed and made improvements to how we record and approve activity related to our Gifts and Hospitality Policy. We have also developed a training module on Anti-Bribery and Corruption and this will launch Company wide during the coming year alongside a new Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy.\n\nThe Board has a zero tolerance for bribery and corruption of any sort and this is reinforced through our Code of Conduct. Our principal suppliers are required to have similar policies and practices in place within their own businesses.",

Revenue recognition (including the timing of revenue recognition,  the/uni00A0treatment of rents, incentives and recognition of trading  property/uni00A0proceeds)  Certain transactions require management to make judgements as to  whether and to what extent they should be recognised as revenue in  the year. Market expectations and revenue pro/fit-based targets may  place pressure on management to distort revenue recognition. This  may result in overstatement or deferral of revenues to assist in meeting  current or future targets or expectations. | CBRE proposed changes to the values of our properties and developments during the  year, which were discussed by the Committee in detail and accepted. Based on the degree of oversight and challenge applied to the valuation process, the  Committee concluded that the valuations had each been conducted appropriately,  objectively and in accordance with the valuer's professional standards. The Committee and EY considered the main areas of judgement exercised by  management in accounting for matters related to revenue recognition, including  timing and treatment of rents, incentives, surrender premiums and other property- related revenue. In its assessment, the Committee, in consultation with EY, considered all relevant  facts, challenged the recoverability of occupier incentives, the options that  management had in terms of accounting treatment and the appropriateness of the  judgements made by management. These matters had themselves been the subject  of prior discussion between EY and management. |\n| Going concern in the context of Covid-19  The Group's going concern assessment is dependent on a number  of factors, including the Group's /financial performance, the Group's  continued access to borrowing facilities and the Group's ability to  continue to operate within its /financial covenants.

Other sections of the Annual Report deal with the e/ffects of the pandemic on our business in more detail, but I would like to pay tribute here to all those at Landsec who have worked so hard to minimise the potentially devastating impact of the virus on our people, our partners and our customers.\n\n## DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION POLICY\n\nThis year we continued to apply the Remuneration Policy that was approved by shareholders at our 2018 AGM. However, as the policy is due to expire during 2021, we have undertaken a comprehensive review of executive pay arrangements.\n\nWe consulted with our major shareholders, the main shareholder representatives and with our people. In doing so, we took account of developments in best practice and investor expectations, as well as the speci/fic nature of our business and the sector in which we operate.\n\nThe Committee believes that the existing approach to Directors' remuneration remains appropriate for Landsec. We are, however, proposing several changes to the Remuneration Policy and its implementation to align it to the conclusions of our recent strategic review, to address feedback received at the 2020 AGM, and to re/flect recent developments in governance and good practice more generally.\n\nThe details of the proposed changes we are making to the Policy, which do not involve any increases to quantum, can be found on page 134, while the Committee's proposed implementation of the Policy for the year ending 31 March 2022 is presented below.\n\n## PERFORMANCE FOR THE 2020/21 FINANCIAL YEAR\n\nWe began the new /financial year with the country in lockdown, many retail and leisure destinations closed and our o/ffices, while open, largely empty given Government guidance to work from home. Conditions have improved from the early days of the pandemic, but the e/ffect of Covid-19 on our income continues to be signi/ficant.",

        "page_content": "## Directors' Remuneration Report - Chairman's Annual Statement\n\n## continued\n\nThe decline in asset values in our retail and leisure assets has continued, although our London o/ffices have been resilient with only a small reduction in values.\n\nOne of the /first steps we took to manage the e/ffects of Covid-19 was to suspend dividend payments in April 2020 in order to conserve cash in the face of signi/ficant uncertainty. Over the subsequent months, we have seen trading conditions begin to improve and consequently reinstated our dividend in November 2020.\n\nOur results clearly show the impact of the pandemic on our business, but Landsec remains in a fundamentally strong position. The high-quality of our portfolio and low leverage of our balance sheet provide a solid foundation for executing our growth strategy and creating value for all stakeholders. The business is well placed to capitalise on opportunities as they emerge.\n\nFor the year ended 31 March 2021 revenue pro/fit is down 39.4%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share are also down 39.4% to 33.9p. Asset values declined by 13.7% in aggregate re/flecting the weaker retail market, particularly shopping centres and retail parks and the vacating of proposed developments during the year. This resulted in a 17.4% reduction in EPRA net tangible assets per share to 985p.\n\nThese results are clearly re/flected in the variable pay awarded to the Executive Directors in respect of the performance period ended 31 March 2021.\n\n## ANNUAL BONUS PERFORMANCE\n\nWhile revenue pro/fit and total property return have been impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic, the performance of the Executive Directors and employees has been strong. This included the successful delivery of a number of initiatives designed to ensure that Landsec emerges from the pandemic in the best position possible, including maintaining /financial strength and /flexibility by successfully executing asset disposals, preserving optionality over the Group's development programme and strengthening relationships with our customers.\n\nGiven the above, the Committee believes that it is appropriate for the Executive Directors to receive annual bonuses for 2020/21. However, the Committee has also considered the experience of shareholders and stakeholders more widely during the pandemic in addition to recognising the Executive Directors' e/fforts and performance against the targets which were set.\n\nAs a result, the Committee agreed to exercise downward discretion to: (i) reduce the calculated outcome by 50%; and (ii) defer the entire bonus into shares for a period of three years.\n\nThis resulted in a bonus outcome of 16.2% of maximum (equating to 24.3% of salary), which is considered to be appropriate in the context of the performance of the Executive Directors and the impact of Covid-19 on our shareholders and wider stakeholders. See page 122 for further details.\n\n## LONG/hyphen.caseTERM INCENTIVE PLAN PERFORMANCE\n\nVesting of the LTIP is determined by performance against two equally-weighted measures of total property return (TPR) and Total Shareholder Return (TSR) relative to FTSE 350 real estate companies. Performance under both measures over the three years to 31 March 2021 was below the threshold level and as such there will be no vesting in respect of the 2018 LTIP award.\n\n## MANAGEMENT CHANGES\n\nOn 30 September 2020 Martin Greenslade announced his intention to retire from the Board during 2021. He will step down as CFO on 31 May 2021 and full details of the remuneration arrangements are explained on page 124.\n\nFollowing the announcement, the Board instigated a comprehensive search for a replacement CFO and after thorough consideration, Vanessa Simms was appointed. She joined the business on 4 May 2021 as CFO Designate assuming the role of CFO on 1 June 2021. Full details of her remuneration arrangements are set out on page 125.\n\nThe retirement of Martin Greenslade was comprehensively reviewed by the Committee. Noting that he took the role of Acting CEO prior to Mark Allan's appointment and after taking into account Martin's length of service, commitment to the business and his record in steering the Company through a turbulent economic environment, the Committee deemed him to be a good leaver under the terms of the bonus plan and LTIP. Furthermore Martin will continue in his role as CFO until 31 May 2021, providing his full support until a handover is completed on 30 June 2021; his 12-month employment and notice period will end on 29 September 2021 after which time he will comply with the Company's post-cessation shareholding requirements.",

BASE SALARY\n\nDue to the ongoing impact of Covid-19, the annual salary review due for June 2021 will not take place. The next salary review will be carried out in June 2022.\n\n## 2. PENSION\n\nConsistent with the UK Corporate Governance Code and recent investor guidance, our new CFO will receive a pension allowance of 10.5% of salary in line with the wider workforce. All Executive Directors' pension contributions will now be aligned to the wider workforce.\n\n## 3. ANNUAL BONUS\n\nFor the performance period ending 31 March 2022, Executive Directors will be eligible for an annual bonus of up to 150% of salary. Re/flecting Landsec's new strategy and a desire to simplify the current arrangements, revenue pro/fit will be upweighted slightly, absolute total return targets will replace relative total property return targets and a small number of key ESG objectives will replace business KPIs. Personal objectives will continue to be operated for a minority of the award albeit upweighted compared to prior years. Further detail is provided on page 128.\n\n## 4. LONG/hyphen.caseTERM INCENTIVE PLAN\n\nWe intend to grant awards under the LTIP in June 2021, which will be subject to performance conditions over a three-year performance period. Performance targets will be based on total business return, relative TSR, and carbon reduction. Any awards which vest will continue to be subject to a two-year post-vesting holding period. The Committee will consider the prevailing share price at the time of grant and it will also retain full discretion to apply a downward adjustment to the level of LTIP vesting in 2024 if it considers that the vesting value represents an unjusti/fied 'windfall gain' taking account of the level of performance achieved over the relevant period. Further detail is provided on page 129.\n\n## REMUNERATION ACROSS THE COMPANY\n\nThe Committee oversees all remuneration policies and practices across the organisation, and is regularly briefed by the MD, People and Corporate Services on their implementation. When making any decisions on remuneration matters, the Committee takes account of the interests of all internal and external stakeholders. During the current year, we reviewed the bonus scheme for our sta/ff and agreed measures to simplify the scheme, more closely aligning it to the Executive Director bonus scheme.\n\n## GENDER PAY GAP\n\nDuring the course of the year, the Committee was pleased to see that the Company's gender pay gap had improved. However, we remain concerned about the gap and continue to review management's response to this important topic. The Committee is pleased to note that management is also well advanced in its preparations to report the ethnicity pay gap, ahead of any formal regulations. More information on the measures being taken to deal with this can be found on page 62 and on the Company's website.\n\n## EMPLOYEE VOICE\n\nI took the opportunity to meet with our Employee Forum in early 2021, speci/fically to understand the views of the wider workforce in respect of Executive remuneration and our proposed Remuneration Policy. Employees were able to ensure their voice was heard directly by this Committee and I was pleased to answer a number of questions posed by the forum. In particular, I noted that the alignment of Executive pensions with employee pensions was well received.\n\n## SHAREHOLDER CONSULTATION\n\nAs part of the Remuneration Policy review, the Remuneration Committee consulted with 20 of our main shareholders and the main shareholder representative bodies. In addition to setting out the proposals in a detailed letter and responding to a number of questions and clari/fications, the Committee held a number of calls with major shareholders to discuss the proposals. Finally, consistent with best practice and in the interests of transparency, shareholder feedback was summarised and shared with those consulted. The level of support received for the proposals has been very strong and, as such, no changes have been made to the proposals originally presented.\n\n## CONCLUSION\n\nI would like to thank my predecessor, Edward Bonham Carter, for chairing the Remuneration Committee until 6 May 2020. This has been a challenging year and, like many, I look forward to a time when Covid-19 is a distant memory.\n\nI hope that you have found my letter useful, informative and clear. I am grateful for the engagement and support provided by our shareholders, and welcome your feedback.\n\nCHRISTOPHE EVAIN CHAIRMAN, REMUNERATION COMMITTEE\n\n<!-- image -->",

REMUNERATION OUTCOMES FOR DIRECTORS DURING THE YEAR\n\nIn this section, we explain the pay outcomes for Directors in relation to the /financial year ended 31 March 2021. Tables 38 and 39 show the payments we have made or expect to make and tables 40-44 give more detail on how we have measured the performance outcomes with respect to the annual bonus and LTIP.\n\n## 1.1 DIRECTORS' EMOLUMENTS /parenleft.caseAUDITED/parenright.case\n\nThe basis of disclosure in the table below is on an 'accruals' basis. This means that the annual bonus column includes the amount that will be awarded in June 2021 in connection with performance achieved in the /financial year ended 31 March 2021.\n\nThe values shown for the 2020/21 annual bonus and the 2018 LTIP awards (for the three-year performance period ended 31 March 2021) are based on estimated achievement against total property return (TPR) performance measures. Based on the estimated TPR and actual TSR performance, the vesting level for the 2018 LTIP is projected to be zero.\n\n## Single /figure of remuneration for each Executive Director (\u00a3000)\n\nTable 38\n\n|                     |                                                | Base salary                 | /one.tf Bene/fits /two.tf   | Pension  allowance /three.tf   | Annual  bonus paid  in cash/four.numr   | bonus  deferred  into shares/four.numr   | Long-term incentives/five.numr   | Other/six.numr                 | Total                              | Total   /fixed pay               | Total   variable pay               |\n|---------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| Executive Directors | Executive Directors                            | Executive Directors         | Executive Directors         | Executive Directors            | Executive Directors                     | Executive Directors                      | Executive Directors              | Executive Directors            | Executive Directors                | Executive Directors              | Executive Directors                |\n| Mark Allan          | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf//two.tf/one.tf  | /seven.tf/three.tf/three.tf | /two.tf/three.tf/zero.tf    | /seven.tf/seven.tf             | -

Actual outturn /zero.tf./six.tf/five.tf% adjusted to /zero.tf./five.tf% to re/flect the Executive Directors' decision taken at the start of the year to waive the /financial element of any bonus for the /first quarter of /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf//two.tf/one.tf.\n\nAs detailed in the table above, the revenue pro/fit target of the bonus scheme delivered a low outcome and the total property return target is expected to be missed due to the pandemic impacting our business for longer than expected. However, performance against a number of the Group KPIs and personal objectives was strong.\n\nThis included the successful delivery of a number of initiatives designed to ensure Landsec emerges from the pandemic in the best position possible, in particular:\n\n- \u203a maintaining /financial strength and /flexibility including through successfully executed asset disposals;\n- \u203a preserving optionality over the Group's development programme for as long as possible to allow time for the impact of the pandemic to become clearer before committing signi/ficant capital expenditure; and\n- \u203a strengthening relationships with customers at a very challenging time.\n\nAs such, and noting: (i) that no government support has been taken; (ii) that there have been no Covid-related redundancies; (iii) the signi/ficant \u00a380m support fund provided to our customers; and (iv) that no adjustments to the targets have been made; the Committee believes that, in line with the approach adopted for our employees below Board, it was appropriate for the Executive Directors to receive annual bonuses for 2020/21.\n\nHowever, the Committee has also considered the experience of shareholders and stakeholders more widely during the pandemic in addition to recognising the Executive Directors' e/fforts and performance against the targets, which were set at the beginning of the year. As a result, the Committee agreed to exercise downward discretion to: (i) reduce the calculated outcome by 50%; and (ii) defer the entire bonus into shares for a period of three years.\n\nThis resulted in a bonus outcome of 16.2% of maximum (equating to 24.3% of salary), which is considered to be appropriate in the context of the performance of the Executive Directors and the impact of Covid-19 on our shareholders and wider stakeholders.",

MANAGEMENT CHANGES DURING THE YEAR\n\n## 2.1 RETIREMENT OF MARTIN GREENSLADE\n\nAs announced on 30 September 2020, Martin will retire from his role as CFO and as a Director of the Board on 31 May 2021, continuing the handover process until 30 June 2021. His employment ends on 29 September 2021 in accordance with his 12-month notice period.\n\n## Salary and bene/fits\n\nMartin will receive salary, bene/fits, and pension allowance as normal up until the end of his employment. The total value of these for the period from 1 June to 29 September 2021 is \u00a3217,330 (subject to all necessary deductions).\n\n## Annual bonus\n\nAs explained on page 116, as a retiree Martin is a 'good leaver' under the terms of the Policy and relevant incentive plan rules. In line with Company policy on 'good leaver' status, in June 2021 Martin will be awarded an annual bonus of \u00a3128,790 in respect of the year ended 31 March 2021 which he served in full. The total bonus amount will be deferred into shares in line with other Executive Directors and will vest after three years. Martin will be eligible for a bonus award for the period 1 April 2021 - 30 June 2021, with any bonus paid in 2022 at the same time and on the same basis as other Executive Directors. No bonus will be awarded for the period 1 July 2021 to 29 September 2021.\n\n## Share awards\n\nOutstanding LTIP awards have been pro-rated for the portion of the performance period served (see table below). The awards will remain subject to their performance conditions measured over the full performance period. Any vesting awards will be subject to the normal two-year post-vesting holding period.\n\nOutstanding unvested deferred bonus awards over 65,400 shares will vest in full and become exercisable for a six-month period from the normal vesting date, 24 July 2021, subject to the rules of the Deferred Share Bonus Plan (DSBP).\n\n## Post-cessation shareholding\n\nIn line with the minimum shareholding policy, Martin will hold at least 200% of salary in Landsec shares for a period of two years from 29 September 2021 based on the Company's share price on 28 September 2020 of 528.9p. This shareholding requirement will be recalculated on 28 May 2021 and 29 September 2021; in the event the Company's share price is higher on those dates, the number of shares required to be held will be adjusted accordingly.\n\n## Compensation for loss of o/ffice\n\nMartin will not be eligible for any payments for loss of o/ffice.\n\n## Malus and clawback\n\nMalus and clawback provisions will continue to apply to annual bonus, deferred bonus and LTIP awards.\n\n| Outstanding LTIP awards - Martin Greenslade Award                                                    | Number of shares   subject to award                | Maximum number of  shares which could vest /one.tf       | Table 45 Vesting date                                |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| /two.tf/zero.tf/one.tf/eight.tf LTIP granted on /two.tf/five.tf June /two.tf/zero.tf/one.tf/eight.tf | /one.tf/six.tf/three.tf,/nine.tf/six.tf/zero.tf    | /one.tf/six.tf/three.tf,/nine.tf/six.tf/zero.tf/two.numr | /two.tf/five.tf June /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf   |\n| /two.tf/zero.tf/one.tf/nine.tf LTIP granted on /two.tf/five.tf June /two.tf/zero.tf/one.tf/nine.tf   | /one.tf/nine.tf/three.tf,/nine.tf/nine.tf/seven.tf | /one.tf/four.tf/five.tf,/four.tf/nine.tf/seven.tf        | /two.tf/five.tf June /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf   |\n| /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf LTIP granted on /two.tf/four.tf July /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf   | /two.tf/nine.tf/zero.tf,/five.tf/seven.tf/zero.tf  | /one.tf/one.tf/two.tf,/nine.tf/nine.tf/nine.tf           | /two.tf/four.tf July /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/three.tf |\n\n- /one.tf.

The Committee determined Vanessa's remuneration taking account of pay levels in our sector peers and for companies similar in size to Landsec, as well as the skills and experience she brings. Her remuneration has been set within the parameters of the approved Policy, and consists of:\n\n- \u203a a base salary of \u00a3490,000\n- \u203a a standard Company bene/fits package including car allowance, health cover and life insurance\n- \u203a a pension allowance of 10.5% of salary, in line with the majority workforce rate\n- \u203a a maximum annual bonus of 150% of salary and\n- \u203a LTIP awards of 300% of salary.\n\nVanessa will also be required to comply with the Company's Minimum Shareholding Policy, and build and hold a shareholding to the value of 200% of salary within /five years of her appointment, which she will also be required to retain for a two-year period post-cessation.\n\nIn compensation for incentive awards forfeited on her resignation from her previous employer, four share awards were granted shortly after Vanessa joined the Company; see table below for detail of the awards. These awards will vest no earlier than the original vesting dates of the awards they replace.\n\nAs the performance period for Vanessa's 2018 LTIP award has been partially completed, the buyout value has been determined based on an estimate of the extent to which the performance conditions of her previous employer were satis/fied up to 30 September 2020, and the reduced number of shares will vest subject to continued service.\n\nThe performance conditions for the buyout award for Vanessa's 2019 LTIP award will be based on Landsec's performance over the two-year period starting 1 April 2021, with the same performance targets as the 2021 LTIP grant made to other Landsec employees albeit measured over a two-year performance period. Both awards will be subject to a two-year post-vesting holding period, and were granted on materially equivalent terms to the rules of the Landsec LTIP including malus and clawback provisions.\n\nIn addition to the above, two awards were made to compensate for Deferred Share Bonus Plan (DSBP) awards forfeited upon resignation.

DIRECTORS' INTERESTS\n\n## 3.1 TOTAL SHAREHOLDING /parenleft.caseAUDITED/parenright.case\n\nDetails of the Directors' interests, including those of their immediate families and connected persons, in the issued share capital of the Company at the beginning and end of the year, together with their required shareholding, are set out in the table below.\n\nExecutive Directors are expected to meet the minimum shareholding requirements within /five years of appointment to the Board. Where the minimum level is not met, or where the value of shareholding\n\nfalls below the required level due to movements in the share price, the Executive Director is expected to retain 100% of the shares acquired, net of tax, under any share plan awarded by the Company.\n\nNon-executive Directors are expected to meet the minimum shareholding requirements within three years of appointment to the Board. The shareholding requirements are considered met once the Non-executive Director has obtained the required holding value and, provided those shares are retained, no adjustment is required due to movements in the share price.\n\n| Directors' shares Name     | Salary/  base fee at  /three.tf/one.tf March  /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf (/sterling.tf)   | Minimum  shareholding  requirements  (%

Performance targets are considered to be commercially sensitive although will be disclosed in full, together with the performance and the resulting bonus awards, in next year's Directors' Remuneration Report.\n\n| Annual bonus 2021/22: Performance criteria Table 54   | Annual bonus 2021/22: Performance criteria Table 54   | Annual bonus 2021/22: Performance criteria Table 54                                                                            | Annual bonus 2021/22: Performance criteria Table 54                        |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Measure                                               | Weighting                                             | Description                                                                                                                    | Performance range                                                          |\n| Revenue pro/fit (/sterling.tfm)                       | /three.tf/zero.tf%                                    | Revenue pro/fit targets in line with overall /five-year strategic plan.                                                        | Full details will be provided in the /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf report. |\n| Total business return  (pence per share)              | /three.tf/zero.tf%                                    | Delivery of growth in asset values measured by EPRA NTA growth   (adjusted for dividends) through pro-active asset management. | Full details will be provided in the /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf report. |\n| ESG                                                   | /two.tf/zero.tf%                                      | Energy intensity reduction in all assets and embodied carbon reduction   in assets under development.                          | Full details will be provided in the /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf report. |\n| Personal objectives                                   | /two.tf/zero.tf%                                      | A mix of individual goals set at the beginning of the year.                                                                    | Full details will be provided in the /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf report. |\n| Total annual bonus                                    | /one.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf%                              |                                                                                                                                |                                                                            |\n\nThe introduction of total business return into the annual bonus and an increased weighting on revenue pro/fit will ensure that the delivery of absolute returns through pro-active portfolio management and income generation will be incentivised and rewarded. Total property return will no longer be used as a bonus metric given that it is not considered to be well-aligned to the new strategy. Furthermore, the relative nature of the targets and measurement against third party data is no longer considered to be an e/ffective incentive.

The approach to relative TSR will be simpli/fied with a more conventional, unweighted, median to upper quartile vesting schedule and total business return targets have replaced relative total property return for a closer alignment to strategy and a clear line of sight for management. The 2021 LTIP award will be set at 300% of salary for the CEO and CFO and 250% of salary for the COO (the COO award level will be kept under review and may be increased for future grants).\n\n## 5. TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE PAY\n\nThe following graph illustrates the performance of the Company measured by TSR (share price growth plus dividends paid) against a 'broad equity market index' over a period of ten years. As the Company is a constituent of the FTSE 350 Real Estate Index, this is considered to be the most appropriate benchmark for the purposes of the graph. An additional line to illustrate the Company's performance compared with the FTSE 100 Index over the previous ten years is also included.\n\nThis graph shows the value, by 31 March 2021, of \u00a3100 invested in Landsec on 31 March 2011, compared with the value of \u00a3100 invested in the FTSE 100 and FTSE 350 Real Estate Indices on the same date.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe following table shows remuneration for the Chief Executive over a period of ten years.\n\n| Chief Executive remuneration over ten years   | Chief Executive remuneration over ten years   |                                                                             |                                         | Table 57 Long-term               |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Year                                          | Chief Executive                               | Single /figure of total remuneration (/sterling.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf) | Annual bonus   payment   (% of maximum) | incentive vesting (% of maximum) |\n| /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf                 | Mark Allan                                    | /two.tf,/nine.tf/two.tf/zero.tf /one.tf                                     | /one.tf/six.tf./two.tf                  | n/a                              |\n| /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf                | Robert Noel                                   | /one.tf,/five.tf/six.tf/nine.tf                                             | /four.tf/three.tf./eight.tf             | /zero.tf./zero.tf                |\n| /two.tf /zero.tf /one.tf/nine.tf              | Robert Noel                                   | /one.tf,/six.tf/two.tf/four.tf                                              | /five.tf/zero.tf./five.tf               | /zero.tf./zero.tf                |\n| /two.tf/zero.tf/one.tf/eight.tf               | Robert Noel                                   | /one.tf,/six.tf/nine.tf/three.tf                                            | /five.tf/eight.tf./eight.tf             | /zero.tf./zero.tf                |\n| /two.tf/zero.tf/one.tf/seven.tf               | Robert Noel                                   | /two.tf,/six.tf/nine.tf/two.tf                                              | /five.tf/eight.tf./eight.tf             | /five.tf/zero.tf./zero.tf        |\n| /two.tf/zero.tf/one.tf/six.tf                 | Robert Noel                                   | /two.tf,/zero.tf/one.tf/one.tf                                              | /six.tf/seven.tf./five.tf               | /one.tf/three.tf./one.tf         |\n| /two.tf/zero.tf/one.tf/five.tf                | Robert Noel                                   | /four.tf,/seven.tf/seven.tf/six.tf                                          | /nine.tf/four.tf./five.tf               | /eight.tf/four.tf./seven.tf      |\n| /two.tf/zero.tf/one.tf/four.tf                | Robert Noel                                   | /two.tf,/two.tf/seven.tf/four.tf                                            | /seven.tf/one.tf./zero.tf               | /six.tf/two.tf./five.tf          |\n| /two.tf/zero.tf/one.tf/three.tf               | Robert Noel                                   | /two.tf,/six.tf/seven.tf/eight.tf                                           | /eight.tf/six.tf./zero.tf               | /seven.tf/six.tf./one.tf         |\n| /two.tf/zero.tf/one.tf /two.tf                | Francis Salway                                | /two.tf,/seven.tf/six.tf/nine.tf                                            | /two.tf/four.tf./zero.tf                | /eight.tf/five.tf./nine.tf       |\n\n- /one.tf.

Senior management\n\nFor the year under review, performance-related pay for our 17 most senior employees (excluding the Executive Directors) is expected to range from 17% to 27% of salary (2020: 27% to 50%). The average bonus is expected to be 19.7% of salary (2020: 37%). The LTIP awards made to senior management in June 2018 will vest on the same basis as the awards made to Executive Directors.\n\n## b. All other employees\n\nStandard pay increases for employees were not awarded due to the continued impact of the pandemic. However, moderate pay increases were awarded to lower earners and to a small number of employees whose salaries had variances against the market. As at 31 March 2021, the ratio of the base salary of the Chief Executive to the average base salary across the Group (excluding Executive Directors) was 12:1 (\u00a3800,000: \u00a367,839).\n\n## c.

D I L U T I O N\n\nAwards granted under the Company's long-term incentive arrangements, which cover those made under the LTIP, MSP, Deferred Share Bonus Plan and the ESOP, are satis/fied through the funding of an Employee Bene/fit Trust (administered by an external trustee) which acquires existing Land Securities Group PLC shares in the market. The Employee Bene/fit Trust held 1,224,468 shares at 31 March 2021.\n\nThe exercise of share options under the Savings Related Share Option Scheme (SAYE), which is open to all employees who have completed more than one month's service with the Group, can be satis/fied by the allotment of newly issued shares. At 31 March 2021, the total number of shares which could be allotted under this Scheme was 666,526 shares, which represents less than 0.09% of the issued share capital of the Company.\n\n## 8. REMUNERATION COMMITTEE MEETINGS\n\nThe Committee met for four scheduled meetings over the course of the year, and for two additional meetings as a result of the CFO appointment process. All members attended all the scheduled meetings. Christophe Evain replaced Edward Bonham Carter as the Chairman from 6 May 2020. The other members during the year were Cressida Hogg, Stacey Rauch and Edward Bonham Carter. The Committee meetings were also attended by the Chief Executive, the Managing Director, People and Corporate Services and the Group General Counsel and Company Secretary who acted as the Committee's Secretary.\n\nFrom July 2020 the Committee received advice on remuneration and ancillary legal matters from FIT Remuneration Consultants LLP (previous advice was provided by Aon plc). It has also made use of various published surveys to help determine appropriate remuneration levels and relied on information and advice provided by the Group General Counsel and Company Secretary and the Managing Director, People and Corporate Services. FIT and Aon are members of the Remuneration Consultants Group and are signatories to its Code of Conduct, which requires their advice to be impartial. The Committee is satis/fied that the advice it receives is independent and objective. Aside from some support in benchmarking remuneration for roles below the Board, the remuneration advisers have no other connection with the Group. For the /financial year under review Aon and FIT received fees of \u00a332,386 and \u00a378,184 respectively in connection with advice provided to the Committee.\n\n## 9.

When setting the pay policy for Executive Directors, the Committee also considered pay practices and policies of the wider workforce in order to ensure the revised policy is proportionate and aligned with Landsec's culture. The review was approached with the following main aims:\n\n- \u203a Remuneration should be clearly linked to the Group's purpose of creating Sustainable places, Connecting communities, Realising potential\n- \u203a Remuneration should reward and drive the right behaviours and outcomes and re/flect strategic, personal and /financial achievements\n- \u203a Remuneration should be designed in a manner that is clear for all stakeholders and re/flects their expectations\n- \u203a Remuneration should be easy to explain and be viewed as fair\n- \u203a Remuneration should be based on a pay-for-performance model\n\n## REMUNERATION PRINCIPLES\n\nOur remuneration principles, which we also aim to cascade throughout the business, underpin our Policy. These principles are that our remuneration should:\n\n- \u203a Support the long-term success of the business and sustainable long-term shareholder value\n- \u203a Materially di/fferentiate reward according to performance\n- \u203a Be relevant, stretching and aligned to the business strategy and achievement of planned business goals\n- \u203a Be compatible with Landsec's risk policies and systems, with malus and clawback provisions in place for all forms of variable pay\n- \u203a Provide a balance between attracting, retaining and motivating talented people as well as supporting equal opportunity and diversity of talent\n\n- \u203a Ensure that performance-related pay constitutes a proportion of the overall package appropriate to each level of the organisation\n- \u203a Be clear and explainable to appropriate stakeholders, avoiding paying more than the Committee considers necessary\n\n## CONSIDERATION OF SHAREHOLDER VIEWS\n\nThe Committee values the views of Landsec's shareholders and guidance from the main shareholder representative bodies. As such, the Committee proactively consults with our major shareholders to ensure that their views are represented in discussions on remuneration matters. As part of the process for renewing the Policy, the Committee consulted with Landsec's top 20 shareholders as well as the major shareholder representative bodies on a set of draft proposals. The proposed Policy re/flects guidance received from major investors and representative bodies during the course of the engagement process.",

STATEMENT OF CONSIDERATION OF EMPLOYMENT CONDITIONS ELSEWHERE IN THE COMPANY\n\nThe 2021 Policy is designed in line with the remuneration principles outlined on page 132 above. In setting the remuneration of the Executive Directors, the Committee takes into account the overall approach to reward for employees in the Group. Landsec operates in a number of di/fferent environments and has many employees who carry out diverse roles across a number of locations. All employees, including Directors, are paid by reference to the market rate and base salary levels are reviewed regularly. When considering salary increases for Executive Directors, the Company pays close attention to pay and employment conditions across the wider workforce. The Group's MD, People & Corporate Services regularly updates the Committee on pay and conditions applying to the wider workforce. During 2020, the Committee received speci/fic updates on Gender Pay Reporting and pay ratios. The Committee does not formally consult with employees on the executive remuneration policy, although the Committee Chair meets with the Employee Forum. The Company also holds regular forums with employee groups and conducts regular employee engagement surveys, the results of which are presented to the Board. Remuneration arrangements for employees below Board level re/flect the seniority of the role.\n\n## 3. MALUS AND CLAWBACK PROVISIONS\n\nAll incentive scheme rules contain malus and/or clawback provisions that allow the Committee to reduce or retrieve a payment or an award.\n\n## MALUS\n\nMalus is the adjustment of annual bonus payments or unvested share awards because of the occurrence of one or more circumstances listed below. The adjustment may result in the value being reduced to nil.\n\n## CLAWBACK\n\nClawback is the recovery of payments made under the annual bonus plan or vested share awards as a result of the occurrence of one or more circumstances listed below. Clawback may apply to all or part of an Executive Director's payment/award and may be e/ffected, among other means, by requiring the transfer of shares, payment of cash or reduction of awards or bonuses.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee may apply malus/clawback when there are exceptional circumstances. Such exceptional circumstances include (without limitation):\n\n- \u203a a material mis-statement in the published results of the Group or one of its members;\n- \u203a an error in assessing any applicable performance condition or the number of shares subject to an award;\n\n- \u203a misconduct on the part of the Executive Director concerned;\n- \u203a where, as a result of an appropriate review of accountability, the Remuneration Committee determines that the Executive Director has caused wholly or in part a material loss for the Group as a result of (i) reckless, negligent or wilful actions or omissions; or (ii) inappropriate behaviour;\n- \u203a where, as a result of an appropriate review of accountability, the Remuneration Committee determines that the Executive Director has caused wholly or in part a corporate failure of the Group or one of its members;\n- \u203a a Group member being censured by a regulatory body;\n- \u203a events or behaviour on the part of the Executive Director leading to signi/ficant reputational damage to the Group; or\n- \u203a any other events that the Remuneration Committee considers speci/fically relevant to Landsec, e.g. serious health and safety event or an exceptional negative event.",

SHARE OWNERSHIP GUIDELINES SHARE OWNERSHIP DURING EMPLOYMENT\n\nThe Chief Executive and all other Executive Directors are expected to accumulate and maintain a holding in ordinary shares in the Company equivalent to no less than 300% of base salary for the CEO and 200% for other Executive Directors.\n\nExecutive Directors are normally expected to meet the minimum shareholding requirements within /five years of appointment to the Board. Where the minimum level is not met, or where the value of shareholding falls below the required level due to movements in the share price, the Executive Director is expected to retain 100% of the shares acquired, net of tax, under any share plan awarded by the Company.\n\nAn annual calculation as a percentage of salary is made against the guidelines for each Executive Director as at 31 March each year based on the closing middle market quotation of a share price on the last business day in March.\n\n- \u203a Expenses in relation to Company business will be reimbursed (including any tax thereon, where applicable)\n- \u203a If deemed necessary, and in the performance of their duties, Non-executive Directors may take independent professional advice at the Company's expense\n\n## SHARE OWNERSHIP POST CESSATION\n\nOn leaving the Board, Executive Directors are expected to maintain a shareholding equivalent to their in-employment shareholding requirement for a period of two years from the date of cessation. Shares acquired by the Executive are excluded from this calculation.\n\n## NON/hyphen.caseEXECUTIVE DIRECTOR SHARE OWNERSHIP\n\nNon-executive Directors are expected to meet a minimum shareholding requirement of 100% of the relevant annual fee within three years of appointment to the Board. The shareholding requirements are considered met once the Non-executive Director has obtained the required holding value and, provided those shares are retained, no adjustment is required due to movements in the share price.\n\n## 6. DIRECTORS' SERVICE AGREEMENTS AND LETTERS OF APPOINTMENT EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS' LETTERS OF APPOINTMENT\n\nThe Executive Directors have Service Agreements with the Company which normally continue until the Director's agreed retirement date or such other date as the parties agree. In line with Group policy, the Executive Directors' employment can be terminated at any time by either party on giving 12 months' prior written notice.\n\nThe Company allows Executive Directors to hold external non-executive directorships, subject to the prior approval of the Board, and to retain fees from these roles.\n\n## CHAIRMAN AND NON/hyphen.caseEXECUTIVE DIRECTORS' LETTERS OF APPOINTMENT\n\nThe Chairman and the Non-executive Directors do not have Service Agreements with the Company. Instead, each of them has a Letter of Appointment which sets out the terms of their appointment, including the three months' prior written notice on which their appointment can be terminated by either party at any time. The dates of the current Letters of Appointment are shown in the Annual Report on Remuneration and these, together with the Executive Directors' Service Agreements, are available for inspection at the Company's registered o/ffice.\n\nOn appointment, the fee arrangements for a new Non-executive Director are set in accordance with the approved remuneration policy in force at that time.\n\nFull details of the terms of appointment of each Director can be found on page 127 of the Remuneration Report.",

TERMINATION PROVISIONS FOR EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS\n\nThe Company's policy is for Executive Directors' Service Agreements to be terminable on 12 months' notice by either party. Service Agreements contain noncompete and non-solicit clauses with key suppliers and employees. In the event of early termination, any payment in lieu of notice would be limited to 12 months' basic salary, normally payable on a phased basis and subject to mitigation.\n\nIn addition to the scenarios below, an Executive Director's Service Agreement may be terminated without notice and without further payment or compensation, except for sums earned up to the date of termination, on the occurrence of certain events such as gross misconduct.\n\nThe Committee retains discretion to determine the exact termination arrangements of any Executive Director, having regard to all the relevant facts and circumstances available to them at the time.\n\nThe table below sets out the general position and range of approaches in respect of incentive arrangements. In accordance with the terms of the relevant incentive plan rules, based on the circumstances of any departure, the Committee has discretion to determine how an Executive Director should be categorised for each element and determine payout/vesting levels accordingly based on the range as shown.\n\n| Provision                   | Default leaver

        "page_content": "## 8. CHANGE OF CONTROL PROVISIONS\n\nOn a change of control, unvested LTIP awards will normally vest subject to performance and time pro-rating (although the Committee may allow a greater number of shares to vest than if pro-rating is applied where appropriate) and unvested deferred bonus shares vest in full. The contracts of the Executive Directors do not provide for any enhanced payments in the event of a change of control of the Company or for liquidated damages.\n\n## 9. REMUNERATION OF NEWLY APPOINTED EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS\n\nThe remuneration package for a new externally appointed Executive Director will be set in accordance with the terms of the Company's approved Policy in force at the time of appointment.\n\n## FIXED PAY\n\n- \u203a The Committee has the /flexibility to set the base salary of a new hire at the market level or at a discount to the market level initially, with a series of planned increases implemented over the following few years (subject to performance in the role) to bring the salary to the desired positioning.\n- \u203a In exceptional circumstances the salary of a newly appointed Executive Director may exceed the market median benchmark for the role.\n\n## VARIABLE PAY\n\n- \u203a The annual bonus will operate in accordance with the terms of the approved Policy, with the opportunity pro-rated for the period of employment in the /first year.\n- \u203a Depending on the timing and responsibilities of the appointment, it may be necessary to set revised performance measures and targets initially.\n- \u203a The LTIP will also operate in accordance with the approved Policy.\n\nThe maximum level of variable pay that may be o/ffered to a new Executive Director is an aggregate maximum of 450% of salary, but it may be lower. This limit does not include the value of any buy-out arrangements deemed appropriate.\n\nIn addition to the elements of the remuneration package covered by the policy, the Committee may 'buy out' certain existing remuneration arrangements of an incoming Executive Director through the o/ffer of either additional cash and/or share-based elements when it considers these to be in the best interests of the Company. Any such payments will be based solely on remuneration lost when leaving\n\nthe former employer and will take into account the existing delivery mechanism (i.e. cash, shares, options), time horizons and performance conditions.\n\nIn the case of an internally appointed Executive Director, any variable pay element awarded in respect of the prior role would be paid out according to its terms, adjusted as relevant to take into account the appointment. In addition, any other ongoing remuneration obligations existing prior to appointment will continue, provided that they are put to shareholders for approval at the earliest opportunity.\n\n## RELOCATION ALLOWANCE\n\nFor external and internal appointments, the Committee may agree that the Company will meet certain relocation expenses, for a limited period only, as appropriate. Where a Director is recruited from overseas, /flexibility is retained to provide bene/fits that take account of market practice in their country of residence. The Company may o/ffer a cash amount on recruitment, payment of which may be staggered over a period of up to two years, to re/flect the value of bene/fits a new recruit may have received from a former employer.\n\n## LEGAL FEES\n\nOn recruitment of an Executive Director, the Company may make a contribution towards legal fees in connection with agreeing employment terms and drawing up a service contract.\n\nShareholders will normally be informed of the remuneration package and all additional payments to newly-appointed Executive Directors at the time of their appointment.\n\n## 10. DISCRETIONS RETAINED BY THE COMMITTEE\n\nThe Committee operates the Group's various incentive plans according to their respective rules and in accordance with HMRC regulations where relevant. To ensure the e/fficient administration and appropriate governance of all remuneration arrangements the Committee may apply certain operational discretions, within the limits of the Directors' Remuneration Policy and relevant plan rules. These include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n- \u203a selecting the participants in the plans\n- \u203a determining the timing of awards and/or payments\n- \u203a determining the quantum of awards and/ or payments\n- \u203a selecting appropriate performance criteria and determining weightings, and adjusting these if necessary\n- \u203a setting performance targets for the various criteria, and adjusting these if necessary\n- \u203a adjusting the constituents of the comparator groups in respect of relative performance measures, if necessary\n- \u203a determining the extent of payment/ vesting based on the assessment of performance\n- \u203a determining 'good leaver' status and the extent of payment/vesting in the case of the bonus and share-based plans\n- \u203a determining the treatment of awards under share-based plans in the event of a change of control\n- \u203a making the appropriate adjustments required in certain circumstances (e.g. rights issues, corporate restructuring events, variation of capital, special dividends etc.)\n\nIn all cases, the Committee retains its absolute discretion to override formulaic outcomes in the bonus, LTIP and any other remuneration arrangements should the payouts not re/flect underlying Company performance.",

The Board may appoint a Director either to /fill a vacancy or as an addition to the Board so long as the total number of Directors does not exceed the limit prescribed in the\n\nArticles. An appointed Director must retire and seek election to o/ffice at the next Landsec AGM. In addition to any power of removal conferred by the Act, Landsec may by ordinary resolution remove any Director before the expiry of their period of o/ffice and may, subject to the Articles, by ordinary resolution appoint another person who is willing to act as a Director in their place. In line with the Code and the Board's policy, all Directors are required to stand for re-election at each AGM.\n\n## DIRECTORS' POWERS\n\nThe Board manages the business of Landsec under the powers set out in the Articles. These powers include the Directors' ability to issue or buy back shares. Shareholders' authority to empower the Directors to make market purchases of up to 10% of its own ordinary shares is sought at the AGM each year. The Articles can only be amended, or new Articles adopted, by a resolution passed by shareholders in general meeting and being approved by at least three quarters of the votes cast.\n\n## DIRECTORS' INTERESTS\n\nSave as disclosed in the Directors' Remuneration Report, none of the Directors, nor any person connected with them, has any interest in the share or loan capital of Landsec or any of its subsidiaries. At no time during the year ended 31 March 2021 did any Director hold a material interest, directly or indirectly, in any contract of signi/ficance with Landsec or any subsidiary other than the Executive Directors in relation to their Service Agreements.",

        "page_content": "## DIRECTORS' INDEMNITIES AND INSURANCE\n\nLandsec has agreed to indemnify each Director against any liability incurred in relation to acts or omissions arising in the ordinary course of their duties. The indemnity applies only to the extent permitted by law. A copy of the deed of indemnity is available for inspection at Landsec's registered o/ffice. Landsec has in place appropriate Directors' & O/fficers' Liability insurance cover in respect of potential legal action against its Directors.\n\n## SHARE CAPITAL\n\nLandsec has a single class of share capital which is divided into ordinary shares of nominal value 10 2 /3p each ranking pari passu. No other securities have been issued by the Company. At 31 March 2021, there were 751,313,063 ordinary shares in issue and fully paid, of which 9,839,179 are held in treasury. No shares were bought back during the year. Further details relating to share capital, including movements during the year, are set out in note 35 to the /financial statements.\n\nAt the Company's AGM held on 9 July 2020, shareholders authorised the Company to make market purchases of ordinary shares representing up to 10% of its issued share capital at that time and to allot shares within certain limits approved by shareholders. These authorities will expire at the 2021 AGM and a renewal of that authority will be sought. The Company received no other DTR noti/fications by way of change to the information in the substantial shareholders table during the period from 1 April to 17 May 2021, being the period from the year end through to the date on which this report has been signed. Information provided to the Company under the DTR is publicly available to view via the Investor section on the Company's website.\n\n## EMPLOYEE BENEFIT TRUST\n\nEquiniti Trust (Jersey) Limited continues as trustee (Trustee) of Landsec's Employee Bene/fit Trust (EBT). The EBT is used to purchase Land Securities Group PLC ordinary shares in the market from time to time for the bene/fit of employees, including to satisfy outstanding awards under Landsec's various employee share plans. The EBT purchased 500,000 shares in total in the market during the year. On 17 July 2020, 125,907 ordinary shares were purchased at a price of \u00a35.48 per share.

Further details regarding the EBT, and of shares issued pursuant to Landsec's various employee share plans during the year, are set out in notes 34-36 to the /financial statements.\n\n## SUBSTANTIAL SHAREHOLDERS\n\nAs at 31 March 2021, the Company had been noti/fied under the Disclosure and Transparency Rules (DTR 5) of the following holdings of voting rights in its issued share capital:\n\n| Shareholders holding 3% or more of the Company's issued share capital Table 67   | Shareholders holding 3% or more of the Company's issued share capital Table 67   | Shareholders holding 3% or more of the Company's issued share capital Table 67   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Shareholder name                                                                 | Number of   ordinary shares                                                      | Percentage of total voting rights  attaching to issued share capital /one.tf     |\n| BlackRock, Inc.                                                                  | /eight.tf/seven.tf,/five.tf/zero.tf/nine.tf,/eight.tf/eight.tf/three.tf          | /one.tf/one.tf./eight.tf/two.tf                                                  |\n| Norges Bank Investment Management                                                | /six.tf/eight.tf,/one.tf/nine.tf/two.tf,/seven.tf/seven.tf/five.tf               | /nine.tf./two.tf/zero.tf                                                         |\n| The Vanguard Group, Inc.                                                         | /three.tf/two.tf,/three.tf/two.tf/one.tf,/three.tf/seven.tf/three.tf             | /four.tf./three.tf/six.tf                                                        |\n| Legal & General Investment Management Ltd                                        | /two.tf/six.tf,/five.tf/seven.tf/six.tf,/nine.tf/six.tf/three.tf                 | /three.tf./five.tf/eight.tf                                                      |\n| State Street Global Advisors Ltd                                                 | /two.tf/five.tf,/six.tf/four.tf/two.tf,/six.tf/four.tf/eight.tf                  | /three.tf./four.tf/six.tf                                                        |\n\n## SHAREHOLDER VOTING RIGHTS AND RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER OF SHARES\n\nAll the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of Landsec have equal voting rights with one vote per share. There are no special control rights attaching to them save that the control rights of ordinary shares held in the EBT can be directed by the Company to satisfy the vesting of outstanding awards under its various employee share plans.\n\nIn relation to the EBT, the Trustee has agreed not to vote any shares held in the EBT at any general meeting. If any o/ffer is made to all shareholders to acquire their shares in Landsec, the Trustee will not be obliged to accept or reject the o/ffer in respect of any shares which are at the time subject to subsisting awards, but will have regard to the interests of the award holders and will have power to consult them to obtain their views on the o/ffer. Subject to the above, the Trustee may take such action with respect to an o/ffer as it thinks /fit.\n\nLandsec is not aware of any agreements or control rights between existing shareholders that may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities or on voting rights. The rights, including full details relating to voting of shareholders and any restrictions on transfer relating to Landsec's ordinary shares, are set out in the Articles and in the explanatory notes that accompany the Notice of the 2021 AGM. These documents are available on Landsec's website at: www.landsec.com/agm.\n\n## CHANGE OF CONTROL\n\nThere are a number of agreements that take e/ffect, alter or terminate upon a change of control of the Company following a takeover. None of these are considered signi/ficant. The Company's share plans contain provisions that take e/ffect in such an event but do not entitle participants to a greater interest in the shares of the Company than created by the initial grant or award under the relevant plan. There are no agreements between the Company and its Directors or employees providing for compensation for loss of o/ffice or employment or otherwise that occurs speci/fically because of a takeover.",

We support the principles set out within both the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labour Organization's Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. Our Policy is built on these foundations including, without limitation, the principles of equal opportunities, collective bargaining, freedom of association and protection from forced or child labour.\n\nThe Policy takes account of the Modern Slavery Act that came into force in October 2015 and requires Landsec to report annually on its workforce and supply chain, speci/fically to con/firm that workers are not enslaved or tra/fficked. Landsec's latest Modern Slavery Statement was approved by the Board on 22 September 2020 and posted on our website on 30 September 2020.\n\nLandsec is an equal opportunities employer and our range of employment policies and guidelines re/flects legal and employment requirements in the UK and safeguards the interests of employees, potential employees and other workers. We do not condone unfair treatment of any kind and o/ffer equal opportunities in all aspects of employment and advancement regardless of race, nationality, gender, age, marital status, sexual orientation, disability, religious or political beliefs. Landsec recognises that it has clear obligations towards all its employees and the\n\ncommunity at large to ensure that people with disabilities are a/fforded equal opportunities to enter employment and progress. Landsec has therefore established procedures designed to provide fair consideration and selection of disabled applicants and to satisfy their training and career development needs. If an employee becomes disabled, wherever possible Landsec takes steps to accommodate the disability by making adjustments to their existing employment arrangements, or by redeployment and providing appropriate retraining to enable continued employment in the Group. Further information can be found in the Social review on pages 59-61.\n\n## POLITICAL DONATIONS\n\nThe Company did not make any political donations or expenditure in the year that require disclosure (2020: nil).\n\n## AUDITOR AND DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO THE AUDITOR\n\nSo far as the Directors are aware, there is no relevant audit information that has not been brought to the attention of the Company's auditor. Each Director has taken all reasonable steps to make himself or herself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that such information was provided to the auditor.\n\nA resolution to con/firm the reappointment of Ernst & Young LLP as auditor of the Company will be proposed at the 2021 AGM. The reappointment has been recommended to the Board by the Audit Committee and EY has indicated its willingness to remain in o/ffice.\n\n## 2021 ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING\n\nThis year's AGM is scheduled to be held at 10.00 am on Thursday, 8 July 2021 at 80 Victoria Street, London SW1E 5JL. Due to Covid-19 restrictions we strongly encourage our stakeholders to attend virtually. Shareholders will be able to watch presentations from our Chairman and CEO, ask questions and cast their votes online. We request that shareholders who do wish to attend in person preregister their intention to attend to help us manage numbers.\n\nWe will continue to monitor the impact of the pandemic, with the health and safety of our shareholders, Directors and employees as our priority. If it becomes necessary or appropriate to make changes to the proposed format of the AGM, we will inform shareholders as soon as we can. Shareholders are encouraged to monitor our website at www.landsec.com/agm and London Stock Exchange announcements for any updates regarding the AGM arrangements.\n\nA separate circular, comprising a letter from the Chairman, Notice of Meeting and explanatory notes in respect of the resolutions proposed, can be found on our website: www.landsec.com/agm.\n\n## DISCLAIMER\n\nThe purpose of this Annual Report is to provide information to the members of the Company and it has been prepared for, and only for, the members of the Company as a body, and no other persons.

Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the /financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the /financial statements in the UK, including the FRC's Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities, and we have ful/filled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is su/fficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## CONCLUSIONS RELATING TO GOING CONCERN\n\nIn auditing the /financial statements, we have concluded that the Directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the /financial statements is appropriate. Our evaluation of the Directors' assessment of the Group and Parent Company's ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included the following:\n\n- \u203a We assessed the risk around going concern at the interim half year review, in planning our audit and again at the year-end phase.\n- \u203a We con/firmed our understanding of the process followed by Management to prepare the Group's going concern assessment, including assessing the ongoing impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, the resulting Government restrictions and lockdowns and /financial pressures on tenants leading to increased credit risk and rent concessions.\n- \u203a We checked the logic and arithmetical accuracy of the models developed by Management for the base case cash/flow and liquidity forecasts and covenant calculations covering the going concern review period to 31 May 2022 and the additional downside scenarios.\n\n\u203a\n\nFor each of the modelled scenarios, we challenged the key assumptions by checking to corroborative evidence and searching out\n\nindependent contradictory evidence. We assessed Management's consideration of downside sensitivity analysis and applied further\n\nsensitivities where appropriate to stress test the impact on liquidity.\n\n- \u203a We checked that the terms and conditions of the debt agreements with lenders had been appropriately incorporated into the going concern scenarios and modelling, including the maturity pro/file of the Group's borrowings, the impact of the Security Group structure and the tiered operating covenant regime.\n- \u203a We performed testing to evaluate whether the covenant requirements of the debt facilities would be breached under either the base case or the stress scenarios through the going concern period. We performed reverse stress testing on key assumptions and considered the likelihood of outcomes including controllable mitigating actions over and above the scenarios modelled. In doing so, we considered the perspective of our Chartered Surveyors in assessing the remoteness of movements in rental and valuation assumptions.\n- \u203a We reviewed the disclosures in the /financial statements relating to going concern (including the impact of Covid-19) with a view to con/firming that they appropriately disclose the risk, the impact on the Group's operations and results and potential mitigating actions. In light of the current market conditions, this included consultation with independent audit partners to validate our work on the going concern assessment.",

        "page_content": "We have observed that the Covid-19 pandemic has had a number of impacts on the operations and results of the Group. The most signi/ficant have been the collection of rent and service charges, reductions in turnover-based revenues and the decline in property values. The pandemic has had the most signi/ficant impact on the Group's Regional retail, Urban opportunities and Subscale segments which account for 31% of Group net rental income. The Central London assets, which account for the remaining 69% of net rental income, have not been as signi/ficantly impacted due to the lower impact on o/ffice tenants. There continues to be judgement in assessing the future impact of the pandemic and the UK Government's response to it.\n\nBased on the work we have performed, we have not identi/fied any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast signi/ficant doubt on the Group and Parent Company's ability to continue as a going concern through the going concern period to 31 May 2022.\n\nIn relation to the Group and Parent Company's reporting on how they have applied the UK Corporate Governance Code, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to the Directors' statement in the /financial statements about whether the Directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nOur responsibilities and the responsibilities of the Directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report. However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group and Parent Company's ability to continue as a going concern.\n\n## OVERVIEW OF OUR AUDIT APPROACH\n\n| Audit scope        | \u203a The Group solely operates in the United Kingdom and operates through one portfolio, which is split into four segments:   Central London, Regional retail, Urban opportunities and Subscale sectors, all of which were subject to the same full audit scope.   This included the Group audit team performing direct audit procedures on joint venture balances included within the Group   /financial statements.   |\n|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Key audit  matters | \u203a The valuation of property, including investment properties and investment properties held in joint ventures. \u203a Revenue recognition, including the timing of revenue recognition and the treatment of lease incentives. \u203a (New in 2021) Impairment of trade receivables, including lease incentive balances.                                                                                                        |\n| Materiality        | \u203a Overall group materiality of \u00a399m which represents 0.9% of total assets in the Group balance sheet at 31 March 2021. Overall  materiality is applied to account balances related to investment properties (either wholly owned or held within joint ventures)   and related loans and borrowings.                                                                                                                  |\n|                    | \u203a Speci/fic materiality of \u00a317m, which represents 5% of average revenue pro/fit before tax over two years to 31 March 2021. Speci/fic  materiality is applied to account balances not related to investment properties (either wholly owned or held within joint ventures)  and loans and borrowing.                                                                                                                 |\n|                    | \u203a Parent Company materiality of \u00a355m, which represents 0.9% of total assets in the Parent Company balance sheet. Parent Company  materiality is applied to all balances within the Parent Company.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n\n## AN OVERVIEW OF THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT\n\nOur assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and our allocation of performance materiality determine our audit scope for each entity within the Group. Taken together, this enables us to form an opinion on the consolidated /financial statements.\n\nThe Group solely operates in the United Kingdom and operates through four segments, Central London, Regional retail, Urban opportunities and Subscale sectors, all of which were subject to the same full audit scope. The Group audit team performed all the work necessary to issue the Group and Parent Company audit opinion, including undertaking all of the audit work on the risks of material misstatement identi/fied above. As a result of all consolidated entities being full scope, we have achieved full coverage over Revenue, Loss before tax and Total assets.\n\n## KEY AUDIT MATTERS\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most signi/ficance in our audit of the /financial statements of the current period and include the most signi/ficant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identi/fied. These matters included those which had the greatest e/ffect on the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit, and directing the e/fforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the /financial statements as a whole, and in our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\nThis year we have included a new key audit matter: Impairment of trade receivables, including lease incentive balances. In light of the Covid-19 pandemic and the challenges over cash collection, particularly in the retail sector, the Group has seen a signi/ficant increase in the levels of outstanding debtor balances and bad and doubtful debt expense. The audit partner and other senior members of the audit team spent a signi/ficant amount of time assessing the judgements made and the appropriateness of the balances recorded.",

We determined that an asset-based measure would be the most appropriate basis for determining overall materiality given that key users of the Group's /financial statements are primarily focused on the valuation of the Group's assets. Based on this, we determined that it is appropriate to set the overall materiality at 0.9% of total assets (2020: 1% of total assets adjusted for certain cash items). We adjusted total assets in 2020 to remove the impact of cash drawn down close to year end in response to the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. This was paid back during the current /financial year and so no such adjustment was required in setting materiality. We have reduced the percentage of the basis taken to re/flect the increased risk pro/file from changes and uncertainty in the business environment due to Covid-19. We apply overall materiality to the investment property balances, including those in joint ventures, and other directly related balance sheet items such as the value of loans and borrowings which are secured against the Group's investment properties.\n\nThis provided a basis for determining the nature, timing and extent of risk assessment procedures, identifying and assessing the risk of/uni00A0material misstatement and determining the nature, timing and extent of further audit procedures.\n\nWe have determined that for other account balances not related to investment properties (either wholly owned or held within joint ventures) or loans and borrowings, a misstatement of less than overall materiality for the /financial statements as a whole could in/fluence the economic decisions of users. We believe that it is most appropriate to use a pro/fit-based measure as pro/fit is also a focus of users of/uni00A0the/uni00A0/financial statements.\n\nWe have determined that materiality for these areas should be based upon average revenue pro/fit before tax over two /financial years (2020 and 2021), \u00a3333m (2020: revenue pro/fit of \u00a3414m). This led to a reduction in the speci/fic materiality in response to the impact Covid-19 has had on the pro/fitability of the Group. Revenue pro/fit has declined due to the impact of Covid-19 and the resulting bad debt charges. We conclude that the speci/fic materiality is more appropriately determined using a normalised basis based on past results and that this better re/flects a normal level of earnings. We selected a two-year period as this is more aligned with the impacts of the ongoing pandemic and other structural changes in the retail property market.\n\nWe benchmarked this change in basis to setting speci/fic materiality against other UK listed REITs and determined that using a normalised basis gives a comparable approach in setting speci/fic materiality.\n\nWe reassessed initial materiality at the year end date and, as actual total assets were lower than that which we had used as the initial basis for determining overall materiality, our /final materiality was lower than the materiality we calculated initially.\n\n## PERFORMANCE MATERIALITY\n\nThe application of materiality at the individual account or balance level. It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level the/uni00A0probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality.\n\nOn the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Group's overall control environment, our judgement is that overall performance materiality and speci/fic performance materiality (i.e. our tolerance for misstatement in an individual account or balance) for the Group should be 75% (2020: 75%) of the respective materiality. We have set performance materiality at this percentage due to our past experience of the audit that indicates a lower risk of misstatements, both corrected and uncorrected.",

We also agreed to report di/fferences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to in/fluence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these /financial statements.\n\n## EXPLANATION AS TO WHAT EXTENT THE AUDIT WAS CONSIDERED CAPABLE OF DETECTING IRREGULARITIES, INCLUDING FRAUD\n\nIrregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect irregularities, including fraud. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is/uni00A0higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or/uni00A0intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including/uni00A0fraud is detailed below.\n\nHowever, the primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud rests with both those charged with governance of the Company and Management.\n\n## Our approach was as follows:\n\n- \u203a We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that are applicable to the Group and determined that the most relevant to the presentation of the Annual Report and Accounts are those that relate to the reporting framework (IFRS, the Companies Act 2006 and UK Corporate Governance Code), the relevant tax regulations in the United Kingdom, including the UK REIT regulations, the UK General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Health & Safety Regulations and the Bribery Act. There are no signi/ficant industry speci/fic laws or regulations that we considered in determining our approach. We understood how Land Securities Group PLC is complying with those frameworks through enquiry with Management, and by identifying the Group's policies and procedures regarding compliance with laws and regulations. We also identi/fied those members of Management who have the primary responsibility for ensuring compliance with laws and regulations, and for reporting any known instances of non-compliance to those charged with governance. We/uni00A0corroborated our enquiries through our review of Board minutes and papers provided to the Board and the Audit Committee, as well as consideration of the results of our audit procedures across the Group to either corroborate or provide contrary evidence which was then followed up. Our assessment included the tone from the top and the emphasis on a culture of honest and ethical behaviour.\n- \u203a We assessed the susceptibility of the Group's /financial statements to material misstatement, including how fraud might occur by reviewing the Company's risk register and enquiry with Management and the Audit Committee during the planning and execution phases of our audit. We considered the programmes and controls that the Group has established to address risks identi/fied, or that otherwise prevent, deter and detect fraud; and how Management monitors those programmes and controls.\n- \u203a Based on this understanding we designed our audit procedures to identify non-compliance with such laws and regulations. Our/uni00A0procedures involved:\n- - Enquiry of Management, and when appropriate, those charged with governance regarding their knowledge of any non-compliance or/uni00A0potential non-compliance with laws and regulations that could a/ffect the /financial statements;\n- - Reading minutes of meetings of those charged with governance;\n- - Obtaining electronic con/firmations from the Group's banking providers to vouch the existence of cash balances and completeness of/uni00A0loans, borrowings and other treasury positions such as derivatives;\n- - Obtaining and reading correspondence from legal and regulatory bodies, including the FRC and HMRC; and\n- - Journal entry testing, with a focus on manual journals and journals indicating large or unusual transactions based on our understanding of the business.\n\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the /financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council's website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.

        "page_content": "## Notes to the /financial statements\n\nfor the year ended 31 March 2021\n\n## SECTION 1 /endash.case GENERAL\n\nThis section contains a description of the Group's signi/ficant accounting policies that relate to the /financial statements as a whole. A description of accounting policies speci/fic to individual areas (e.g. investment properties) is included within the relevant note to the /financial statements.\n\nThis section also includes a summary of new accounting standards, amendments and interpretations that have been applied in the year and those not yet adopted, and their actual or expected impact on the reported results of the Group.\n\n## 1. BASIS OF PREPARATION AND CONSOLIDATION\n\n## BASIS OF PREPARATION\n\nThese /financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and in accordance with international accounting standards in/uni00A0conformity with the Companies Act 2006. The Group /financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs and IFRICs adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union. The /financial statements have been prepared in/uni00A0Pounds Sterling (rounded to the nearest one million), which is the presentation currency of the Group (Land Securities Group PLC and all/uni00A0its/uni00A0subsidiary undertakings), and under the historical cost convention as modi/fied by the revaluation of investment property, /financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (without recycling), derivative /financial instruments and pension assets.\n\nThe preparation of /financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires the use of estimates and assumptions that a/ffect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the /financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Although these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of/uni00A0the amount, event or actions, actual results ultimately may di/ffer from those estimates.\n\nLand Securities Group PLC (the Company) has not presented its own statement of comprehensive income (and separate income statement), as permitted by Section 408 of Companies Act 2006. The Merger reserve arose on 6 September 2002 when the Company acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Land Securities PLC. The Merger reserve represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the nominal value of the shares issued by the Company to acquire Land Securities PLC. The Merger reserve does not represent a realised or/uni00A0distributable pro/fit. Other reserves includes the Capital redemption reserve, which represents the nominal value of cancelled shares, the/uni00A0Share-based payment reserve and Own shares held by the Group.\n\n## GOING CONCERN\n\nAs the impact of Covid-19 on the Group continues to be signi/ficant, particularly on our ability to collect rent and service charge from customers, the Directors have continued to place additional focus on the appropriateness of adopting the going concern assumption in/uni00A0preparing the /financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2021. The Group's going concern assessment considers changes in the Group's principal risks (see pages 71 to 77) and is dependent on a number of factors, including our /financial performance and continued access to borrowing facilities. Access to our borrowing facilities is dependent on our ability to continue to operate the Group's secured debt/uni00A0structure within its /financial covenants, which are described in note 21.\n\nIn order to satisfy themselves that the Group has adequate resources to continue as a going concern for the foreseeable future, the Directors have reviewed a cash /flow model which considers the impact of pessimistic assumptions on the Group's operating environment (the 'Viability scenario'). This model re/flects unfavourable macro-economic conditions, a continuation of di/fficulties experienced collecting rent and service charge from our customers and removes uncommitted acquisitions, disposals and developments. We also assume that we/uni00A0are unable to raise any new /finance over this period.",

The value of our assets would need to fall from 31 March 2021 values by a further 50% for LTV to reach 65%. The Directors consider the likelihood of this occurring over the going concern assessment period to be remote.\n\nThe Security Group requires earnings of at least \u00a371m in the year ending 31 March 2022 for interest cover to remain above 1.45x in the Viability scenario, which would ensure compliance through to the end of the going concern assessment period. Despite the challenging trading conditions experienced during the year ended 31 March 2021, Security Group earnings are well above the level required to meet the/uni00A0interest cover covenant. Therefore, the Directors do not anticipate a reduction in Security Group earnings over the period ending 31 May 2022 to a level that would result in a breach of the interest cover covenant, even if the trading conditions experienced in the year/uni00A0ended 31 March 2021 continue over this period. More detail on the Security Group can be found in note 25.\n\nThe Directors have also considered a reverse stress-test scenario which assumes no further rent will be received to determine when our available cash resources would be exhausted. Even under this extreme scenario, the Group continues to have su/fficient cash reserves to continue in operation throughout the going concern assessment period.\n\nBased on these considerations, together with available market information and the Directors' knowledge and experience of the Group's property portfolio and markets, the Directors have adopted the going concern basis in preparing these /financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2021.\n\n## BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION\n\nThe consolidated /financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2021 incorporate the /financial statements of the Company and all its subsidiary undertakings. Subsidiary undertakings are those entities controlled by the Company. Control exists where an entity is exposed to/uni00A0variable returns and has the ability to a/ffect those returns through its power over the investee.\n\nThe results of subsidiaries and joint ventures acquired or disposed of during the year are included from the e/ffective date of acquisition or/uni00A0to the e/ffective date of disposal. Accounting policies of subsidiaries and joint ventures which di/ffer from Group accounting policies are/uni00A0adjusted on consolidation.\n\nWhere instruments in a subsidiary held by third parties are redeemable at the option of the holder, these interests are classi/fied as a /financial liability, called the redemption liability. The liability is carried at fair value; the value is reassessed at the balance sheet date and/uni00A0movements are recognised in the income statement.\n\nJoint arrangements are those entities over whose activities the Group has joint control, established by contractual agreement. Interests in joint arrangements are accounted for as either a joint venture or a joint operation. A joint arrangement is accounted for as a joint venture when the Group, along with the other parties that have joint control of the arrangement, have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. Interests in joint ventures are equity accounted. The equity method requires the Group's share of the joint venture's post-tax pro/fit or loss for the year to be presented separately in the income statement and the Group's share of the joint venture's net assets to be presented separately in the balance sheet. A joint arrangement is accounted for as a joint operation when the Group, along with the parties that have joint control of the arrangement, have rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities relating to the arrangement. Joint operations are accounted for by including the Group's share of the assets, liabilities, income and expenses on a line-by-line basis.\n\nIntra-group balances and any unrealised gains and losses arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated /financial statements. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Group's interest in the joint venture concerned. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.",

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES\n\nThe preparation of /financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to exercise judgement in applying the Group's accounting policies. The areas where the Group considers the judgements to be most signi/ficant involve assumptions or estimates in respect of future events, where actual results may di/ffer from these estimates.\n\n## JUDGEMENTS\n\n- \u203a Recognising revenue where property management activities are performed by a third party (note 6)\n- \u203a Compliance with the Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) taxation regime and the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities (note 12)\n- \u203a Accounting for property acquisitions and disposals (note 14)\n\n## ESTIMATES\n\n- \u203a Valuation of investment and trading properties (note 14)\n- \u203a Impairment of trade receivables (note 26)\n\n## 3. CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND STANDARDS\n\nThe accounting policies used in these /financial statements are consistent with those applied in the last annual /financial statements, as/uni00A0amended where relevant to re/flect the adoption of new standards, amendments and interpretations which became e/ffective in the/uni00A0year, none of which have had a signi/ficant impact on the Group or Company's income statement or balance sheet.\n\n## AMENDMENTS TO IFRS\n\nA number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations have been issued but are not yet e/ffective for the Group. The/uni00A0application of these new standards, amendments and interpretations are not expected to have a signi/ficant impact on the Group's income statement or balance sheet.\n\n## SECTION 2 /endash.case PERFORMANCE\n\nThis section focuses on the performance of the Group for the year, including segmental information, earnings per share and net assets per/uni00A0share, together with further details on speci/fic components of the income statement and dividends paid.\n\nOur property portfolio is a combination of properties that are wholly owned by the Group, part owned through joint arrangements and properties owned by the Group but where a third party holds a non-controlling interest. Internally, management review the results of the Group on a basis that adjusts for these di/fferent forms of ownership to present a proportionate share. The Combined Portfolio, with assets totalling \u00a310.8bn , is an example of this approach, re/flecting the economic interest we have in our properties regardless of our ownership structure. We consider this presentation provides further understanding to stakeholders of the activities and performance of the Group, as/uni00A0it aggregates the results of all of the Group's property interests which under IFRS are required to be presented across a number of line items in the statutory /financial statements.\n\nThe same principle is applied to many of the other measures we discuss and, accordingly, a number of our /financial measures include the results of our joint ventures and subsidiaries on a proportionate basis. Measures that are described as being presented on a proportionate basis include the Group's share of joint ventures on a line-by-line basis and are adjusted to exclude the non-owned elements of our subsidiaries. This is in contrast to the Group's statutory /financial statements, where the Group's interest in joint ventures is presented as one line on the income statement and balance sheet, and all subsidiaries are consolidated at 100% with any non-owned element being adjusted as a non-controlling interest or redemption liability, as appropriate. Our joint operations are presented on a proportionate basis in/uni00A0all /financial measures.\n\nOur income statement has two key components: the income we generate from leasing our investment properties net of associated costs (including interest expense), which we refer to as revenue pro/fit, and items not directly related to the underlying rental business, principally valuation changes, pro/fits or losses on the disposal of properties, re/financing activity and exceptional items, which we refer to as Capital and other items. Our income statement is presented in a columnar format, split into those items that relate to revenue pro/fit and Capital and other items. The total column represents the Group's results presented in accordance with IFRS; the other columns provide additional information. We believe revenue pro/fit provides further understanding of the results of the Group's operational performance to stakeholders as it focuses on the rental income performance of the business and excludes Capital and other items which can vary signi/ficantly from year to year. A full de/finition of revenue pro/fit is given in the glossary. The components of revenue pro/fit are presented on/uni00A0a proportionate basis in note 4.",

SEGMENTAL INFORMATION\n\nThe Group's operations are managed across four operating segments, being Central London, Regional retail, Urban opportunities and Subscale sectors.\n\nThe Central London segment includes all assets geographically located within central London. Regional retail includes all regional shopping centres and shops outside London and our outlets. The Urban opportunities segment includes those assets where we see the most potential for capital investment. Subscale sectors mainly includes assets that will not be a focus for capital investment and consists of/uni00A0leisure and hotel assets and retail parks.\n\nIn the year ended 31 March 2020, we merged our London Portfolio and Retail Portfolio and amended our reporting to the Executive Committee (ExecCom) to re/flect the predominant use class of our assets, grouped into O/ffice, Retail and Specialist. Subsequently, during the year ended 31 March 2021, we merged these three segments into four new reporting segments to support our new strategy and better re/flect the way the business is now being managed. The comparative year has been presented in the new format and a reconciliation to the previous presentation has been provided on our website.\n\nManagement has determined the Group's operating segments based on the information reviewed by Senior Management to make strategic decisions. Until 8 December 2020, the chief operating decision maker was ExecCom, which comprised the Executive Directors, the/uni00A0Group General Counsel and Company Secretary and the Group HR Director. From 9 December 2020, ExecCom was replaced by the Executive Leadership Team (ELT), comprising the Executive Directors and the Managing Directors. The information presented to ELT includes reports from all functions of the business as well as strategy, /financial planning, succession planning, organisational development and Group-wide policies.\n\nThe Group's primary measure of underlying pro/fit before tax is revenue pro/fit. However, Segment net rental income is the lowest level to which the pro/fit arising from the ongoing operations of the Group is analysed between the four segments. The indirect costs, which are predominantly sta/ff costs, are all treated as indirect expenses and are not allocated to individual segments.\n\nThe Group manages its /financing structure, with the exception of joint ventures, on a pooled basis. Individual joint ventures may have speci/fic /financing arrangements in place. Debt facilities and /finance expenses, including those of joint ventures, are managed centrally and/uni00A0are therefore not attributed to a particular segment. Unallocated income and expenses are items incurred centrally which are not directly attributable to one of the segments.\n\nAll items in the segmental information note are presented on a proportionate basis. A reconciliation from the Group income statement to/uni00A0the information presented in the segmental information note is included in table 114.",

REVENUE\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICY\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRental income, including /fixed rental uplifts, is recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Lease incentives being o/ffered to occupiers to enter into a lease, such as an initial rent-free period or a cash contribution to /fit out or similar costs, are an integral part of the net consideration for the use of the property and are therefore recognised on the same straight-line basis. Where the total consideration due under a lease is modi/fied, for example, where a concession is granted to a tenant prior to the date the conceded rent falls due, the revised total amount due under the lease is recognised on a straight-line basis over the remaining term of the lease.\n\nContingent rents, being lease payments that are not /fixed at the inception of a lease, for example turnover rents, are variable consideration and are recorded as income in the year in which they are earned. Where a single payment is received from a tenant to cover both rent and service charge, the service charge component is separated and reported as service charge income.\n\nThe Group's revenue from contracts with customers, as de/fined in IFRS 15, includes service charge income, other property related income, trading property sales proceeds and long-term development contract income.\n\nService charge income and management fees are recorded as income over time in the year in which the services are rendered. Revenue is recognised over time because the tenants bene/fit from the services as soon as they are rendered by the Group. The actual service provided during each reporting period is determined using cost incurred as the input method.\n\nOther property related income includes development and asset management fees. These fees are recognised over time, using time elapsed as the input method which measures the bene/fit simultaneously received and consumed by the customer, over the period the development or asset management services are provided.\n\nProceeds received on the sale of trading properties are recognised when control of the property transfers to the buyer, i.e. the buyer has the ability to direct the use of the property and the right to the cash in/flows and out/flows generated by it. This generally occurs on unconditional exchange or on completion. If completion is expected to occur signi/ficantly after exchange or if the Group has signi/ficant outstanding obligations between exchange and completion, the Group assesses whether there are multiple performance obligations in the contract and recognises revenue as each performance obligation is satis/fied.\n\nWhen property is let under a /finance lease, the Group recognises a receivable equal to the net investment in the lease at inception of the lease. Rentals received are accounted for as repayments of principal and /finance income as appropriate. Finance income is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining net investment in the /finance lease and is recognised within revenue.\n\nRevenue on long-term development contracts is recognised over time over the period of the contract as the Group creates or enhances an/uni00A0asset that the customer controls. Progress towards completion of the development, by reference to the value of work completed using the/uni00A0costs incurred to date as a proportion of total costs expected to be incurred over the term of the contract is used as the input method.",

COSTS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICY\n\nThe carrying amounts of the Group's non-/financial assets, other than investment properties, are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset's recoverable amount is estimated. An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement whenever the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of an asset is the greater of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. The value in use is determined as the net present value of the future cash /flows expected to be derived from the asset, discounted using a pre-tax discount rate that re/flects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks speci/fic to the asset. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount after the reversal does not exceed the amount that would have been determined, net of applicable depreciation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.\n\nRents payable re/flect amounts due under head leases. Where rents payable are variable, and do not depend on an index or rate, the payments are recognised in the income statement as incurred. Where these rents are /fixed, or in-substance /fixed, at the inception of the agreement, or/uni00A0become /fixed or in-substance /fixed at some point over the life of the agreement, an asset representing the right to use the underlying land and a corresponding liability for the present value of the minimum future lease payments are recognised on the Group's balance sheet within Investment properties and borrowings respectively.\n\nAll costs are classi/fied within the 'Revenue pro/fit' column of the income statement, with the exception of the cost of sale of trading properties, costs arising on long-term development contracts, amortisation and impairments of intangible assets arising on business combinations and the non-owned element of the Group's subsidiaries which are presented in the 'Capital and other items' column.\n\n|                                                 | Revenue   pro/fit /sterling.tfm   | Capital  and other  items /sterling.tfm   | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf Total /sterling.tfm   | Revenue   pro/fit /sterling.tfm   | Capital  and other  items /sterling.tfm   | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf Total /sterling.tfm   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| Rents payable                                   | /seven.tf                         | -

This /final dividend will result in a further estimated distribution of \u00a367m (2020: \u00a3nil). Subject to shareholders' approval at the Annual General Meeting, the /final dividend will be paid on 23 July 2021 to shareholders registered at the close of business on 18 June 2021.\n\nThe total dividend paid and recommended in respect of the year ended 31 March 2021 is 27p per ordinary share (2020: 23.2p) resulting in/uni00A0a total estimated distribution of \u00a3200m (2020: \u00a3172m).\n\nThe /first quarterly dividend for the year ending 31 March 2022 will be paid in October 2021 and will be announced in due course.\n\nA Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP) has been available in respect of all dividends paid during the year.

INCOME TAX\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICY\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIncome tax on the pro/fit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax is the tax payable on the taxable income for/uni00A0the year and any adjustment in respect of previous years. Deferred tax is provided in full using the balance sheet liability method on/uni00A0temporary di/fferences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for /financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for/uni00A0taxation purposes. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date and/uni00A0are expected to apply when the asset is realised, or the liability is settled.\n\nNo provision is made for temporary di/fferences (i) arising on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities, other than on a business combination, that a/ffect neither accounting nor taxable pro/fit and (ii) relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will/uni00A0not reverse in the foreseeable future.",

INCOME TAX CONTINUED\n\n## SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENT\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Group is a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT). As a result, the Group does not pay UK corporation tax on its pro/fits and gains from the/uni00A0qualifying rental business in the UK. Non-qualifying pro/fits and gains of the Group continue to be subject to corporation tax as normal. In order to maintain group REIT status, certain ongoing criteria must be met. The main criteria are as follows:\n\n- \u203a at the start of each accounting period, the assets of the tax exempt business must be at least 75% of the total value of the Group's assets;\n- \u203a at least 75% of the Group's total pro/fits must arise from the tax exempt business; and\n- \u203a at least 90% of the notional taxable pro/fit of the property rental business must be distributed.\n\nThe Directors intend that the Group should continue as a REIT for the foreseeable future, with the result that deferred tax is no longer recognised on temporary di/fferences relating to the property rental business.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities require management judgement in determining the amounts, if any, to be recognised. In particular, judgement is required when assessing the extent to which deferred tax assets should be recognised, taking into account the expected timing and level of future taxable income. Deferred tax assets are only recognised when management believe they will be recovered against future taxable pro/fits.\n\nThere is no income tax charge in the income statement. In the year ended 31 March 2020, there was an income tax credit of \u00a35m in the income statement, comprising tax credits received and a payment for losses surrendered to one of the Group's joint ventures of \u00a34m and/uni00A0a deferred tax credit of \u00a31m. There is a deferred tax credit of \u00a32m (2020: \u00a31m charge) included within Other comprehensive income.\n\nThe tax for the year is lower than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 19% . The di/fferences are explained in the table below.\n\n|                                                                                         | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf /sterling.tfm   | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf /sterling.tfm   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| Loss before tax                                                                         | (/one.tf,/three.tf/nine.tf/three.tf)          | (/eight.tf/three.tf/seven.tf)                  |\n| Loss before tax multiplied by the rate of corporation tax in the UK of /one.tf/nine.tf% | (/two.tf/six.tf/five.tf)                      | (/one.tf/five.tf/nine.tf)                      |\n| Adjustment for exempt property rental (pro/fits)/losses and revaluations in the year    | /two.tf/seven.tf/four.tf                      | /one.tf/five.tf/eight.tf                       |\n|                                                                                         | /nine.tf                                      | (/one.tf)                                      |\n| E/ffects of:                                                                            |                                               |                                                |\n| Timing di/fference on repurchase of medium term notes                                   | (/one.tf/zero.tf)                             | -                                              |\n| Interest rate fair value movements and other temporary di/fferences                     | (/one.tf)                                     | -                                              |\n| Non-allowable expenses and non-taxable items                                            | /one.tf                                       | /one.tf                                        |\n| Movement in unrecognised tax losses                                                     | /one.tf                                       | (/three.tf)                                    |\n| Other tax adjustments                                                                   | -                                             | (/two.tf)                                      |\n| Total income tax credit in the income statement                                         | -                                             | (/five.tf)                                     |\n|                                                                                         | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf /sterling.tfm   | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf /sterling.tfm   |\n| The Group's deferred tax liability is analysed as follows:                              |                                               |                                                |\n| Arising on business combination                                                         | /one.tf                                       | /one.tf                                        |\n| Arising on pension surplus                                                              | /one.tf                                       | /three.tf                                      |\n| Total deferred tax liability                                                            | /two.tf                                       | /four.tf                                       |\n\nDeferred tax is calculated at the rate substantively enacted at the balance sheet date of 19% .

It includes details of investment properties, investments in joint ventures and trading properties.\n\nOur property portfolio is a combination of properties that are wholly owned by the Group, part owned through joint arrangements and properties owned by the Group but where a third party holds a non-controlling interest. In the Group's IFRS balance sheet, wholly owned properties are presented as either 'Investment properties' or 'Trading properties'. The Group applies equity accounting to its investments in joint ventures, which requires the Group's share of properties held by joint ventures to be presented within 'Investments in joint ventures'.\n\nInternally, management review the results of the Group on a basis that adjusts for these forms of ownership to present a proportionate share. The Combined Portfolio, with assets totalling \u00a310.8bn , is an example of this proportionate share, re/flecting the economic interest we have in our properties regardless of our ownership structure. We consider this presentation provides further insight to stakeholders about the activities and performance of the Group, as it aggregates the results of all of the Group's property interests which under IFRS are required to be presented across a number of line items in the statutory /financial statements.\n\nThe Group's investment properties are carried at fair value and trading properties are carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Both of these values are determined by the Group's external valuers. The combined value of the Group's total investment property portfolio (including the Group's share of investment properties held through joint ventures) is shown as a reconciliation in note 14.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the /hyphen.casenancial statements\n\nfor the year ended 31 March 2021 continued\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## INVESTMENT PROPERTIES\n\nInvestment properties are properties, either owned or leased by the Group, that are held either to earn rental income or for capital appreciation, or both. Investment properties are measured initially at cost including related transaction costs, and subsequently at fair value. Fair value is based on market value, as determined by a professional external valuer at each reporting date. The di/fference between the fair value of an investment property at the reporting date and its carrying amount prior to re-measurement is included in the income statement as a valuation surplus or de/ficit. Investment properties are presented on the balance sheet within non-current assets.\n\nSome of the Group's investment properties are owned through long-leasehold arrangements, as opposed to the Group owning the freehold. Where the Group is a lessee, a right-of-use asset is recognised at the commencement date of the lease and accounted for as investment property. Initially, the cost of investment properties held under leases includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received. The investment properties held/uni00A0under leases are subsequently carried at their fair value. A corresponding liability is recorded within borrowings. Each lease payment is/uni00A0allocated between repayment of the liability and a /finance charge to achieve a constant interest rate on the outstanding liability.\n\n## TRADING PROPERTIES\n\nTrading properties are those properties held for sale, or those being developed with a view to sell. Trading properties are recorded at the/uni00A0lower of cost and net realisable value. The net realisable value of a trading property is determined by a professional external valuer at/uni00A0each/uni00A0reporting date. If the net realisable value of a trading property is lower than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded in/uni00A0the income statement. If, in subsequent periods, the net realisable value of a trading property that was previously impaired increases above its/uni00A0carrying value, the impairment is reversed to align the carrying value of the property with the net realisable value. Trading properties are/uni00A0presented on the balance sheet within current assets.\n\n## ACQUISITION OF PROPERTIES\n\nProperties are treated as acquired when the Group assumes control of the property.\n\n## CAPITAL EXPENDITURE AND CAPITALISATION OF BORROWING COSTS\n\nCapital expenditure on properties consists of costs of a capital nature, including costs associated with developments and refurbishments. Where a property is being developed or undergoing major refurbishment, interest costs associated with direct expenditure on the property are capitalised. The interest capitalised is calculated using the Group's weighted average cost of borrowings. Interest is capitalised from the/uni00A0commencement of the development work until the date of practical completion. Certain internal sta/ff and associated costs directly attributable to the management of major schemes are also capitalised. The total sta/ff and associated costs are capitalised based on the proportion of time spent on the relevant scheme. Internal sta/ff costs are capitalised from the date the Group determines it is probable that the development will progress until the date of practical completion.\n\n## TRANSFERS BETWEEN INVESTMENT PROPERTIES AND TRADING PROPERTIES\n\nWhen the Group begins to redevelop an existing investment property for continued future use as an investment property, the property continues to be held as an investment property. When the Group begins to redevelop an existing investment property with a view to sell, the property is transferred to trading properties and held as a current asset. The property is re-measured to fair value as at the date of the/uni00A0transfer with any gain or loss being taken to the income statement. The re-measured amount becomes the deemed cost at which the/uni00A0property is then carried in trading properties.\n\n## DISPOSAL OF PROPERTIES\n\nProperties are treated as disposed when control of the property is transferred to the buyer. Typically, this will either occur on unconditional exchange or on completion. Where completion is expected to occur signi/ficantly after exchange, or where the Group continues to have signi/ficant outstanding obligations after exchange, the control will not usually transfer to the buyer until completion.\n\nThe pro/fit on disposal is determined as the di/fference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset at the beginning of/uni00A0the accounting period plus capital expenditure to the date of disposal. The pro/fit on disposal of investment properties is presented separately on the face of the income statement. Proceeds received on the sale of trading properties are recognised within Revenue, and/uni00A0the carrying value at the date of disposal is recognised within Costs.",

        "page_content": "## SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## ACQUISITION AND DISPOSAL OF PROPERTIES\n\nProperty transactions can be complex in nature and material to the /financial statements. To determine when an acquisition or disposal should be recognised, management consider whether the Group assumes or relinquishes control of the property, and the point at which this is obtained or relinquished. Consideration is given to the terms of the acquisition or disposal contracts and any conditions that must/uni00A0be/uni00A0satis/fied before the contract is ful/filled. In the case of an acquisition, management must also consider whether the transaction represents an asset acquisition or business combination.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\n\n## VALUATION OF THE GROUP'S PROPERTIES\n\nThe valuation of the Group's property portfolio is inherently subjective due to, among other factors, the individual nature of each property, its location and the expected future rental revenues from that particular property. As a result, the valuations the Group places on its property portfolio are subject to a degree of uncertainty and are made on the basis of assumptions which may not prove to be accurate, particularly in periods of volatility or low transaction /flow in the property market.\n\nThe investment property valuation contains a number of assumptions upon which the Group's valuer has based its valuation of the Group's properties. The assumptions on which the property valuation reports have been based include, but are not limited to, matters such as the tenure and tenancy details for the properties, ground conditions at the properties, the structural condition of the properties, prevailing market yields and comparable market transactions. These assumptions are market standard and accord with the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) Valuation - Professional Standards UK.\n\nThe estimation of the net realisable value of the Group's trading properties, in particular the development land and infrastructure programmes, is inherently subjective due to a number of factors, including their complexity, unusually large size, the substantial expenditure required and long timescales to completion. In addition, as a result of these timescales to completion, the plans associated with these programmes could be subject to signi/ficant variation. As a result, and similar to the valuation of investment properties, the net realisable values of the Group's trading properties are subject to a degree of uncertainty and are determined on the basis of assumptions which may not prove to be accurate.\n\nIf the assumptions upon which the external valuer has based its valuations prove to be inaccurate, this may have an impact on the value of/uni00A0the Group's investment and trading properties, which could in turn have an e/ffect on the Group's /financial position and results.\n\nThe Valuer's report for the year ended 31 March 2020 contained a 'material uncertainty' clause due to the disruption to the market at that date caused by Covid-19. The inclusion of this clause indicated that there was substantially more uncertainty than normal and therefore a/uni00A0higher likelihood that the assumptions upon which the external valuer had based its valuations prove to be inaccurate. As a result of this/uni00A0increased uncertainty, sensitivities for more extensive changes in assumptions were disclosed in the table on page 176. The material uncertainty clause was removed from the Valuer's report for the year ended 31 March 2021, except in relation to the valuation of hotels which only form a small portion of the Group's portfolio. Therefore the range of sensitivities disclosed in the table on page 175 have been reduced back to previous levels.\n\n## 14.

In December /two.tf/zero.tf/one.tf/nine.tf, the Group purchased this additional interest thereby settling the redemption liability.\n\nThe net book value of leasehold properties where head leases have been capitalised is \u00a32,484m (2020: \u00a32,561m).\n\nInvestment properties include capitalised interest of \u00a3232m (2020: \u00a3221m). The average rate of interest capitalisation for the year is 2.6% (2020: 2.6%). The historical cost of investment properties is \u00a37,554m (2020: \u00a37,463m).\n\n## VALUATION PROCESS\n\nThe fair value of investment properties at 31 March 2021 was determined by the Group's external valuer, CBRE. The valuations are in accordance with RICS standards and were arrived at by reference to market evidence of transactions for similar properties. The valuations performed by the valuer are reviewed internally by Senior Management and other relevant people within the business. This process includes discussions of the assumptions used by the valuer, as well as a review of the resulting valuations. Discussions of the valuation process and results are held between Senior Management, the Audit Committee and the valuer on a half-yearly basis.\n\nThe valuer's opinion of fair value was primarily derived using comparable recent market transactions on arm's length terms and using appropriate valuation techniques. The fair value of investment properties is determined using the income capitalisation approach. Under this approach, forecast net cash /flows, based upon current market derived estimated rental values (market rents) together with estimated costs, are discounted at market derived capitalisation rates to produce the valuer's opinion of fair value. The average discount rate, which, if applied to all cash /flows would produce the fair value, is described as the equivalent yield.\n\nProperties in the development programme are typically valued using a residual valuation method. Under this methodology, the valuer assesses the completed development value using income and yield assumptions. Deductions are then made for estimated costs to complete, including /finance and developer's pro/fit, to arrive at the valuation. Costs include future estimated costs associated with refurbishment or development (excluding /finance costs), together with an estimate of cash incentives to be paid to tenants. As the development approaches completion, the valuer may consider the income capitalisation approach to be more appropriate.\n\nThe Group considers all of its investment properties to fall within 'Level 3', as de/fined by IFRS 13 and as explained in note 25(iii). Accordingly, there have been no transfers of properties within the fair value hierarchy in the /financial year.",

JOINT ARRANGEMENTS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICY\n\nJoint arrangements are those entities over whose activities the Group has joint control, established by contractual agreement. Interests in/uni00A0joint arrangements are accounted for as either a joint venture or a joint operation. The treatment as either a joint venture or a joint operation will depend on whether the Group has rights to the net assets, or a direct interest in the assets and liabilities of the arrangement.\n\nA joint arrangement is accounted for as a joint venture when the Group, along with the other parties that have joint control of the arrangement, has rights to the net assets of the arrangement. Interests in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of/uni00A0accounting. The equity method requires the Group's share of the joint venture's post-tax pro/fit or loss for the year to be presented separately in the income statement and the Group's share of the joint venture's net assets to be presented separately in the balance sheet.\n\nA joint arrangement is accounted for as a joint operation when the Group, along with the parties that have joint control of the arrangement, has rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities relating to the arrangement. The Group's share of jointly controlled assets, related liabilities, income and expenses are combined with the equivalent items in the /financial statements on a line-by-line basis.\n\nThe Group's principal joint arrangements are described below:\n\n| Joint ventures                                               | Percentage owned  &/uni00A0voting rights   | Business segment                   | Year end date /one.tf      | Joint venture partner                                                                                   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Held at /three.tf/one.tf March /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf |                                            |                                    |                            |                                                                                                         |\n| Nova, Victoria /two.tf                                       | /five.tf/zero.tf%                          | Central London                     | /three.tf/one.tf  M a rc h | Suntec Real Estate Investment Trust                                                                     |\n| Southside Limited Partnership                                | /five.tf/zero.tf%                          | Urban opportunities                | /three.tf/one.tf  M a rc h | Invesco Real Estate European Fund                                                                       |\n| St. David's Limited Partnership                              | /five.tf/zero.tf%                          | Regional retail                    | /three.tf/one.tf December  | Intu Properties plc /three.tf                                                                           |\n| Westgate Oxford Alliance Limited Partnership                 | /five.tf/zero.tf%                          | Regional retail,  Subscale sectors | /three.tf/one.tf  M a rc h | The Crown Estate Commissioners                                                                          |\n| Harvest  /four.tf, /five.tf                                  | /five.tf/zero.tf%                          | Subscale sectors                   | /three.tf/one.tf  M a rc h | J Sainsbury plc                                                                                         |\n| The Ebbs/fleet Limited Partnership /four.tf                  | /five.tf/zero.tf%                          | Subscale sectors                   | /three.tf/one.tf  M a rc h | Ebbs/fleet Property Limited                                                                             |\n| West India Quay Unit Trust  /four.tf                         | /five.tf/zero.tf%                          | Subscale sectors                   | /three.tf/one.tf  M a rc h | Schroder UK Real Estate Fund                                                                            |\n| Joint operation                                              | Ownership interest                         | Business segment                   | Year end date /one.tf      | Joint operation partners                                                                                |\n| Held at /three.tf/one.tf March /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf |                                            |                                    |                            |                                                                                                         |\n| Bluewater, Kent                                              | /three.tf/zero.tf%                         | Regional retail                    | /three.tf/one.tf  M a rc h | M&G Real Estate and GIC Lendlease Retail LP Royal London Asset Management Aberdeen Standard Investments |",

JOINT ARRANGEMENTS CONTINUED\n\nAll of the Group's joint arrangements have their principal place of business in the United Kingdom. All of the Group's joint arrangements own and operate investment property, with the exception of The Ebbs/fleet Limited Partnership which holds development land as a trading property and Harvest which is engaged in long-term development contracts. The activities of all the Group's joint arrangements are therefore strategically important to the business activities of the Group.\n\nAll joint ventures are registered in England and Wales with the exception of Southside Limited Partnership and West India Quay Unit Trust which are registered in Jersey.\n\n| Joint ventures                                       | Nova,                                           | Southside  Limited  Partnership /one.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf%   | St. David's  Limited  Partnership /one.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf% /sterling.tfm   | Westgate  Oxford  Alliance  Partnership /one.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf%   | Other /one.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf%   | Year ended /three.tf/one.tf March /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf   | Year ended /three.tf/one.tf March /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Comprehensive income statement                       | Victoria /one.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf% /sterling.tfm | /sterling.tfm                                              |                                                                            | /sterling.tfm                                                      | /sterling.tfm                    | Total /one.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf% /sterling.tfm                      | Total Group  share /sterling.tfm                                  |\n| Revenue /one.tf                                      | /five.tf/three.tf                               | /one.tf/one.tf                                             | /three.tf/zero.tf                                                          | /three.tf/two.tf                                                   | /eight.tf                        | /one.tf/three.tf/four.tf                                          | /six.tf/seven.tf                                                  |\n| Gross rental income (after rents payable)            | /three.tf/five.tf                               | /one.tf/zero.tf                                            | /two.tf/three.tf                                                           | /two.tf/four.tf                                                    | /four.tf                         | /nine.tf/six.tf                                                   | /four.tf/eight.tf                                                 |\n| Net rental income                                    | /three.tf/two.tf                                | /four.tf                                                   | /six.tf                                                                    | /six.tf                                                            | /one.tf                          | /four.tf/nine.tf                                                  | /two.tf/four.tf                                                   |\n| Revenue pro/fit before interest                      | /two.tf/eight.tf                                | /four.tf                                                   | /five.tf                                                                   | /five.tf                                                           | /one.tf                          | /four.tf/three.tf                                                 | /two.tf/two.tf                                                    |\n| Finance expense                                      | (/two.tf/two.tf)                                | (/six.tf)                                                  | -

Software assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful economic lives, normally three to /five years.\n\n|                                                          | Goodwill  /sterling.tfm   | Software  /sterling.tfm   | Other  intangible   asset /sterling.tfm   | Total  /sterling.tfm   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------|\n| At /one.tf April /two.tf/zero.tf/one.tf/nine.tf          | /two.tf                   | /seven.tf                 | /one.tf/one.tf                            | /two.tf/zero.tf        |\n| Capital expenditure                                      | -                         | /two.tf                   | -                                         | /two.tf                |\n| Amortisation                                             | -                         | (/three.tf)               | -                                         | (/three.tf)            |\n| Impairment                                               | (/one.tf)                 | -                         | (/four.tf)                                | (/five.tf)             |\n| At /three.tf/one.tf March /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf | /one.tf                   | /six.tf                   | /seven.tf                                 | /one.tf/four.tf        |\n| Capital expenditure                                      | -                         | /two.tf                   | -                                         | /two.tf                |\n| Amortisation                                             | -                         | (/three.tf)               | (/one.tf)                                 | (/four.tf)             |\n| Impairment                                               | -                         | -                         | (/four.tf)                                | (/four.tf)             |\n| At /three.tf/one.tf March /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf  | /one.tf                   | /five.tf                  | /two.tf                                   | /eight.tf              |\n\nThe other intangible asset relates to the Group's acquisition of its interest in Bluewater, Kent in 2014 and represents the estimated fair value of the management rights for the centre. The fair value at the date of acquisition was \u00a330m and the asset is being amortised over a period of 20 years. On recognition of the intangible asset, the Group recognised a deferred tax liability of \u00a36m, and corresponding goodwill of the same amount. The deferred tax liability is being released to the income statement as the intangible asset is amortised or impaired, and the corresponding element of the goodwill is being tested for impairment.\n\nIn the year ended 31 March 2021, the intangible asset has been impaired by \u00a34m (2020: \u00a34m) as a result of a decline in the management fees expected to be earned by the Group for managing the asset following further declines in its valuation. The recoverable amount of the/uni00A0intangible asset has been based on its value in use, using a discount rate of 4.0% .",

The Group's strategy is to maintain an appropriate net debt to total equity ratio (gearing) and loan-to-value ratio (LTV) to ensure that asset level performance is translated into enhanced returns for/uni00A0shareholders while maintaining an appropriate risk reward balance to accommodate changing /financial and operating market cycles. The table in note 20 details a number of the Group's key metrics in relation to managing its capital structure.\n\nA key element of the Group's capital structure is that the majority of our borrowings are secured against a large pool of our assets (the Security Group). This enables us to raise long-term debt in the bond market, as well as shorter-term /flexible bank facilities, both at/uni00A0competitive rates. In general, we follow a secured debt strategy as we believe this gives the Group better access to borrowings at a/uni00A0lower cost.\n\nIn addition, the Group holds a number of assets outside the Security Group structure (in the Non-restricted Group). By having both the Security Group and the Non-restricted Group, and considerable /flexibility to move assets between the two, we are able to raise the most appropriate /finance for each speci/fic asset or joint venture.\n\n## 20.

The Security Group includes investment properties, development properties, the X-Leisure fund, and the Group's investment in Westgate Oxford Alliance Limited Partnership, Nova Victoria, St. David's Limited Partnership and Southside Limited Partnership, in total valued at \u00a310.6bn at 31 March 2021 (2020: \u00a312.1bn). The secured debt structure has a tiered operating covenant regime which gives the Group substantial /flexibility when the loan-to-value and interest cover in the Security Group are less than 65% and more than 1.45x respectively. If these limits are exceeded, the operating environment becomes more restrictive with provisions to encourage a reduction in gearing. The interest rate of each MTN is /fixed until the expected maturity, being two years before the legal maturity date of the MTN. The interest rate for the last two years may either become /floating on a LIBOR basis plus an increased margin (relative to that at the time of issue), or subject to a /fixed coupon uplift, depending on the terms and conditions of the speci/fic notes.\n\nThe e/ffective interest rate is based on the coupon paid and includes the amortisation of issue costs. The MTNs are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange and their fair values are based on their respective market prices.\n\nDuring the year, the Group purchased \u00a312m (2020: \u00a3196m) of MTNs for a total premium of \u00a33m (2020: \u00a359m). Details of the purchases and associated premium by series are as follows:\n\n| MTN purchases                                                                                | Purchases /sterling.tfm   | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf Premium /sterling.tfm   | Purchases /sterling.tfm   | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf Premium /sterling.tfm   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| A/one.tf/zero.tf /four.tf./eight.tf/seven.tf/five.tf% MTN due /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/five.tf | -                         | -                                                     | /four.tf                  | /one.tf                                                |\n| A/four.tf  /five.tf./three.tf/nine.tf/one.tf% MTN due /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/six.tf          | -                         | -                                                     | /eight.tf                 | /one.tf                                                |\n| A/five.tf  /five.tf./three.tf/nine.tf/one.tf% MTN due /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/seven.tf        | /eight.tf                 | /two.tf                                               | /nine.tf/one.tf           | /two.tf/zero.tf                                        |\n| A/six.tf  /five.tf./three.tf/seven.tf/six.tf% MTN due /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/nine.tf         | -                         | -                                                     | /one.tf/two.tf            | /three.tf                                              |\n| A/seven.tf  /five.tf./three.tf/nine.tf/six.tf% MTN due /two.tf/zero.tf/three.tf/two.tf       | /four.tf                  | /one.tf                                               | /seven.tf/five.tf         | /three.tf/one.tf                                       |\n| A/one.tf/one.tf /five.tf./one.tf/two.tf/five.tf% MTN due /two.tf/zero.tf/three.tf/six.tf     | -                         | -                                                     | /six.tf                   | /three.tf                                              |\n|                                                                                              | /one.tf/two.tf            | /three.tf                                             | /one.tf/nine.tf/six.tf    | /five.tf/nine.tf                                       |",

Holding cash in restricted accounts does not prevent the Group from optimising returns by putting these monies on short-term deposit.\n\n|                          | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf /sterling.tfm   | Group /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf /sterling.tfm   | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf  /sterling.tfm   | Company /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf /sterling.tfm   |\n|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| Cash at bank and in hand | /three.tf                                     | /four.tf                                             | /three.tf                                      | /four.tf                                               |\n| Short-term deposits      | /seven.tf                                     | /five.tf                                             | -                                              | -                                                      |\n|                          | /one.tf/zero.tf                               | /nine.tf                                             | /three.tf                                      | /four.tf                                               |\n\nThe credit quality of monies held in restricted accounts and deposits can be assessed by reference to external credit ratings of the counterparty where the account or deposit is placed.\n\n|                                             | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf /sterling.tfm   | Group /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf /sterling.tfm   | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf  /sterling.tfm   | Company /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf /sterling.tfm   |\n|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| Counterparties with external credit ratings |                                               |                                                      |                                                |                                                        |\n| A/plus.tf                                   | /seven.tf                                     | /five.tf                                             | -                                              | -                                                      |\n| A                                           | /two.tf                                       | /three.tf                                            | /two.tf                                        | /three.tf                                              |\n| BBB/plus.tf                                 | /one.tf                                       | /one.tf                                              | /one.tf                                        | /one.tf                                                |\n|                                             | /one.tf/zero.tf                               | /nine.tf                                             | /three.tf                                      | /four.tf                                               |",

These facilities have been repaid during the year ended 31 March 2021.\n\nThe credit quality of cash and cash equivalents can be assessed by reference to external credit ratings of the counterparty where the account or deposit is placed.\n\n|                                             | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf  /sterling.tfm   | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf /sterling.tfm   |\n|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| Counterparties with external credit ratings |                                                |                                                |\n| A/plus.tf                                   | -                                              | /one.tf,/three.tf/four.tf/five.tf              |\n|                                             | -                                              | /one.tf,/three.tf/four.tf/five.tf              |\n\nThe Group's cash and cash equivalents and bank overdrafts are subject to cash pooling arrangements.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICY\n\nThe Group uses interest-rate and foreign exchange swaps and forwards to manage its market risk. In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes.\n\nAll derivatives are recognised on the balance sheet at fair value. The fair value of interest-rate and foreign exchange swaps is based on counterparty or market quotes. Those quotes are tested for reasonableness by discounting estimated future cash /flows based on the terms and maturity of each contract and using market rates for similar instruments at the measurement date. The gain or loss on derivatives are recognised immediately in the income statement, within net /finance expense.\n\n| Carrying value of derivative /financial instruments   | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf  /sterling.tfm   | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf /sterling.tfm   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| Current assets                                        | /one.tf                                        | /three.tf/nine.tf                              |\n| Non-current assets                                    | /three.tf                                      | -                                              |\n| Current liabilities                                   | (/seven.tf)                                    | (/two.tf)                                      |\n| Non-current liabilities                               | -                                              | (/one.tf)                                      |\n|                                                       | (/three.tf)                                    | /three.tf/six.tf                               |\n\n| Notional amount             | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf /sterling.tfm   | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf /sterling.tfm   |\n|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| Interest-rate swaps /one.tf | /six.tf/seven.tf/five.tf                      | /six.tf/seven.tf/five.tf                       |\n| Foreign exchange swaps      | /eight.tf/four.tf/three.tf                    | /nine.tf/nine.tf/six.tf                        |\n|                             | /one.tf,/five.tf/one.tf/eight.tf              | /one.tf,/six.tf/seven.tf/one.tf                |\n\n## 25. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nA review of the Group's objectives, policies and processes for managing and monitoring risk is set out in 'Managing risk' and 'Our principal risks and uncertainties' (pages 68 to 77). This note provides further detail on /financial risk management and includes quantitative information on speci/fic /financial risks.\n\nThe Group is exposed to a variety of /financial risks: market risks (principally interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group's overall risk management strategy seeks to minimise the potential adverse e/ffects of these on the Group's /financial performance and includes the use of derivative /financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.\n\nFinancial risk management is carried out by the Group's treasury function under policies approved by the Board of Directors.\n\nThe Group assesses whether it intends to hold its /financial assets to collect the contractual cash /flows, or whether it intends to sell them before maturity and classi/fies its /financial instruments into the appropriate categories. The following table summarises the Group's /financial assets and liabilities into the categories required by IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures:\n\n|                                                                                       | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf /sterling.tfm   | Group /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf /sterling.tfm   | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf /sterling.tfm   | Company /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf /sterling.tfm   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| Financial assets at amortised cost                                                    | /six.tf/four.tf/seven.tf                      | /seven.tf/four.tf/one.tf                             | /three.tf                                     | /four.tf                                               |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                                                             | -                                             | /one.tf,/three.tf/four.tf/five.tf                    | -                                             | -                                                      |\n| Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (without recycling) | /five.tf                                      | /nine.tf                                             | -                                             | -                                                      |\n| Financial liabilities at amortised cost                                               | (/three.tf,/six.tf/seven.tf/six.tf)           | (/five.tf,/four.tf/six.tf/one.tf)                    | (/two.tf,/six.tf/three.tf/zero.tf)            | (/two.tf,/four.tf/zero.tf/six.tf)                      |\n| Financial instruments at fair value through pro/fit or loss                           | (/three.tf)                                   | /three.tf/six.tf                                     | -                                             | -                                                      |\n|                                                                                       | (/three.tf,/zero.tf/two.tf/seven.tf)          | (/three.tf,/three.tf/three.tf/zero.tf)               | (/two.tf,/six.tf/two.tf/seven.tf)             | (/two.tf,/four.tf/zero.tf/two.tf)                      |",

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED\n\n## FINANCIAL RISK FACTORS\n\n## /parenleft.caseI/parenright.case CREDIT RISK\n\nThe Group's principal /financial assets are cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, net investment in /finance leases and amounts due from joint ventures. Further details concerning the credit risk of counterparties is provided in the note that speci/fically relates to each type of asset.\n\n## BANK AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS\n\nThe principal credit risks of the Group arise from /financial derivative instruments and deposits with banks and /financial institutions. In line with the policy approved by the Board of Directors, where the Group manages the deposit, only independently rated banks and /financial institutions with a minimum rating of A- are accepted. For UK banks and /financial institutions with which the Group has a committed lending relationship, the minimum rating is lowered to BBB+. The Group's treasury function currently performs regular reviews of the credit ratings of all /financial institution counterparties. Furthermore, the treasury function ensures that funds deposited with a single /financial institution remain within the Group's policy limits.\n\n## TRADE RECEIVABLES\n\nTrade receivables are presented in the balance sheet net of allowances for doubtful receivables. The Group assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit losses associated with its trade receivables. A provision for impairment is made for the lifetime expected credit losses on initial recognition of the receivable. In determining the expected credit losses the Group takes into account any recent payment behaviours and future expectations of likely default events (i.e. not making payment on the due date) based on individual customer credit/uni00A0ratings, actual or expected insolvency /filings or company voluntary arrangements, likely deferrals of payments due, agreed rent concessions and market expectations and trends in the wider macro-economic environment in which our customers operate. These assessments are made on a customer by customer basis.\n\nWhile the balance remains high at 31 March 2021 as a result of the ongoing impact of Covid-19, it remains low relative to the scale of the balance sheet. The long-term nature and diversity of the Group's tenancy arrangements mean the credit risk of trade receivables is usually considered to be low. This risk increased at 31 March 2020 following reduced rent collections as a result of Covid-19, and remains elevated at/uni00A031 March 2021 as a result of a continuation in these trends throughout the year.\n\nTo limit the Group's exposure to credit risk on trade receivables, a credit report is usually obtained from an independent rating agency prior/uni00A0to the inception of a lease with a new counterparty. This report, alongside the Group's internal assessment of credit risk, is used to determine the size of the deposit that is required, if any, from the tenant at inception. In general, these deposits represent between three and six months' rent.\n\n## NET INVESTMENT IN FINANCE LEASES\n\nThis balance relates to amounts receivable from tenants in respect of tenant /finance leases. This is not considered a signi/ficant credit risk as the tenants are generally of good /financial standing.\n\n## /parenleft.caseII/parenright.case LIQUIDITY RISK\n\nThe Group actively maintains a mixture of notes with /final maturities between 2025 and 2059, commercial paper and medium-term committed bank facilities that are designed to ensure that the Group has su/fficient available funds for its operations and its committed capital expenditure programme.\n\nManagement monitors the Group's available funds as follows:\n\n|                                       | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf  /sterling.tfm   | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf /sterling.tfm   |\n|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| Cash and cash equivalents             | -                                              | /one.tf,/three.tf/four.tf/five.tf              |\n| Commercial paper                      | (/nine.tf/zero.tf/six.tf)                      | (/nine.tf/seven.tf/seven.tf)                   |\n| Undrawn facilities                    | /two.tf,/five.tf/zero.tf/six.tf                | /seven.tf/seven.tf/one.tf                      |\n| Cash and available undrawn facilities | /one.tf,/six.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf                | /one.tf,/one.tf/three.tf/nine.tf               |\n| As a proportion of drawn debt /one.tf | /four.tf/six.tf./one.tf%                       | /two.tf/one.tf./five.tf%                       |\n\n- /one.tf.

        "page_content": "## SECURITY GROUP\n\nThe Group's principal /financing arrangements utilise the credit support of a ring-fenced group of assets (the Security Group) that comprises the majority of the Group's investment property portfolio and certain investments in joint ventures. These arrangements operate in 'tiers' determined by LTV and interest cover ratio (ICR). This structure is most /flexible at lower tiers (with a lower LTV and a higher ICR) and allows property acquisitions, disposals and developments to occur with relative freedom. In higher tiers, the requirements become more prescriptive. No /financial covenant default is triggered until the applicable LTV exceeds 100% or the ICR is less than 1.0x.\n\nAs at 31 March 2021, the reported LTV for the Security Group was 32.7% (2020: 32.5%), meaning that the Group was operating in Tier 1 and/uni00A0bene/fited from maximum operational /flexibility.\n\nManagement monitors the key covenants attached to the Security Group on a monthly basis, including LTV, ICR, sector and regional concentration and disposals.\n\n## NON/hyphen.caseRESTRICTED GROUP\n\nThe Non-restricted Group obtains funding when required from a combination of inter-company loans from the Security Group, equity and/uni00A0external bank debt. Bespoke credit facilities are established with banks when required for the Non-restricted Group and joint ventures, usually on a limited-recourse basis.\n\nThe table below analyses the Group's /financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the expected maturity date.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED\n\n## /parenleft.caseIII/parenright.case MARKET RISK\n\nThe Group is exposed to market risk through interest rates, availability of credit and foreign exchange movements.\n\n## INTEREST RATES\n\nThe Group uses derivative products to manage its interest rate exposure and has a hedging policy that generally requires at least 70% of its existing debt plus increases in debt associated with net committed capital expenditure to be at /fixed interest rates for the coming three years, with at least 50% /fixed for a further two years. Due to a combination of factors, including the degree of certainty required under IFRS 9 Financial instruments, the Group does not apply hedge accounting to hedging instruments used in this context. Speci/fic interest-rate hedges are also used from time to time to /fix the interest rate exposure on our debt. Where speci/fic hedges are used to /fix the interest exposure on /floating rate debt, these may qualify for hedge accounting.\n\nAt 31 March 2021, the Group (including joint ventures) had pay-/fixed interest-rate swaps in place with a nominal value of \u00a3400m (2020: \u00a3400m) and forward starting pay-/fixed interest-rate swaps of \u00a3275m (2020: \u00a3275m). The Group's net debt was 80.8% /fixed (2020: 71.3%) and based on the Group's debt balances at 31 March 2021, a 1% increase/(decrease) in interest rates would increase/(decrease) the annual net /finance expense in the income statement and reduce/(increase) equity by \u00a37m (2020: \u00a312m). The sensitivity has been calculated by applying the interest rate change to the variable rate borrowings, net of interest-rate swaps and cash and cash equivalents.\n\n## FOREIGN EXCHANGE\n\nForeign exchange risk arises when future commercial transactions or recognised assets or liabilities are denominated in a currency that is/uni00A0not the Group's functional currency.\n\nAs it is solely UK based, the Group's foreign exchange risk is low. The vast majority of the Group's foreign currency transactions relate to/uni00A0foreign currency borrowing under the Group's commercial paper programme. It is the Group's policy to hedge 100% of this exposure. At/uni00A031 March 2021, the Group had issued \u20ac752m (2020: \u20ac901m) and $250m (2020: $220m) of commercial paper, fully hedged through foreign exchange swaps. A 10% weakening or strengthening of Sterling would therefore have \u00a3nil (2020: \u00a3nil) impact in the income statement and equity arising from foreign currency borrowings.\n\nWhere additional foreign exchange risk is identi/fied (not linked to commercial paper borrowing), it is the Group's policy to assess the likelihood of the risk crystallising and if deemed appropriate use derivatives to hedge some or all of the risk. At 31 March 2021, the Group had \u20ac17m (2020: \u20ac29m) and CHFnil (2020: CHF12m) of foreign currency exposures being managed using foreign currency derivative contracts. These were entered into in order to economically hedge our exposure to movements in foreign currencies. A 10% weakening of/uni00A0Sterling would reduce the loss before tax and increase total equity by \u00a32m (2020: \u00a37m). A 10% strengthening in Sterling would increase/uni00A0the loss before tax and reduce equity by \u00a31m (2020: \u00a35m).\n\n## FINANCIAL MATURITY ANALYSIS\n\nThe interest rate pro/file of the Group's borrowings is set out below (based on notional values):\n\n|           |                                  |                                |                                    | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf   | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf    | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf       |\n|-----------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n|           | Fixed   rate /sterling.tfm       | Floating  rate /sterling.tfm   | Total /sterling.tfm                | Fixed   rate /sterling.tfm       | Floating   rate /sterling.tfm     | Total /sterling.tfm                  |\n| Sterling  | /two.tf,/four.tf/one.tf/seven.tf | /two.tf/nine.tf/three.tf       | /two.tf,/seven.tf/one.tf/zero.tf   | /two.tf,/four.tf/two.tf/nine.tf  | /one.tf,/nine.tf/four.tf/eight.tf | /four.tf,/three.tf/seven.tf/seven.tf |\n| Euro      | -                                | /six.tf/four.tf/zero.tf        | /six.tf/four.tf/zero.tf            | -                                | /seven.tf/nine.tf/six.tf          | /seven.tf/nine.tf/six.tf             |\n| US Dollar | -                                | /one.tf/eight.tf/two.tf        | /one.tf/eight.tf/two.tf            | -                                | /one.tf/seven.tf/seven.tf         | /one.tf/seven.tf/seven.tf            |\n|           | /two.tf,/four.tf/one.tf/seven.tf | /one.tf,/one.tf/one.tf/five.tf | /three.tf,/five.tf/three.tf/two.tf | /two.tf,/four.tf/two.tf/nine.tf  | /two.tf,/nine.tf/two.tf/one.tf    | /five.tf,/three.tf/five.tf/zero.tf   |\n\nThe expected maturity pro/files of the Group's borrowings are as follows (based on notional values):\n\n|                                                   | Fixed   rate /sterling.tfm        | Floating  rate /sterling.tfm   | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf Total /sterling.tfm   | Fixed   rate /sterling.tfm        | Floating   rate /sterling.tfm    | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf Total /sterling.tfm   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| One year or less, or on demand                    | -                                 | /nine.tf/zero.tf/six.tf        | /nine.tf/zero.tf/six.tf                             | -                                 | /nine.tf/seven.tf/seven.tf       | /nine.tf/seven.tf/seven.tf                           |\n| More than two years but not more than /five years | /five.tf/one.tf/four.tf           | /two.tf/zero.tf/nine.tf        | /seven.tf/two.tf/three.tf                           | /five.tf/two.tf/two.tf            | /one.tf,/nine.tf/four.tf/four.tf | /two.tf,/four.tf/six.tf/six.tf                       |\n| More than /five years                             | /one.tf,/nine.tf/zero.tf/three.tf | -                              | /one.tf,/nine.tf/zero.tf/three.tf                   | /one.tf,/nine.tf/zero.tf/seven.tf | -                                | /one.tf,/nine.tf/zero.tf/seven.tf                    |\n| Borrowings                                        | /two.tf,/four.tf/one.tf/seven.tf  | /one.tf,/one.tf/one.tf/five.tf | /three.tf,/five.tf/three.tf/two.tf                  | /two.tf,/four.tf/two.tf/nine.tf   | /two.tf,/nine.tf/two.tf/one.tf   | /five.tf,/three.tf/five.tf/zero.tf                   |\n| E/ffect of hedging                                | /four.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf          | (/four.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf)     | -                                                   | /four.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf          | (/four.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf)       | -                                                    |\n| Borrowings net of interest-rate swaps             | /two.tf,/eight.tf/one.tf/seven.tf | /seven.tf/one.tf/five.tf       | /three.tf,/five.tf/three.tf/two.tf                  | /two.tf,/eight.tf/two.tf/nine.tf  | /two.tf,/five.tf/two.tf/one.tf   | /five.tf,/three.tf/five.tf/zero.tf                   |",

The fair value of the Group's net investment in tenant /finance leases, calculated by the Group's external valuer by applying a weighted average equivalent yield of 4.6% (2020: discount rate of 1.8%), is \u00a3249m (2020: \u00a3247m).\n\nThe fair values of any /floating rate /financial liabilities are assumed to be equal to their nominal value.

The fair values of the Group's outstanding interest-rate swaps have been estimated by calculating the present value of future cash /flows, using appropriate market discount rates.

TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICY\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTrade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value, subsequently at amortised cost and, where relevant, adjusted for the time value of money. The Group assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit losses associated with its trade receivables. A provision for impairment is made for the lifetime expected credit losses on initial recognition of the receivable. If collection is expected in more than one year, the balance is presented within non-current assets.\n\nIn determining the expected credit losses the Group takes into account any recent payment behaviours and future expectations of likely default events (i.e. not making payment on the due date) based on individual customer credit ratings, actual or expected insolvency /filings/uni00A0or company voluntary arrangements and market expectations and trends in the wider macro-economic environment in which our/uni00A0customers operate. Where a concession is agreed with a customer after the due date for the rent, this amount is recognised as an/uni00A0impairment of the related trade receivable.\n\nTrade and other receivables are written o/ff once all avenues to recover the balances are exhausted and the lease has ended. Receivables written o/ff are no longer subject to any enforcement activity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\n\n## IMPAIRMENT OF TRADE RECEIVABLES\n\nThe Group's assessment of expected credit losses is inherently subjective due to the forward-looking nature of the assessments. As a result, the value of the provisions for impairment of the Group's trade receivables are subject to a degree of uncertainty and are made on the basis of assumptions which may not prove to be accurate. See note 25 for further details of the Group's assessment of the credit risk associated with trade receivables.\n\n|                                                | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf /sterling.tfm   | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf /sterling.tfm   |\n|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| Net trade receivables                          | /seven.tf/four.tf                             | /seven.tf/seven.tf                             |\n| Tenant lease incentives (note /one.tf/four.tf) | /two.tf/three.tf/zero.tf                      | /three.tf/one.tf/six.tf                        |\n| Prepayments                                    | /two.tf/four.tf                               | /two.tf/four.tf                                |\n| Accrued income                                 | /three.tf                                     | /one.tf                                        |\n| Amounts due from joint ventures                | /seven.tf                                     | /two.tf                                        |\n| Other receivables                              | /one.tf/six.tf                                | /one.tf/three.tf                               |\n| Total current trade and other receivables      | /three.tf/five.tf/four.tf                     | /four.tf/three.tf/three.tf                     |\n| Non-current amounts due from joint ventures    | /one.tf/six.tf/two.tf                         | /one.tf/six.tf/one.tf                          |\n| Non-current property sales receivables         | /eight.tf                                     | /one.tf/seven.tf                               |\n| Total trade and other receivables              | /five.tf/two.tf/four.tf                       | /six.tf/one.tf/one.tf                          |\n\nThe accounting for lease incentives is set out in note 6.

NET PENSION SURPLUS\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICY\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nContributions to de/fined contribution schemes are charged to the income statement as incurred.\n\nThe pension obligations arising under the Group's de/fined bene/fit pension scheme are measured at discounted present value. The scheme assets are measured at fair value, except annuities which are valued to match the liability or bene/fit value. The operating and /financing costs of the scheme are recognised separately in the income statement. Service costs are spread using the projected unit credit method. Past service costs are recognised immediately in the income statement in the period in which they are identi/fied. Net /financing costs are recognised in the period in which they arise, calculated with reference to the discount rate, and are included in /finance income or expense on a net basis. Re-measurement gains and losses arising from either experience di/ffering from previous actuarial assumptions, or changes to those assumptions, are recognised immediately in other comprehensive income.\n\n## DEFINED CONTRIBUTION SCHEMES\n\nThe charge to operating pro/fit for the year in respect of de/fined contribution schemes was \u00a33m (2020: \u00a32m).\n\n## DEFINED BENEFIT SCHEME\n\nThe Pension & Assurance Scheme of the Land Securities Group of Companies (the Scheme) is a registered de/fined bene/fit /final salary scheme subject to the UK regulatory framework for pensions, including the Scheme Speci/fic Funding requirements. The Scheme is operated under trust and as such, the Trustees of the Scheme are responsible for operating the Scheme and they have a statutory responsibility to/uni00A0act in accordance with the Scheme's Trust Deed and Rules, in the best interest of the bene/ficiaries of the Scheme and UK legislation (including trust law). The Trustees and the Group have the joint power to set the contributions that are paid to the Scheme.\n\nIn setting contributions to the Scheme, the Trustees and the Group are guided by the advice of a quali/fied independent actuary on the basis of triennial valuations using the projected unit credit method. The Scheme is closed to new members (and was closed to future accrual on 31 October 2019). A full actuarial valuation of the Scheme was undertaken on 30 June 2018 by the independent actuaries, Hymans Robertson LLP. This valuation was updated to 31 March 2021 using, where required, assumptions prescribed by IAS 19 Employee Bene/fits. The next full actuarial valuation will be performed as at 30 June 2021.\n\nThere have been no employer or employee contributions following the closure of the Scheme to future accrual on 31 October 2019. Prior to this, the employer contribution rate was 43.1% of pensionable salary to cover the costs of accruing bene/fits and the employee contributions were at 8% of monthly pensionable salary. It was also agreed that no further de/ficit contributions were required from the Group. Employee contributions were paid by salary sacri/fice, and therefore appeared as Group contributions. The Group does not expect to make any employee or employer contributions to the Scheme in the year to 31 March 2022 (2021: \u00a3nil).",

For awards with non-market related criteria, the charge is reversed if it appears probable that the performance or service criteria will not be met.\n\nThe following table analyses the total cost recognised in the income statement for the year between each plan, together with the number of options outstanding.\n\n|                             | Charge  /sterling.tfm   | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf Number  (millions)   | Charge  /sterling.tfm   | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf Number  (millions)   |\n|-----------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| Long-Term Incentive Plan    | /two.tf                 | /two.tf                                            | /one.tf                 | /two.tf                                             |\n| Deferred Share Bonus Plan   | -                       | -                                                  | /one.tf                 | -                                                   |\n| Executive Share Option Plan | -                       | /one.tf                                            | -                       | /two.tf                                             |\n| Sharesave Plan              | /one.tf                 | /one.tf                                            | -                       | -                                                   |\n| Restricted Share Plan       | /one.tf                 | /one.tf                                            | -                       | -                                                   |\n|                             | /four.tf                | /five.tf                                           | /two.tf                 | /four.tf                                            |\n\nA summary of the main features of each type of plan is given below. The plans have been split into two categories: Executive plans and Other plans. For further details on the Executive plans, see the Directors' Remuneration Report on pages 115 to 141.\n\n## EXECUTIVE PLANS:\n\n## LONG/hyphen.caseTERM INCENTIVE PLAN /parenleft.caseLTIP/parenright.case\n\nThe LTIP is open to Executive Directors and Executive Leadership Team members with awards made at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. The LTIP was previously also open to Senior Management. In addition, other than for Executive Directors, an award of 'matching shares' could be made where the individual acquired shares in Land Securities Group PLC and pledged to hold them for a period of three years. The awards are issued at nil consideration, subject to performance and vesting conditions being met. Awards of LTIP shares and matching shares are subject to the same performance criteria and normally vest after three years. Awards are satis/fied by the transfer of existing shares held by the Employee Bene/fit Trust (EBT). The weighted average share price at the date of vesting during the year was 616p (2020: 988p). The estimated fair value of awards granted during the year under the scheme was \u00a33m (2020: \u00a32m).\n\n## DEFERRED SHARE BONUS PLAN /parenleft.caseDSBP/parenright.case\n\nThe Executive Directors' annual bonus is structured in two distinct parts made up of an initial payment and deferred shares. The shares are usually deferred for between one and three years. In July 2020 the DSBP was awarded following the deferral of 100% of the Executive Directors' bonus entitlement for the year ended 31 March 2020. The shares are deferred for one year and are not subject to additional performance criteria. Awards are satis/fied by the transfer of existing shares held by the EBT at nil consideration. The weighted average share price at the date of vesting during the year was 567p (2020: 745p). The estimated fair value of awards granted during the year under/uni00A0the scheme was \u00a31m (2020: \u00a3nil).\n\n## OTHER PLANS:\n\n## EXECUTIVE SHARE OPTION PLAN /parenleft.caseESOP/parenright.case\n\nThe 2005 ESOP was previously open to managers not eligible to participate in the LTIP, but was largely replaced by the new Restricted Share Plan in the year ended 31 March 2020. Awards are discretionary and are granted over ordinary shares of the Company at the middle market price on the three dealing days immediately preceding the date of grant. Awards normally vest after three years and are not subject to performance conditions. Awards are satis/fied by the transfer of shares from the EBT and lapse ten years after the date of grant. There were no awards exercised during the year (2020: weighted average share price of exercises 927p). The estimated fair value of awards granted during the year under the scheme was \u00a3nil (2020: \u00a3nil).\n\n## SHARESAVE PLAN\n\nUnder the Sharesave Plan, Executive Directors and other eligible employees are invited to make regular monthly contributions into a sharesave plan operated by Equiniti. On completion of the three- or /five-year contract period, ordinary shares in the Company may be purchased at a price based upon the middle market price on the three dealing days immediately preceding the date of invitation less 20% discount. There were no awards exercised during the year (2020: weighted average share price of exercises 944p). The estimated fair value of awards granted during the year under the scheme was \u00a31m (2020: \u00a3nil).",

It is open to qualifying management level employees with awards granted as nil cost options. Awards are discretionary and are granted over ordinary shares of the Company at the middle market price on the day immediately preceding date of grant. Awards normally vest after three years and are not subject to performance conditions. Awards are satis/fied by the transfer of shares from the EBT and lapse ten years after the date of grant. There were no awards exercised during the year (2020: none).

The expected life used in the model has been determined based upon management's best estimate for the e/ffects of non-transferability, vesting/exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations. The risk-free rate is the yield at the date of the grant of an award on a gilt-edged stock with a redemption date equal to the anticipated vesting of that award.\n\n## FAIR VALUE INPUTS FOR AWARDS WITH MARKET PERFORMANCE CONDITIONS\n\nFair values are calculated using the Monte Carlo simulation option pricing model for awards with market performance conditions.

We do not calculate a cost ratio excluding direct vacancy costs as we do not consider this to be helpful. Provisions for bad and doubtful debts have been excluded from our cost ratio.\n\n## EPRA vacancy rate\n\nTable 70\n\nThe EPRA vacancy rate is based on the ratio of the estimated market rent for vacant properties versus total estimated market rent, for the Combined Portfolio excluding properties under development.

We want customers to prefer our spaces. We want communities to be pleased it's us operating in/uni00A0their area. We want partners to share our priorities. And we want employees to invest their energy and ambition here. When we get all/uni00A0this right, we create value for our investors.\n\nTo deliver this we've set twelve long-term sustainability commitments, covering each of our priority areas of creating jobs and opportunities, e/fficient use of natural resources and sustainable design and innovation. This section includes a summary of our performance against those commitments and our key disclosures.\n\nFor more information please visit www.landsec.com/sustainability.\n\n## CREATING JOBS AND OPPORTUNITIES\n\n## SOCIAL VALUE\n\nCommitment: Create \u00a325m of social value through our community programmes by 2025.\n\n## Performance: On track\n\nThis year we've created over \u00a36.5m of social value through our social sustainability programmes, achieving in-year outperformance. Over \u00a311m of social value created since commitment launched in 2019/20.\n\n## FAIRNESS\n\nCommitment: By 2020, ensure everyone working on our behalf, in/uni00A0an environment we control, is given equal opportunities, protected from discrimination and paid at least the Real Living Wage.\n\n## Performance: Not met\n\nWe continue to pay the Real Living Wage to all of our direct employees and partners across o/ffice portfolio. We have not been able to meet our 2020 Living Wage commitment fully across our retail portfolio. Recognising the impact that the pandemic had on/uni00A0businesses, particularly the retail sector, The Living Wage Foundation is allowing businesses to pause their accreditation during the pandemic. We will review our accreditation by November this year when there will be more certainty on the reopening of the UK economy.\n\nWe collaborated with modern slavery specialist Stronger Together to perform a gap analysis, develop an action plan, and launched a/uni00A0Modern Slavery Working Group to improve our approach in identifying and managing modern slavery risk.\n\n## DIVERSITY\n\nCommitment: Make measurable improvements to the pro/file in/uni00A0terms of gender, ethnicity and disability - of our employee mix.\n\n## Performance: On track\n\nAcross the whole organisation 52% of our employees are female, exceeding our 2025 target of 50%. We continue to maintain good female representation at all levels of our organisation, increasing our female representation to 31% at leader level and 38% at senior leader level. Our ethnic minority representation is 8% at leader and/uni00A06% at senior leader level.\n\n## HEALTH AND SAFETY\n\nCommitment: Maintain an exceptional standard of health, safety/uni00A0and security in all the working environments we control.\n\n## Performance: On track\n\nTo establish and maintain Covid-secure destinations and workplaces we launched a taskforce to assess the impact of the virus on our operations, to interpret government guidance, and co-ordinate the rollout of new ways of working. We continue to enhance /fire safety across the business and ensure we meet new/uni00A0government initiatives and legislation.\n\n## EFFICIENT USE OF NATURAL RESOURCES\n\n## CARBON\n\nCommitment: Reduce carbon emissions (tCO 2 e) by 70% by 2030/uni00A0compared with a 2013/14 baseline, for property under our management for at least two years.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Performance: On track\n\nReduced carbon emissions by 55% since 2013/14 against our science-based carbon reduction target. Signi/ficant reduction in carbon emissions as a result of lower occupancy and operational hours due to Covid-19 restrictions.\n\n## RENEWABLE ENERGY\n\nCommitment: Ensure 100% of our electricity supplies through our/uni00A0corporate contract are from REGO-backed renewable sources\n\n## Performance: Complete\n\nWe continue to procure 100% renewable electricity across our portfolio. We are currently exploring opportunities to move our procurement towards direct purchasing from renewable projects through Power Purchase Agreements (PPA).\n\nCommitment: Achieve 3MW of renewable electricity capacity by 2030.\n\n## Performance: On track\n\nOur current on-site renewable electricity capacity is 1.4 MW. We have continued to progress our feasibility studies for on-site renewable technologies, assessing the value this would deliver to Landsec and our customers and how these could be incorporated as part of future redevelopment works.\n\n## ENERGY\n\nCommitment: Reduce energy intensity (kWh/m 2 ) by 40% by 2030 compared with a 2013/14 baseline, for property under our management for at least two years.",

Although this /figure suggests that we've already achieved our target to reduce energy intensity by 40% by 2030, we recognise that energy consumption has been signi/ficantly impacted by lower occupancy and operational hours due to Covid-19 restrictions and doesn't re/flect portfolio energy performance in normal conditions.

The decrease in/uni00A0recycling rate from last year (2020:73%) re/flects the reduction of/uni00A0recyclable materials such as packaging in retail as a result of/uni00A0Covid-19.

We are recycling 65% of operational waste and 99% of construction waste.\n\n## SUSTAINABLE DESIGN AND INNOVATION\n\n## RESILIENCE\n\nCommitment: Assess and mitigate physical and /financial climate change adaptation risks that are material across our portfolio.\n\n## Performance: On track\n\nTo continue aligning our disclosures with the TCFD recommendations, this year we've again worked with Willis Towers Watson in assessing and quantifying climate-related risks to inform our approach to managing climate risks across our portfolio, including new developments.\n\nIn our development pipeline we continue undertaking climate change adaptation risk reviews, addressing structural and fabric resilience as well as building services.\n\n## MATERIALS\n\nCommitment: Source core construction products and materials from ethical and sustainable sources.\n\n## Performance: On track\n\nOur developments continue to make good progress against this target.\n\nAll our live developments are targeting 100% of core construction materials to be manufactured within UK and Europe, to reduce emissions from transportation and reduce risk of ethical issues in/uni00A0manufacture and extraction.\n\nThis year we published our Materials Brief to guide our supply partners and mitigate human rights risks and 100% of key construction materials responsibly sourced.\n\n## BIODIVERSITY\n\nCommitment: Maximise the biodiversity potential of all our development and operational sites and achieve a 25% biodiversity net gain across our /five operational sites currently o/ffering the greatest potential, by 2030.\n\n## Performance: On track\n\nWe continued our partnership with The Wildlife Trusts to enhance biodiversity net gain at our /five operational sites and we're on track to deliver signi/ficant net gain on our developments and created a/uni00A0new Biodiversity Brief for developments.\n\n## WELLBEING\n\nCommitment: Ensure our buildings are designed and managed to/uni00A0maximise wellbeing and productivity.\n\n## Performance: On track\n\nThis year we committed to pursuing the WELL Portfolio Programme across our existing managed o/ffice portfolio, in addition to our new schemes.

Energy consumption is reported as kWh and no normalisation technique is applied. Carbon emissions are reported as tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO 2 e). We report our full greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions annually in accordance to the WRI GHG Protocol.\n\nGHG emissions are broken down into three scopes: scope 1, 2 and 3.\n\nScope 1 emissions are direct emissions from activities controlled by/uni00A0us that release emissions into the atmosphere, while scope 2 emissions are indirect emissions associated with our consumption of purchased energy.\n\nAt Landsec, scope 1 comprises emissions from natural gas and refrigerant gases. Scope 2 emissions are from electricity, heating and cooling purchased for common areas and shared services. All/uni00A0material sources of scope 1 and 2 emissions are reported. As the remaining sources (e.g. diesel used in generator testing) represent such a small proportion of total emissions, we do not report them.\n\nScope 2 emissions are reported using both the 'location-based' and 'market-based' accounting methods. Location-based emissions are reported using the UK Government's 'Greenhouse gas reporting: conversion factors 2020'. Scope 2 market-based emissions are reported using the conversion factor associated with each individual electricity, heating and cooling supply, either obtained directly from the supplier or from their o/fficial company website.\n\nBetween April 2017 and March 2019, at least 15% of our gas purchases were from green sources (i.e. biogas). Scope 1 emissions for this period were also reported using both the 'location-based' and 'market-based' accounting methods. Our market-based emissions from biogas were reported as following: the CH 4 or N 2 O/uni00A0emissions from biogas were reported as scope 1, and the CO 2 /uni00A0portion of the biogas was reported outside of the scopes, as/uni00A0a/uni00A0memo line. Therefore, our scope 1 market-based emissions were based on the emissions from the remaining 85% of our gas purchases, as well as the CH 4 or N 2 O conversion factors associated with biogas. We haven't purchased biogas since April 2019, therefore Scope 1 emissions for 2019/20 and 2020/21 are reported using only 'location-based' method.\n\nScope 3 emissions are those that are a consequence of our business activities, but which occur at sources we do not own or control and which are not classi/fied as scope 2 emissions. The GHG Protocol identi/fies 15 categories of which 8 are directly relevant for Landsec.\n\n| Landsec - Scope 1 and 2 emissions                | Table 102                                            | Table 102                                      | Table 102                                     |\n|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| Location-based emissions                         |                                                      |                                                |                                               |\n| Emissions                                        | /two.tf /zero.tf /one.tf /eight.tf / /one.tf/nine.tf | /two.tf/zero.tf/one.tf/nine.tf//two.tf/zero.tf | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf//two.tf/one.tf |\n| Scope /one.tf tCO/two.tfe                        | /one.tf/one.tf,/four.tf/nine.tf/zero.tf              | /nine.tf,/one.tf/five.tf/eight.tf              | /seven.tf,/five.tf/five.tf/four.tf            |\n| Scope /two.tf tCO/two.tfe                        | /three.tf/zero.tf,/five.tf/one.tf/eight.tf           | /two.tf/five.tf,/three.tf/eight.tf/two.tf      | /one.tf/eight.tf,/four.tf/three.tf/four.tf    |\n| Scope /one.tf and /two.tf tCO/two.tfe            | /four.tf/two.tf,/zero.tf/zero.tf/eight.tf            | /three.tf/four.tf,/five.tf/four.tf/zero.tf     | /two.tf/five.tf,/nine.tf/eight.tf/eight.tf    |\n| Intensity                                        |                                                      |                                                |                                               |\n| Scope /one.tf and /two.tf kgCO/two.tfe/m /two.tf | /two.tf/two.tf./five.tf/four.tf                      | /one.tf/eight.tf./five.tf/six.tf               | /one.tf/one.tf/four.tf./two.tf/three.tf       |\n\n| Landsec - Scope 1 and 2 emissions                | Table 102                                            | Table 102                                      | Table 102                                     |\n|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| Market-based emissions                           |                                                      |                                                |                                               |\n| Emissions                                        | /two.tf /zero.tf /one.tf /eight.tf / /one.tf/nine.tf | /two.tf/zero.tf/one.tf/nine.tf//two.tf/zero.tf | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf//two.tf/one.tf |\n| Scope /one.tf tCO/two.tfe                        | /nine.tf,/eight.tf/seven.tf/nine.tf                  | /nine.tf,/one.tf/five.tf/eight.tf              | /seven.tf,/five.tf/five.tf/four.tf            |\n| Scope /two.tf tCO/two.tfe                        | /three.tf,/five.tf/one.tf/seven.tf                   | /three.tf,/seven.tf/one.tf/nine.tf             | /two.tf,/zero.tf/seven.tf/nine.tf             |\n| Scope /one.tf and /two.tf tCO/two.tfe            | /one.tf/three.tf,/three.tf/nine.tf/six.tf            | /one.tf/two.tf,/eight.tf/seven.tf/eight.tf     | /nine.tf,/six.tf/three.tf/three.tf            |\n| Intensity                                        |                                                      |                                                |                                               |\n| Scope /one.tf and /two.tf kgCO/two.tfe/m /two.tf | /eight.tf./zero.tf/zero.tf                           | /six.tf./one.tf/one.tf                         | /five.tf./two.tf/seven.tf                     |\n\nScope 1 and 2 GHG emissions using location-based emission factors have dropped by 25% compared with previous year. Although these reductions have been achieved through a combination of factors, including energy e/fficiency projects, changes in our portfolio and/uni00A0changes in the UK's emission factors, the main driver for carbon reduction across the portfolio, this year, was the Covid-19 pandemic. The/uni00A0detailed breakdown of main factors driving the change in our/uni00A0Scope 1 and Scope 2 can be seen in the waterfall chart 103. In terms of market-based emissions we have also seen a reduction of 25%.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe table 104 shows the absolute energy consumption with a breakdown by landlord and tenant consumption. This year absolute energy intensity has reduced by 32% compared with previous year, largely as a result of Covid-19 restrictions.\n\nOur active energy management programme has also contributed to further reduce energy, maximising building e/fficiency in line with lower occupancy levels, while ensuring the health and safety and comfort of our occupants. To do this, we use smart technology to gather data from our building management systems in several of our o/ffices, and having this detailed data helps us decide how we control energy-intensive service equipment in our buildings, and the services that we provide in our buildings are now running in line with occupancy. Consequently, this year we have been able to/uni00A0undertake various actions to improve the building management systems across our o/ffice assets. For example, we have improved the e/fficiency and lifecycle of our cooling systems, as they now react more optimally to external temperatures.\n\nThis year we identi/fied and committed to implement energy e/fficiency projects across our portfolio that will lead to over 6,600 MWh of savings per annum. More information on our/uni00A0energy programme can be found on pages 64-67 (Environmental/uni00A0review).",

from our value chain activities (i.e. Scope 3 emissions). By/uni00A0developing a full GHG emissions inventory, incorporating scope 1, scope 2, and scope 3 emissions, we're able to understand the total/uni00A0emissions associated with our business. The GHG Protocol identi/fies 15 categories for scope 3 emissions of which 8 are directly relevant to our business. The table below provides a breakdown of our entire emissions inventory. Our scope 3 reporting methodology is/uni00A0detailed in the 2021 Sustainability Performance and Data Report.\n\n| Landsec - Carbon footprint   | Landsec - Carbon footprint                 | /two.tf

        "page_content": "## Sustainability performance\n\ncontinued\n\nOur scope 3 reporting allows us to identify the most signi/ficant areas in our value chain to focus on reducing emissions. The chart below shows the largest categories.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe two largest scope 3 categories are Capital goods and Downstream leased assets, making up over 71% of our total emissions. Capital goods include the emissions associated with the manufacture and transport of materials used within our development activities and portfolio projects. Downstream leased assets are those emissions associated with energy consumed by our customers within our assets.\n\nThe increase in emissions for Capital goods is explained by the fact that most of our development projects were still in the design stage in 2019/20, progressing to construction phase during\n\nthe reporting year. In the table below, we provide the amount of embodied carbon emissions reported for each development in 2020/21. Conversely, lower emissions for Downstream leased assets are associated with reduction in energy consumption as a result of/uni00A0Covid-19 restrictions and reduction in the UK's emission factors.\n\nBecause both categories represent a signi/ficant proportion of our total carbon footprint, we are committed to understanding the impacts of our buildings as much as we can to ensure that we build and run them as e/fficiently as possible. We therefore undertake lifecycle assessments on all of our development projects, following the RICS guidance document 'Whole life carbon assessment for the built environment' 1st Edition and BS EN 15978. The assessment considers both the embodied carbon emissions from our supply chain and construction activities (stages A1 to A5) as well as anticipated emissions from a building's operations and embodied carbon associated with maintenance and repairs over the lifetime of the building (stages B1 to C4). To minimise our construction impacts, we set targets on the embodied carbon emissions from supply chain (A1-A5) on a project by project basis, measured against design stage baseline (RIBA stage 3), and track these through to the completion of our buildings. The table below shows that we'll avoid over 38,000 tCO 2 e by targeting an overall reduction of 15.6% in the embodied carbon across four developments. We/uni00A0also carefully design our buildings to minimise the energy demand of our operations and meet the remaining demand through renewable energy contracts.\n\n| Embodied carbon - development pipeline   |                                                   | Forecasted total                                | Forecasted embodied  /two.tf      | Embodied carbon            | Table 107 Embodied carbon  emissions reported in          |\n|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|\n| Development                              | Total embodied carbon  baseline tCO/two.tf        | embodied carbon tCO/two.tf                      | carbon intensity kgCO/two.tf/m    | reduction %                | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf//two.tf/one.tf t CO/two.tf |\n| /two.tf/one.tf Moor/fields, EC/two.tf    | /one.tf/two.tf/zero.tf,/eight.tf/seven.tf/one.tf  | /one.tf/zero.tf/two.tf,/two.tf/two.tf/four.tf   | /one.tf,/three.tf/six.tf/three.tf | -/one.tf/five.tf./four.tf  | /four.tf/zero.tf,/two.tf/nine.tf/five.tf                  |\n| Lucent, W/one.tf                         | /two.tf/seven.tf,/one.tf/zero.tf/one.tf           | /two.tf/two.tf,/zero.tf/four.tf/seven.tf        | /one.tf,/one.tf/four.tf/six.tf    | -/one.tf/eight.tf./six.tf  | /nine.tf/zero.tf/nine.tf                                  |\n| n/two.tf, SW/one.tf                      | /two.tf/four.tf,/seven.tf/eight.tf/eight.tf       | /two.tf/zero.tf,/eight.tf/seven.tf/eight.tf     | /one.tf,/zero.tf/one.tf/three.tf  | -/one.tf/five.tf./eight.tf | /one.tf,/eight.tf/three.tf/six.tf                         |\n| The Forge, SE/one.tf                     | /two.tf/four.tf,/seven.tf/four.tf/one.tf          | /one.tf/eight.tf,/seven.tf/zero.tf/five.tf      | /one.tf,/zero.tf/four.tf/two.tf   | -/two.tf/four.tf./four.tf  | /two.tf,/one.tf/seven.tf/two.tf                           |\n| Portland House, SW/one.tf                | /one.tf/nine.tf,/five.tf/five.tf/four.tf          | /one.tf/nine.tf,/three.tf/eight.tf/four.tf      | /three.tf/four.tf/two.tf          | -/zero.tf./nine.tf         | /seven.tf/three.tf                                        |\n| Timber Square, SE/one.tf                 | /three.tf/zero.tf,/five.tf/four.tf/eight.tf       | /two.tf/five.tf,/eight.tf/one.tf/three.tf       | /five.tf/zero.tf/one.tf           | -/one.tf/five.tf./five.tf  | -                                                         |\n| Landsec development pipeline             | /two.tf/four.tf/seven.tf,/six.tf/zero.tf/three.tf | /two.tf/zero.tf/nine.tf,/zero.tf/five.tf/one.tf |                                   | -/one.tf/five.tf./six.tf   | /four.tf/five.tf,/two.tf/eight.tf/five.tf                 |",

Refer to Glossary for de/finition.\n- /two.tf. Annualised rental income is annual 'rental income' (as de/fined in the Glossary) at the balance sheet date, except that car park and commercialisation income are included on a/uni00A0net basis (after deduction for operational outgoings). Annualised rental income includes temporary lettings.\n- /three.tf. Annualised net rent is annual cash rent, after/uni00A0the deduction of rent payable, as at the/uni00A0balance sheet date. It is calculated using the/uni00A0same methodology as annualised rental income but is stated net of rent payable and before tenant lease incentive adjustments. /three.tf/one.tf March /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf annualised net rent data is not available, therefore /three.tf/zero.tf September /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf information has been included for comparative purposes.\n- /four.tf. Net estimated rental value is gross estimated rental value, as de/fined in the Glossary, after deducting expected rent payable.\n- /five.tf. Gross estimated rental value (ERV) - refer to Glossary for de/finition. The /figure for proposed developments relates to the existing buildings and not the schemes proposed.\n- /six.tf. Net initial yield - refer to Glossary for de/finition. This calculation includes all properties including those sites with no income.\n- /seven.tf. Equivalent yield - refer to Glossary for de/finition. Proposed developments are excluded from the calculation of equivalent yield on the Combined Portfolio.\n- /eight.tf. The like-for-like portfolio - refer to Glossary for/uni00A0de/finition. Capital expenditure on refurbishments, acquisitions of head leases and similar capital expenditure has been allocated to the like-for-like portfolio in preparing this table.\n- /nine.tf. The development programme - refer to Glossary for de/finition. Net initial yield /figures are only calculated for properties in the development programme that have reached practical completion.\n- /one.tf/zero.tf. Includes all properties acquired since /one.tf April /two.tf /zero.tf /one.tf /nine.tf.\n- /one.tf/one.tf.

Of the properties in the development pipeline at 31 March 2021, the only property on which interest was/uni00A0capitalised on the land cost was 21 Moor/fields, EC2.\n\n## Net income/ERV\n\nNet income/ERV represents headline annual rent on let units plus ERV at 31 March 2021 on unlet units, both after rents payable.\n\n## Alternative performance measures\n\nThe Group has applied the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) 'Guidelines on Alternative Performance Measures' in these results. In the context of these results, an alternative performance measure (APM) is a /financial measure of historical or future /financial performance, position or cash /flows of the Group which is not a measure de/fined or speci/fied in IFRS.\n\nThe table below summarises the APMs included in these results, where the de/finitions and reconciliations of these measures can be found and where further discussion is included. The de/finitions of all APMs are included in the Glossary and further discussion of these measures can be found in the Financial review.\n\n| Alternative performance measure                     | Nearest IFRS measure                       | Table 113 Reconciliation   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Revenue pro/fit                                     | Pro/fit/loss before tax                    | Note /four.tf              |\n| Adjusted earnings                                   | Pro/fit/loss attributable to shareholders  | Note /five.tf              |\n| Adjusted earnings per share                         | Basic earnings/loss per share              | Note /five.tf              |\n| Adjusted diluted earnings per share                 | Diluted earnings/loss per share            | Note /five.tf              |\n| EPRA net tangible assets                            | Net assets attributable to shareholders    | Note /five.tf              |\n| EPRA net tangible assets per share                  | Net assets attributable to shareholders    | Note /five.tf              |\n| Total business return                               | n/a                                        | Note /five.tf              |\n| Adjusted net cash in/flow from operating activities | Net cash in/flow from operating activities | Note /one.tf/three.tf      |\n| Combined Portfolio                                  | Investment properties                      | Note /one.tf/four.tf       |\n| Adjusted net debt                                   | Borrowings                                 | Note /two.tf/zero.tf       |\n| Group LTV                                           | n/a                                        | Note /two.tf/zero.tf       |",

This will enable/uni00A0you to receive such communications more quickly and securely, whilst supporting Landsec's sustainability commitment by/uni00A0communicating in a more environmentally friendly and coste/ffective manner. Registration for electronic communications is available via our website: www.landsec.com/investors/ shareholders-equity-investors or www.shareview.co.uk.\n\n## UK REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST /parenleft.caseREIT/parenright.case TAXATION AND STATUS ON PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS\n\nAs a UK REIT, Landsec does not pay corporation tax on Qualifying Activities, which are rental pro/fits and chargeable gains relating to/uni00A0its property rental business.\n\nAt least 90% of income derived from Qualifying Activities must be/uni00A0distributed as Property Income Distributions (PIDs). For most shareholders, PIDs will be paid after deducting withholding tax at/uni00A020%. However, certain categories of shareholder may be able to/uni00A0receive PIDs gross, (i.e. without deduction of withholding tax). These categories are principally UK companies, charities, local authorities, UK pension schemes and managers of ISAs, PEPs and Child Trust Funds.\n\nA REIT may additionally pay ordinary dividends which will be treated in the same way as dividends from non-REIT companies.\n\nFurther information on UK REITs and the forms required to be completed to apply for PIDs to be paid gross are available on the Landsec website or from the Registrar: www.landsec.com/investors/ shareholders-equity-investors.\n\n## PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS TO UK RESIDENT SHAREHOLDERS\n\nFollowing shareholder approval at the 2019 AGM, as recon/firmed in the 2020 Annual Report, dividend payments by cheque ceased from October 2020, with the /first payments made electronically by direct credit to a bank/building society account from the January 2021 dividend payment. Dividend con/firmations will continue to be sent to the shareholder's registered address or an Electronic Dividend Con/firmation will be sent if the shareholder has elected this option.\n\nReceiving dividends directly into a nominated account has a number of advantages, including the crediting of cleared funds on/uni00A0the actual dividend payment date, removing the necessity of physically having to deposit and waiting for the cheque to clear.\n\nShareholders who have not already done so are encouraged to contact the Registrar (Equiniti) to complete a mandate instruction to provide their nominated bank or building society account details to enable payment of dividends, or to provide these details via their Equiniti Shareview online account. Registration to Shareview is free and available on our website: www.landsec.com/investors/shareholders-equity-investors or direct/uni00A0at Equiniti: www.shareview.co.uk.\n\nAlternatively, shareholders may wish to sign up to the Dividend Reinvestment Plan to build upon existing shareholding(s), (see below).\n\n## PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS TO NON/hyphen.caseUK RESIDENT SHAREHOLDERS\n\nAs applicable to UK resident shareholders, following shareholder approval at the 2019 AGM, as recon/firmed in the 2020 Annual Report, dividend payments by cheque ceased from October 2020. Payments were made by direct mandate only from the January 2021 dividend payment. Dividend con/firmations will continue to be sent to the/uni00A0shareholder's registered address or an Electronic Dividend Con/firmation will be sent if the shareholder has elected this option. Payments to overseas accounts are made a few days after the Company's dividend payment day by Citibank.\n\nShareholders who have not already done so are encouraged to contact the Registrar (Equiniti) to complete an Overseas Mandate form to provide their nominated overseas bank account details to/uni00A0enable payment of dividends or provide these details via their Equiniti Shareview online account.\n\nRegistration to Shareview is free and available on our website: www.landsec.com/investors/shareholders-equity-investors or direct/uni00A0at Equiniti: www.shareview.co.uk.\n\nThis service is available in over 90 countries worldwide, as listed on/uni00A0the Equiniti shareholder online facility at www.shareview.co.uk, or by contacting Equiniti by telephone or post at the address shown above under 'Registrar: Equiniti'. The local domestic currency the payment will be converted to is also available on this list.\n\nA small fee will be deducted prior to the overseas account credit, though usually less than the charges for use of a UK Sterling cheque. Please note the maximum payment is \u00a350,000 unless otherwise stated in the list.\n\nShareholders wishing to nominate a bank/building society account in the Republic of Ireland are required to complete an Overseas Mandate form.\n\nShareholders wishing to nominate a bank/building society account in Northern Ireland should use the standard UK process as detailed above.\n\n## DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN /parenleft.caseDRIP/parenright.case\n\nThe DRIP provides shareholders with the opportunity to use cash dividends to increase their shareholding in Landsec. It is a convenient and cost-e/ffective facility provided by Equiniti Financial Services Limited (FCA regulated). Under the DRIP, cash dividends are automatically used to purchase shares in the market as soon as/uni00A0possible after the dividend payment. Any residual cash will be carried forward to the next dividend payment.\n\nDetails of the DRIP, including terms and conditions and participation election forms, are available on our website: www.landsec.com/investors/shareholders-equity-investors\n\nThese are also available by post from: Dividend Reinvestment Plans Equiniti Aspect House, Spencer Road, Lancing, West Sussex BN99 6DA Telephone: 0371 384 2268\u00b9 International dialling: +44 121 415 7173\u00b9",

On the assumption that the 5 for 8 Rights Issue in/uni00A0March 2009 was taken up in full and there were no fractional shares in the 2017 share consolidation, the adjusted price, post consolidation, for Capital Gains Tax purposes would be 229p per share.

To limit the receipt of unsolicited mail, shareholders may register for free with the Mailing Preference Service, an independent organisation by registering at their website at www.mps.org.uk, or by telephone on: +44 (0)20 7291 3310\n\n## SHAREHOLDER SECURITY\n\nIn the past, some of our shareholders have received unsolicited telephone calls or correspondence concerning investment matters from organisations or persons claiming or implying that they have some connection with the Company. These are typically from purported 'brokers' who o/ffer to buy shares at a price often far in/uni00A0excess of their market value. These operations are commonly known as 'boiler rooms'.\n\nShareholders are advised to be very wary of any o/ffers of unsolicited advice, discounted shares, premium prices for shares they own or free reports into the Company. If you receive any such unsolicited calls, correspondence or investment advice:\n\n- \u203a ensure you get the correct name of the person and /firm;\n- \u203a check that the /firm is on the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) Register to ensure that they are authorised at www.register.fca.org.uk;\n- \u203a use the details on the FCA Register to contact the /firm;\n- \u203a call the FCA Consumer Helpline (freephone 0800 111 6768) if there are no contact details in the Register or you are told they are out of date; and\n- \u203a if you feel uncomfortable with the call or the calls persist, simply hang up.\n\nAdditionally, feel free to report and/or discuss any shareholder security matters with the Company. To do this, please call: +44 (0)20 7413 9000 and ask to be put through to a member of the Company Secretariat department or email: shareholder.enquiries@landsec.com\n\n- 1.

It is consistent with the net initial yield calculated by the Group's external valuer.\n\n## EPRA net tangible assets (NTA) per share\n\nDiluted net assets per share adjusted to remove the cumulative fair value movements on interest-rate swaps and similar instruments, the carrying value of goodwill arising as a result of deferred tax and other intangible assets, deferred tax on intangible assets and to include the di/fference between the fair value and the/uni00A0book value of the net investment in tenant /finance/uni00A0leases.\n\n## Equivalent yield\n\nCalculated by the Group's external valuer, equivalent yield is the internal rate of return from an investment property, based on the gross outlays for the purchase of a property (including purchase costs), re/flecting reversions to current market rent and such items as voids and non-recoverable expenditure but ignoring future changes in capital value. The calculation assumes rent is received annually in arrears.\n\n## ERV - Gross estimated rental value\n\nThe estimated market rental value of lettable space as determined biannually by the Group's external valuer.

It is calculated using revenue pro/fit before interest, divided by net interest (excluding the mark-to-market movement on interest-rate swaps, foreign exchange swaps, capitalised interest and interest on the pension scheme/uni00A0assets and liabilities). The calculation excludes/uni00A0joint ventures.\n\n## Interest-rate swap\n\nA /financial instrument where two parties agree to/uni00A0exchange an interest rate obligation for a predetermined amount of time.

Net rental income is presented on a proportionate basis.\n\n## Net zero carbon building\n\nA building for which an overall balance has been achieved between carbon emissions produced and those taken out of the atmosphere, including via o/ffset arrangements. This relates to operational emissions for all buildings while, for a new building, it also includes supply-chain emissions associated with its construction.\n\n## Over-rented\n\nSpace where the passing rent is above the ERV.\n\n## Passing cash rent\n\nPassing cash rent is passing rent excluding units that are in a rent free period at the reporting date.\n\n## Passing rent\n\nThe estimated annual rent receivable as at the reporting date which includes estimates of turnover rent and estimates of rent to be agreed in respect of outstanding rent review or lease renewal negotiations. Passing rent may be more or less than the ERV (see over-rented, reversionary and ERV). Passing rent excludes annual rent receivable from units in administration save to the extent that rents are expected to be received. Void units at the reporting date are deemed to have no passing rent. Although temporary lets of less than 12 months are treated as/uni00A0void, income from temporary lets is included in passing/uni00A0rents.\n\n## Planning permission\n\nThere are two common types of planning permission: full planning permission and outline planning permission. A full planning permission results in a decision on the detailed proposals on how the site can be developed. The grant of a full planning permission will, subject to satisfaction of any conditions, mean no further engagement with the local planning authority will be required to build the consented development. An/uni00A0outline planning permission approves general principles of how a site can be developed. Outline planning permission is granted subject to conditions known as 'reserved matters'. Consent must be sought and achieved for discharge of all reserved matters within a speci/fied time-limit, normally three years from the date outline planning permission was granted, before building can begin. In both the case of full and outline planning permission, the local planning authority will 'resolve to grant permission'. At this stage, the planning permission is granted subject to agreement of legal documents, in particular the s106 agreement. On execution of the s106 agreement, the/uni00A0planning permission will be issued. Work can begin/uni00A0on satisfaction of any 'pre-commencement' planning conditions.\n\n## Pre-development properties\n\nPre-development properties are those properties within the like-for-like portfolio which are being managed to align vacant possession within a three-year horizon with a view to redevelopment.\n\n## Pre-let\n\nA lease signed with an occupier prior to completion of/uni00A0a/uni00A0development.\n\n## Property Income Distribution (PID)\n\nA PID is a distribution by a REIT to its shareholders paid out of qualifying pro/fits.

The market value of the Combined Portfolio is/uni00A0determined by the Group's external valuer.\n\n## Voids\n\nVoids are expressed as a percentage of ERV and represent all unlet space, including voids where refurbishment work is being carried out and voids in respect of pre-development properties. Temporary lettings for a period of one year or less are also treated/uni00A0as voids. The screen at Piccadilly Lights, W1 is/uni00A0excluded from the void calculation as it will always carry advertising although the number and duration of/uni00A0our agreements with advertisers will vary.
