        "page_content": "## Dear fellow shareholders,\n\n## 2020: the year of the pandemic\n\nIn every sense, 2020 was an extraordinary year. The worst pandemic in a century has cost well over 2 million lives and caused worldwide economic and social disruption. While vaccination programmes are now building momentum, the path to recovery remains uncertain.\n\nBecause demand for energy is closely linked to human activity, our sector was deeply affected. The combination of a steep fall in share values for almost all oil and gas companies and a new bp distribution policy significantly affected your shareholder returns.\n\nAs chairman of your board, I am conscious of my responsibilities to bp's shareholders. When the board decided to reset our distribution policy, it did so with a view to your long-term interests. Our priorities were, and remain, weathering the immediate challenge of the pandemic; paying a resilient dividend; strengthening our balance sheet; investing into the energy transition; investing in our resilient hydrocarbons business and, after that, returning surplus cash \u00ab to shareholders through buybacks.\n\nThe board was unanimous in its support for this course of action, which will help establish bp as an Integrated Energy Company. I hope that bp's new investor proposition and financial frame give reasons for optimism about bp's long-term prospects. As we turn to 2021, the board's focus is on supporting bp's leadership team to deliver our new strategy, and on building renewed shareholder confidence through strategic progress and operational and financial performance.\n\n2020 was also tough for our people. My board colleagues and I are proud of them. Their commitment - on rigs, in refineries, across retail stations and everywhere else in bp - helped keep the world's lights on and allowed us to provide many emergency services with free or heavily discounted fuel. Despite new COVID-19-related practical challenges, our people maintained the safety of bp's operations. That is a testament to their careful work.\n\n## bp's new purpose\n\n2020 was a remarkable year for bp for other reasons too. With the backing of the board, our new CEO, Bernard Looney, introduced a new company purpose: reimagining energy for people and our planet. That purpose - together with our strong culture and values - underpins the net zero ambition that we set out last year, together with our new strategy, financial frame and investor proposition. It also informed bp's reinvention - the selection of a new leadership team, and the replacement of bp's upstream/downstream model with a new, integrated group structure.\n\nChange of this scale necessitated a reorganization of how we work. That reorganization will ultimately see close to 10,000 colleagues leaving bp. Saying goodbye has been difficult, but the result is a leaner, flatter, nimbler company - better able to realize the opportunities of the energy transition.\n\nMacro-economic developments have only strengthened the board's belief that the direction in which we are taking bp is the right one including China's new net zero target, the EU's Green Deal, the UK's plan for a green industrial revolution, and the US's recommitment to the Paris Agreement. Today, global energy markets are even further down the path of fundamental change - and bp is well-positioned to help to speed the world's journey to net zero.\n\n## A year of engagement\n\nWhile this is a journey that will require patience, our goal is that bp over time will become a more valuable company for its shareholders and bring wider benefits for society. Of course, the journey to net zero is, in part, one of discovery. For that reason, the board and bp's leadership team know that we must be fully open to advice, learning and challenge.\n\n2020 was therefore a year of engagement with our stakeholders, and I am grateful for the inputs we received - which helped us shape our new strategy, financial frame and investor proposition, sustainability frame and position on biodiversity. We will keep listening, and we count on you to share your feedback with us as we travel the road to net zero together.\n\n## Evolution of the board\n\nAs the company evolves, the board's\n\ncomposition will evolve too - reflecting the need for new experiences and skills aligned with bp's new direction. During the year, the board said goodbye to our former CEO, Bob Dudley, and to Brian Gilvary, our former CFO. Sir Ian Davis, Nils Andersen and Dame Alison Carnwath have also stepped down from the board, and we shall shortly say farewell to Brendan Nelson. Collectively and individually they served with fortunate to welcome Tushar Morzaria, Karen Richardson and Johannes Teyssen to bp's board\n\ndistinction - bp is very fortunate to have had their wise advice and strong leadership. We are just as for the first time.\n\n## Closing thanks\n\nI would like to thank Bernard Looney, his leadership team and everyone in bp for their work during 2020. Throughout this challenging year, they showed characteristic determination.\n\nFinally, I thank you, our shareholders. I am grateful both for the continued support we received during 2020, and also for the support of our new shareholders. During 2020, we received investment and other endorsement from those who told us they would not have considered supporting bp were it not for the transformation we have begun. We look forward to repaying the faith you have placed in bp.\n\nHelge Lund, Chairman 22 March 2021\n\n<!-- image -->",

At bp, our thoughts are with the families and loved ones of the colleagues we have lost. Thousands more on our teams have had the virus, and life under lockdown has meant additional challenges, and anxiety for everyone. I want to pay particular tribute to those on the frontline of our business who have kept our plants and platforms running, our shops and forecourts open, and energy flowing to the world. They have sacrificed so much and earned our deepest respect and appreciation.\n\n## Responding to brutal conditions\n\nWe began our transformation from an International Oil Company to an Integrated Energy Company against this backdrop, along with lower oil and gas prices, lower refining margins and unprecedented falls in demand for our retail and aviation fuels. Our response included lowering costs, strengthening the balance sheet with an innovative hybrid bond issue, and advancing our strategy to become\n\n## $20.3bn\n\nloss attributable to bp shareholders",

        "page_content": "a more diversified, resilient and lower carbon company. As part of our strategy planning process, we reviewed our portfolio and development plans. This work - informed by bp's views of the long-term price environment - led to significant impairment charges and non-cash exploration write-offs in the second quarter.\n\nFor shareholders, all this was reflected in a reset dividend and a diminished share price. I recognize the financial impact this must have had on you. However, I wholeheartedly believe we will not just restore, but will enhance the long-term sustainable value of your company through the actions we are taking to reinvent bp. And despite the most brutal operating conditions I can remember in almost 30 years in this industry, we have made considerable operational and strategic progress.\n\n## Performing while transforming\n\nThe loss of $20.3 billion we reported for the year is clearly disappointing. However, it in no way reflects the heroic efforts of the bp team in extremely difficult circumstances, or their deep commitment to performing while transforming:\n\n- Most importantly - our safety performance continued to improve.\n- Reliability of 94% for bp's operated plants \u00ab and refining availability \u00ab of 96% represents remarkably strong performance, especially given the challenges faced by our frontline staff.\n- Capital was reset and we delivered at the lower end of the range.\n- We made good progress towards our net debt \u00ab target, including the contribution from high grading our portfolio and $6.6 billion of divestment and other proceeds received during the year.\n- New oil and gas production came on from four major projects \u00ab - in India, Oman, the UK and the US.\n- Natural gas from the Shah Deniz field in the Caspian Sea arrived in Italy following final completion of the historic Southern Gas Corridor project.\n- And we doubled our retail network in growth markets to around 2,700 retail sites \u00ab , plus the addition of around 300 strategic convenience sites \u00ab .\n\n## Reinventing bp\n\nThis performance is even more remarkable given that we have been carrying out the most extensive reorganization in bp's 112-year history. We have retired the upstream/downstream business model that has served bp very well. In its place we have introduced a leaner, flatter structure, stripping away tiers of management and lowering the workforce towards a target of around 10,000 fewer jobs. My role is now five layers at most away from more than half of our employees. That means people's ideas and voices can be more easily heard - and decisions taken much faster.\n\nWe are now more centralized, more agile, and better integrated. This enables us to maximize value creation in a rapidly evolving market through economies of scale, and by exploiting synergies and driving continuous improvement in operational performance.\n\nWe are now organized around four business groups.\n\n- Production & operations is the operating heart of the company - and is focusing our resilient hydrocarbons portfolio on value.\n- Customers & products is growing our convenience and mobility offers for an increasing number of customers.\n- Gas & low carbon energy is growing to help meet rapidly increasing clean energy demand.\n- Innovation & engineering acts as a catalyst, opening up new and disruptive business models and driving our digital transformation.\n\nAnd our trading & shipping business and regions, cities & solutions team knit together the offers of our four core groups to drive greater value creation.\n\n## Reimagining energy\n\nCompleting our transformation to a net zero Integrated Energy Company will take time. But we are led by our purpose - to reimagine energy for people and our planet - and motivated by the opportunity we see in the energy transition. Trillions of dollars of investment will be needed over the next 30 years in replumbing and rewiring the global energy system.\n\nWe now have offshore wind partnerships in the US with Equinor and in the UK with EnBW - two of the best regions globally for the world's fastest-growing source of energy. Our solar development joint venture \u00ab , Lightsource bp, is growing prolifically. We are working with \u00d8rsted to develop green hydrogen for our Lingen refinery. We have joined forces with the mobility\n\nplatform DiDi to build a network of electric vehicle chargers in China, by far the world's biggest market for EVs. And we have a growing list of low carbon partnerships with cities such as Aberdeen and Houston and some of the world's leading companies, including Amazon, Microsoft, Qantas and Uber.\n\n## A compelling investor proposition\n\nWe are fully focused at all times on the bottom line of the business - on executing our strategy while operating safely, reliably and with discipline. We continue to build resilience and strength in the balance sheet as conditions remain challenging and uncertain while vaccines roll out, the pandemic recedes, and economies look to recover. At the same time, we are transforming to create value from the energy transition over the long term.\n\nWe see tremendous business opportunity in providing people with the reliable, affordable, clean energy they want and need. Our net zero ambition is clearly the right thing for society, but we know it does not give us a free pass in a fast-changing world. We have to show you the evidence that we can compete fiercely and add value - in service of the compelling investor proposition we believe we offer:\n\n- Committed distributions - including the dividend as the number one priority;\n- Profitable growth; and\n- Sustainable value.\n\nThis is all in service of growing long-term shareholder value, that is our job. And I promise to keep you well informed as we execute our plans. As ever, thank you for your continued support - I will never take that for granted. And I look forward to any feedback you might have.\n\nThank you.\n\nBernard Looney, Chief executive officer 22 March 2021\n\n<!-- image -->",

Energy markets have begun a process of significant, lasting change in response to this - shifting increasingly towards low carbon and renewables. And in 2020 we saw further changes, as COVID-19 spread across the globe.\n\n## COVID-19\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has affected individuals, countries and businesses. The spread of the pandemic quickly plunged the world economy into recession and reshaped social norms and attitudes.\n\nGlobally, businesses have had to change established assumptions and introduce new models and ways of working. For bp, it has had an adverse impact on our business, including on the demand for our products and on their prices.\n\nBut the more we understand about the consequences for the global economy - and the inevitable uncertainty it brings - the more convinced we are that our ambition and strategy are taking us in the right direction for bp, for our employees, our shareholders and society.\n\n## Impact on the economy\n\nThe global economy is estimated to have contracted 4.3% in 2020, the steepest decline in economic activity since 1946, caused by COVID-19.\n\nIn advanced economies the recovery from the initial contraction was dampened by resurgences of COVID-19 cases, leading to an annual contraction of 5.4%. Most emerging markets, excluding China, also experienced deep recessions, with growth of -5% in 2020, while in China the economy grew by 2% a .\n\n- a  World Bank Global Economic Prospects, January 2021.\n\n## Mobilizing safely in the North Sea\n\nIn 2020 bp managed more than 15,000 journeys by people mobilizing to and from our North Sea assets. As the COVID-19 pandemic took hold in the UK, the bp North Sea team quickly implemented wide-ranging and robust COVID-19-specific measures to protect the safety and wellbeing of offshore colleagues.\n\nThe 'Safe Passage' programme was introduced during the first UK lockdown to help individuals travel to Aberdeen for mobilization as safely as possible. The programme provided door-to-door transport, accommodation during the journey to Aberdeen and hotels in the city dedicated to bp staff and contractors.\n\nWe introduced pre-mobilization COVID-19 testing in Aberdeen, one of the first operators in the North Sea to do this. Social distancing and enhanced hygiene and cleaning regimes continue to play a vital role in protecting the health and wellbeing of our offshore teams.\n\nSpecialist 'C-MED' medevac helicopters, equipped with an on-board medic and configured to enable social distancing, were introduced to safely transport individuals suspected of contracting the virus back to shore for further treatment and support.\n\n## Our response\n\nAs COVID-19 continues to affect communities around the world, we have focused our effort on three priorities.\n\n- 1  Protecting our people.\n- 2  Supporting communities where we live and work.\n- 3  Strengthening our finances.\n\nOur leadership teams were in daily discussions to respond to the conditions in the countries where we operate as the pandemic unfolded.\n\nWe had a three-tier response model with executive-level, business, country and incident management steering committees. Some examples are given on the next page.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "1\n\n## Protecting our people\n\nOur first priority is the safety and health of our people.\n\nOur people involved in, or supporting, critical operations continued at their normal workplace during the pandemic and we put additional processes in place to help protect them. These included operating robust protocols for health and pre-mobilization checks, PPE, travel and workplace access, social distancing and isolation.\n\nEmployees who were able to work from home were asked not to come into their workplace and we put business travel restrictions in place. Many office-based workers continue to work from home at the time of publication and are likely to do so for the foreseeable future as ways of working change.\n\nWe liaised closely with industry peers and other organizations to regularly test our approach on specific safety issues. And we created a global COVID-19 OneMap, providing our businesses with current local COVID-19 risk profiles including rates of infection, vaccines rates and procurement.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2\n\n## Supporting communities\n\nProviding essential support for the communities where our people live and our businesses operate was a priority throughout our response to COVID-19. We offered support to governments and partners, using our expertise and resources to support the relief effort. The bp Foundation donated $2 million to the World Health Organization's COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund, which supports medical professionals and patients worldwide by providing critical aid and supplies. The fund also helps track and understand the spread of COVID-19 and supports efforts to develop tests, treatments and vaccines.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 3\n\n## Strengthening our finances\n\nThe economic consequences of COVID-19 for the world remain uncertain at the time of publication. In response to this uncertainty, we took deliberate steps to strengthen our finances - reinforcing liquidity, rapidly reducing spending and costs, driving our cash balance point lower.\n\n## Divestment programme\n\n- We delivered our plans for $15 billion of announced divestments, which commenced at the start of 2019, in June 2020 - a year earlier than expected.\n\n## Supplying free fuel for emergency services vehicles\n\nIn 2020 we supplied more than 10 million litres of free fuel to emergency service vehicles across the UK.\n\nWe ran programmes during 2020 and 2021 offering free fuel to UK emergency vehicles - including police, fire, blood transportation, emergency NHS ambulances and NHS Trust non-emergency vehicles.\n\nUnder the programmes, emergency services vehicles issued with either a bp Plus or Allstar fuel card could fill up without charge at bp's network of 1,200 retail sites across the UK, including charging of electric vehicles through bp pulse.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- In 2020 we set a new target of $25 billion of proceeds between the second half of 2020 and 2025, of which we've completed or agreed transactions for over half of this target. This includes the agreed sale of a 20% interest in Oman's Block 61 and proceeds from the divestments of our petrochemicals business and Alaska interests.\n- We have a deep hopper of potential future divestment options. As we execute this programme, we will continue to be focused on value.\n\n## Capital expenditure\n\n- Capital expenditure \u00ab for 2020 was $14 billion, around 28% lower than 2019. Organic capital expenditure \u00ab for 2020 was $12 billion, in line with the guidance given in April.\n\n## Liquidity\n\n- Finance debt was $72.7 billion and net debt \u00ab was $38.9 billion at the end of 2020. We are actively managing the profile of our debt portfolio. We issued perpetual hybrid bonds with a US dollar equivalent value of $11.9 billion in June 2020, and we bought back an aggregate US dollar equivalent value of $8 billion of debt in the third quarter of 2020, January 2021 and March 2021. bp had around $44 billion of liquidity, consisting of cash and cash equivalents (net of restricted cash) plus undrawn revolving credit facilities committed credit and bank facilities, at the end of 2020.\n- In April 2020 Moody's reaffirmed BP p.l.c.'s A1 credit rating and revised its outlook from stable to negative. The short-term P-1 rating was also reaffirmed.\n- In January 2021 S&P revised its outlook on BP p.l.c. from stable to negative and affirmed BP p.l.c.'s long- and short-term corporate credit rating of A-/A-2.\n- From January 2021, Fitch Ratings has provided a solicited long-term corporate credit rating to BP p.l.c. of A with stable outlook. In February 2021, Fitch Ratings assigned BP p.l.c. a short-term corporate credit rating of F1.\n\nbp's financial performance, including cash flows and net debt, has been and will continue to be impacted by the extent and duration of the current market conditions and the effectiveness of the actions that it and others take, including its financial interventions. It is difficult to predict when current supply and demand imbalances will be resolved and what the ultimate impact of COVID-19 will be.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee page 22 for more information on capital allocation.\n\nWe have addressed our response to COVID-19 in further detail throughout this report:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee page 63 Our stakeholders.\n\nSee page 64 How we manage risk.\n\nSee page 67\n\nRisk factors.\n\nSee page 87 Workforce engagement.",

        "page_content": "## Energy markets continued\n\n## Energy economics\n\n## Oil\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a sharp contraction in oil sector demand and production in 2020.\n\nGlobal oil consumption a decreased by 8.8mmb/d to 91.2mmb/d for the year (-8.8%) as global lockdown measures reduced mobility and took a toll on economic activity.\n\nOn the supply side, unprecedented co-ordinated output cuts from OPEC+, coupled with curtailed non-OPEC supply, reduced global oil production a by 6.6mmb/d to 93.9mmb/d.\n\nDated Brent \u00ab prices averaged $41.84/bbl in 2020 - a 35% decrease from 2019 levels and almost 26% below the 2016-18 average.\n\nPrices fluctuated during 2020, reaching a peak of almost $70/bbl in January on OPEC+ supply restraints and the decline in Libyan output. Prices hit a low of almost $13/bbl in April as lockdown measures were put in place globally. In the second half of the year prices hovered around the $40-45/bbl range, before hitting $50/bbl in December.\n\nUrals prices in North West Europe (Rotterdam) averaged $41.71/bbl in 2020. The discount to dated Brent was $0.13/bbl below 2019 ($1.25/bbl).\n\n## 8.8%\n\ndecrease in global oil consumption in 2020\n\n## Natural gas\n\nGas spot prices dropped in all three key regional markets in 2020.\n\n- Henry Hub \u00ab prices decreased to $2.08/ mmBtu in 2020 from $2.63/mmBtu in 2019. US gas prices varied substantially during 2020, dropping in the second quarter of 2020 due to the impact of the lockdown, before recovering in the fourth quarter as production declined due to the earlier oil price drop and lower oil and gas drilling activity b .\n- The UK National Balancing Point \u00ab hub price also dropped significantly from 34.70 pence per therm in 2019, down to 24.93 pence per therm in 2020, due to a combination of a mild winter 2019/20, global LNG oversupply, demand drop and record-high storage levels b .\n- Asian spot prices declined from $5.49/mmBtu in 2019, down to $4.39/mmBtu on the back of global LNG oversupply and LNG supply capacity growth, especially in the US c . They recovered in the fourth quarter on the back of strong Asian LNG demand and LNG supply issues.\n\nGlobal gas demand dropped by an estimated 2.5% in 2020, while China's gas demand continued to grow. Meanwhile, LNG trade increased modestly during 2020 b .\n\n## 2.5%\n\nestimated decrease in global gas demand in 2020\n\n.\n\n## Refining marker margin\n\nWe track the refining margin environment using a global refining marker margin \u00ab (RMM) c .\n\nCOVID-19 significantly impacted the downstream sector during 2020. Weaker demand drove product stocks to record highs. OECD commercial product stocks peaked in August at over 1,650Mbbls, almost 150Mbbls higher than a year ago. Since then stocks have declined but are still above historical levels.\n\nIn 2020 COVID-19 impacted demand through different channels. During the initial global lockdown period, the drop in demand was concentrated in road and air travel - hitting gasoline and jet fuel the hardest. As more measured domestic social distancing policies evolved, road mobility and hence gasoline demand recovered, while jet demand remained depressed. The broader negative impact on the economy also dampened diesel demand given the close link between commercial and industrial diesel uses and economic activity.\n\nThe resulting refining margins have, therefore, remained extremely weak since the beginning of the pandemic, with RMM averaging $6.7/bbl in 2020, far lower than the level in 2019 ($13.2/bbl).\n\nMoreover, the weak margin environment combined with continued capacity additions in developing markets has prompted a raft of third-party closure announcements. Some industry rationalization is expected given the step change in demand, but this is not likely to be sufficient to see a sustained rebound in margins to pre-COVID-19 levels.\n\n$6.7/bbl global RMM average in 2020",

        "page_content": "## Energy markets continued\n\nSome scenarios start from today and project forward over a timeframe in which the current structure of the energy system helps to inform the pace and nature of the transition path. Other scenarios start in the distant future, breaking free from the inherent inertia in the energy system (and potentially our thinking), and look back to the present from that new perspective. In thinking about appropriate scenarios to inform our new strategy, we used both approaches.\n\nThe scenarios chosen to explore the range of uncertainty surrounding the future of the global energy system span a broad range of energy transition paths. Importantly, the scenarios are not predictions of what is likely to happen or what bp would like to happen. Rather they consider the possible implications of different judgements and assumptions and so help to design a strategy which is resilient to the wide range of uncertainty we face.\n\nBy considering various time horizons, we can identify key milestones or signposts which might emerge over the next five, 10 or 30 years and inform our view of the key sources of uncertainty affecting the global energy system. We actively monitor for changes in the external environment, and refresh or review our scenarios as needed in response to these signals.\n\n## How we create scenarios\n\nWe quantify these scenarios in the bp Energy Outlook 2020 using our global energy modelling system. This comprises of a suite of models developed over the past 10 years to help us understand supply and demand dynamics of the global energy system.\n\nThe modelling framework uses historical data based on the bp Statistical Review of World Energy , IEA energy balances and a range of other energy and non-energy data sets. The model combines supply, end-use demand, and production in intermediate sectors, including power and hydrogen, to create global energy outlooks.\n\nEach scenario is determined by a set of key assumptions including population and economic growth, pace of technological change, resource constraints and government policies. Prices are used to balance supply and demand. The modelling techniques used vary by sector and include a combination of econometric modelling, least-cost optimization, adoption curves and consumer choice modelling. The regional coverage varies by sector but at its most aggregated the model produces views for 14 regions, across six sectors, more than 20 energy and technology sources and associated CO 2 emissions from each. It produces annual data out to 2050.\n\nScenarios are generated based on our own judgements alongside views from external organizations. For example, population growth from the United Nations, economic growth supported by views from Oxford Economics, resource availability based on Rystad Energy's global upstream database, power modelling informed by Aurora Energy Research and global system dynamics based on a proprietary TIMES integrated assessment model. All scenarios typically take into account historical evidence, current policies, user judgement and specialist projections.\n\nIn developing the scenarios, we benchmark our views against scenarios from external organizations including from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPPC) 2019 Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5\u00b0C, IEA's World Energy Outlook 2020 and IHS Markit's Energy and Climate Scenarios.\n\n## How scenarios inform our strategy\n\nThe scenarios described in the bp Energy Outlook 2020 helped inform bp's strategy process, alongside a wide range of other analyses and information. As we developed the strategy, the scenarios were reviewed and refined to ensure they remained relevant, for example, they were completely refreshed to account for the possible implications of COVID-19, and they remained challenging for example, by including a scenario in which global emissions from energy reach near zero by 2050.\n\nThe aim of the scenarios is to aid our understanding of how the pace and nature of the energy transition may affect the global energy system and so help our strategy be robust and resilient to the range of uncertainty we face. Given that, we believe that it is neither useful nor sensible to try to identify one scenario as being more or less likely than another.\n\n<!-- image -->",

And through our disciplined approach to investment, we expect to create the opportunity to significantly increase our investment in low carbon activities in this decade, while also operating a high-quality base business.\n\n## A coherent approach to capital allocation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## A clear set of priorities\n\nResilient dividend: We aim to fund a resilient dividend intended to remain fixed at 5.25 cents per ordinary share, per quarter, subject to the board's discretion.\n\nStrong balance sheet: In the near term, we target deleveraging to $35 billion of net debt \u00ab and maintaining a strong investment grade credit rating thereafter.\n\n## Investing at scale in the energy transition:\n\nWe plan to allocate sufficient capital to advance our energy transition strategy, with this allocation intended to rise once our near-term deleveraging target is achieved.\n\n- We have a range of sector-specific internal rate of return hurdles for transition and low carbon investments between 10% and 15%.\n- For renewable power, we look for returns of at least 8% to 10% levered.\n\nAll of this is then optimized to make sure we are considering a sufficiently broad range of economic, strategic and sustainability criteria in the context of risk and enduring sources of competitive advantage.\n\n## Investing to maximize value in resilient\n\nhydrocarbons: We aim to invest appropriately in our resilient and valuable hydrocarbons business to generate sustainable cash flow.\n\n- We have set stringent hurdle rates for all final investment decisions. A payback of less than 10 years for all investments in upstream oil and refining.\n- A payback of less than 15 years for upstream gas.\n\nShare buyback commitment: We are committing to return at least 60% of surplus cash \u00ab as share buybacks, having reached $35 billion net debt and subject to maintaining a strong investment grade credit rating.\n\n## Investment in non-oil and gas\n\nAs part of our net zero ambition (see page 49), we aim to increase the proportion of investment we make into our non-oil and gas businesses. We plan to increase investment in low carbon from around $750 million in 2020 to $3-4 billion by 2025 and to around $5 billion a year in 2030.\n\nOur 2020 capital expenditure \u00ab against our aim 5 non-oil and gas activities of around $750 million included a partial acquisition payment for the US offshore wind partnership with Equinor, see page 20, our investments in electrification and advanced mobility, and investment into activities through bp ventures and Launchpad.\n\nIn 2020 Lightsource bp progressed multiple solar projects, including developments in Texas, Indiana, Colorado and Spain. bp Bunge now has capacity for 1.8 billion litres of ethanol production a year and is able to export over 1,200GWh of electricity to the national grid in Brazil. We expect overall low carbon spend to grow significantly in 2021.\n\nCapital expenditure for convenience and mobility grew to $2.2 billion in 2020, weighted towards growth and with a focus on new retail sites \u00ab , differentiated fuels and lubricants and next-gen mobility. We formed a joint venture with Reliance in India and plan to scale up to 5,500 retail sites by 2025, see page 24.\n\nWe made significant progress towards our 2030 aim of more than 70,000 electric vehicle charge points \u00ab through the DiDi joint venture in China, investment in ultra-fast electric vehicle charging points in Germany, and bp pulse - the UK's largest public charging network.\n\nOverall, bp transition and low carbon capital expenditure in 2020 was around 20% of the capital mix, and by 2030 we expect it to be as much as 50% of our capital expenditure, of which a significant majority will be low carbon.\n\nAs a reminder, the CA100+ resolution \u00ab requires us to disclose:\n\n- Our anticipated investment in oil and gas resources and reserves - this is anticipated to be less in 2021 than it was in 2020.\n- Our anticipated investment in other energy sources and technologies, which is anticipated to be significantly greater than 2020 levels, as described above.",

        "page_content": "## Reinventing bp consistency with the Paris goals\n\n## Pursuing a strategy that is consistent with the Paris goals\n\n## What we mean by Paris consistent\n\nWe aim to be recognized as a leader in transparency for our sector, in the knowledge that investors and other stakeholders are seeking to understand whether companies and their strategies, targets and aims are consistent with the world meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change a (the Paris goals). This is what we refer to as 'Paris consistency'.\n\nWe believe the world is on an unsustainable path - the carbon budget is running out - and needs to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions. And we believe that there are a range of global pathways to achieve the Paris goals, with differing implications for regions, industries and sectors, so business strategies need to be flexible.\n\nOur approach to determining Paris consistency is based on three key principles. We believe that our strategy satisfies all three principles and therefore the board considers it to be consistent with the Paris goals.\n\n## 1. Informed by Paris-consistent energy\n\ntransition scenarios - a company's strategy should be informed by Paris-consistent scenarios. We see the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as the most authoritative source of information on the evolving science of climate change and we use it and other sources to inform our strategy.\n\nThe IPCC highlights that there are a range of global pathways by which the world can meet the Paris goals, with differing implications for regions, industries and sectors. For many years to come oil and gas features in the energy mix in the IPCC's suite of Paris-consistent scenarios, albeit progressively decarbonized and ultimately offset; the exact trajectory for oil and for gas varies from scenario to scenario.\n\nbp's new strategy is informed by all of these considerations. It is designed to drive progressive decarbonization, while remaining flexible and adaptable to the many different potential pathways the energy transition may take, including various Paris-consistent pathways.\n\n- 2. Contributing to net zero - whether a\n\ncompany's strategy enables it to make a positive contribution to the world meeting the Paris goals.\n\nWe believe that bp's strategy enables us to make just such a contribution. It is designed to deliver value, while advancing bp towards meeting our net zero ambition and helping the world get to net zero too. Together, we believe this sets out a path that is consistent with the Paris goals.\n\nThere are many different ways in which a company at the heart of the energy sector can make a meaningful contribution - including action on greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) measured by emissions metrics like Scope 1, 2 and 3.\n\nParis consistency also includes consideration of a range of other activities, such as technology development, policy advocacy, low carbon collaboration and investments in low carbon. Our strategy seeks to address all of these by reshaping bp's business around our three focus areas and three sources of differentiation, see page 15.\n\nSome ways of contributing are more readily measured by quantitative metrics than others - but all can be important, whether or not they translate into GHG reductions for the company.\n\nTo illustrate this, in terms of low carbon investment, by 2030 we aim to increase the amount of renewable energy generating capacity we have developed to 50GW, as part of our increased capital expenditure on low carbon businesses. This aim supports the Paris goals by increasing the low carbon options available to energy consumers. However, it does not reduce our Scope 1, 2 or 3 emissions. And it may not result in a decrease in the overall intensity of bp's marketed products, because that is dependent on the extent to which we market the resulting renewable power, which is a commercial consideration.\n\nAdditionally, our strategy is underpinned by our aim to more actively advocate for policies that support net zero, including carbon pricing. Helping policy makers to design and put in place low carbon policies can help deliver our strategy and take advantage of the huge opportunities associated with achieving the Paris goals. Well-designed low carbon policies can advance the decarbonization of a whole economy something potentially of far greater impact than anything a single company can achieve through its own portfolio.\n\n- 3. Strategic resilience - a Paris-consistent strategy should position the company for success and resilience in a Paris-consistent world - a world that is progressing on one of the many global trajectories considered to be Paris consistent, and ultimately meets the Paris goals.\n\nWe believe this means having a strategy that's flexible enough to manage the inherent uncertainty in the range of potential global pathways, including those that can achieve the Paris goals.\n\nOur new strategy is designed to provide this flexibility. In setting the strategy, the board and management referred to the range of scenarios set out in the bp Energy Outlook 2020 , see page 11. We see huge opportunity in the energy transition, including the Outlook's 'Rapid' and 'Net Zero' scenarios, which we believe are two of many possible Paris-consistent pathways for the world. Our strategy also mitigates the risks associated with a scenario such as the Outlook's 'Delayed and Disorderly' transition.\n\nAs a result, our strategy is designed to be resilient across scenarios, including those that are Paris consistent, but is weighted towards a rapid transition.",

        "page_content": "## Responding to increased shareholder interest on Paris consistency\n\nIn 2019 the board recommended that shareholders support a special resolution requisitioned by Climate Action 100+ (CA100+) on climate change disclosures. The CA100+ resolution passed with more than 99% of the vote. This is the second year we have included responses throughout the annual report. We have adopted a similar approach to the bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2019 .\n\nThe CA100+ resolution, which includes safeguards such as protections for commercially confidential and competitively sensitive information, is on page 341.

By 2030 we expect to have a smaller, more resilient and focused oil and gas portfolio.\n\nThis is supported by our evaluation of each new material capex investment for Paris consistency and our long-term price assumptions, which were reviewed in June 2020. We lowered our price assumptions and extended them to 2050 so that they are now consistent with our long-term time planning horizon, see page 28.\n\nWe are building a portfolio that is more robust in a low carbon world. We believe that the diversification of our portfolio and decarbonizing our hydrocarbons business will make bp more resilient to Paris-consistent pathways. And this will allow us to continue to redeploy capital to support our strategy to become an Integrated Energy Company - aiming to deploy an appropriate mix of cash flow from hydrocarbons and capital released by divestments into ambitious plans for growth in our low carbon, convenience and mobility businesses, see page 18.\n\n## Scale and reach\n\nOur global footprint and interests in multiple sources of energy provide resilience through exposure to different price environments, and our presence in over 70 countries enables access to new markets. Our track record of creating mutually beneficial strategic partnerships helps our resilience, and we are building new and deeper relationships with governments, cities and corporate customers at a scale that we believe is difficult for others to replicate. Our presence across the energy value chain and our ability to provide integrated energy solutions for our customers position us to succeed in a Paris-consistent world.\n\n## Targets and aims\n\nOur strategy is supported by clear business plans, underpinned by specific short, medium and long-term targets and aims for 2025, 2030 and 2050 or sooner, including:\n\n- Aiming to be net zero across our entire operations (Scopes 1 and 2).\n- Aiming for the carbon in our upstream oil and gas production (Scope 3) to be net zero.\n- Aiming to cut the life cycle carbon intensity of our marketed products by 50% (which includes the associated Scope 3 emissions).\n\nFrom a 2019 baseline, we aim to increase our annual low carbon investment ten-fold to around $5 billion a year, building out an integrated portfolio of low carbon technologies, including renewables, bioenergy and early positions in hydrogen and carbon capture, use and storage (CCUS).\n\nOver the same period, our oil and gas production is expected to reduce by at least 1 million barrels of oil equivalent a day, or 40%, from 2019 levels.",

        "page_content": "## Reinventing bp our investment process\n\n## Our investment process\n\n## Price assumptions\n\n## Revising long-term price assumptions\n\nOur price assumptions are determined for use in our investment appraisal processes. They are also used to inform decisions about internal planning processes and the impairment testing of assets for financial reporting.\n\n## What the prices are\n\nAs part of our strategy development we reviewed our portfolio and capital development plans. That work was informed by bp's views of the long-term price environment and its balanced investment criteria. Together these create a framework that seeks to ensure investments align with our strategy and add shareholder value.\n\nAdditionally, with the COVID-19 pandemic continuing throughout 2020, we see it having an enduring impact on the global economy, with demand for energy weaker than expected for a sustained period.\n\nWe attach increasing weight to the possibility that the aftermath of COVID-19 will accelerate the pace of transition to a lower carbon economy and energy system, as countries seek to 'build back better' so their economies are more resilient and sustainable.\n\nAs a result of all the above, we revised down our long-term price assumptions, and also extended them to 2050 to align with the horizon of our ambition. The next few years will likely see periods of market volatility as demand recovers against a backdrop of reduced levels of investment and we believe we are well positioned to benefit from any near-term increase in oil prices. The role of long-term price assumptions is to look through this near-term volatility and help ensure our future projects are resilient to the longer-term trends affecting our industry.\n\nOur revised investment appraisal long-term price assumptions are now an average of around $55/bbl for Brent \u00ab and $2.90 per mmBtu for Henry Hub \u00ab gas (2020 $ real), from 20212050. We consider these lower long-term price assumptions to be broadly in line with a range of transition paths consistent with the Paris goals. However, they do not correspond to any specific Paris-consistent scenario. We also revised our carbon prices for the period to 2050, and these now include a price of $100/teCO 2 in 2030 (2020 $ real).\n\n## Key investment appraisal assumptions\n\n|                         |   2021 |   2025 |   2030 |   2040 |   2050 |\n|-------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Brent oil ($/bbl)       |     50 |     50 |     60 |     60 |  50    |\n| Henry Hub gas ($/mmBtu) |      3 |      3 |      3 |      3 |   2.75 |\n| RMM \u00ab                   |     10 |     12 |     12 |     10 |  10    |\n\n## Carbon price (US$/tCO 2 e)\n\n|                          |   2021 |   2025 |   2030 |   2040 |   2050 |\n|--------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Central case real (2020) |     50 |     50 |    100 |    200 |    250 |\n\n## Impairment testing\n\nAs a result of the revision of long-term price assumptions used for investment appraisal, we also revised the price assumptions we use in value in-use impairment testing. These two price sets are now aligned.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee pages 166-167 for more about oil and natural gas price assumptions used for impairment testing and relating sensitivity testing.\n\n## Investment process price assumptions\n\nAll investments are evaluated against our long-term price assumptions across a range of alternative prices (central, upper and lower) for oil, natural gas and refining margins. In addition, all investment cases above defined thresholds for anticipated annual greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from operations must estimate those anticipated GHG emissions and include an associated carbon price into the investment economics.\n\nAll price assumptions place some weight on scenarios in which the transition to a low carbon energy system is sufficiently rapid to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement, as well as scenarios in which the transition is not, or may not be, sufficiently rapid. They also place some weight on a range of other factors, which can drive prices, and are not related to the goals of the Paris Agreement.\n\nThese price ranges do not link to specific scenarios or outcomes, but instead try to capture the range of different possibilities surrounding the future path of the global energy system. The nature of the uncertainty means that these price ranges inevitably reflect considerable judgement. The ranges are reviewed and updated on an annual basis as our understanding and judgement about the energy transition evolves.\n\nIn addition to consideration of a range of price assumptions, investment cases are asked to present scenarios covering a range of variables, related to the economics of the investment, such as cost, resource, policy changes and schedule, to highlight the robustness of investment cases to a range of other factors.",

This seeks to ensure investments align with our strategy, fall within our prevailing financial frame, and add shareholder value. The governance framework also provides for investments to be assessed consistently and against a range of other outcomes relevant to our strategy, including a range of environmental and sustainability factors.\n\nInvestments follow an integrated stage-gate process designed to enable us to choose and develop the most attractive investment cases. A balanced set of investment criteria is used, see page 30. This allows for the comparison and prioritization of investments across an increasingly diverse range of business models.\n\nThe governance framework also specifies that proposed investments are tested, including against carbon prices for projected operational emissions, and are subject to assurance by functions independent of the business before a final investment decision (FID) is taken.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee  page  88 for more information on bp's governance framework.\n\n## Resource commitment meeting\n\nFor capital investments above defined financial thresholds for organic or inorganic spend, the investment approval is conducted by the executive-level resource commitment meeting (RCM), which is chaired by the chief executive officer. The RCM reviews the merits of each such investment case against a balanced set of criteria and considers any key issues raised in the assurance process.\n\nThe CA100+ resolution requires bp to disclose how we evaluate the consistency of new material capex investments \u00ab with (i) the Paris goals and (ii) a range of other outcomes relevant to bp's strategy. bp's evaluation of consistency of such investments with the Paris goals was undertaken by the RCM for new material capex investments sanctioned in 2020, see page 31. bp's evaluation of an investment's consistency with 'a range of other relevant outcomes' is achieved by considering its merits against bp's balanced investment criteria as described on page 30.\n\n## The role of the board\n\nThe board assesses the impact of portfolio changes, such as strategic acquisitions and the allocation of capital. The board reviews capital investments that are more than $3 billion for resilient hydrocarbons, more than $1 billion for all transition or low carbon investments and, in addition, any significant inorganic acquisition that is exceptional or unique in nature.\n\n## bp board\n\nReviews investment cases more than $3 billion for resilient hydrocarbons, more than $1 billion for all transition or low carbon investments and any significant inorganic acquisition that is exceptional or unique in nature.\n\n## Resource commitment meeting\n\nApproves investment decisions related to existing and new lines of business above $250 million organic and $25 million inorganic, or which exceeds the relevant EVP financial authority, and for any project considered strategically important such as new market entry.\n\n## Investment allocation committees\n\nEVP level forums to review investment cases within a business group as per individual EVP financial authority (up to $250 million organic, $25 million inorganic capital investment).\n\n## Business unit investment governance meetings\n\nSVP level forums which review investment cases within a business group, enabler or integrator up to the individual SVP financial authority.\n\n## Cross-group meetings and forums\n\nMeetings and forums to allow cross-group discussions and integration.

Further, the decision to endorse an investment based on the information provided represents bp's evaluation that the investment is considered consistent with a range of other outcomes, relevant to bp's strategy.\n\nIn 2020 the standardized approach for investment cases was reviewed to place a greater focus on our strategy, sustainability and integration value. These changes, and associated nomenclature, ensure our investment framework is consistent with our strategy.\n\nWhen taking investment decisions, we consider six factors, although our decisions may also take other factors into account as appropriate.\n\n## Six factors\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Strategic alignment\n\n## Investment economics\n\nFor all investment cases, we consider whether the investment supports delivery of our strategy, see page 18. And if it involves distinctive capability that bp has, or intends to develop, and whether it adds to an existing 'scale' business within the portfolio or could help us create one.\n\n## Safety and risks\n\nInvestment cases are required to describe risks unique to the project which have a significantly higher probability than usual or have a significantly greater impact (relative to the size of the project) were they to occur.\n\n## Sustainability\n\nAll investment cases are considered against appropriate environmental and sustainability considerations, and sustainability measures, including carbon. Investment cases above defined thresholds for anticipated annual greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from operations must estimate those anticipated GHG emissions and include an associated carbon price in the investment economics.\n\nWe consider investment economics against a range of measures including internal rate of return, net present value, discounted payback, profitability index and investment efficiency, using a set of scenarios for commodity prices, margins and carbon prices (where relevant).\n\nInvestments are considered against stringent differentiated hurdle rates.\n\n- 1. A payback of less than 10 years for all investments in upstream oil, refining and for fuels retail in mature markets; together with an internal rate of return hurdle.\n- 2. A payback of less than 15 years for upstream gas; together with an internal rate of return hurdle.\n- 3. We have a range of sector-specific internal rates of returns of between 10% and 15%. And finally, for renewable power we look for returns of at least 8% to 10% levered.\n\n## Volatility and rateability\n\nEconomic metrics are also considered in the context of the cash flow certainty of the investment assumptions. For example, a high-return deepwater tieback will have less certain and more volatile (oil-price linked) cash flows than a lower return but more certain renewable power project with a long-term power purchase agreement (and a fixed power price).\n\n## Optionality and integration\n\nAll investment cases are requested to quantify the strategic optionality that might be accessed through follow-on activity and regular cross-entity forums enable integration opportunities to be identified. For example, an offshore wind development may provide additional optionality for power offtake and integration into our digital platforms.",

        "page_content": "## Evaluation process\n\nWhen evaluating the consistency of our 2020 new material capex investments \u00ab with the Paris goals, a focus of the evaluation criteria was on their competitiveness and financial robustness as the prices of different forms of energy and products adjust in response to the changing market environment.\n\nFor new material capex investment decisions taken from September 2020, the evaluation used our revised central price assumptions of around $55/bbl for Brent \u00ab and $2.90 per mmBtu for Henry Hub \u00ab gas (2020 $ real), from 2021-2050. It also used our revised central carbon price assumptions, applied to the anticipated operational greenhouse gas emissions associated with the investment, for the period to 2050. These now include a price of $100/teCO 2 in 2030 (2020 $ real), see page 28.\n\n## Quantitative evaluations\n\nTwo quantitative guide levels were considered to inform the evaluation of Paris consistency. As stated in the bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2019, we continue to develop our approach and in 2020 we made a number of improvements, including benchmarking investment economics against our agreed economic investment hurdles; evaluating investments on the revised price assumptions; and setting a lower carbon intensity guide. As our approach matures with experience, we may continue to adjust or supplement these.\n\nOur resource commitment meeting (RCM) evaluates consistency with the Paris goals by considering them against a balanced set of investment criteria, see page 30.\n\nFor each of the investment criteria, a qualitative explanation of each business case was considered and presented to the RCM or relevant investment committee, as per the description on page 29.\n\nOur new material capex investments are intended to support the delivery of bp's strategy. In-scope investments are defined as:\n\n- New: investment in a new project or extension of an existing project/asset, or share of an entity that is new to bp or a substantial increase in bp's share.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Investment economics\n\nThe calculation of internal rate of return (IRR) and discounted payback uses the 'central-price' case for commodity prices and margins and the 'central' carbon price. Economic indicators are then benchmarked against the economic hurdles, see page 30. As a guide, we would normally target a minimum threshold of greater than 1.0x on this basis.\n\nFor clarity, Paris-consistency evaluations for investment decisions made before September 2020 were measured against the previous long-term price assumptions and against the profitability index (PI) measure. For details, see the bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2019 , page 22.\n\n- Material: more than $250 million capital investment.\n- Capital expenditure: includes organic and inorganic.\n\n2020 was an exceptional year, and one aspect of bp's response was to reduce our planned capital expenditure, see page 9. As a result, there were only three new material capex investments unusually low, and less than half the number in 2019. So bp decided to voluntarily conduct and disclose Paris-consistency evaluations for the four largest new capex investments which fell below our materiality threshold. We do not expect to disclose such evaluations of nonmaterial investments in future years. To maintain consistency of approach, the conduct of these evaluations was delegated to a subset of the RCM.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Environment and sustainability\n\nWhere appropriate, we measure the operational carbon intensity \u00ab of the investment relative to that of the 2020 portfolio average for the segment or the related business activity (upstream, refining, offshore wind). As a guide, we would normally target a ratio of less than 100%, meaning that the investment is expected to reduce the average operational carbon intensity of that portfolio.\n\nThe potential impact of new material capex investments on bp's greenhouse gas emission targets is a further consideration.\n\nThere may be instances when new material capex investments are evaluated as consistent with the Paris goals despite either or both of these guide levels not being met.",

Each of these investments was evaluated to be consistent with the Paris goals.\n\nSimilarly, the four additional (non-material) new capex investments in 2020, referred to on page 33, also met the evaluation guides, with the exception of one investment not meeting the guide level for carbon intensity. This investment was evaluated to be consistent with the Paris goals, based on the role liquefied natural gas (LNG) plays in the energy transition, especially in the Asia Pacific region in which the project is located, and the strength of the investment economics - with a short payback period, delivering short-cycle cash returns and reducing the timeframe during which the investment would be exposed to uncertainties associated with Paris-consistent pathways.\n\nIn addition, when this investment is benchmarked on the carbon intensity measure against other LNG projects, instead of the upstream portfolio average, it benchmarks towards the low end of the range.\n\nEach of the four additional capex investments was evaluated to be consistent with the Paris goals.\n\n## The respective rankings of investment performance against each of the quantitative guide levels\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 2 For one of the investments the operational carbon intensity was not calculated due to the nature of these investments.

This may in part be a consequence of decreased activity during the COVID-19 pandemic, but we believe that other, more intentional, factors are also involved, such as our deepening focus on safety leadership, human performance, and the effectiveness of core safety processes, such as permit-to-work.\n\n## Reported recordable injury frequency a\n\nReported recordable injury frequency (RIF) measures the number of reported work-related employee and contractor incidents that result in a fatality or injury per 200,000 hours worked.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2020 performance\n\nWe have seen a decrease in RIF compared with 2019 and maintain our focus to drive zero incidents. Since 2015, RIF rates have decreased around 46%.\n\n- a  This represents reported incidents occurring within bp's operational HSSE reporting boundary. That boundary includes bp's own operated facilities and certain other locations or situations.\n\n## Sustainable operations\n\n## Greenhouse gas emissions (MtCO 2 e)\n\nWe provide data on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions material to our business on a carbon dioxide-equivalent basis. This particular KPI comprises Scope 1 (direct) emissions of CO 2 and methane, for 100% emissions from subsidiaries \u00ab and the percentage of emissions equivalent to our share of joint arrangements \u00ab and associates \u00ab , other than bp's share of Rosneft.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|   2020 |   41.3 |\n|--------|--------|\n|   2019 |   46   |\n|   2018 |   46.5 |\n|   2017 |   49.4 |\n|   2016 |   50.1 |\n\n## 2020 performance\n\nOur Scope 1 (direct) equity share emissions decreased by 4.7MtCO 2 e to 41.3MtCO 2 e in 2020 (46.0MtCO 2 e in 2019). The reduction was associated with a number of factors such as divestments, including of our Alaska operations, sustainable emissions reductions, turnarounds, and the impact of COVID-19 on demand.\n\n## Sustainable GHG emissions reductions (MtCO 2 e)\n\nThis measure includes actions taken by our businesses to improve energy efficiency and reduce methane emissions and flaring - all leading to ongoing, quantifiable GHG reductions. These refer to the GHG emissions on an operational control basis b that would have occurred had we not made the change i.e. they could be absolute in nature or underlying.

This applies to methane emissions within our operational control boundary, where we have the highest degree of control. Methane emissions from non-producing activities, such as exploration drilling, are excluded. In 2020 we set an intensity target of 0.20% by 2025, using a measurement approach.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2020 performance\n\nOur methane intensity in 2020 was 0.12%, an improvement from 0.14% in 2019.\n\n## Upstream unit production costs ($/boe)\n\nThe upstream unit production cost is calculated as production cost divided by units of production. Production cost does not include ad valorem and severance taxes. Units of production are barrels for liquids and thousands of cubic feet for gas. Amounts disclosed are for bp subsidiaries only and do not include bp's share of equity-accounted entities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2020 performance\n\nLower production costs compared with 2019 were mainly due to improved efficiency in our operations and divestment impacts.\n\n## 2020 performance\n\nWe started up four major projects in India, Oman, the UK and US.\n\n## Downstream refining availability\n\n(%)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRefining availability represents Solomon Associates' operational availability for bp-operated refineries. The measure shows the percentage of the year that a unit is available for processing after deducting the time spent on turnaround activity and all mechanical, process and regulatory downtime.\n\nRefining availability is an important indicator of the operational performance of our downstream businesses.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2020 performance\n\nRefining availability was higher, reflecting continued strong operational performance in our portfolio. This performance is underpinned by our global reliability programmes.\n\n## Major project delivery\n\nWe monitor the progress of our major projects to gauge whether we are delivering our core pipeline of projects under construction on time.\n\nProjects take many years to complete, requiring differing amounts of resource, so a smooth or increasing trend should not be anticipated.\n\nMajor projects are defined as those with a bp net investment of at least $250 million, or considered to be of strategic importance to bp, or of a high degree of complexity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Upstream plant reliability (%)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nbp-operated upstream plant reliability is calculated taking 100% less the ratio of total unplanned plant deferrals divided by installed production capacity. Unplanned plant deferrals are associated with the topside plant and, where applicable, the subsea equipment (excluding wells and reservoir). Unplanned plant deferrals include breakdowns, which does not include Gulf of Mexico weather-related downtime.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2020 performance\n\nOperations were strong in 2020 with plant reliability remaining at 94%.\n\n## Diversity and inclusion d (%)\n\nEach year we report the percentage of women and individuals from countries other than the UK and the US among bp's group leaders.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2020 performance\n\nBoth measures increased. As a global business we are committed to increasing the diversity of our workforce and leadership.\n\n- d  Relates to bp employees.",

Adjusting for inventory holding losses, replacement cost (RC) loss was $18.1 billion, compared with a profit of $3.5 billion in 2019.\n\nAfter adjusting RC loss for a net charge for non-operating items of $12.2 billion and net adverse fair value accounting effects of $0.2 billion (both on a post-tax basis), underlying RC loss for the year ended 31 December 2020 was $5.7 billion. The result reflected lower oil and gas prices, significant exploration write-offs and lower refining margins and depressed demand.\n\nThe profit for the year ended 31 December 2019 attributable to bp shareholders was $4.0 billion, excluding inventory holding gains, RC profit was $3.5 billion.

The decrease was predominantly due to lower oil and gas prices in the Upstream segment and a significantly weaker environment in the Downstream segment.\n\n## Non-operating items\n\nIn 2020 the net charge for non-operating items was $12.2 billion, mainly related to impairment charges, a gain on the disposal of our petrochemicals business, certain exploration write-offs (reported within the 'other' category), and restructuring costs associated with the reinvent bp programme. The impairment charges mainly relate to producing assets and principally arose as a result of changes to the group's oil and gas price assumptions. Impairment charges also include amounts relating to the disposal of the group's interests in its Alaska business.",

The decrease mainly reflects the loss in 2020. The effective tax rate (ETR) on the loss for the year in 2020 was impacted by the impairment charges and exploration write-offs. The ETRs for 2020 and 2019 were also impacted by various other one-off items.\n\nAdjusting for inventory holding impacts, non-operating items and fair value accounting effects, the underlying ETR in 2020 was lower than in 2019, mainly reflecting the exploration write-offs with a limited deferred tax benefit and the reassessment of deferred tax asset recognition. The underlying ETR for 2021 is expected to be higher than 40% but is sensitive to the impact that volatility in the current environment may have on the geographical mix of the group's profits and losses. Underlying ETR is a non-GAAP measure.

At 31 December 2020, bp reported Upstream, Downstream, Rosneft and Other businesses and corporate.\n\nUpstream's activities included oil and natural gas exploration, field development and production; midstream transportation, storage and processing; and the marketing and trading of natural gas, including liquefied natural gas (LNG), together with power and natural gas liquids (NGLs). For further details of Upstream's activities during the year see page 308.\n\nDownstream's activities covered convenience and mobility offers, including next-gen mobility to our customers. It also included the refining, manufacturing, marketing, transportation, and supply and trading of crude oil, petroleum, lubricants and petrochemicals products.\n\nThe Rosneft segment result includes equityaccounted earnings arising from bp's interest in Rosneft.\n\nOther businesses and corporate comprised the biofuels and wind businesses, the group's shipping and treasury functions, and corporate activities worldwide.\n\nIn February 2020 bp announced plans for a future reorganization of the group's operating segments.

This primarily relates to impairments associated with revisions to the long-term price assumptions. See Financial statements - Note 5 for further information. Fair value accounting effects had an adverse impact of $738 million relative to management's view of performance.\n\nThe 2019 result included a net non-operating charge of $6,947 million, primarily related to impairment charges arising from disposal transactions. Fair value accounting effects had a favourable impact of $706 million relative to management's view of performance.\n\nAfter adjusting for non-operating items and fair value accounting effects, the underlying RC result before interest and tax was lower in 2020 compared with 2019. This primarily reflected lower liquids and gas realizations and the impact of writing down certain exploration intangible carrying values.\n\n## Downstream\n\nSales and other operating revenues in 2020 were lower than in 2019, mainly due to lower crude and product prices and the demand impact of COVID-19.\n\nRC profit before interest and tax for 2020 included a net non-operating gain of $479 million. The gain reflected a profit of $2.3 billion on the sale of our petrochemicals business, which was partially offset by restructuring costs and impairments. In addition, fair value accounting effects for 2020 had an adverse impact of $149 million, compared with a favourable impact of $160 million in 2019.\n\nAfter adjusting for non-operating items and fair value accounting effects, underlying RC profit before interest and tax for the year was $3,088 million.\n\nThe fuels business reported a lower underlying RC profit before interest and tax compared with 2019, due to an exceptionally weak refining environment, with COVID-19 restrictions impacting refining utilization and fuel volumes. The 2020 result also reflects a higher contribution from supply and trading.\n\nOur fuels marketing business demonstrated continued resilience, delivering significant profit in 2020, despite COVID-19 - which adversely impacted retail fuel and aviation volumes by 14% and 50% respectively.\n\nRefining loss in 2020 reflects the continued impact of historically low industry margins. Although refining availability \u00ab was strong at 96%, utilization was around 6% lower than 2019, due to the impact of COVID-19 on demand. These factors were partially offset by a lower level of turnaround activity and lower costs.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020, we announced plans to cease production at our Kwinana refinery and convert it to an import terminal, helping secure ongoing fuel supply for Western Australia.\n\nWe continued to redefine convenience in 2020, delivering a 6% growth in convenience gross margin \u00ab . We also expanded our retail network by more than 1,400 sites, to a total of 20,300, including more than 1,900 strategic convenience sites \u00ab . And we completed the formation of Jio-bp, our Indian joint venture with Reliance, helping more than double the number of retail sites in growth markets \u00ab , see page 24.\n\nWe also progressed our electrification agenda, growing our network to 10,100 bp and joint venture operated electric vehicle charge points \u00ab , see Our strategy on page 15.\n\nThe lubricants business reported a lower underlying RC profit before interest and tax compared with 2019 and this reflected significant COVID-19 demand impacts, with volumes 15% lower for the year. We continued to expand our service offer in 2020, growing the number of Castrol branded independent workshops by more than 4,000 to over 28,000 globally.\n\nThe petrochemicals business reported a lower underlying RC profit before interest and tax compared with 2019, reflecting the impact of COVID-19 on demand and a significantly weaker margin environment. In December we completed the divestment of bp's petrochemicals business to INEOS for a total consideration of $5 billion. Final payments, totalling $1 billion, were received in February 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information see Additional information for Downstream on page 318.\n\n## Rosneft\n\nRC loss before interest and tax for 2020 and RC profit before interest and tax for 2019 for the segment included a non-operating charge of $205 million for 2020 and $103 million for 2019.\n\nAfter adjusting for non-operating items, the underlying RC profit before interest and tax in 2020 primarily reflected lower oil prices and unfavourable foreign exchange and adverse duty lag effects compared with 2019 underlying profit.\n\nFinancial and operating performance for 2020 also reflected the increased average economic interest that bp holds in Rosneft as a result of Rosneft's share buyback programme and the transaction to sell Rosneft's business in Venezuela in exchange for its own shares, which completed in April 2020.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information see Additional information for Rosneft on page 320.\n\n## Other businesses and corporate\n\nRC loss before interest and tax for the year ended 31 December 2020 was $683 million (2019 $2,771 million). The 2020 result included a net charge for non-operating items of $318 million, primarily relating to Gulf of Mexico oil spill related costs of $255 million and restructuring costs, partly offset by a gain on disposal (non-operating items in 2019 $1,491 million). In addition, fair value accounting effects had a favourable impact of $675 million.\n\nAfter adjusting for non-operating items and fair value accounting effects, the underlying RC loss before interest and tax for the year ended 31 December 2020 was $1,040 million (2019 $1,280 million). This result mainly reflected an uplift in valuation of a venture investment of $284 million.\n\n## Outlook for 2021\n\n- From the oil supply side, limited growth from non-OPEC+ countries coupled with active market management from OPEC+ means that for 2021 we anticipate a normalization of the currently high inventory levels.\n- Oil demand is anticipated to recover in 2021. The speed and degree of the rebound depends on governments' policies and individuals' self-imposed actions as vaccine distribution proceeds.",

        "page_content": "## Group performance continued\n\n- Oil prices have risen since the end of October, supported by vaccine rollout programmes and continued active supply management by OPEC+ countries. Prices are expected to remain subject to the decisions of OPEC+, confidence in efforts to manage the rollout of vaccination and further virus control measures.\n- We expect the US gas market to tighten in 2021 as supply declines and demand for LNG exports recovers. The current tightness on global LNG markets and higher US gas prices will lift other regional gas prices.\n- US gas markets are likely to benefit from lower production and a recovery in international LNG demand driven by demand in Asia.\n- In Downstream we expect the outlook for the first part of the year to remain challenged due to COVID-19, but to improve. While COVID-19 has had material impacts at the start of the year, with increased restrictions resulting in lower product demand, we expect this uncertainty to improve subject to the successful rollout of vaccination and virus control measures. Industry refining margins and utilization continue to remain restrained by uncertainty about the pace of demand recovery. The weak margin environment combined with continued capacity additions in developing markets has prompted a raft of third-party closure announcements. However, these closures are unlikely to be sufficient to see a sustained rebound in margins to pre-COVID levels in 2021.\n- Full-year 2021 underlying production \u00ab is expected to be slightly higher than 2020 due to the ramp-up of major projects \u00ab , primarily in gas regions, partly offset by the impacts of reduced capital investment and decline in lower-margin gas assets. Reported production is expected to be lower due to the impact of the ongoing divestment programme.\n- Other businesses and corporate charges for 2021, excluding non-operating items, fair value accounting effects and foreign exchange volatility impact, are expected to be $1.2-1.4 billion although the quarterly charge may vary quarter to quarter.\n\n## Cash flow and net debt information\n\n|                                                                    | 2020     | 2019     | 2018     |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|----------|\n| Operating cash flow excluding Gulf of Mexico oil spill  payments a | 13,770   | 28,199   | 26,091   |\n| Operating cash flow                                                | 12,162   | 25,770   | 22,873   |\n| Net cash used in investing activities                              | (7,858)  | (16,974) | (21,571) |\n| Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities                | 3,956    | (8,817)  | (4,079)  |\n| Cash and cash equivalents at end of year                           | 31,111   | 22,472   | 22,468   |\n| Capital expenditure \u00ab                                              |          |          |          |\n| Organic capital expenditure \u00ab                                      | (12,034) | (15,238) | (15,140) |\n| Inorganic capital expenditure \u00ab                                    | (2,021)  | (4,183)  | (9,948)  |\n|                                                                    | (14,055) | (19,421) | (25,088) |\n| Divestment and other proceeds                                      |          |          |          |\n| Divestment proceeds \u00ab                                              | 5,480    | 2,201    | 2,851    |\n| Other proceeds                                                     | 1,106    | 566      | 666      |\n|                                                                    | 6,586    | 2,767    | 3,517    |\n| Debt                                                               |          |          |          |\n| Finance debt                                                       | 72,664   | 67,724   | 65,132   |\n| Net debt \u00ab                                                         | 38,941   | 45,442   | 43,477   |\n| Finance debt ratio \u00ab  (%)                                          | 45.9%    | 40.2%    | 39.1%    |\n| Gearing \u00ab  (%)                                                     | 31.3%    | 31.1%    | 30.0%    |\n| Gearing including leases \u00ab  (%)                                    | 36.0%    | 35.3%    | NA       |\n\n$ million\n\n## Operating cash flow\n\nOperating cash flow for the year ended 31 December 2020 was $12.2 billion, $13.6 billion lower than 2019. Operating cash flow in 2020 reflects $1.8 billion of pre-tax cash outflows related to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill. Compared with 2019, operating cash flows in 2020 reflected lower oil and gas realizations, lower refining margins and lower fuels volumes partly offset by lower tax payments and lower working capital \u00ab build.\n\nMovements in working capital adversely impacted cash flow in the year by $0.1 billion, including an adverse impact on working capital from the Gulf of Mexico oil spill of $1.6 billion. Other working capital effects, principally a decrease in inventory and other current and non-current assets partially offset by a decrease in other current and non-current liabilities, had a favourable effect of $1.5 billion. bp actively manages its working capital balances to optimize and reduce volatility in cash flow.\n\nOperating cash flow for the year ended 31 December 2019 was $25.8 billion, $2.9 billion higher than 2018. Operating cash flow in 2019 reflected $2.7 billion of pre-tax cash outflows related to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill. Compared with 2018, operating cash flows in 2019 also reflected the favourable effect of an estimated $2.0 billion of lease payments being classified as financing cash flows from 1 January 2019 following the implementation of IFRS 16.\n\nMovements in working capital adversely impacted cash flow in the year by $2.9 billion, including an adverse impact on working capital from the Gulf of Mexico oil spill of $2.6 billion.",

        "page_content": "## Net cash used in investing activities\n\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended 31 December 2020 decreased by $9.1 billion compared with 2019.\n\nThe decrease mainly reflected lower capital expenditure, particularly due to payments of $3.5 billion in 2019 for the acquisition of unconventional onshore US oil and gas assets from BHP, and $3.9 billion of disposal proceeds from the petrochemicals divestment.\n\nTotal capital expenditure for 2020 was $14.1 billion (2019 $19.4 billion), of which organic capital expenditure was $12.0 billion (2019 $15.2 billion) in line with the guidance given in April. Sources of funding are fungible, but the majority of the group's funding requirements for new investment comes from cash generated by existing operations. We expect 2021 total capital expenditure, including organic capital expenditure, to be around $13 billion.\n\nTotal divestment and other proceeds for 2020 amounted to $6.6 billion, including $3.9 billion of proceeds from the petrochemicals divestment and $1.1 billion other proceeds. Other proceeds represented a loan repayment relating to the TANAP pipeline refinancing; and proceeds in relation to the sale of interests in bp's retail property portfolio in the UK and New Zealand. Total divestment and other proceeds for 2019 amounted to $2.8 billion, including $0.6 billion received in relation to the sale of an interest in bp's retail property portfolio in Australia. The proceeds from the UK, New Zealand and Australia property transactions are reported within financing activities in the group cash flow statement.\n\nbp has completed or agreed transactions for over half of its target of $25 billion in proceeds by 2025. bp expects proceeds from divestments and other disposals of $4-6 billion in 2021, weighted towards the second half.\n\n## Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended 31 December 2020 was $4.0 billion, compared with net cash used of $8.8 billion in 2019. This was mainly due to the issue of perpetual hybrid bonds with a US$ equivalent value of $11.9 billion.\n\ngroup's activities see Financial and capital resources on page 306.\n\n## Group reserves and production (including Rosneft segment) a\n\n|                                                  | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Estimated net proved reserves (net of royalties) |        |        |        |\n| Liquids (mmb)                                    | 10,661 | 11,478 | 11,456 |\n| Natural gas (bcf)                                | 42,467 | 45,601 | 49,239 |\n| Total hydrocarbons (mmboe)                       | 17,982 | 19,341 | 19,945 |\n| Of which:                                        |        |        |        |\n| Equity-accounted entities b                      | 10,100 | 9,965  | 9,757  |\n| Production (net of royalties)                    |        |        |        |\n| Liquids (mb/d)                                   | 2,106  | 2,211  | 2,191  |\n| Natural gas (mmcf/d)                             | 7,929  | 9,102  | 8,659  |\n| Total hydrocarbons (mboe/d)                      | 3,473  | 3,781  | 3,683  |\n| Of which:                                        |        |        |        |\n| Subsidiaries                                     | 2,146  | 2,420  | 2,328  |\n| Equity-accounted entities c                      | 1,326  | 1,360  | 1,355  |\n\nTotal dividends distributed to shareholders in 2020 were 31.5 cents per share, 9.5 cents lower than 2019. This amounted to a total distribution to shareholders of $6.3 billion in 2020. In 2019 the total distribution to shareholders was $8.3 billion, of which shareholders elected to receive $1.4 billion in shares under the scrip dividend programme. The board decided not to offer a scrip dividend alternative in respect of the 2020 dividends.\n\n## Debt\n\nFinance debt at the end of 2020 increased by $4.9 billion from the end of 2019. The finance debt ratio at the end of 2020 increased to 45.9% from 40.2% at the end of 2019. Net debt at the end of 2020 decreased by $6.5 billion from the 2019 year-end position. Gearing at the end of 2020 increased to 31.3% from 31.1%, reflecting significant impairments and exploration writeoffs, offset by the hybrid bond issue in June 2020. Net debt and gearing are non-GAAP measures.

Natural gas represented about 41% (47% for subsidiaries and 36% for equity-accounted entities) of these reserves. The change includes a net decrease from acquisitions and disposals of 1,069mmboe (decrease of 1,072mmboe within our subsidiaries and increase of 3mmboe within our equity-accounted entities). Acquisition and divestment activity occurred in our equity-accounted entities in Russia, and divestment activity in our subsidiaries in the US including Alaska.\n\nTotal hydrocarbon production for the group was 8% lower compared with 2019. The decrease comprised an 11% decrease (6% decrease for liquids and 16% decrease for gas) for subsidiaries and a 2% decrease (4% decrease for liquids and 2% increase for gas) for equity-accounted entities.",

When talking about bp becoming a net zero company by 2050, or sooner, in the context of our new ambition and aims 1 and 2, this means achieving a balance between (a) the relevant Scope 1 and 2 emissions associated with our operations (aim 1), or Scope 3 emissions associated with carbon in bp's net share of production of oil and gas excluding Rosneft (aim 2), and (b) the total of applicable deductions from activities such as sinks, for example carbon capture, use and storage (CCUS) and land carbon projects, which we allow for in our methodology.\n\n## Our aim 1 is to be net zero across our entire operations on an absolute basis by 2050 or sooner.\n\nThis aim relates to our Scope 1 (from running the assets within our operational control boundary) and Scope 2 (associated with producing the electricity, heating and cooling that is bought in to run those operations) GHG emissions.\n\n## Our performance in 2020\n\nOur combined Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, covered by aim 1, decreased by 16% from 54.4MteCO 2 e in 2019 to 45.5MteCO 2 e in 2020.\n\nScope 1 (direct) emissions covered by aim 1 decreased by 15% to 41.7MteCO 2 e in 2020, from 49.2MteCO 2 e in 2019. Of those Scope 1 emissions, 39.8MteCO 2 e were from CO 2 and 1.9MteCO 2 e from methane.\n\nScope 2 (indirect) emissions decreased by 1.4MteCO 2 e, to 3.8Mte CO 2 e, a 27% reduction compared to 2019. Decreases resulted from SERs, reduced energy requirement following COVID-19 demand reduction and also include a 1MteCO 2 e reduction in reported emissions from our Whiting refinery, which in 2020 put an agreement in place to purchase electricity from our Whiting clean energy facility.\n\nOur aim 2 is to be net zero on an absolute basis across the carbon in our upstream oil and gas production \u00ab by 2050 or sooner.\n\nThis is our Scope 3 aim and is on a bp equity share basis excluding Rosneft. Emissions are broadly equivalent to the GHG Protocol, Scope 3, category 11 g , with the specific scope of upstream production volumes.\n\n## Our performance in 2020\n\nThe estimated emissions from the carbon in our Upstream oil and gas production were equivalent to 328MteCO 2 e in 2020, a reduction of approximately 9% compared to 361MteCO 2 e b in 2019.\n\n- a  Reductions against the 2019 baseline.\n- b  The baseline year for our aims 1, 2 and 3 is 2019. Following publication of the bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2019 , some data improvements related to the reported 2019 figures for aims 2 and 3 were identified. Although these are not considered to be material, for each of aims 2 and 3 the 2019 figure has been adjusted.\n- c  The 2020 methane intensity is calculated using existing methodology and, while it reflects progress in reducing methane emissions, will not directly correlate with progress towards delivering the 2025 target under aim 4.\n- d  We aim to have this in place by end of 2023.\n- e  Aim 5 non-oil and gas activities included a partial acquisition payment for the US offshore wind partnership with Equinor, our investments in electrification and advanced mobility, and investment into activities through bp ventures and Launchpad.\n- f  Article 4.1 of the Paris Agreement: In order to achieve the long-term temperature goal set out in Article 2, Parties aim to reach global peaking of greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible, recognizing that peaking will take longer for developing country parties, and to undertake rapid reductions thereafter in accordance with best available science, so as to achieve a balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases in the second half of this century, on the basis of equity, and in the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty.\n- g See ghgprotocol.org for the full list of categories.",

This is our key metric for tracking annual reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from energy efficiency savings and direct GHG emissions. We set annual internal targets for the delivery of SERs across bp.\n\nIn 2020 we delivered 1MteCO 2 e of SERs. These included reductions in flaring, direct methane emissions and energy efficiency savings.\n\nFor example, our operations in the AGT region reduced fuel use for water injection pumps through energy efficiency optimization resulting in a 55kteCO 2 e reduction of Scope 1 emissions. Further SERs include those delivered by our US onshore operations, bpx energy of over 245kteCO 2 e - driving operational efficiencies and substantively reducing our methane emissions profile. Our assets in the Permian region delivered 94kteCO 2 e of SERs. The largest of these projects was construction and delivery of a centralized facility and electrification of certain operations combined with use of renewable electricity.\n\n## bp equity share bg\n\nOur Scope 1 (direct) equity share emissions decreased by 4.7MtCO 2 e to 41.3MtCO 2 e in 2020 (46.0MtCO 2 e in 2019). The reduction was associated with a number of factors such as divestments, including of our Alaska operations, turnarounds, and the impact of COVID-19 on demand.\n\n|                              |   2020 |   2019 |   2018 |\n|------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Scope 1 (direct) emissions   |   41.3 |   46   |   46.5 |\n| Scope 2 (indirect) emissions |    4.2 |    5.7 |    5.7 |\n| Total                        |   45.5 |   51.7 |   52.2 |\n\n- a  The baseline year for our aims 1, 2 and 3 is 2019.

Although these are not considered to be material, for each of aims 2 and 3 the 2019 figure has been adjusted.\n- b Our approach to reporting GHG emissions broadly follows the IPIECA/API/IOGP Petroleum Industry Guidelines for Reporting GHG Emissions. We calculate CO 2 emissions based on the fuel consumption and fuel properties for major sources. We report CO 2 and methane. We do not include nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulphur hexafluoride as they are not material to our operations and it is not practical to collect this data.\n- c  Operational control data comprises 100% of emissions from activities operated by bp, going beyond the IPIECA guidelines by including emissions from certain other activities such as contracted drilling activities.",

Marketed gas was 3,075bcf in 2020. This reduction in methane intensity was due to the Alaska and bpx energy divestments in 2020 and from SER projects and flaring reductions, the largest reductions being delivered in bpx energy and Angola.\n\n## Our aim 5 is to increase the proportion of investment we make into our non-oil and gas businesses.\n\nOver time, as investment goes up in low and no carbon, we see it going down in oil and gas. We are aiming for up to an eight-fold scaling up of our investment in low carbon energy by 2025 and a ten-fold scaling up by 2030, to around $5 billion a year. In 2020 we invested $750 million, compared to more than $500 million in 2019.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee  page  22 for more on our investment in line with aim 5.\n\n## Five aims to help the world get to net zero\n\n## Our aim 6 is to more actively advocate for policies that support net zero, including carbon pricing.\n\nWe have stopped corporate reputation advertising campaigns and this is enabling us to re-direct resources to promote climate policies.

We will continue to run recruitment campaigns and advertise our products, services and partnerships - although we aim for these to be increasingly low carbon.\n\nWe are involved in advocacy activities related to well-designed policies, primarily carbon pricing in the US, through our support for regional initiatives.\n\n## bp.com/policyandadvocacy\n\n## Our aim 7 is to incentivize our global workforce to deliver on our aims and mobilize them to become advocates for net zero.\n\nWe want to help our employees understand what net zero means and the part they can play through education and training programmes. We want to incentivize employees, which is why in 2019 we linked our annual cash bonus for eligible employees, including the bp leadership team, to sustainable emissions reductions (SERs). We have exceeded targeted delivery of SERs in both 2019 and 2020, though in 2020, bp decided not to pay an annual bonus due to the prevailing economic and financial environment.\n\nIn 2020 for senior leaders we increased emphasis on low carbon, moving from 5% to 30% of senior leaders' equity awards linked to low carbon. And for the bp leadership team, 25% of performancebased pay was linked to delivery of our purpose.\n\nThe measures for the 2021 annual bonus for the wider workforce are aligned to bp's strategy and net zero ambition and tied to a balanced scorecard consisting of safety and sustainability, operations and financial measures.\n\nIn February 2021, we introduced the reinvent bp share award to incentivize our employees in meeting our aims. All employees will receive a one-off grant of either shares or share options that will become available to keep, sell or transfer in the first quarter of 2025.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee the Directors' remuneration report on pages 103-126 for more detail.\n\n## Our aim 8 is to set new expectations for our relationships with trade associations around the globe.\n\nWe belong to associations that offer opportunities to share good practices and collaborate on issues of importance to our sector. We aim for alignment between our policies and those of trade associations that we are a member of but understand that associations' positions reflect a compromise of the assorted views of\n\nthe membership. We will make the case for our views on climate change and we will be transparent where we differ. And where we can't reach alignment, we will be prepared to leave.\n\nWe published our first trade associations review in early 2020, and left three associations where we assessed climate positions as not aligned. Since then, we have made interventions where our views have not aligned - these occurred in the area of carbon pricing with the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers and the Netherlands Employer Association, VNO-NCV.\n\nIn 2021 we intend to publish an update on our relationships with trade associations which will focus on our engagement with five partially aligned associations.\n\n## bp.com/tradeassociations\n\n## Our aim 9 is to be recognized as an industry leader for the transparency of our reporting.\n\nOn 12 February 2020, we declared our support for the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). We intend to work constructively with the TCFD and others - such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board - to develop good practices and standards for transparency.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee pages 52-55 for our expanded TCFD disclosures.\n\n## Our aim 10 is to launch a new team to create integrated clean energy and mobility solutions.\n\nWe launched our regions, cities and solutions team in 2020. It will help countries, cities and corporations around the world decarbonize.\n\nWe have announced our aim to partner with 10-15 cities globally over the next decade to help them achieve their climate goals. And we will work with three industrial sectors - high tech and consumer products, heavy transport and heavy industries - as they shape their energy transition journeys.\n\nIn 2020 we've formed strategic partnerships with Aberdeen, Houston and Microsoft. We've also agreed to provide additional renewable energy to Amazon, helping them toward their ambition to decarbonize.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## bp.com/RCS",

This energy must be delivered in affordable and reliable ways, but it must also be lower carbon.\n\n## Climate-related financial disclosures\n\nWe support the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), which was established by the Financial Stability Board with the aim of improving the reporting of climate-related risks and opportunities. We announced in 2020 that we intend to work constructively with the TCFD, and others, to develop good practices and standards for transparency. Our latest reporting provides information supporting the TCFD's recommended disclosures.\n\nWe responded to the FCA consultation on climate-related financial disclosures and welcome the new listing rule.\n\n## Governance\n\nTCFD recommendation: Disclose the organization's governance around climaterelated issues and opportunities.\n\nFrom 1 January 2021, bp implemented a new, simplified system of sustainability governance encompassing the board, its associated committees and the leadership team. This structure will enhance oversight of bp's new sustainability frame, which focuses on three areas: net zero, people and planet. The remit of the board and its committees under our new governance framework is set out on page 88. Terms of reference for the board and its committees are available at bp.com/governance .\n\n## Recommended disclosure:\n\n- a. Describe the board's oversight of climaterelated risks and opportunities.\n\nThe role of the board is to promote bp's sustainable success for the benefit of its members, generating value for shareholders while having regard to the interests of our other stakeholders, the impact of our operations on the communities where we operate and the environment. In performing this role, the board is responsible for oversight of the overall conduct of the group's business, which extends to setting our strategy and approach to the energy transition.\n\nThe board and its associated committees, including the safety and sustainability, audit, people and governance and remuneration committees, where appropriate, have oversight of climate-related matters, which include climate risks and opportunities. They are updated on these matters frequently, a process which is managed by our company secretary's office, which works closely with teams in bp to develop materials that assist the board or committee to discharge its responsibilities, including those related to climate.\n\nIn 2020 these processes included formal analysis of bp's net zero ambition and aims, briefings with subject matter experts, reviews of regulatory correspondence regarding prior year climate disclosures, virtual site visits and the preparation and consideration of corporate reporting documents and AGM materials.\n\nDuring 2020, climate matters were included on the agenda at every board meeting. Agendas are now structured along four distinct pillars: strategy, performance, people and governance.\n\n- The safety and sustainability committee's remit was extended from the beginning of 2020 to provide oversight of the effectiveness of the implementation of bp's sustainability frame. This includes reviewing that appropriate progress is being made against our net zero, people and planet aims. The committee will continue to cover existing sustainability-related activities, including the oversight of operational sustainability risks.\n- The role of the audit committee is to monitor the effectiveness of bp's financial reporting, systems of internal control and risk management, and the integrity of bp's external and internal audit processes. In fulfilling this purpose, the committee has oversight of financial disclosure, including TCFD reporting.\n- The role of the remuneration committee is to recommend to the board the remuneration policy for executive directors and the leadership team. It also reviews workforce remuneration and monitors related policies, satisfying itself that incentives and rewards are aligned to bp's strategy, culture and long-term sustainable success. This includes climaterelated matters.\n- The role of the people and governance committee (formerly the nomination and governance committee) is to oversee a diverse succession pipeline and to review workforce policies and practices, monitoring their consistency with bp's purpose, strategy and values. This helps ensure that we have the right people to deliver our strategy and net zero ambition.\n\n## Pursuing a strategy consistent with the Paris goals\n\nStrategy has been the core focus of every board meeting since the beginning of 2019. Throughout 2020 the board worked closely with the leadership team in developing our new strategy. In August 2020 the chairman outlined the key judgements the board had applied to their decision making regarding bp's strategy, financial frame and investor proposition. As a result, the board considers that the strategy allows us to be flexible to adapt to market changes and scenarios to remain consistent with the Paris goals.\n\n## The role of the board in evaluating material capex consistency with Paris\n\nThe board assesses the impact of portfolio changes, such as strategic acquisitions and the allocation of capital. It also considers specific investment cases which have been approved by the resource commitment meeting, see page 29.",

Describe management's role in assessing and managing climate-related risks and opportunities.\n\nThe assessment and management of climaterelated matters is embedded across bp at various levels and delegated authority flows down from the board, see page 29.\n\nFrom 1 January 2021, a new executive level governance forum, the group sustainability committee, will provide internal oversight of bp's progress against the aims and objectives in the sustainability frame, including net zero.\n\nThis group is chaired by the EVP strategy & sustainability (S&S) and comprises members of the bp leadership team. The group sustainability committee plans to meet on a quarterly basis to review progress within entities against the sustainability frame and decide on critical strategic positions related to sustainability that present risks or opportunities to delivery. The EVP S&S will report to the main board and committees as required.\n\nThe group operational risk committee will continue to provide oversight of safety and operational risk management performance for the group, where appropriate, which includes sustainability-related risks such as modern slavery and severe weather.\n\n## Climate governance: management of climate-related matters\n\nAs at 1 January 2021\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nClimate-related matters were discussed at each of the leadership team meetings in 2020, including the development of bp's net zero ambition and aims ahead of discussion with the board.\n\nThe leadership team is supported by bp's senior-level leadership and their respective teams, with dedicated business and functional expertise focused on climate-related matters. This includes our health, safety, environment and carbon, strategy and sustainability and group policy and economics teams.\n\nAlignment between group, business and functional leaders is fostered through crossfunctional bodies.",

Describe the climate-related risk and opportunities that the organization has identified over the short, medium, and long term.\n- b. The impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the organization's businesses, strategy, and financial planning.\n- c. The resilience of the organization's strategy, taking into consideration different climaterelated scenarios, including a 2\u00b0C or lower scenario.\n\nOur strategy to become an Integrated Energy Company, and our net zero ambition and aims are set out on pages 2-3, 15 and 49. In developing this strategy, the board and leadership team consider a wide range of opportunities and risks across three discrete time horizons:\n\n- Short term (to 2025): the next five years are defined by detailed business and financial plans, which are performance managed in delivery of our 2025 targets.\n- Medium term (to 2030): looking out 10 years enables us to think beyond the short-term to consider signposts and milestones towards the longer-term scenarios, enabling us to adjust course if required.\n- Long term (to 2050): recognizing the wide range of uncertainties, we use a scenario planning approach to help us explore possible pathways for the energy transition over the next 30 years, as the world moves towards net zero. This includes consideration of changes in policy, societal preferences, economic growth and technological progress. For more detail on our approach and how it informs our strategy, see page 11.\n\nIn the bp Energy Outlook 2020 we describe the potential implications of climate change and the energy transition on both primary energy demand and the energy system, through three long-term scenarios: Rapid, Net Zero and Business-as-usual.\n\nThese are summarized on page 11 and further analysis by country and region, energy sector and fuel type can be found in the bp Energy Outlook , available at bp.com/energyoutlook .\n\nThe transition to a lower carbon economy presents both risks and significant business opportunities for bp. Climate-related physical and transition risks are managed and reported as part of our group-wide risk management process described on pages 64-66.\n\nClimate-related risks and opportunities associated with the energy transition were taken into consideration alongside other inputs in developing our new ambition, aims and strategy. For more information about how our new organizational model and financial reporting segments see pages 36-38. For more on our new financial frame see page 22.\n\n## Strategic resilience\n\nWe believe our strategy is resilient to the range of energy transition pathways and scenarios including Paris, see page 11.\n\nFor more information on our financial resilience, including our revised long-term price assumptions and impairment testing, see page 28. For information on the resilience of our individual investments, including our governance structure and investment process, see page 29.\n\nOur strategy is validated annually by the board to ensure it remains relevant and resilient, as part of our standard governance processes. Elements of the strategy may be refreshed earlier if there are significant changes in external or internal environment.\n\n## Risk management\n\nTCFD recommendation: Disclose how the organization identifies, assesses and manages climate-related risks.\n\n## Recommended disclosure:\n\n- a. Describe the organization's processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks.\n\nbp's risk management system, described on page 64, is designed to address all types of risks including our principal risks and uncertainties described in Risk factors on page 67.\n\nAs part of this system our operating businesses, integrators and enablers (see page 36) are responsible for identifying, assessing, managing, and monitoring risks associated with their business area. Risks are assessed in line with bp's risk management policy and this includes an impact and likelihood assessment which supports relative prioritization.\n\nClimate-related risks are classified in alignment with TCFD's description of physical and transition risks:\n\n- Physical risks - risks related to the physical impacts of climate change including eventdriven risks such as changes in the severity and/or frequency of extreme weather events.\n- Transition risks - risks related to the transition to a lower carbon economy including policy and legal, technology, markets and reputational risks.\n\nThe potential material impacts of such climaterelated risks are described in Risk factors, see page 67.\n\n## Recommended disclosure:\n\n- b. Describe the organization's processes for managing climate-related risks.\n- c. Describe how processes for identifying, assessing and managing climate-related risks are integrated into the organization's overall risk management.\n\nRisks which may be identified include potential effects on operations at asset level, performance at business level and developments at regional level from extreme weather or the transition to a lower carbon economy.",

        "page_content": "As part of our annual planning process we review the group's principal risks and uncertainties. Climate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy has been identified as a principal risk, see page 68. This covers various aspects of how risks associated with the energy transition could manifest. Similarly, physical climate-related risks such as extreme weather are covered in our principal risks related to safety and operations.\n\nOur processes for identifying, assessing, managing and monitoring climate-related risks are integrated into bp's risk management policy and the associated risk management procedures.\n\nExamples of how physical and transition climate-related risks are identified, assessed and managed:\n\n- In the North Sea and Gulf of Mexico, regions more prone to severe weather conditions, our\n\noffshore facilities monitor meteorological and oceanographic conditions through collection of measurements at these facilities. These data are collated and periodically compared against the Basis of Design for the facility. If significant differences are observed, then this may trigger an update to the Basis of Design, prompting action to re-assess risks such as structural integrity and station-keeping and if necessary, implement additional risk mitigations. Updates may also occur as a result of other new knowledge, analysis methods and data.\n\n- Transition risks are typically identified and managed by business, regional or central teams. For example, our strategy & sustainability team has identified risks relating to evolving policies across different regions. They work with bp's leadership as well as with both central and regional legal teams, communications & advocacy and external advisors to manage and monitor these risks.\n\n## Metrics and targets\n\nTCFD recommendation: Disclose the metrics and targets used to assess and manage relevant climate-related risks and opportunities where such information is material.\n\nWe present the principal group-wide metrics and targets used to assess and manage climaterelated risks and opportunities below. This also addresses the CA100+ resolution requirement to disclose the company's principal metrics and relevant targets or goals consistent with the Paris goals. We consider this to cover the principal metrics used at group level to help monitor progress on delivery of our strategic consistency with the Paris goals - including our net zero aims.\n\nIn addition, we report on selected energy group illustrative metrics \u00ab .

        "page_content": "## Sustainability continued\n\n## Managing our environmental impacts\n\nOur health, safety, security and environmental (HSSE) goals are: no accidents, no harm to people and no damage to the environment. We work hard to avoid, mitigate and manage our environmental and social impacts over the life of our operations.\n\nThe way our businesses around the world are expected to understand and manage their environmental and social impacts is set out in our operating management system \u00ab (OMS). This includes requirements on engaging with stakeholders who may be affected by our activities.\n\nIn planning our projects, we identify potential impacts from our activities in areas such as land rights, water use and protected areas. We use the results of this analysis to identify actions and mitigation measures and look to implement these in project design, construction and operations.\n\nOur OMS requires each of bp's operating businesses and functions to create and maintain its own OMS handbook, describing how it will carry out its local operating activities. Through self-verification, local business processes are reviewed and areas for improvement are prioritized, allowing focus on delivering safe, reliable and compliant operations.\n\n## Air emissions\n\nWe monitor our air emissions and put measures in place to reduce the potential impact of our activities on local communities. As part of our aim 19 we plan to evaluate the air emissions from our global operating facilities to better understand how they may be affected while advancing our net zero aims for GHG emissions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor  more on air emissions, see the bp Sustainability Report 2020 .\n\n## Caring for our planet\n\nOur sustainability frame includes a focus on making a positive difference to the environment in which we operate. The scope of our care for our planet aims covers biodiversity, water management, nature-based solutions including those that reduce or remove carbon, circularity and sustainable purchasing.\n\n## Water\n\nWe actively manage our freshwater demands in areas of stress and scarcity. Based on analysis using the World Resources Institute Aqueduct Global Water Risk Atlas, four of our 24 major operating sites were located in regions with high or extremely high water stress in 2020, with another four in areas of medium to high water stress. This number reduces to three in regions with high or extremely high water and three in regions of medium to high water stress, if our bp petrochemicals and other 2020 divestments are excluded.\n\nIn 2020 we saw a 2% fall in freshwater withdrawals and a 17% fall in freshwater consumption compared to 2019. This was largely due to the divestment of our Alaskan operation in 2020, the formation of the bp Bunge nonoperated joint venture from bp operated biofuels and biopower businesses at the end of 2019 and a reduction in freshwater use in our bpx energy operations during 2020.\n\nWe have set an aim to be water positive by 2035. We aim to replenish more freshwater than we consume in our operations. We will do this by being more efficient in operational freshwater use and effluent management, and by collaborating with others to replenish freshwater in stressed and scarce catchment areas where we operate.\n\n## Biodiversity\n\nWe have set an aim to enhance biodiversity, focusing on making a positive impact through our actions to restore, maintain and enhance biodiversity where we work.\n\nWe expect that from 2022 all new bp projects in scope will have plans in place aiming to achieve net positive impact (NPI), with a target for 90% of actions to be delivered within five years of project approval a . We also aim to enhance biodiversity at our major operating sites and support biodiversity restoration and sustainable use of natural resource projects in the countries where we have current or growing investments.\n\nIn 2020 we launched our new biodiversity position and focused on sharing it with our stakeholders and putting in place the resources to deliver it. We also started work on defining our NPI methodology with Fauna & Flora International, which we expect to complete at the end of 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nbp.com/biodiversity\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Our aims to care for our planet:\n\n- Aim 16: enhance biodiversity.\n- Aim 17: water positive.\n- Aim 18: championing nature-based solutions.\n- Aim 19: unlock circularity.\n- Aim 20: sustainable purchasing.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nbp.com/planet",

We need a motivated, engaged, and diverse workforce to deliver our purpose and strategy.\n\nWe promote a culture that generates the diversity of thought, approach and ideas needed to reimagine energy and move to a low carbon environment.\n\nThe people and culture committee helps facilitate the CEO's oversight of people related matters. In 2020 the committee discussed key items, including our remuneration policy, progress in our diversity and inclusion programme, employee engagement, workplace, our talent and learning programmes and long-term people priorities. The committee also spent significant time focusing on the reinvent bp programme and related design and selection activities.\n\n## Attraction and retention\n\nWe aim to recruit talented people from diverse backgrounds, and invest in training, development and competitive rewards for all our people. We invest in employee development - with a focus on driving safe, reliable and compliant operations, and on building technical, functional and leadership capability. This includes a range of development opportunities for our people through a mix of on-the-job learning, developmental relationships with mentors, managers and peers, and training delivered face-to-face, virtually and through simulation or e-learning.\n\n## Reinvent bp selection process\n\nAs part of our work to reinvent bp we are running selection processes and considering in-scope employees for roles within the new organizational design, with the outcome that around 10,000 employees will leave bp by early 2022. The selection processes focus on office-based non-operational roles.\n\nWe have put robust steps in place to help ensure that the selection processes are fair and objective and that employees are supported before and after receiving their selection outcome confirmation.\n\nWe have appointed and coached neutral observers to challenge selection decisions and help mitigate unconscious bias and trained line managers on how to undertake fair and meritocratic selection decisions. Where roles are impacted by the selection processes, bp adheres to local laws.\n\nLine managers were given supporting resources for the notification process, including guides, training and scripts on communicating outcomes compassionately. We will continue to provide these resources throughout the remaining selection processes. Employees were provided with supporting resources, including guidance on preparing for change, mental wellbeing, preparing for outcome conversations, and dealing with uncertainty. Employees were encouraged to use the Employee Assistance Programme throughout.\n\nWe also established our myFuture programme, which provides tools, resources and support to help leavers navigate the next stage in their career or phase of life.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- See  pages  36-37 for more on reinvent\n\nbp and our new organizational model.\n\n## Diversity\n\nOur mission is to create an environment in which everyone can bring their best and true selves to work, to reach their potential and support the reinvention of bp.\n\n## Ethnic diversity\n\nIn 2020 we published our UK and US frameworks for action to help combat racial injustice in bp. Both frameworks have three key focus areas: transparency, accountability and talent. Those actions will include: publishing a comprehensive global diversity & inclusion (D&I) report in 2021, embedding expectations and metrics on D&I delivery in our operating plans, reporting externally on our UK ethnicity pay gap annually and doubling our spend with US-based diverse suppliers by 2023.\n\nA total of 30% of our group leaders came from countries other than the UK and the US in 2020 (2019 25%).\n\n## Gender equality\n\nThe gender balance across bp as a whole is improving, with women representing 39% of bp's total population (2019 38%). 38% of our 120 newly-appointed extended leadership team are women and our goal is to increase this.\n\nAt the end of 2020 we had five female directors (2019 5) on our board. Our people and governance committee remains mindful of diversity when considering potential candidates. For more information on the composition of our board, see page 74.\n\n## Workforce by gender\n\n| As at   31 December 2020   | Male   | Female   |   Female  % |\n|----------------------------|--------|----------|-------------|\n| Board directors            | 6      | 5        |          45 |\n| Leadership team            | 8      | 4        |          33 |\n| Group leaders              | 193    | 77       |          29 |\n| Subsidiary  directors      | 1,351  | 284      |          17 |\n| All employees              | 38,826 | 24,719   |          39 |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## bp.com/ukgenderpaygap\n\n## Inclusion\n\nTo promote an inclusive culture we provide leadership training and support employee-run advocacy groups in areas such as gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation and disability. As well as bringing employees together, these groups support our recruitment programmes and provide feedback on the potential impact of policy changes. Each group is sponsored by a senior executive.\n\nWe aim to provide equal opportunity in recruitment, career development, promotion, training and reward for all employees - regardless of ethnicity, national origin, religion, gender, age, sexual orientation, marital status, disability, or any other characteristic protected by applicable laws. Where existing employees become disabled, our policy is to engage and use reasonable accommodations or adjustments to enable continued employment.\n\n## Employee engagement\n\nOur managers hold team and one-to-one meetings with their team members, complemented by formal processes through works councils in parts of Europe. We regularly communicate with employees on factors that affect bp's performance, and seek to maintain constructive relationships with labour unions formally representing our employees.",

        "page_content": "## Sustainability continued\n\nTo understand what our employees think and feel about bp, we run an annual 'Pulse' survey as well as 'Pulse Live' surveys, which enable us to monitor changes in employee sentiment on a weekly basis. The overall employee engagement positivity score in our 2020 annual survey was 64% (2019 65%). Pride in working for bp was 75% (2019 75%).\n\nEmployees participating in the 2020 Pulse survey told us they strongly supported the launch of bp's new purpose and ambition in February and the strategy announcement in August. Initial positivity over the strategy waned in December, with employees expressing anxiety about the reinvent process and economic uncertainty during 2020. Most participants felt confident in bp's approach to managing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Employees also told us we should focus on addressing workload, supporting health and wellbeing and being transparent about the new structure.\n\n## Share ownership\n\nWe continue to encourage employee share ownership and have a number of employee share plans in place. For example, we operate a ShareMatch plan in more than 50 countries, matching bp shares purchased by our employees. We also make annual share awards as part of our total reward package all for senior and mid-level employees globally, and a portion of our more junior professional grade staff.\n\nIn February 2021, we introduced the reinvent bp share award to incentivize our employees in meeting our aims. All employees will receive a one-off grant of either shares or share options that will become available to keep, sell or transfer in the first quarter of 2025.\n\n## Wellbeing and mental health\n\nMental health and physical wellbeing are priorities for us and we recognized that the COVID-19 pandemic had direct and indirect consequences for our employees and their families. We offered access to a range of facilities and services, including support through our well-established Employee Assistance Programme and new interventions, including providing access to the Headspace app to both employees and their partners.\n\nOur annual global physical wellbeing programme had 5,887 participants from 59 countries, with positive feedback on helping keep teams connected and keeping people physically active.\n\nWe continue to improve our systematic management of health data points and sources, to identify where we can target preventive interventions and provide training, support and resources to help improve employee wellbeing and performance.\n\nWe believe wellbeing at work is becoming part of the bp language - a critical part of caring for our people and the communities in which we operate.\n\n## Value to society Improving people's lives\n\nOne of our sustainability frame areas of focus is to improve people's lives. We have set five people aims focusing on where bp can make the biggest difference.\n\nWe want people to benefit from our presence in their local communities, wherever we run projects or operate.\n\nThis includes collaborating with local communities to support sustainable livelihoods and build greater resilience as part of a just transition. Our work on sustainable livelihoods to date supports several of the UN Sustainable Development Goals, in particular on education, health and economic growth as drivers for sustainable livelihoods.\n\n## Human rights\n\nWe believe everyone deserves to be treated with fairness, respect and dignity. At bp we strive to conduct our business in a responsible way, respecting the human rights of our workers and everyone we come into contact with. Our human rights policy and our code of conduct help us do that. See page 63 for information on how we updated our business and human rights policy in 2020.\n\nWe respect internationally recognized human rights as set out in the International Bill of Human Rights and the International Labour Organization's Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, including the core Conventions. These include the rights of our workforce and those living in communities potentially affected by our activities.\n\nWe incorporate the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, which set out how companies should prevent, address and remedy human rights impacts, into our business processes.\n\nWhen working to remediate any impacts on the rights of local communities we are open to co-operating in good faith to agree remedial actions through state-led mechanisms such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development National Contact Points. We recognize the importance of accessible and effective operational-level grievance mechanisms in addressing our impacts.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## bp.com/humanrights\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Our aims to improve people's lives:\n\n- Aim 11: more clean energy.\n- Aim 12: just transition.\n- Aim 13: sustainable livelihoods.\n- Aim 14: greater equity.\n- Aim 15: enhance wellbeing.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nbp.com/people",

In 2020 it remained our first priority throughout our transformation process and the COVID-19 pandemic.

Tragically, we saw one fatality related to illness, rather than a process safety incident, in our operations in 2020. This occurred in December in our Indonesian operations when an employee died following COVID-19 infection contracted on site. We deeply regret this loss and offer our deepest condolences to the employee's family.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee  page  8 for more information.\n\n## Keeping people safe\n\nAll our employees and contractors have the responsibility and the authority to stop unsafe work. Our safety rules guide our workers on staying safe while performing tasks with the potential to cause most harm. The rules are aligned with our operating management system (OMS) and focus on areas such as working at heights, lifting operations and driving safety. We monitor and report on key workforce personal safety metrics in line with industry standards. We include both employees and contractors in our data.\n\nWe have seen improvements in personal safety in 2020 and while this may in part be a consequence of decreased activity during the COVID-19 pandemic, we also believe that other, more intentional factors, are involved - namely the groundwork we have done over the past few years, including our deepening focus on safety leadership, human performance, and the effectiveness of our safety processes such as permit-to-work.\n\nOur recordable injury frequency, reduced from 0.166 in 2019 to 0.132 in 2020.

        "page_content": "## Sustainability continued\n\n## Managing safety\n\nbp-operated businesses are responsible for identifying and managing operating risks and bringing together people with the right skills and competencies to address them. Our safety and operational risk assurance team works alongside bp-operated businesses to provide oversight and technical guidance, while our group audit team visits sites on a risk-prioritized basis to check how they are managing risks.\n\n## Our operating management system\n\nOur OMS is a group-wide framework designed to help us manage risks in our operating activities and drive performance improvements. It brings together bp requirements on health, safety, security, the environment, social responsibility and operational reliability, as well as related issues, such as maintenance, contractor relations and organizational learning, into a common management system. Our OMS also helps us improve the quality of our activities by setting a common framework that our operations must work to. We review and amend these requirements from time to time to reflect our priorities. Any variations in the application of our OMS, in order to meet local regulations or circumstances, are subject to a governance process. Recently acquired operations need to transition to our OMS.\n\n## Preventing incidents\n\nWe carefully plan our operations, with the aim of identifying potential hazards and having rigorous operating and maintenance practices applied by capable people to manage risks at every stage. We design our new facilities in line with process safety, good design and engineering principles. We track our safety performance using industry metrics such as the American Petroleum Institute recommended practice 754 and the International Association of Oil & Gas Producers recommended practice 45.\n\nOur process safety performance improved from 2019 and was roughly comparable to 2018 and 2017. There were 35% fewer tier 1 process safety events in 2020 compared to 2019, but our performance was broadly in line with the previous three years. We also recorded 26% fewer tier 2 process safety events compared to 2019, lower than the previous 10 years. The combined tier 1 and tier 2 process safety events were down 29% in 2020 compared to 2019.\n\nWe investigate incidents including near misses. And we use leading indicators, such as inspections and equipment tests, to monitor the strength of controls to prevent incidents.\n\n|                                             |   2020 |   2019 |   2018 |\n|---------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Tier 1 and tier 2  process safety  events a |     70 |     98 |     72 |\n| Oil spills -  number b                      |    121 |    152 |    124 |\n| Oil spills  contained                       |     70 |     90 |     63 |\n| Oil spills reaching  land and water         |     46 |     58 |     57 |\n| Oil spilled -  volume  (thousand litres)    |    784 |    710 |    538 |\n| Oil unrecovered  (thousand litres)          |    494 |    300 |    131 |\n\n## Emergency preparedness\n\nThe scale and spread of bp's operations means we must be prepared to respond to a range of possible disruptions and emergency events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. We maintain disaster recovery, crisis and business continuity management plans and work to build day-today response capabilities to support local management of incidents.\n\n## Security\n\nWe monitor for hostile actions that could harm our people or disrupt our operations. These actions might be connected to political or social unrest, terrorism, armed conflict or criminal activity. We take these potential threats seriously and assess them continuously. Our 24-hour response information centre in the UK uses state-of-the-art technology to monitor evolving high-risk situations in real time. It helps us to assess the safety of our people and provide them with practical advice if there is an emergency.\n\n## Cyber security\n\nThe severity, sophistication and scale of cyber attacks continues to evolve. The increasing digitalization and reliance on IT systems makes managing cyber risk an even greater priority for many industries, including our own. The risk comes from a variety of cyber-threat actors, including nation states, criminals, terrorists, hacktivists and insiders. As with previous years, we've experienced threats to the security of our digital infrastructure, but none of these had a significant impact on our business in 2020.\n\nWe have a range of measures to manage this risk, including the use of cyber-security policies and procedures, security protection tools, continuous threat monitoring and event detection capabilities, and incident response plans. We also conduct exercises to test our response to and recovery from cyber attacks. To encourage vigilance among our staff, our cyber-security training and awareness programme covers topics such as phishing and the correct classification and handling of our information. We collaborate closely with governments, law enforcement and industry peers to understand and respond to new and emerging threats.\n\n## Working with contractors\n\nThrough documents that help bridge between our policies and those of our contractors, we define the way our safety management system co-exists with those of our contractors to manage risk on a site. For our contractors facing the most serious risks, we conduct quality, technical, health, safety and security audits before awarding contracts. Once they start work, we continue to monitor their safety performance. Our OMS includes requirements and practices for working with contractors. Our standard model contracts include health, safety and security requirements.\n\nWe expect and encourage our contractors and their employees to act in a way that is consistent with our code of conduct and take appropriate action if those expectations, or their contractual obligations, are not met.\n\n## Our partners in joint arrangements \u00ab\n\nIn joint arrangements where we are the operator, our OMS, code of conduct and other policies apply. We aim to report on aspects of our business where we are the operator - as we directly manage the performance of these operations. We monitor performance and how risk is managed in our joint arrangements, whether we are the operator or not. Where we are not the operator, our OMS is available as a reference point for bp businesses when engaging with operators and co-venturers. We have a group framework to assess and manage bp's exposure related to safety, operational and bribery and corruption risk from our participation in these types of arrangements. Where appropriate, we may seek to influence how risk is managed in arrangements where we are not the operator.",

        "page_content": "## Business ethics and accountability\n\n## Our values and code of conduct\n\nOur values of safety, respect, excellence, courage and one team represent the qualities and actions we wish to see in bp. They inform how we do business and the decisions we make. We use these values as part of our recruitment, promotion and individual performance management processes.\n\nOur code of conduct is based on our values and sets clear expectations for how we work at bp. It applies to all bp employees and members of the board.\n\nEmployees, contractors or other third parties who have a question about our code of conduct or see something that they feel is unethical or unsafe can discuss this with their managers, supporting teams, works councils (where relevant) or through OpenTalk, a confidential and anonymous helpline operated by an independent company.\n\nWe received more than 1,600 concerns or enquiries through these channels in 2020 (2019 1,800). The most commonly raised concerns were related to the 'Our people' section of our code of conduct. The section addresses issues such as harassment, equal opportunity, and diversity and inclusion. We take steps to identify and correct areas of non-conformance and take disciplinary action where appropriate. In 2020 our businesses dismissed approximately 50 bp employees for non-conformance with our code of conduct or unethical behaviour (2019 82 a ). This excludes dismissals of contractors and vendors, and staff employed at our retail service stations.\n\n## Anti-bribery and corruption\n\nWe operate in parts of the world where bribery and corruption present a high risk. We have a responsibility to our employees, our shareholders and the countries and communities in which we do business to be ethical and lawful in all our work.\n\nOur code of conduct explicitly prohibits engaging in bribery or corruption in any form. Our group-wide anti-bribery and corruption policy and procedures include measures and guidance to assess risks, understand relevant laws and report concerns. They apply to all bp-operated businesses.\n\nWe provide training to employees appropriate to the nature or location of their role. Around 7,700 employees completed anti-bribery and corruption training in 2020 (2019 ~11,000). We assess any exposure to bribery and corruption risk when working with suppliers and business partners. Where appropriate, we put in place a risk mitigation plan or we reject them if we conclude that risks are too high.\n\nWe also conduct anti-bribery compliance audits on selected suppliers when contracts are in place. Many of our production & operations projects conduct supplier audits to assess their conformance with our anti-bribery and corruption contractual requirements. We take corrective action with suppliers and business partners that fail to meet our expectations, which may include terminating contracts. In 2020 we issued 35 audit reports (2019 25).\n\nWhile our audit process was disrupted in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we continued to engage suppliers and communicate our expectations for managing bribery and corruption risk on behalf of bp. For example, our customers & products business delivered a regional annual contractor forum digitally, to provide awareness of bribery and corruption risks.\n\n## Political donations and activity\n\nWe prohibit the use of bp funds or resources to support any political candidate or party. We recognize the rights of our employees to participate in the political process and these rights are governed by the applicable laws in the countries where we operate. The way in which we interact with those governments depends on the legal and regulatory framework in each country. Our stance on political activity is defined in our code of conduct.\n\nIn the US we provide administrative support for the bp employee political action committee (PAC), which is a non-partisan committee that encourages voluntary employee participation in the political process. All bp employee PAC contributions are reviewed for compliance with federal and state law and are publicly reported in accordance with US election laws. The PAC paused all contributions for six months beginning in January 2021. During this time the PAC will re-evaluate its criteria for candidate support.\n\n## Tax transparency\n\nWe comply with tax laws in a responsible manner, pay and report our taxes on time and have open and constructive conversations with stakeholders, including governments and tax authorities. And we contribute to initiatives that simplify and improve tax regimes to encourage investment and sustainable growth and support the energy transition. We are committed to being transparent about our tax principles and the taxes we pay.\n\nWe paid $3.3 billion in corporate income and production taxes to governments (2019 $6.9 billion).\n\nIn 2020 we endorsed the B Team Responsible Tax Principles and we published Our tax report 2019 .\n\nThe report provides more detailed information on how we approach tax matters and the tax payments we make. New disclosures in our tax report include the total tax contribution for our global operations. This covers: all our business activities and details the taxes we pay directly to governments on our own behalf, along with taxes we collect and pay to governments on behalf of others; financial and tax data from our OECD country-by-country report, summary activities of bp subsidiaries by country and details of bp companies located in countries considered to be low tax jurisdictions.\n\nbp is a founding member of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), which supports the disclosure of payments made to and received by governments in relation to oil, gas and mining. Through EITI we work with governments, NGOs and international agencies to improve transparency.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nbp.com/tax",

The employee engagement score is a key performance indicator for bp, see page 41.\n\n## Responding to feedback\n\nWhen our 'Pulse Live' and Employee Assistance platforms showed increased anxiety in employees, our CEO Bernard Looney led a series of live webcasts, including one focused on reducing mental health stigma and encouraging employees to ask for help. We also increased the frequency of mental health awareness training for managers.\n\n## Keeping connected through webcasts\n\nCEO Bernard Looney hosted regular 'Keeping Connected' webcasts to discuss important topics with members of the leadership team and subject matter experts such as our partner Equinor's EVP, New Energy Solutions, and our vice president health and wellbeing, Dr Richard Heron. The sessions included a live Q&A section where employees could ask questions, anonymously if desired, of the CEO and webcast guests.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee page 86 for more on how the board and senior management team engaged with stakeholders throughout the year.\n\nmost likely promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members as a whole, having regard to the likely consequences of any decision in the long term and the broader interests of other stakeholders, as required by the Act.\n\n## Investors\n\n## Developing our new strategy, financial frame and investor proposition\n\nOur decision to introduce a new strategy, financial frame and investor proposition, including a new distribution policy, benefited from extensive dialogue with our major shareholders.\n\n## ESG engagement\n\nWe engage frequently with our investors on environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues. This includes one-to-one conversations, participation at external events and group meetings, including with Climate Action 100+ representatives.\n\n## bp week\n\nIn response to feedback from investors and others, CEO Bernard Looney and his leadership team offered further insight into bp's new strategy and sustainability frame during bp week - three consecutive virtual capital markets days held in September 2020.\n\nSee table on pages 82-83 for more information in support of this statement, including a description of the board's activities during 2020.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Society\n\n## Our biodiversity position\n\nWe developed our updated position with input and constructive challenge from international nature and conservation organizations and experts including Conservation International, Fauna & Flora International (FFI), UNESCO and IUCN. The position sets out new measures to help restore, maintain and enhance nature. In September we announced a five-year collaboration with FFI to help support the delivery of our new position, including our aim to achieve a net positive impact.\n\n## Our human rights policy\n\nWe updated our business and human rights policy in 2020 to address emerging human rights issues relevant to our industry, clarify our human rights commitments and communicate how bp's approach to managing human rights impacts has advanced. The update was supported by consultations with a wide range of NGOs, subject matter experts and investors.\n\n## Examples of engagement with other stakeholder groups Customers\n\n- Collaboration with original equipment manufacturers such as Ford, Renault, JLR and Volvo on future technologies.\n- Global customer brand tracking.\n\n## Government and regulators\n\n- Publication of Our tax report 2019 - see bp.com/tax .\n- Government lobbying - we actively advocated for regional carbon pricing schemes in the US, provided input to the EU methane strategy and supported the UK government's planned phase out of internal combustion engines.\n\n## Partners and suppliers\n\n- Supplier workshops, including sessions focused on net zero, people and planet.\n- University collaborations, including the Carbon Mitigation Initiative (CMI), an independent academic research programme based at Princeton University.",

These risks are described in the Risk factors on page 67.\n\nOur management systems, organizational structures, processes, standards, code of conduct and behaviours together form a system of internal control that governs how we conduct the business of bp and manage associated risks.\n\n## bp's risk management system\n\nbp's risk management system and policy is designed to be a consistent and clear framework for managing and reporting risks from the group's operations to management and to the board. The system seeks to avoid incidents and enhance business outcomes by allowing us to:\n\n- Understand the risk environment, identify the specific risks and assess the potential exposure for bp.\n- Determine how best to deal with these risks to manage overall potential exposure.\n- Manage the identified risks in appropriate ways.\n- Monitor and seek assurance of the effectiveness of the management of these risks and intervene for improvement where necessary.\n- Report up the management chain and to the board on a periodic basis on how significant risks are being managed, monitored, assured and the improvements that are being made.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Our risk management activities\n\nDay-to-day risk management - management and staff at our facilities, assets, and within our businesses, integrators and enablers seek to identify and manage risk, promoting safe, compliant and reliable operations. bp requirements, which take into account applicable laws and regulations, underpin the practical plans developed to help reduce risk and deliver safe, compliant and reliable operations as well as greater efficiency and sustainable financial results.\n\nBusiness and strategic risk management - our businesses, integrators and enablers integrate risk management into key business processes such as strategy, planning, performance management, resource and capital allocation, and project appraisal. We do this by using a standard framework for collating risk data, assessing risk management activities, making further improvements and in connection with planning new activities.\n\nOversight and governance - throughout the year management, the leadership team, the board and relevant committees provide oversight of how significant risks to bp are identified, assessed and managed. They help to ensure that risks are governed by relevant policies and are managed appropriately. Such oversight may include reviews of the outcomes of business processes including strategy, planning and resource and capital allocation.\n\nbp's group risk team analyses the group's risk profile and maintains the group's risk management system. Our internal audit team provides independent assurance to the chief executive and board as to whether the group's system of internal control is adequately designed and operating effectively to respond appropriately to the risks that are significant to bp.\n\n## Risk oversight and governance\n\nKey risk oversight and governance committees include the following:\n\n## Leadership team and its committees\n\n- Leadership team meeting - for oversight and for strategic and commercial risks.\n- Group operations risk committee - for health, safety, security, environment and operations integrity risks.\n- Group financial risk committee - for finance, treasury, trading and cyber risks.\n- Group disclosure committee - for financial reporting risks.\n- Group people and culture committee - for employee risks.\n- Group ethics and compliance committee - for legal and regulatory compliance and ethics risks.\n- Resource commitment meeting - for investment decision risks.\n- bp quarterly audit meeting - for assurance on the oversight of bp's principal risks.\n\n## Board and its committees\n\n- bp board.\n- Audit committee.\n- Safety and sustainability committee.\n- Remuneration committee.\n- People and governance committee.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor bp governance framework see page 88, Board activities see page 80, committee reports see pages 92-102 and 105 and Risk management and internal control see page 127.",

These may be updated during the year in response to changes in internal and external circumstances.\n\n## Our risk profile\n\nThe nature of our business operations is long term, resulting in many of our risks being enduring in nature. Nonetheless, risks can develop and evolve over time and their potential impact or likelihood may vary in response to internal and external events. These may include emerging risks which are considered through existing processes, including bp's risk management system, bp's Energy Outlook, bp's Technology Outlook and group strategic reviews.\n\nWe identify longer-term strategic risks and high priority risks for particular oversight by the board and its various committees in the coming year.\n\nThere can be no certainty that our risk management activities will mitigate or prevent these, or other risks, from occurring. Further details of the principal risks and uncertainties we face are set out in Risk factors on page 67.\n\n## Risks for particular oversight by the board and its committees in 2021\n\nThe risks for particular oversight by the board and its committees in 2021 have been reviewed and are listed in this section. These may be updated throughout the year in response to changes in internal and external circumstances. The oversight and management of other risks is undertaken in the normal course of business. In addition to the risks reviewed in 2020, climate-related risks remain a longer-term strategic risk.\n\n## Climate-related risks\n\nRisks associated with climate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy impact many elements of our strategy and, as such, these risks are considered through key business processes including the strategy, annual plan, capital allocation and investment decisions. The outputs of these key business processes are reviewed in line with the cadence of these activities.\n\nFurther details are described in Climate change and the environment on page 52.\n\n## Strategic and commercial risks\n\n## Financial liquidity\n\nExternal market conditions can impact our financial performance. Supply and demand and the prices achieved for our products can be affected by a wide range of factors including political developments, consumer preferences for low carbon energy, global economic conditions and the influence of OPEC.\n\nWe seek to manage this risk through bp's diversified portfolio, our financial framework, liquidity stress testing, maintaining a significant cash buffer, regular reviews of market conditions and our planning and investment processes.\n\nSee Prices and markets and Liquidity, financial capacity and financial, including credit, exposure on page 67.\n\n## The impact of COVID-19\n\nThe spread of COVID-19 has caused a significant drop in the oil and gas prices and refining margins. bp's future financial performance will be impacted by the extent and duration of the current market conditions and the effectiveness of the actions that it and others take, including its financial interventions. Our financial frame is designed to be robust to periods of low price, with flexibility to reduce cost and capital expenditure if required. We continue to assess the impact of COVID-19 on our staff and operations and have instigated appropriate mitigation plans.\n\n## Cyber security\n\nThe targeted and indiscriminate threats to the security of our digital infrastructure and those of third parties continue to evolve rapidly and are increasingly prevalent across industries worldwide. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic changed ways of working and introduced new phishing campaigns.\n\nWe seek to manage this risk through a range of measures, which include cyber security standards, security protection tools, ongoing detection and monitoring of threats and testing of cyber response and recovery procedures. We collaborate closely with governments, law enforcement agencies and industry peers to understand and respond to new and emerging cyber threats. We build awareness with our staff, share information on incidents with leadership for continuous learning and conduct regular exercises including with the leadership team to test response and recovery procedures.",

Geopolitical risk is inherent to many regions in which we operate, and heightened political or social tensions or changes in key relationships could adversely affect the group.\n\nWe seek to manage this risk through development and maintenance of relationships with governments and stakeholders and by becoming trusted partners in each country and region. In addition, we closely monitor events and implement risk mitigation plans where appropriate.\n\n## The impact of the UK's exit from the EU\n\nWe have been assessing the potential impact on bp of Brexit and the UK's future global relationships and have not identified any significant risk to our business.\n\n## Safety and operational risks\n\n## Process safety, personal safety and environmental risks\n\nThe nature of the group's operating activities exposes us to a wide range of significant health, safety and environmental risks such as incidents associated with releases of hydrocarbons when drilling wells, operating facilities and transporting hydrocarbons.\n\nOur operating management system \u00ab helps us manage these risks and drive performance improvements. It sets out the standards and requirements which govern key risk management activities such as inspection, maintenance, testing, business continuity and crisis response planning and competency development. In addition, we conduct our drilling activity through a wells organization in order to promote a consistent approach for designing, constructing and managing wells.\n\n## Security\n\nHostile acts such as terrorism or piracy could harm our people and disrupt our operations. We monitor for emerging threats and vulnerabilities to manage our physical and information security.\n\nOur central security team provides guidance and support to our businesses through a network of regional security advisors who advise and conduct assurance activities with respect to the management of security risks affecting our people and operations. We continue to monitor threats globally and maintain disaster recovery, crisis and business continuity management plans.\n\n## Compliance and control risks\n\n## Ethical misconduct and legal or regulatory non-compliance\n\nEthical misconduct or breaches of applicable laws or regulations could damage our reputation, result in litigation, regulatory action and penalties, adversely affect results and shareholder value, and potentially affect our licence to operate.\n\nOur code of conduct and our values and behaviours, applicable to all employees, are central to managing this risk. Additionally, we have various group requirements and training covering areas such as anti-bribery and corruption, anti-money laundering, competition/anti-trust law and international trade regulations. We seek to keep abreast of new regulations and legislation and plan our response to them. We offer an independent confidential helpline, OpenTalk, for employees, contractors and other third parties.\n\n## Trading non-compliance\n\nIn the normal course of business, we are subject to risks around our trading activities which could arise from shortcomings or failures in our systems, risk management methodology, internal control processes or employee conduct.\n\nWe have specific operating standards and control processes to manage these risks, including guidelines specific to trading, and seek to monitor compliance through our dedicated compliance teams. We also seek to maintain a positive and collaborative relationship with regulators and the industry at large.\n\n## The impact of reinventing bp on the organization\n\nLast year we announced that we are reinventing bp to help deliver our ambition.\n\nThis significant reorganization includes a new structure, a new leadership team, new ways of working and a reduction in the size of bp's officebased workforce. Risks associated with these changes have been identified, assessed and are being managed. As part of our three lines of defence, our businesses, integrators and enablers are working to deliver clear accountabilities and the associated workload reduction. All individuals changing roles or leaving bp are required to complete a comprehensive management of change. Material risk management actions are being assured by internal audit.",

        "page_content": "## Risk factors\n\nThe risks discussed below, separately or in combination, could have a material adverse effect on the implementation of our strategy, our business, financial performance, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity, prospects, shareholder value and returns and reputation.\n\n## Strategic and commercial risks\n\nPrices and markets - our financial performance is impacted by fluctuating prices of oil, gas and refined products, technological change, exchange rate fluctuations, and the general macroeconomic outlook.\n\nOil, gas and product prices are subject to international supply and demand and margins can be volatile. Political developments, increased supply from new oil and gas or alternative low carbon energy sources, technological change, global economic conditions, public health situations (including the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or any future epidemic or pandemic) and the influence of OPEC can impact supply and demand and prices for our products. Decreases in oil, gas or product prices could have an adverse effect on revenue, margins, profitability and cash flows. If significant or for a prolonged period, we may have to write down assets and re-assess the viability of certain projects, which may impact future cash flows, profit, capital expenditure, the ability to work within our financial frame and maintain our long-term investment programme. Conversely, an increase in oil, gas and product prices may not improve margin performance as there could be increased fiscal take, cost inflation and more onerous terms for access to resources. The profitability of our refining activities can be volatile, with periodic over-supply or supply tightness in regional markets and fluctuations in demand.\n\nExchange rate fluctuations can create currency exposures and impact underlying costs and revenues. Crude oil prices are generally set in US dollars, while products vary in currency. Many of our major project \u00ab development costs are denominated in local currencies, which may be subject to fluctuations against the US dollar.\n\nAccess, renewal and reserves progression - inability to access, renew and progress upstream resources in a timely manner could adversely affect our long-term replacement of reserves.\n\nFocused renewal of our reserve base in line with our strategy depends on our ability to progress upstream resources from our existing portfolio and access new resource in our core areas, generating future opportunities for oil and natural gas production. Competition for access to investment opportunities, heightened political and economic risks where we operate, unsuccessful exploration activity, technical challenges and capital commitments may adversely affect our reserve replacement. This, and our ability to progress upstream resources at a level in line with our strategic outlook for hydrocarbon production, could impact our future production and financial performance.\n\nMajor project delivery - failure to invest in the best opportunities or deliver major projects successfully could adversely affect our financial performance.\n\nWe face challenges in developing major projects, particularly in geographically and technically challenging areas. Poor investment choice, efficiency or delivery, or operational challenges at any major project that underpins production or production growth could adversely affect our financial performance.\n\nGeopolitical - exposure to a range of political developments and consequent changes to the operating and regulatory environment could cause business disruption.\n\nWe operate and may seek new opportunities in countries, regions and cities where political, economic and social transition may take place. Political instability, changes to the regulatory environment or taxation, international trade disputes and barriers to free trade, international sanctions, expropriation or nationalization of property, civil strife, strikes, insurrections, acts of terrorism, acts of war and public health situations (including the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or any future epidemic or pandemic) may disrupt or curtail our operations or development activities. These may in turn cause production to decline, limit our ability to pursue new opportunities, affect the recoverability of our assets or cause us to incur additional costs, particularly due to the long-term nature of many of our projects and significant capital expenditure required. Events in or relating to Russia, including trade restrictions and other sanctions, could adversely impact our income and investment in or relating to Russia. Our ability to pursue business objectives and to recognize production and reserves relating to these investments could also be adversely impacted.\n\nLiquidity, financial capacity and financial, including credit, exposure - failure to work within our financial framework could impact our ability to operate and result in financial loss.\n\nFailure to accurately forecast or work within our financial framework could impact our ability to operate and result in financial loss. Trade and other receivables, including overdue receivables, may not be recovered, divestments may not be successfully completed and a substantial and unexpected cash call or funding request could disrupt our financial framework or overwhelm our ability to meet our obligations.",

        "page_content": "## Risk factors continued\n\nAn event such as a significant operational incident, legal proceedings or a geopolitical event in an area where we have significant activities, could reduce our financial liquidity and our credit ratings. Credit rating downgrades could potentially increase financing costs and limit access to financing or engagement in our trading activities on acceptable terms, which could put pressure on the group's liquidity.\n\nbp's credit rating downgrades could also trigger a requirement for the company to review its funding arrangements with the bp pension trustees and may cause other impacts on financial performance. In the event of extended constraints on our ability to obtain financing, we could be required to reduce capital expenditure or increase asset disposals in order to provide additional liquidity. See Liquidity and capital resources on page 306 and Financial statements - Note 29.\n\nJoint arrangements and contractors - varying levels of control over the standards, operations and compliance of our partners, contractors and sub-contractors could result in legal liability and reputational damage.\n\nWe conduct many of our activities through joint arrangements \u00ab , associates \u00ab /.notdefor with contractors and sub-contractors where we may have limited influence and control over the performance of such operations. Our partners and contractors are responsible for the adequacy of the resources and capabilities they bring to a project. If these are found to be lacking, there may be financial, operational or safety exposures for bp. Should an incident occur in an operation that bp participates in, our partners and contractors may be unable or unwilling to fully compensate us against costs we may incur on their behalf or on behalf of the arrangement. Where we do not have operational control of a venture, we may still be pursued by regulators or claimants in the event of an incident.\n\nDigital infrastructure and cyber security - breach or failure of our or third parties' digital infrastructure or cyber security, including loss or misuse of sensitive information could damage our operations, increase costs and damage our reputation.\n\nThe energy industry is subject to fast-evolving risks from cyber threat actors, including nation states, criminals, terrorists, hacktivists and insiders. A breach or failure of our or third parties' digital infrastructure - including control systems - due to breaches of our cyber defences, or those of third parties, negligence, intentional misconduct or other reasons, could seriously disrupt our operations. This could result in the loss or misuse of data or sensitive information, injury to people, disruption to our business, harm to the environment or our assets, legal or regulatory breaches and legal liability. Furthermore, the rapid detection of attempts to gain unauthorized access to our digital infrastructure, often through the use of sophisticated and co-ordinated means, is a challenge and any delay or failure to detect could compound these potential harms. These could result in significant costs including fines, cost of remediation or reputational consequences.\n\n## Climate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy\n\n- developments in policy, law, regulation, technology and markets, including societal and investor sentiment, related to the issue of climate change could increase costs, constrain our operations and affect our business plans and financial performance.\n\nLaws, regulations, policies, obligations, government actions, social attitudes and customer preferences relating to climate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy, including the pace of change to any of these factors, and also the pace of the transition itself, could have adverse impacts on our business including on our access to and realization of competitive opportunities in any of our strategic focus areas, a decline in demand for, or constraints on our ability to sell certain products, constraints on production and supply and access to new reserves, adverse litigation and regulatory or litigation outcomes, increased costs from compliance and increased provisions for environmental and legal liabilities.\n\nInvestor preferences and sentiment are influenced by environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) considerations including climate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy. Changes in those preferences and sentiment could affect our access to capital markets and our attractiveness to potential investors, potentially resulting in reduced access to financing, increased financing costs and impacts upon our business plans and financial performance.\n\nTechnological improvements or innovations that support the transition to a lower carbon economy, and customer preferences or regulatory incentives that alter fuel or power choices, could impact demand for oil and gas. Depending on the nature and speed of any such changes and our response, these changes could increase costs, reduce our profitability, reduce demand for certain products, limit our access to new opportunities, require us to write down certain assets or curtail or cease certain operations, and affect investor sentiment, our access to capital markets, our competitiveness and financial performance.\n\nPolicy, legal regulatory, technological and market developments related to climate change could also affect future price assumptions used in the assessment of recoverability of asset carrying values including goodwill, the judgement as to whether there is continued intent to develop exploration and appraisal intangible assets, the timing of decommissioning of assets and the useful economic lives of assets used for the calculation of depreciation and amortization.

        "page_content": "Competition - inability to remain efficient, maintain a high-quality portfolio of assets, innovate and retain an appropriately skilled workforce could negatively impact delivery of our strategy in a highly competitive market.\n\nOur strategic progress and performance could be impeded if we are unable to control our development and operating costs and margins, if we fail to scale our businesses at pace, or to sustain, develop and operate a highquality portfolio of assets efficiently. Furthermore, as we transition from an International Oil Company to an Integrated Energy Company, we face an expanded and rapidly evolving range of competitors in the sectors in which we operate. We could be adversely affected if competitors offer superior terms for access rights or licences, or if our innovation in areas such as new low carbon technologies, digital, customer offer, exploration, production, refining, manufacturing or renewable energy lags those of our competitors. Our performance could also be negatively impacted if we fail to protect our intellectual property. Our industry faces increasing challenges to recruit and retain diverse, skilled and experienced talent. Successful recruitment, development and retention of specialist staff is essential to our plans.\n\n## Crisis management and business continuity - failure to address an incident effectively could potentially disrupt our business.\n\nOur business activities could be disrupted if we do not respond, or are perceived not to respond, in an appropriate manner to any major crisis or if we are not able to restore or replace critical operational capacity.\n\nInsurance - our insurance strategy could expose the group to material uninsured losses.\n\nbp generally purchases insurance only in situations where this is legally and contractually required. Some risks are insured with third parties and reinsured by group insurance companies. Uninsured losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, particularly if they arise at a time when we are facing material costs as a result of a significant operational event which could put pressure on our liquidity and cash flows.\n\n## Safety and operational risks\n\nProcess safety, personal safety, and environmental risks - exposure to a wide range of health, safety, security and environmental risks could cause harm to people, the environment and our assets and result in regulatory action, legal liability, business interruption, increased costs, damage to our reputation and potentially denial of our licence to operate.\n\nTechnical integrity failure, natural disasters, extreme weather or a change in its frequency or severity, human error and other adverse events or conditions, including breach of digital security, could lead to loss of containment of hydrocarbons or other hazardous materials. This could also lead to constrained availability of resources used in our operating activities, as well as fires, explosions or other personal and process safety incidents, including when drilling wells, operating facilities and those associated with transportation by road, sea or pipeline. There can be no certainty that our operating management system/.notdefor other policies and procedures will adequately identify all process safety, personal safety and environmental risks or that all our operating activities, including acquired businesses, will be conducted in conformance with these systems. See Safety on page 59.\n\n## Strategic report\n\nSuch events or conditions, including a marine incident, or inability to provide safe environments for our workforce and the public while at our facilities, premises or during transportation, could lead to injuries, loss of life or environmental damage. As a result we could face regulatory action and legal liability, including penalties and remediation obligations, increased costs and potentially denial of our licence to operate. Our activities are sometimes conducted in hazardous, remote or environmentally sensitive locations, where the consequences of such events or conditions could be greater than in other locations.\n\nDrilling and production - challenging operational environments and other uncertainties could impact drilling and production activities.\n\nOur activities require high levels of investment and are sometimes conducted in challenging environments such as those prone to natural disasters and extreme weather, which heightens the risks of technical integrity failure. The physical characteristics of an oil or natural gas field, and cost of drilling, completing or operating wells is often uncertain. We may be required to curtail, delay or cancel drilling operations or stop production because of a variety of factors, including unexpected drilling conditions, pressure or irregularities in geological formations, equipment failures or accidents, adverse weather conditions and compliance with governmental requirements.\n\nSecurity - hostile acts against our staff and activities could cause harm to people and disrupt our operations.\n\nActs of terrorism, piracy, sabotage and similar activities directed against our operations and facilities, pipelines, transportation or digital infrastructure could cause harm to people and severely disrupt operations. Our activities could also be severely affected by conflict, civil strife or political unrest.\n\nProduct quality - supplying customers with off-specification products could damage our reputation, lead to regulatory action and legal liability, and impact our financial performance.\n\nFailure to meet product quality specifications could cause harm to people and the environment, damage our reputation, result in regulatory action and legal liability, and impact financial performance.",

These laws and regulations result in an often complex, uncertain and changing legal and regulatory environment for our global businesses and operations. Changes in laws or regulations, including how they are interpreted and enforced, can and does impact all aspects of our business.\n\nRoyalties and taxes, particularly those applied to our hydrocarbon activities, tend to be high compared with those imposed on similar commercial activities. In certain jurisdictions there is also a degree of uncertainty relating to tax law interpretation and changes. Governments may change their fiscal and regulatory frameworks in response to public pressure on finances, resulting in increased amounts payable to them or their agencies.\n\nChanges in law or regulation could increase the compliance and litigation risk and costs, reduce our profitability, reduce demand for or constrain our ability to sell certain products, limit our access to new opportunities, require us to divest or write down certain assets or curtail or cease certain operations, or affect the adequacy of our provisions for pensions, tax, decommissioning, environmental and legal liabilities. Changes in laws or regulations could result in the nationalization, expropriation, cancellation, non-renewal or renegotiation of our interests, assets and related rights. Potential changes to pension or financial market regulation could also impact funding requirements of the group. Following the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, we may be subjected to a higher level of fines or penalties imposed in relation to any alleged breaches of laws or regulations, which could result in increased costs. See Regulation of the group's business on page 321.\n\nTreasury and trading activities - ineffective oversight of treasury and trading activities could lead to business disruption, financial loss, regulatory intervention or damage to our reputation.\n\nWe are subject to operational risk around our treasury and trading activities in financial and commodity markets, some of which are regulated. Failure to process, manage and monitor a large number of complex transactions across many markets and currencies while complying with all regulatory requirements could hinder profitable trading opportunities. There is a risk that a single trader or a group of traders could act outside of our delegations and controls, leading to regulatory intervention and resulting in financial loss, fines and potentially damaging our reputation. See Financial statements Note 29.\n\nReporting - failure to accurately report our data could lead to regulatory action, legal liability and reputational damage.\n\nExternal reporting of financial and non-financial data, including reserves estimates, relies on the integrity of the control environment, our systems and people operating them. Failure to report data accurately and in compliance with applicable standards could result in regulatory action, legal liability and damage to our reputation.\n\nThe Strategic report was approved by the board and signed on its behalf by Ben J. S. Mathews, company secretary, on 22 March 2021.",

        "page_content": "## Introduction from the chairman\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2020 tested bp's governance processes like no other year. Board members, like many colleagues across bp, have achieved and learned a lot together through our new way of working - and there's much that we will continue. I am grateful for the flexibility, commitment and clearsightedness of my board colleagues in 2020 - it bodes well for the years ahead.\n\nHelge Lund\n\nChairman\n\n## New strategy\n\nAs a board, our responsibilities include determining bp's purpose and strategy, monitoring its culture and seeking assurance that these are aligned with our values. For bp, 2020 was a year in which we felt this responsibility especially keenly. With the board's support, bp adopted a new purpose - reimagining energy for people and our planet, which aligns bp's capabilities and aspirations with the needs of society.\n\n2020 was also the year bp's new CEO, Bernard Looney, commenced his role. As well as formally launching our new purpose, Bernard set out a net zero ambition, new strategy, financial frame and investor proposition. These actions were taken with the full support of the board following a process of careful debate, and the board is confident that they respect bp's culture and values.\n\nThe change that was immediately most consequential for many people within bp was a restructure that will see close to 10,000 colleagues leave bp. It was difficult saying goodbye to people who helped make our organization what it is today - and the board was united with the leadership team in determining that the process should be conducted fairly and respectfully.\n\nThat process is now largely complete, and I believe, as does the board, that bp is now leaner, flatter and nimbler - better able to fulfil our new purpose, ambition and strategy.\n\n## COVID impact on working of the board\n\nChange on this scale would be challenging in any company at any time. So, I want to pay tribute to my board colleagues for their contribution during such a difficult period. It is to their credit that we very quickly adapted to a new way of working together - with our many meetings since March held entirely virtually.\n\nIndeed, the COVID-19 pandemic justified more regular meetings with bp's leadership - so early in the pandemic we instituted weekly calls to keep abreast of bp's response to the pandemic and how the team was taking account of the needs and expectations of all our stakeholders.\n\n## Maintaining bp's culture\n\nSince joining bp, I have always been impressed at the strength of the company's culture - open, co-operative, collaborative and performancefocused. Rather than weaken that culture, I believe that the pandemic has strengthened it further - and has proved its value. bp would not have achieved all it did in 2020 without such a strong culture. We have been careful that the changes introduced throughout the year are respectful of it, and consistent with bp's values of safety, respect, excellence, courage and one team.\n\n## Board composition\n\nIn 2020 we welcomed Tushar Morzaria, Karen Richardson and Johannes Teyssen to the board. They each have skills, experience and a diverse mindset that is closely aligned to the strategic direction we have set for bp.\n\nWe also said goodbye to friends who have served bp with distinction over many years - Nils Andersen, Brian Gilvary, Sir Ian Davis, Dame Alison Carnwath and, of course, Bob Dudley. bp has been fortunate to have them, and we will miss them.\n\nI was delighted that Paula Reynolds agreed to take over from Sir Ian Davis as senior independent director following the AGM 2020, and that Melody Meyer was able to take over the important role of chairing the safety and sustainability committee after Nils Andersen stepped down from the board. Tushar Morzaria will take over as chair of the audit committee after the AGM in May, following an extensive handover from Brendan Nelson, who will then retire.",

        "page_content": "In the coming year, one of my priorities will be to ensure that the board remains at an appropriate size, with strong composition, and with diversity of both thought and skills in support of the strategic direction we have set.\n\n## Diversity\n\nThe process of reinventing bp provided opportunities to enhance bp's diversity in other ways, too. Though we have more to do in all areas, we have made particular progress on gender diversity at senior levels. In 2020, we increased female board representation from 42% to 45%; increased female executive committee representation from 15% to 31%; and met the Hampton-Alexander and Parker review targets for 2021.\n\n## New governance framework\n\nTo complement bp's new strategic direction, we have introduced a new governance framework, covering bp's board-level corporate governance and facilitating a stronger board focus on strategy, performance, people and governance, with the committees each playing a critical role in support. The emphasis on strategy and its execution is especially important - I believe it to be where the board can deliver most value at this time, encouraging and working closely with the leadership team as they drive forward our strategic progress, safety, financial and operational performance.\n\nThe governance framework redefines the committees' roles. Our newly-titled safety and sustainability committee rightly gains an enhanced focus on sustainability, but with no let-up on our core and overriding priority - safety, while our people and governance committee gains an enhanced focus on our single most important asset - our people. These committees and the insights they provide to the board very much support its effectiveness.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n2020 tested bp's governance processes like no other year. Board members, like many colleagues across bp, have achieved and learned a lot together through our new way of working and there's much that we will continue. I am grateful for the flexibility, commitment and clear-sightedness of my board colleagues in 2020 - it bodes well for the years ahead.\n\nHelge Lund, Chairman 22 March 2021\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code\n\nThroughout 2020, bp applied the principles and complied with all the provisions of the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code.",

The board is responsible to bp's owners for promoting the long-term sustainable success of the company, generating value for its shareholders, while having regard to its other stakeholders, the impact of its operations on the communities within which it operates, and the environment.\n\n## Primary tasks of the board in 2020 included\n\nDefining and establishing a new purpose and strategy, while assessing and monitoring whether they were consistent with bp's culture and values.\n\nIn light of the significant operational challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, establishing a rhythm of board meetings to ensure that the leadership team was supported, providing guidance to the CEO to ensure that shareholder and other stakeholder interests were taken into account, while maintaining safe and reliable operations.\n\nMonitoring the activities and performance of bp's leadership team, obtaining assurance about the delivery of 2025 and 2030 targets and aims and the sustainability frame within which they operate.\n\nDesigning and establishing the board's new corporate governance framework, including the delegations of authority under which it operates.\n\nAssessing and monitoring the principal risks and emerging risks of bp, having considered feedback from the committees of the board.\n\n## Ways of working\n\nNew ways of working were put in place during 2020 alongside the changes to the design of the board's corporate governance framework. Meeting agendas were structured along four distinct pillars: strategy, performance, people, and governance, with the overarching focus being on the development of bp's new strategy in support of its transition to an Integrated Energy Company.\n\nThe board and its committees met regularly during the year, as well as on an ad hoc basis, as required by business needs. Attendance is shown in the table on page 84. Although the board and its committees were able to hold physical meetings in the early part of the year, once COVID-19-related restrictions and controls were introduced, most meetings took place virtually. Throughout the year, the board and its committees continued to engage effectively through the use of technology. Key areas covered during 2020 under each of these pillars are set out on the next page.",

        "page_content": "## Strategy\n\nDuring 2020 the board worked closely with the incoming chief executive officer (CEO) and his leadership team, establishing a new purpose and strategy for bp. bp's purpose is to reimagine energy for people and our planet, with an ambition to become a net zero company by 2050 or sooner, and to help the world get to net zero. This new purpose recognizes:\n\n- The world is on an unsustainable path - its carbon budget is running out.\n- Energy markets have begun to shift towards low carbon and renewables.\n- Oil and gas produced safely and efficiently will continue to perform a vital role for the world and our business, but over the longer term, demand for both oil and gas will be challenged.\n- bp can contribute to the energy transition the world wants and needs and create value in doing so.\n\nThe delivery and execution of the strategy that supports this new purpose is made possible through a resilient financial framework, including a new approach to capital allocation. In 2020 the board determined a new distribution policy, which will support us in facing an increasingly uncertain world, allow us to strengthen the balance sheet, invest in our resilient and valuable hydrocarbons business, and invest adequately into the energy transition. A new distribution policy was approved by the board, comprising a reset and resilient dividend and a firm share buyback commitment, see page 22.\n\nAssociated with the new strategy, the board also agreed a number of tactical divestments, including the disposal of its petrochemicals business. Alongside this, new business opportunities were progressed, for example the formation of a strategic partnership with Equinor, to develop offshore wind energy in the US, see page 21.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of the board's activities during 2020 described in this section, the table on pages 82 and 83 sets out some examples of board decision making in 2020 and how the directors have performed their duty under Section 172.\n\n## Performance\n\nThe board reviewed project, operational and safety performance throughout the year, as well as the latest view on full-year delivery against plan and the implications for the group's scorecard measures. Equally, in light of the challenging macro-economic environment facing the sector, the company's financial performance, liquidity, credit position and associated financial risks were closely and regularly monitored by the board. In this way and through the regular interactions that were taking place during the year, the board was able to satisfy itself that bp was performing while transforming.\n\nReports supplementing the role played by the board included:\n\n- CEO and chief financial officer (CFO) reports.\n- Group financial outlook.\n- The annual effectiveness of investment review.\n- Quarterly and full-year results.\n- Shareholder distributions.\n- The annual plan and associated capital allocation commitments.\n\nOn risk oversight, the board, assisted by its committees, also regularly reviewed its principal and emerging risks, including the process through which they are identified, evaluated and managed. Linked to this, the high-priority risks were reviewed in 2020, giving the directors the chance to seek assurance as to how those risks were prioritized and being managed.\n\nOn internal controls, the board also assessed the effectiveness of the group's system of internal control and risk management as part of the process through which it reviews and, ultimately, approves the bp Annual Report and Form 20-F . No specific areas of significant deterioration were identified in this assessment. The board concluded that the group's system of internal control continued to be resilient. The board also concluded that the overall design of the group's system of internal control generally meets external expectations of components to be included in internal control frameworks. In arriving at these conclusions, the board took into account reports from group risk and internal audit, as well as reviews undertaken by the board and its committees during the year. In conducting reviews during the year, the board and its committees considered the impact of remote working on the control environment, among other key factors.\n\nFor more information on bp's system of risk management see How we manage risk on page 64. Information about bp's system of internal control is on page 127.\n\n## People\n\nThe board, through the former nomination and governance committee, continued to focus on reviewing its own composition, skills, experience and diversity, as well as that of the bp leadership team. Ultimately, new board appointments were made during the year, most notably with the retirement of the CEO, Bob Dudley, and CFO, Brian Gilvary, succeeded by Bernard Looney and Murray Auchincloss, respectively.\n\nTushar Morzaria was appointed to the board and its audit committee with effect from September 2020. Karen Richardson and Dr Johannes Teyssen were appointed to the board with effect from 1 January 2021. Johannes was also appointed to the safety and sustainability committee with effect from the same date. A new leadership team under the CEO came into being on 1 July 2020.\n\nThrough the new people and governance committee, the process for executive succession planning, talent management and development is being redesigned. People insights - particularly the reinvention of bp and its impact on the organization - were presented to the board and this committee by the CEO and EVP, people & culture, providing information on matters relating to people strategy, employee engagement, diversity and people processes and policies. To help inform board discussions and decisions, board members also engaged directly with the workforce in structured events, see page 87.\n\n## Governance\n\nThe board established a new corporate governance framework, which is more closely aligned with bp's new purpose and also reinforces the effectiveness of the internal control framework. For more information on the new corporate governance framework see page 88.",

Ultimately, the board retains responsibility for - and regularly monitors - the execution of this delegation of authority, taking action to update it as required.\n\nAs part of the wider board corporate governance redesign, the board reviewed the delegation of authority, in part reflecting the need to ensure that it remained appropriate in light of bp's new strategy, and the 2025 and 2030 targets and aims. The board's new ways of working are explained on page 80 including certain matters that under the new corporate governance framework are reserved for the board as set out in its new terms of reference.\n\nThe execution of company strategy is undertaken by the CEO's leadership team, under the day-to-day authority for the management of the company delegated to the CEO.

        "page_content": "In the context of the board's activities during 2020, the table below sets out some examples of board decision making in 2020 and how the directors have performed their duty under Section 172.\n\n## Section 172(1)a) to (f) matters considered, including stakeholder group(s) affected and feedback received\n\n## How the board had regard to the feedback in its decision making\n\n## Workforce\n\nIn town halls and leadership meetings employees wanted to know how bp could do more to step up to the climate challenge and help society deal with these issues. It became clear that employees were seeking even stronger commitments to the climate change agenda by the company.\n\n## Community and environment\n\nWe consulted with communities, NGOs, academics and industry associations - even bringing some of bp's harshest critics into discussions about the future of the company, about environment, social and governance matters and the issues facing the world, drawing on their external expertise, input and challenge.\n\n## Investors\n\nWe talked with investors about their expectations of bp and heard of their desire for bp to continue to deliver operational excellence, to drive higher returns but also to set out a clear medium to long-term vision for a sustainable bp business in light of the energy transition.\n\n## Fostering business relationships\n\nWe received feedback from customers via the bp leadership team, conveying the importance of being able to react rapidly to changing demand.\n\nThe board considered the importance of skills evaluation to the delivery of cost reduction and the wider long-term strategic delivery of bp's aims.\n\nThey heard feedback from the CEO's 'Keeping Connected' webcasts with the workforce together with responses to bp's 'Pulse' surveys.\n\n## Considerations\n\n- The wider society context following the impact of COVID-19 and the wider oil industry job losses.\n- The importance of putting the safety of employees first.\n- Companies should try to provide job assurance and consider the mental health impact of job insecurity.\n- bp's reputation for high standards of conduct and the importance of honesty, fairness, and respect in the process.\n\nIn considering the proposed financial frame and distribution policy, the board had regard to:\n\n- The resilience of bp's balance sheet for the long term.\n- Delivering sustainable value to shareholders.\n- The need for bp to invest adequately in the energy transition and low carbon, to support the new ambition and strategy.\n\nAll the elements highlighted in Section 172 were central to the discussions as the board evaluated the purpose and strategy options - what are bp's beliefs and what does bp want to be? The discussions encompassed bp's role with respect to its shareholders, employees and society. It considered the value creation opportunities and the importance of leaning into the changing needs of customer demand for convenience and society's demand for renewables and lower carbon energy.\n\nThe change in purpose and strategy reflects bp's people's belief that we can create long-term value by helping solve one of society's biggest problems - climate change.\n\nThe decision was made with the long-term future and sustainability of bp in mind with clear 2025 targets, 2030 aims and a 2050 goal.\n\nThe board supported the reinvention of bp, with the associated headcount reduction that this implied.\n\nGiven the feedback received, although the board considered it was the right decision to go ahead, they sought assurances from the executive that:\n\n- The redundancy process was fair, transparent and objective with an environment of honesty, trust and co-operation that put the care and wellbeing of our people at the heart of the process.\n- The reduction in the workforce was conducted in a manner which protected bp's safe and reliable operations.\n- Support for the life transition that redundancy brings is offered to the relevant employees.\n- Discretionary enhanced redundancy terms could be offered.\n- In approving the new distribution policy the directors reflected that there may be some change in bp's investor base as some investors focus more on the short-term direct return that the dividend provides.\n- After considering all the various factors, the board concluded that a resilient dividend intended to remain fixed at 5.25 cents per ordinary share per quarter (subject to the board's decision each quarter), with a commitment to return at least 60% of surplus cash \u00ab to shareholders through share buybacks (having reached $35 billion net debt \u00ab and subject to maintaining a strong investment grade credit rating), was in the best interest of the company, its shareholders as a whole and other stakeholder groups, as it enabled bp to offer sustainable value with increased investment in low carbon and non-oil and gas ventures.",

        "page_content": "## Corporate governance continued\n\n## Independence\n\nNon-executive directors (NEDs) are expected to exercise independent judgement and to be free from any business or other relationship that could materially interfere with it. This independence is crucial in bringing constructive challenge to the CEO and the leadership team at board meetings, while providing support and guidance to promote meaningful discussion and, ultimately, informed and effective decision making.\n\nThe board regularly reviews the independence of its NEDs, as advised by the company secretary, and takes action to identify and manage conflicts of interests, including those that may arise from significant shareholdings. This process helps to ensure that the influence of third parties does not compromise or override independent judgement.\n\nDirectors are required to provide sufficient information to allow the board to evaluate their independence prior to and following their appointment. As a consequence of regular reviews throughout the year, the board has satisfied itself that there were no matters giving rise to any conflict of interests or which compromised the independence of the NEDs. It has therefore concluded that all bp NEDs are independent.\n\nProfessor Dame Ann Dowling continues to serve on the board notwithstanding that she has served beyond nine years as a NED. Following careful consideration, the board believes that Ann continues to provide constructive challenge and robust scrutiny of matters that come before the board and the committee on which she serves. She has only served with the current executive directors for a year and the overall average tenure of the board is below the FTSE 100 average. In addition, in 2018 the board undertook significant refreshment of its composition. Accordingly, the board is satisfied that Ann continues to demonstrate the qualities of independence in carrying out her duties.\n\n## Appointment and time commitment\n\nThe chairman, senior independent director and other NEDs each have letters of appointment and do not serve, nor are they employed, in any executive capacity. There is no fixed term limit on a director's service; however, in line with good governance practice, bp proposes all directors for annual re-election by shareholders.\n\nUnlike the chairman's letter of appointment, the NEDs' letters of appointment do not set a fixed time commitment. NEDs are expected to allocate appropriate time to effectively discharge their duties. The time required of NEDs fluctuates depending on the demands of bp business and other events. The COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the oversight by the board of the energy transition and associated workload, required the NEDs to spend considerably more time fulfilling their responsibilities towards bp during 2020, than in previous years. This included NEDs dedicating additional time through regular calls with the leadership team to remain informed and help guide the executive through unprecedented times.\n\nThe NEDs' external time commitments are regularly reviewed, ensuring that, even in the exceptional circumstances of a global pandemic, the NEDs are able to allocate appropriate time to bp. The review process is managed by the company secretary, considering NEDs' outside appointments and commitments, including relevant factors such as complexity of company and industry, in particular highly regulated sectors, and issues impacting these other companies. The board has concluded that, notwithstanding the NEDs' other appointments, they are each able to dedicate sufficient time to fulfil their bp duties.\n\nExecutive directors are normally permitted to take up one board appointment at an external company, subject to the agreement of the chairman and after consultation with the company secretary. Bernard Looney and Murray Auchincloss each hold one non-executive directorship, shown on page 74. Prior to retiring from the board in June 2020, Brian Gilvary undertook a role as NED of Barclays PLC, in addition to his NED role with L'Air Liquide S.A.. Following consideration, it was concluded that Brian's two external appointments were unlikely to be detrimental to his ability to perform his duties as outgoing CFO.\n\n## Diversity\n\nAt a time of significant change across the sector, and with bp transitioning to become an Integrated Energy Company, diversity of thought is as important as ever.\n\nOur purpose, to reimagine energy for people and our planet, can only be achieved through collaboration, innovation and constructive\n\nchallenge that derives from having a diverse and inclusive workplace. The board understands and advocates that better decisions and outcomes are achieved when different people, with differences of opinions, from different backgrounds, come together with a common ambition.\n\nWe recognize that diversity can take many forms, whether it be gender, social or ethnic backgrounds, personal identities, age, religion, physical abilities and more. All of which promote diversity of thought and reduce the risk of group think. The board has, and continues to have, regard to all these forms of diversity in respect of its processes including both its appointments and succession plans.\n\nThe board and leadership team believe in leading by example and are pleased to have met the Hampton-Alexander and Parker review targets for 2021.\n\nAt the end of 2020 the board comprised five female directors, representing 45% of the board (2019 42%, 2018 35%).\n\n- Karen Richardson and Johannes Teyssen joined the board on 1 January 2021.\n- Dame Alison Carnwath stepped down from the board on 14 January 2021.\n- As previously announced, Brendan Nelson will be stepping down from the board at the conclusion of the 2021 AGM.\n- The board is pleased that Tushar Morzaria, a Ugandan-born British national, joined in September 2020. He will succeed Brendan Nelson as audit committee chair following the 2021 AGM.\n\nOur senior management, as defined by the Corporate Governance Code 2018, and their direct reports comprise 43% women (2019 38%) and 25% Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) individuals (2019 18%).\n\nWhile bp continues to benefit from the wide array of perspective and vision in decision-making processes and the company culture continues to strengthen through mitigation of group think, bp will continue to strive for increased diversity across its workforce, leadership team and board.\n\nFor more information on our workforce diversity and inclusion see page 57.",

COVID-19 has meant that this engagement had to move online for the majority of 2020. The pinnacle of this virtual engagement was bp week in September 2020, led by Bernard Looney and members of his leadership team. The team innovatively engaged with shareholders giving detailed insights into bp's new strategy and the 2025 and 2030 targets and aims. This engagement was also deliberately structured to allow for the increasingly important ESG constituency to be consulted in determining the targets and aims, including the overlay of the new sustainability frame in support of the new strategy.\n\nThe board receives feedback from shareholders in many ways, particularly through the chairman and leadership team who meet with investors throughout the year. Numerous one-to-one meetings with major institutional investors and proxy advisory groups were hosted by the chairman in 2020. These engagements generated much insightful feedback which was shared with other board members and committees with due regard being given to these views. A similar programme of engagement on matters relating to the 2020 directors' remuneration policy that was approved by shareholders at the AGM was undertaken during the year, led by the chair of the remuneration committee and senior independent director, Paula Reynolds. More details about this engagement are set out in the 2020 directors' remuneration report on page 103.\n\n## Retail investors\n\nIn May we held our annual event for retail investors in conjunction with the UK Shareholders' Association (UKSA) and the UK Individual Shareholders Society. For the first time this event was held virtually. The chairman, company secretary and head of investor relations gave presentations on bp's annual results, strategy and the work of the board. Shareholders' questions were primarily focused on bp's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, bp's sustainability strategy and financial performance.\n\n## AGM\n\nIn common with the practice adopted by many UK quoted companies, the 2020 AGM was held as a 'closed' meeting, with a minimum quorum present, in line with government rules at the time. Shareholders were invited to submit questions to the board before the meeting, all of which were addressed, and the event was broadcast live via webcast on bp.com.\n\nAs expected, voting levels saw a slight decrease with the pandemic and stay-at-home orders disrupting shareholder voting. The overall turnout was 62.1% of the total voting rights, including votes cast as withheld, compared to 67.1% in 2019 and 67.3% in 2018. All resolutions passed at the meeting in line with the board's recommendations.\n\nAt the date of this report, measures put in place by the UK government in response to the COVID-19 pandemic preclude bp from holding an AGM in person. In these exceptional circumstances, bp's 2021 AGM is planned to be a hybrid meeting. Shareholders will not be permitted to attend the meeting in person, but will be able to participate via bp's electronic meeting platform.\n\nThe board will continue to monitor developments in UK government guidance relating to the COVID-19 situation. If circumstances change materially before the date of the AGM, the board may decide to adapt proposed arrangements.\n\n## Shareholder engagement cycle 2020\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nQ1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nQ2\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nQ3\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nQ4\n\n- Fourth quarter and full-year 2019 results and strategy update\n- Ambition launch\n- Investor roadshows with the leadership team post the ambition launch\n- bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2019\n- bp Sustainability Report 2019\n- First quarter 2020 results presentation\n- Investor roadshows with executive management following first quarter 2020 results\n- UKSA (retail shareholders') meeting with the chairman\n- Other institutional shareholder engagement with the chairman\n- 2020 AGM\n- bp Statistical Review of World Energy\n- Second quarter 2020 results and strategy presentation\n- Investor roadshows with executive management follow second quarter 2020 results and strategy\n- Capital markets event - 'bp week'\n- bp Energy Outlook presentation\n- Investor roadshows with the bp leadership team - capital markets event\n- Third quarter 2020 results presentation\n- Investor roadshows with the bp leadership team following third quarter 2020 results",

        "page_content": "## Workforce\n\n## 2020 engagement\n\nWe believe an engaged workforce is critical to us successfully delivering our strategy.\n\nWhen we talk about bp's workforce, we include a wide range of employees, contractors, agency and remote workers across all of our geographical locations.\n\nThe board is responsible for overseeing and monitoring bp's culture and its values. This extends to putting in place mechanisms allowing for workforce views to be reflected in board discussion and decision making, complementing existing mechanisms that are established by the leadership team.\n\nSuch measures include employees being informed on matters of concern to them through bp's intranet and local sites, social media channels, town halls, site visits and webinars including topics such as quarterly results, strategy, the low carbon transition and diversity.\n\nWe also have a number of employee-led forums and business resource groups (BRGs) and aim to build constructive relationships with labour unions formally representing some employees. Employees are consulted on a regular basis through regular team and one-to-one meetings and through our annual 'Pulse' survey.\n\n## Virtual engagements\n\nDuring 2020 restrictions associated with COVID-19 disrupted planned opportunities for the board to engage with the bp workforce in person. As a result, most engagements were conducted virtually.\n\nThe board believes that the approaches and mechanisms described under Site visits, below, enabled effective engagement opportunities with the bp workforce.\n\nThe board is satisfied that during 2020, these were effective alternatives to the proposed workforce engagement methods set out in Provision 5 of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the Code).\n\n## Future of workforce engagement\n\nAs part of its broader review of bp's corporate governance framework, the board discussed whether its current approach to workforce engagement continues to be the most effective mechanism to inform its discussions and the decisions that it takes.\n\nBuilding on the experience that we have had, and the innovative approaches that were taken to workforce engagement through 2020, the board has sought to create a more rigorous framework so that there is clear channel through which the insights emerging from this engagement process will be consolidated and considered in board discussions and decision making. The board also considered the significant changes to the workforce following reinvent bp and bp's wide geographic spread and size. Taking all these factors into account, the board concluded that for 2021 workforce engagement is best overseen by the newly constituted people and governance committee.\n\n## Virtual site visits\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe audit committee conducted a virtual visit and tour of bp's trading floors in London and Houston and a majority of our non-executive directors attended a virtual visit of bpx energy's Permian assets, led by the safety, environment and security assurance committee. During these visits, directors heard directly from the workforce regarding their perceptions of bp's new strategy and how these businesses planned to implement it, as well as deepening their understanding of businesses and functions within bp.\n\nA regular programme of engagement has been developed. Some sessions have a specific engagement purpose while others will simply be an open opportunity to hear views, interests, ideas and concerns. It is intended that a number of these sessions will have no line managers to allow for an unconstrained exchange of views. Engagement locations will be varied across our global operations. Alongside this programme, the 'Pulse' surveys, bp 'Keeping Connected' sessions, site visits (even if virtual) and the chairman's programme of attendance at selected small team sessions will continue.\n\nThe board believes the existing approaches and mechanisms described above enable comprehensive two-way engagement opportunities with bp's workforce, and as such, is satisfied that these are effective alternatives to the proposed workforce engagement methods set out in Provision 5 of the Code.\n\nLooking beyond 2021 the board will continue to assess the effectiveness of its engagement with the workforce and how ultimately this informs the decisions that it takes, including the options provided for in the Code, for example appointing a director from the workforce.\n\n## Business resource groups and focus groups\n\nNon-executive directors engaged virtually with employees in BRGs and focus groups throughout the year, including virtual events organized by the Women in Wells, Future Talent and One Young World alumni forums. Through these engagements the directors heard directly from employees on a range of topics, including bp's new purpose and strategy, employee sentiment - particularly during the reorganization of bp - the impact of COVID-19 on operations and wellbeing, diversity and career progression.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## CEO 'Keeping Connected' webcasts\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur CEO Bernard Looney hosted a series of webcasts featuring guests from across the organization to discuss a range of topics throughout the year, including bp's new purpose, safety, mental health, and reinventing bp. Helge Lund, chairman of the board, joined the CEO as a speaker on two of these webcasts and non-executive directors were also invited to listen in.\n\n>12,500 average viewers per webcast",

        "page_content": "## Corporate governance continued\n\n## Governance framework\n\nWe completely redesigned the bp corporate governance framework in 2020, to more closely align with bp's new purpose - reimagining energy for people and our planet - as well as our new strategy. The framework defines the board's role, to promote the long-term sustainable success of the company, generating value for its shareholders while having regard to its other stakeholders, the impact of its operations on the communities within which it operates and the environment.\n\nThe review had three main strands:\n\n## 1. The role and purpose of the board\n\nThe bp board believes that in order for governance to be effective it needs to have a regular review process across purpose, strategy, culture and values, while maintaining oversight of performance. Clearly defined terms of reference for the board were established together with a roadmap of activity that reflects those issues the board consider most important.\n\nThe board terms of reference identify certain matters that are considered to be of such materiality at a group level that they are reserved for approval by the whole board and cannot be delegated. The matters reserved include, among others, certain investments, entry into new countries, changes to the company's capital structure, distributions and bp's code of conduct. The full list is available on bp.com/governance .\n\n## Purpose\n\n- Considers bp's purpose, which underpins its decision making.\n- Monitors whether bp's strategy, values and culture remain in line with that purpose.\n\n## Culture\n\n## Values\n\n- The board monitors bp's values, ensuring that they are appropriate as the leadership team focuses on the execution of the new strategy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Reviews the ambition and aims of the people plan and in so doing assesses and monitors any impact on culture so as to satisfy itself that bp's purpose, strategy and values continue to be aligned with its culture.\n- Through the people and governance committee, reviews work on bp's ways of working (including integration, agility, wellbeing, workplace, inclusion and digital).\n\n## Strategy\n\n- Receives regular updates to test that the strategy and strategic direction established by the board continue to be the right approach for the long-term sustainable success of bp in line with its purpose.\n- Approves the annual plan and regularly monitors that it is aligned with the approved strategy, including reviewing business development, investment effectiveness and capita allocation.\n- Conducts deep dives across each of the business groups and key strategic areas.\n- Receives regular updates on progress towards the aims and objectives in the sustainability frame.",

Committees\n\nA review of the board committees looking at their purpose, scope and authority with a focus on:\n\n- Fit with the strategic direction of the bp board.\n- Risk and allocation of the review of risk.\n- Alignment with the new leadership structure to give clear oversight.\n\nThe new committee structure under the board is depicted in the diagram (right) and described below.\n\n- The nomination and governance committee was renamed the people and governance committee to reflect its wider remit in covering workforce engagement, wellbeing and talent management.\n- The safety, environment and security assurance committee was renamed the safety and sustainability committee. Its remit has been widened to include monitoring the effectiveness of implementation of bp's sustainability frame, see page 48. This is an important step in light of bp's new purpose and ambition.\n- The other permanent committees remuneration and audit - will remain. The results committee (comprising the chairman, CEO and chief financial officer (CFO)) also remains with delegated authority from the board to approve and authorize the release of the periodic financial statements and dividend announcements.\n- The geopolitical committee has been replaced by a geopolitical advisory council rather than a board committee. It is attended by members of the board and the executive together with advisors who give a wider external view. The geopolitical highest priority risk is overseen at the board.\n\nEach of the four permanent committees has new terms of reference, adopted from 1 January 2021, to set out their role and responsibilities in a clear mandate, which can be found on bp.com/governance .\n\nThe board will continue to review its framework annually to satisfy itself that it continues to be best aligned to bp's purpose and strategy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 3. New ways of working\n\nThe board's corporate governance review extended to documenting the responsibilities of the chairman, the CEO and the senior independent director so that their respective roles are clear both internally and to our external stakeholders. These are available on bp.com/governance .\n\nThe board delegates day-to-day management of the business of the company to the CEO. This includes accountability to oversee the implementation of a comprehensive system of internal controls that are designed to, among other things, identify and manage the risks that are material to bp.\n\nThe board continues to perform its oversight role and monitor bp's performance. This responsibility extends to monitoring bp's management and operations and obtaining assurance about the delivery of its strategy, and to oversee bp's internal control and risk management frameworks. The chairman holds meetings without executive directors present at the start or end of board meetings.\n\nThe CEO is responsible for maintaining a dialogue with the chairman and the board on important and strategic issues facing bp. Strategic opportunities or issues which may arise, or which are on the CEO's mind, are discussed at board meetings and the CEO welcomes constructive challenge from non-executive directors in light of their wider experience outside bp.\n\nThe changes to bp's purpose and strategy this year and bp's journey towards becoming an Integrated Energy Company have given rise to the need for greater visibility on the decisionmaking criteria for capital expenditure and new business transactions. Accordingly, the board spends time examining and discussing the impact of portfolio changes such as strategic acquisitions and the allocation of capital, along with the annual plan, in order to gain a clear understanding of the methodology of capital allocation.\n\nThe board reviews capital investments that are more than $3 billion for resilient hydrocarbons, more than $1 billion for all transition or low carbon investments and, in addition, any significant inorganic acquisition that is exceptional or unique in nature.\n\nClear information flows have been established between the board and the leadership team. This allows greater time at board meetings to focus on strategic and people topics, enabling a fuller understanding and quality discussion of the challenges to deliver our new strategy.",

A formal and comprehensive induction is provided to all directors following their appointment. This includes meetings with management, technical briefings and site visits.\n\n## Board induction programme\n\nTushar Morzaria, appointed on 1 September 2020, undertook a tailored and robust induction against the challenging backdrop of COVID-19.\n\nThe programme was adapted to accommodate the inability to participate in physical meetings and site visits. Digital solutions were therefore deployed to facilitate Tushar's induction.\n\nTushar looks forward to continuing his introduction to bp's operations and learning more about the business and its people.\n\nThe programme included meetings with a wide range of senior management within bp, the external auditor and other key advisors.

The review also looked at the composition and diversity of the board and how effectively the directors work together.\n\nIn early 2021, the board held a special meeting to discuss the feedback, focusing on strategic and operational oversight, board development and maintaining a dynamic and flexible approach to board and committee agendas. An action plan for areas of focus was agreed.\n\nFollowing this meeting, the senior independent director led a meeting with the non-executive directors without the chairman present to appraise his performance.

        "page_content": "## Activities during the year\n\nReflecting its role in respect of board succession planning, early in 2020, the committee's priority was to identify new non-executive directors to succeed two of the longer-serving members of the board - Sir Ian Davis and Brendan Nelson.\n\nCandidates were sought with the technical and professional skills to take on certain committee responsibilities, including in particular the chairmanship of the audit committee, plus also candidates who would be able to support the chair of the board as the senior independent director.\n\nThese characteristics were broadened so as to identify candidates who would also enhance the strategic discussion in the boardroom. External headhunters were engaged to support the process and identify candidates. These headhunters had no other connection to the company or its directors during the year.\n\nThe search process led to the appointment of Tushar Morzaria in September 2020 and, from among the existing board members, Paula Reynolds as the senior independent director.\n\nEach of these appointments was considered to fulfil the search criteria, including the succession of the audit committee chairmanship.\n\nThe committee also agreed new search categories for other NED candidates, broadly covering the areas of digital/technology and energy, reflecting the strategic shift of bp to become an Integrated Energy Company and the dependency on digital as an enabler to transform companies. Karen Richardson and Johannes Teyssen together bring extensive financial, technological, transformation and energy industry experience to the board.\n\nPlanning for new board members to help ensure a strong focus on strategic execution, safety and sustainability and connectivity to bp's core businesses and markets continues.\n\nCommittee meetings in 2020 included updates and discussions on the redesign of bp's corporate governance framework, more details of which are set out on page 88.\n\n## Skills matrix\n\nBackground and experience\n\n|                         | Energy markets   |

        "page_content": "## Chair's introduction\n\nI am pleased to introduce the report on the audit committee's activities during the year. During the year, the committee has continued to assist the board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, by monitoring the integrity of the group's financial reporting and risk management systems, and also by challenging management and external auditors across a number of key areas of focus, including key accounting judgements and control issues.\n\nIn addition to the routine committee agenda for the year, the committee was particularly focused on the impacts of bp's reorganization and the COVID-19 pandemic on financial performance, the financial control environment and resilience.\n\nI welcome the addition of Tushar Morzaria to the committee from September 2020. His broad financial experience is immensely beneficial to the committee and bp. Following year end, Dame Alison Carnwath stepped down from the committee and the board. I would like to thank her for her diligent contribution to the committee over the years.\n\nThis is my last report as chair of the audit committee. I would like to thank my board and committee colleagues, as well as management, for the open, challenging and constructive nature of discussions we have conducted during my tenure. As I hand over the committee chair to Tushar in May 2021, I remain confident that bp is well-positioned for continued resilience and success.\n\n## Brendan Nelson\n\nCommittee chair\n\n## Activities during the year\n\n## How the committee reviewed financial disclosure\n\nThe committee reviewed the quarterly, half-year and annual financial statements with management, focusing on the:\n\n- Integrity of the group's financial reporting process.\n- Clarity of disclosure.\n- Compliance with relevant legal and financial reporting standards.\n- Application of accounting policies and judgements.\n\nAs part of its review, the committee received regular updates from management and the external auditor in relation to accounting judgements and estimates, including those relating to recoverability of asset carrying values. The committee keeps under review the frequency of results reporting during the year.\n\nIn considering the bp Annual Report and Form 20-F , the committee assessed whether the report was fair, balanced and understandable and also whether it provided the information necessary for shareholders to assess the group's position and performance, business model and strategy. In making this assessment, the committee examined disclosures during the year, discussed the requirement with senior management, confirmed that representations to the external auditors had been evidenced and reviewed reports relating to internal control over financial reporting. The committee made a recommendation to the board, who in turn reviewed the report as a whole, confirmed the assessment and approved the report's publication.\n\n## How accounting judgements and estimates were considered and addressed\n\nThe committee was briefed on a quarterly basis in 2020 on the group's key accounting judgements and estimates. The primary areas of judgement and estimation which were considered by the committee are set out below. These areas were discussed with management and the external auditor throughout the year and during the preparation of these financial statements. The committee is satisfied that the financial statements appropriately address the key accounting judgements and estimates both in respect of the amounts reported and disclosures made.\n\nDuring the year, the committee also considered and approved a change to bp's accounting policy relating to physically settled commodity contracts, with effect from 1 January 2021.\n\nThe committee's process for considering key accounting judgements and estimates included an assessment of matters at various stages during the year. This primarily included the key accounting judgements and estimates set out on pages 98 and 99. The committee also considered and addressed key accounting estimates and judgements relating to provisions, pensions and other post-retirement benefits, and supplier financing arrangements via briefings and review of the group's assumptions. See Notes 23, 24 and 29 respectively for further information.",

        "page_content": "## Corporate governance continued\n\n## How risks were reviewed\n\nThe principal risks allocated to the audit committee for monitoring in 2020 included those associated with:\n\nTrading activities: including risks arising from shortcomings or failures in systems, risk management methodology, internal control processes or employees.\n\nIn reviewing this risk, the committee focused on external market developments and how bp's trading function had responded to a rapidly changing environment, including enhancing its control environment policies to strengthen its compliance and control culture. The committee further considered updates in the trading and shipping function's risk management programme, including compliance with regulatory developments, activities in response to cyber threats, and efficiencies derived from more collaborative ways of working across group functions and businesses and the use of digital technologies. The committee also considered the impact of COVID-19 on operations and the control environment associated with trading activities, with particular reference to operational considerations associated with increased remote working.\n\n## Compliance with business and regulations:\n\nincluding ethical misconduct or breaches of applicable laws or regulations that could damage bp's reputation, adversely affect operational results and/or shareholder value and potentially affect bp's licence to operate.\n\nThe committee reviewed the group's programme on controls and contingencies for managing this risk, including enhanced approaches to monitor the risk in light of business evolution (such as an increase in venturing), as well as other internal and external trends.\n\nCyber security risk: including inappropriate access to or misuse of information and systems and disruption of business activity.\n\nThe committee reviewed ongoing developments in the cyber security landscape, including events in the oil and gas industry and within bp itself. The review focused on a strengthened approach in order to manage the ever-increasing threat of cyber risk and maintain cyber security, as the focus on a digital transformation across bp continues.\n\nFinancial liquidity: including the risk associated with external market conditions, supply and demand and prices achieved for bp's products which could impact financial performance.\n\nThe committee reviewed the key assumptions and underlying judgements used to manage the group's liquidity and capital investments (including appraisal, effectiveness and efficiency).\n\n## How other reviews were undertaken\n\nOther reviews undertaken in 2020 by the committee included the following, and in each case where the committee received segment and function reviews, each reported on strategy, performance, capability and risk management as well as on their first, second and third lines of defence policies as appropriate:\n\n- Information technology and services: including the functions performance, strategy and optimization of core services to enable the digitization and modernization of bp at pace.\n- bp ventures and Launchpad: including the purpose, capabilities, operating model, governance and performance of these entities.\n- Reinvent bp programme: including a review of programme milestones and risks, as well as business continuity and management of change.\n- Tax: including strategy, performance, key drivers of the group's effective tax rate, the global indirect tax environment, the tax modernization programme and the evolving approach to management of key risks. The committee also reviewed bp's tax transparency report.\n- Internal audit functional review: including a five-year plan for the function in a reinvented bp.\n- Trading and shipping: including strategy, performance, capability and risk management.\n- Effectiveness of investment: annual review of performance of projects with sanctioned capital over a certain threshold.\n- Internal controls: assessments of management's plans to remediate the external auditor's control findings.\n\n## How internal control and risk management was assessed\n\nInternal audit\n\nThe committee received quarterly reports on\n\nthe findings of internal audit in 2020, including their assessment of issues raised in previous years, especially those relating to IT access controls. The committee also received a report from internal audit on their annual review of the system of internal control and risk management. The committee met privately with the SVP, internal audit and key members of his leadership team. The committee continued to monitor and review the effectiveness and capabilities of internal audit during the year. During the year, the committee received a report on the findings of an assessment conducted by internal audit of its conformance with the Internal Audit Code of Practice which was published in January 2020. The committee noted that internal audit conforms with the vast majority of recommendations set out in the code. Actions to achieve full conformance with the code were also noted.\n\n## Training and briefings\n\nThe committee considered market updates and developments throughout the year. This included technical accounting updates from the SVP accounting reporting control on developments in financial reporting and accounting policy, as well as on accounting and disclosure changes that would be introduced as a result of the reorganization of the group. The committee also received briefings on specific topics, including non-operated joint ventures, and data analytics used by the external auditor.\n\n## Site visit during the year\n\nIn October 2020, the committee conducted a virtual visit of the trading & shipping function, including virtual presentations from the trading floor, covering low carbon trading, global power and global crude. Key areas of discussion during this site visit included the impacts of oil price volatility, COVID-19 and the reinvent bp programme on the business and its operations during 2020.",

        "page_content": "## FRC thematic review\n\nThe bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2019 was included in the FRC's sample for its limited scope thematic review on reporting on the impact of climate change. bp subsequently received a letter request for information from the FRC's Corporate Reporting Review team. The audit committee considered the letter and bp's detailed response thereto, which enabled the FRC to close its enquiries. The committee notes the further enhancements made to disclosures in relation to climate change and the energy transition in this annual report.\n\nAn FRC review provides no assurance that bp's Annual Report 2019 was correct in all material respects. The FRC's role was not to verify the information provided but to consider compliance with reporting requirements. Its letters are written on the basis that the FRC (which includes the FRC's officers, employees and agents) accepts no liability for reliance on them by bp or any third party, including but not limited to investors and shareholders.\n\n## External audit\n\n## How the committee assessed audit risk\n\nThe external auditor set out its audit plan for 2020, identifying significant audit risks to be addressed during the course of the audit. These included:\n\n- Impairment of upstream oil and gas property, plant and equipment.\n- Impairment of exploration and appraisal assets.\n- Accounting for structured commodity transactions.\n- Valuation of level 3 instruments in trading and shipping revenue recognition.\n- Management override of controls.\n\nThe committee received updates during the year on the audit process, including how the auditor had challenged the group's assumptions on these issues.\n\n## How the committee assessed audit fees\n\nThe audit committee reviews the fee structure, resourcing and terms of engagement for the external auditor annually; in addition it reviews the non-audit services that the auditor provides to the group on a quarterly basis.\n\nFees paid to the external auditor for the year were $54 million (2019 $49 million), of which 1.9% was for non-audit and other assurance services (see Financial statements - Note 36). The audit committee is satisfied that this level of fee is appropriate in respect of the audit services provided and that an effective audit can be\n\nconducted for this fee. Non-audit or non-audit related assurance fees were $1 million (2019 $1 million). Non-audit or non-audit related services consisted of other assurance services.\n\n## How the committee assessed audit effectiveness\n\nManagement undertook a survey which comprised questions across the following:\n\n- (i) The main criteria to measure the auditor's performance were:\n- -  Robustness of the audit process\n- -  Independence and objectivity\n- -  Quality of delivery\n- -  Quality of people and service\n- (ii)  bp's commitment to the audit; and\n- (iii) Aligned audit approach - which sought to measure progress against the commitments from the audit tender.\n\nYear on year, the overall score from the survey increased by +3%. Improvements were seen across audit effectiveness and service quality, including a number areas of focus that had been identified in the previous survey.\n\nThe committee also held private meetings with the external auditor during the year and the committee chair met separately with the external auditor and group head of audit at least quarterly.\n\nThe effectiveness of the external auditor is evaluated by the audit committee. The committee assessed the auditor's approach to providing audit services. On the basis of such assessment, the committee concluded that the audit team was providing the required quality in relation to the provision of the services. The audit team had shown the necessary commitment and ability to provide the services together with a demonstrable depth of knowledge, robustness, independence and objectivity as well as an appreciation of complex issues. The team had posed constructive challenge to management where appropriate.\n\n## How the auditor reappointment and independence was assessed\n\nThe committee considers the reappointment of the external auditor each year before making a recommendation to the board. The committee assesses the independence of the external auditor on an ongoing basis and the external auditor is required to rotate the lead audit partner every five years and other senior audit staff every five to seven years. No partners or senior staff associated with the bp audit may transfer to the group.\n\n## How the committee had oversight of non-audit services\n\nThe audit committee is responsible for bp's policy on non-audit services and the approval of non-audit services. Audit objectivity and independence is safeguarded through the prohibition of non-audit tax services and the limitation of audit-related work which falls within defined categories. bp's policy on non-audit services states that the auditor may not perform non-audit services that are prohibited by the SEC, Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB) and the UK Financial Reporting Council (FRC).\n\nThe audit committee approves the terms of all audit services as well as permitted audit-related and non-audit services in advance. The external auditor is considered for permitted non-audit services only when its expertise and experience of bp is important.\n\nApprovals for individual engagements of pre-approved permitted services below certain thresholds are delegated to the SVP accounting reporting control or the chief financial officer. Any proposed service not included in the permitted services categories must be approved in advance either by the audit committee chair or the audit committee before engagement commences. The audit committee, chief financial officer and SVP accounting reporting control monitor overall compliance with bp's policy on audit-related and non-audit services, including whether the necessary pre-approvals have been obtained. The categories of permitted and pre-approved services are outlined in principal accountant's fees and services on page 327.",

This includes monitoring the management of personal and process safety risk, security and environment risks and receiving assurance that processes to identify and mitigate such non-financial risks are appropriate in their design and effective in their implementation.\n\n## Key responsibilities during 2020\n\nThe committee receives specific reports from the business segments and functions, which include, but are not limited to, the safety and operational risk function, shipping, internal audit and group security. The SASC can access any other independent advice and counsel it requires on an unrestricted basis. The SASC and audit committee worked together, through their chairs and secretaries, to ensure that agendas did not overlap or omit coverage of any key risks during the year.\n\n## Meetings and attendance\n\nThere were six committee meetings in 2020. All directors attended every meeting for which they were eligible. In addition to the committee members, all SASC meetings were attended by the CEO, the SVP for safety and operational risk (S&OR) and the SVP internal audit and/or his delegate. The EVP legal also attended some of the meetings. At the conclusion of each meeting the committee scheduled private sessions for the committee members only, without the presence of executive management, to discuss any issues arising and the quality of the meeting. The CEO receives invitations to join the private meetings on an ad hoc basis and at least once a year the SVP internal audit is invited to a private meeting with the committee.\n\n## Membership\n\nMelody Meyer\n\nMember since May 2017 and chair since November 2019\n\nNils Andersen\n\nMember (resigned March 2020)\n\nProfessor Dame Ann Dowling\n\nMember\n\nSir John Sawers\n\nMember\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Chair's introduction\n\nI am pleased to present my second report as chair of the SASC. During 2020, the committee continued to work with the bp leadership team to promote safe and reliable operations within the organization.\n\nOperational risk management remained a key area of focus during 2020, against the challenging backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic with the result that bp maintained a good safety record during the year despite these challenges. The committee (together with other non-executive directors) conducted a virtual visit of bpx energy Permian assets in December 2020. We were very impressed with the safety culture and performance demonstrated by the bpx energy colleagues with whom we interacted during this virtual visit, and we look forward to being able to conduct a physical visit in due course.\n\nAs part of the review by the board of its governance framework, the committee was renamed as the safety and sustainability committee with effect from 1 January 2021. The committee's remit has also been expanded to include monitoring the effectiveness of the implementation of bp's sustainability frame. This is an important step in light of bp's new purpose and ambition and I look forward to continuing to work with the bp leadership team in furtherance of the new purpose, underpinned by safety and sustainability.\n\nNils Andersen stepped down from the committee and the board in March 2020. I would like to thank him for his valuable contribution and commitment to the committee and I welcome Johannes Teyssen as a new member of the committee from the beginning of 2021.\n\n## Melody Meyer\n\nCommittee chair",

Internal audit provided quarterly reports on its assurance work and its annual review of the system of internal control and risk management.\n\nThe committee also received regular reports from the CEO and SVP S&OR on operational risk, including regular reports prepared on the group's health, safety, security and environmental performance and operational integrity. These included meeting-by-meeting measures of personal and process safety, environmental and regulatory compliance, security and cyber risk analysis, as well as quarterly reports from internal audit. In addition, the SVP, internal audit regularly met in private with the chair and other members of the committee over the course of the year. During the year the committee received separate reports on bp's management of risks relating to:\n\n- Marine\n- Wells\n- Pipelines\n- Explosion or release at our facilities\n- Major security incidents\n- Cyber security (process control networks)\n\nThe committee reviewed these risks and their management and mitigation in depth with relevant executive management. The committee reviewed the 2020 forward programme for the internal audit function. The committee supported the remuneration committee in relation to remuneration policy.\n\n## Virtual site visit\n\nIn December 2020 the members of the committee (together with the non-executive directors of the board) made a virtual visit to the bpx energy Permian site. Discussions during this visit covered a broad range of bpx energy health, safety and environment matters and provided an opportunity for effective virtual engagement with bpx energy staff.\n\n## Corporate reporting\n\nThe committee oversaw the bp Sustainability Report 2019 .

Although the council is not a formal committee of the board, its membership includes other directors, certain members of the bp leadership team and three external advisors, with myself as chair. The geopolitical highest priority risk is now overseen by the board as a whole, informed by feedback from the council.\n\n## Sir John Sawers\n\nCommittee chair\n\n## Activities during the year\n\nEarly in the year, the committee considered the\n\npotential impact on bp of policies and plans of the new EU Commission and new UK government elected in December 2019. Later in the year, the committee considered the geopolitics of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on businesses and policies. The impacts of different potential outcomes of the November US election were discussed by the committee at its meeting in September 2020. The committee also received periodic geopolitical updates on a number of territories in which bp has significant interests throughout the year.",

Yet the bp team operated safely and reliably, ran the business as well as could possibly be expected, and launched a strategic transformation of the company.\n\nThat bp achieved so much last year is a credit to everyone in the company - from the leadership to the front lines. Together, they delivered the energy the world needs, and positioned the company for the future.\n\nNevertheless, as COVID-19 took its toll around the globe, there were consequences for bp's financial outcomes in 2020. The remuneration committee always seeks to align employee reward with shareholder experience. Thus, despite extraordinary efforts on the part of the organization, we decided that there should be no 2020 pay-out for all those who normally participate in our broadly-applicable annual bonus plan.\n\nWe know that this decision was painful for bp's people, many of whom count on earning a cash bonus as part of their personal and family financial planning. While words cannot substitute for remuneration not received, the committee wishes to place on record our gratitude for all that bp people achieved amidst the environment they faced. We look forward to better days ahead.\n\n## Shareholder engagement\n\nThroughout this challenging period when we had many decisions to make regarding metrics and reward, the committee has benefited from engagement with our shareholders. The remuneration policy under which we now operate was directly shaped by a meeting we held with bp's top 25 shareholders and other proxy representatives in 2019. We appreciated shareholders' overwhelming support (96.58% approval) of the new policy at our AGM last May. Throughout 2020, we have continued to meet (virtually) with our largest shareholders to discuss a range of performance and incentive topics in detail. We are grateful for your counsel and hope you will see your advice reflected in the decisions which we have reached. We ask for your support of this directors' remuneration report, and the decisions described herein, at the forthcoming annual general meeting.",

        "page_content": "## Directors' remuneration report continued\n\nIn this report, the committee continues its practice of scrutinizing both one- and three-year performance. Even in the absence of paying annual bonuses for 2020, we have included some discussion on results to give a balanced view of what worked well and what disappointed. This report covers our decisions for 2020 and the details regarding our implementation of the 2020 remuneration policy for 2021 and beyond. The highlights are provided immediately below.\n\n## Key remuneration outcomes for 2020\n\nNo pay-out under our 2020 annual bonus plan.\n\n- There was no pay-out under the annual bonus plan for any of the participating employees\n\nLower vesting for the 2018-2020 equity plan.\n\n- The vesting outcome for our 2018-20 performance shares cycle is 32.5% of maximum, down from 71.2% in the previous cycle, and from an average of over 66% over the last six cycles. It is worth noting that the committee made no alterations to the performance measures or targets on which these awards were based, nor any discretionary adjustment to the vesting outcome. This vesting outcome applies equally to our former executive directors, and to our new CEO and CFO in respect to their preappointment performance share awards.\n\n## Key remuneration decisions for 2021 and beyond\n\n- To recognize the efforts of the wider workforce, virtually all employees will receive an above-market pay increase in 2021. Large numbers of our employees received no pay adjustment in 2020 or had their increase deferred for six months. Given the large reduction in headcount and all the responsibility this action places on those who remain, we agreed with management's plan to increase salaries across-the-board, and ahead of market. Any time salaries rise, the cost of other remuneration that hinges off salary rises as well. At the same time, we are obligated to monitor disparate impacts and overall welfare of the workforce. We will, therefore, continue to monitor and balance the costs of the programme with wider workforce pay issues.\n- We considered the approach to salary for our executive directors apart from the wider workforce. We embrace restraint as a guiding\n\nprinciple, but restraint must be balanced with fair reward for contribution. The board has been gratified by the immediacy of Bernard Looney's impact in leading the organisation, and in refreshing bp's purpose, strategy and organisation. We propose to recognize his efforts with an increase of 2.75% salary with effect from the annual general meeting. This increase is significantly lower than the increase that our UK professional workforce will receive on their pay review date in 2021.\n\n- Murray Auchincloss has likewise made an immediate impact since his appointment. He fully assumed the challenges of the CFO role and has forged a strong partnership alongside Bernard. We set his initial salary in 2020 at a level below comparable rates for finance directors in the FTSE 30, until we could be certain of the contribution he would bring to the role. Shareholders will recall our policy is to keep executive increases within the boundary of wider workforce increases, except in specific circumstances. We find that Murray is already contributing beyond our expectations of even a seasoned CFO. Given his criticality to the execution of our strategy, we conclude that adjusting his below-market salary is such a specific circumstance. We therefore intend to increase his salary by 8% to \u00a3750,500, following the annual general meeting, placing him in line with the median rate for FTSE 30 CFOs. It is our intention, subject to the committee's view of Murray's continued development and success in role, to bring his salary in line with that of his predecessor and other CFOs in similarly challenging roles. We anticipate that this may require increases somewhat above the wider workforce average in the future.\n- In 2021 we have made an all-employee share award to allow employees to participate in the success that a reinvented bp can deliver. The majority of employees will receive restricted shares vesting in 2025, while more senior employees will receive share options to be exercised from 2025 onward and with a ten-year term.\n- We are bringing our metrics and targets for both the 2021 annual bonus and the 2021-23 performance share into line with bp's new strategy and the refreshed commitments to financial performance. The changes are\n- described in detail in this report and we hope you will see how closely we have sought to align these targets to the commitments that management have articulated to investors.\n- The 2021-23 awards will be in line with approved policy and the grant size is unchanged from prior years. All share awards will be granted after the annual meeting and pricing will be based on the preceding 90 days.\n\n## Overview of financial performance, operating achievements, and strategic progress\n\nOur 2020 annual bonus plan consisted of measures associated with financial performance and operations. Our long-term share plan consisted of financial measures and strategic progress. Each area of performance is summarized below to provide a sense of how we evaluated overall performance.\n\nFinancial performance for bonus purposes was measured in terms of underlying replacement cost profit and free cash flow. For performance shares, we measured return on average capital employed (ROACE) and relative total shareholder return (rTSR). In neither the short nor the long-term plan did actual financial performance meet targets.\n\nOver the three-year performance period, however, bp ranked third out of the five supermajors for rTSR purposes which accounted for a modest 12.5% vesting of the 2018-20 performance share grant. To offer some perspective, we note that during 2020 the company reduced net debt by $6.5 billion to $39 billion. In announcing the sale of a share of bp's interest in Oman's Block 61, we continue making good progress towards the 2025 target of $25 billion of proceeds from divestments. Importantly, too, management initiated the review of bp's portfolio of assets in 2020 and recommended significant impairments and exploration writeoffs. Thus, management took the necessary steps to address the value of our assets given the energy transition, in full knowledge that they would forego near-term benefit because of these actions. We think this reflects well on the system of reward - not paying when performance is below expectations - but also on the integrity of the leadership which is nonetheless doing the right thing to create a sustainable future.",

        "page_content": "Despite the challenges of the pandemic, operations were strong in 2020, with refining availability of 96%, upstream plant reliability of 94%, and delivery of four new major projects. Safety trends were also positive, with process safety events, recordable injury frequency, and other key safety and environmental metrics significantly lower than in 2019. While workforce hours were down, bp people safely managed increased COVID-19-related risks and travel restrictions, and increased quarantine periods associated with cross-border crew rotations, while ensuring safety critical staffing and emergency response preparedness. bp teams also delivered above-target sustainable emissions reductions in 2020.\n\nStrategic progress is the other area we assessed; in the 2018-20 performance share plan it carried a 20% weight.\n\nAs we consulted with shareholders, we can appreciate that the inclusion of 'strategic progress' in a scorecard can be a double-edged sword. On the one side, measuring strategic\n\n## Remuneration committee\n\n## Role of the committee\n\nThe role of the committee is to determine and recommend to the board the remuneration policy and to set chair, executive director and leadership team remuneration. It reviews workforce remuneration and monitors related policies, satisfying itself that incentives and rewards are aligned with bp's culture. In determining the policy, the committee takes into account various factors, including workforce remuneration, and structures the policy to promote the long-term success of the company and linking reward to performance.\n\n## Key responsibilities\n\n- Recommend to the board the remuneration principles and policies for the executive directors while considering remuneration and related policies for employees below the board and the executive team.\n- Set and approve the terms of engagement, remuneration, benefits and termination of employment for the executive directors, leadership team and the company secretary in accordance with the policy.\n- Prepare the annual remuneration report to shareholders to show how the policy has been implemented.\n\nprogress more specifically aligns our strategy and the reward we will confer. On the other side, strategic progress does not always carry with it straightforward metrics that are more typically used in remuneration designs. Thus the committee must use its judgement and explain its rationale. We do so here on page 111. We hope you will agree that we've been thoughtful in evaluating the organization's strategic performance over the 2018-20 period.\n\n## Other decisions and forward-looking activity\n\nIn our approved 2020 remuneration policy, we retained flexibility to adjust performance measures and weightings in both our annual bonus and performance share plans. Given the shift in the business mix and the exigencies of our financial frame, for the 2021 annual bonus, we are introducing two new financial measures: cumulative cash cost reductions (weighted at 25%); and an operational measure to reflect margin share from convenience retail and electrification (weighted at 10%). These changes\n\n- Approve the principles of any equity plan that requires shareholder approval.\n- Ensure termination terms and payments to executive directors and leadership team are fair.\n- Receive and consider regular updates on workforce views and engagement initiatives related to remuneration, insight from data sources on pay ratio, gender pay gap and other workforce remuneration outcomes as appropriate.\n- Maintain appropriate dialogue with shareholders on remuneration matters.\n\n## Membership\n\nPaula Rosput Reynolds Member since\n\nSeptember 2017 and chair since May 2018\n\nNils Andersen\n\nMember (resigned March 2020)\n\nPamela Daley\n\nMember\n\nSir Ian Davis\n\nMember (resigned 30 December 2020)\n\nMelody Meyer\n\nMember since March 2020\n\nBrendan Nelson\n\nMember\n\nrepresent the committee's best judgment for fine-tuning measures to the new strategy. While we are adding two new measures, we will continue to measure annual performance of our operations, of cash generation, of sustainable emissions reductions and of safety.\n\nFor the 2021-23 performance share awards, we will introduce an earnings per share growth (EBIDA CAGR) measure alongside the existing ROACE measure (each weighted at 20%), and will reduce the weighting on rTSR (from 40% to 20%). Many of you will recall that the relevance of rTSR and the selection of an appropriate peer group were widely, but inconclusively discussed, during our September 2019 stakeholder engagement session. Against that backdrop, our judgment is that if the bp team can achieve the multi-year financial results to which it committed in July 2020, then the team should be rewarded, with only a modest calibration to what other energy companies accomplish over these three years.\n\n## Meetings and attendance\n\nThe chairman and the CEO attend meetings of the committee except for matters relating to their own remuneration. The CEO is consulted on the remuneration of the CFO, the leadership team and more broadly on remuneration across the wider employee population. Both the CEO and CFO are consulted on matters relating to the group's performance.\n\nbp's EVP people and culture, SVP reward and wellbeing and advisors attend meetings and other executives may attend where necessary. The committee consults other board committees on the group's performance and on issues relating to the exercise of judgement or discretion as necessary.\n\nThe committee met nine times during the year. All directors attended each meeting that they were eligible to attend, except Sir Ian Davis who was not able to attend two meetings, and Pamela Daley and Brendan Nelson who each missed one committee meeting.",

Strategic progress metrics will be weighted at 40%. Several shareholders have asked us to be more specific about which measures from the September 2020 presentations we intend to use in evaluating strategic progress, and I say more on this at page 109 in the alignment to strategy section.\n\nThe leadership team has been bold in seeking to transform bp and has shown exemplary cooperation in developing these challenging performance measures.\n\n## Wider workforce and activities through the pandemic\n\nMuch of the committee's time this year was dominated by the pandemic, which had a serious impact on workforce and remuneration matters.\n\nWith our plans to reinvent bp already proceeding when the pandemic hit, bp's leadership committed that no redundancies would take place for a minimum of three months to allay immediate concerns about job security. Also, bp sought no pandemic relief in the form of grants or furlough funding from any governments anywhere in the world.\n\nDespite the limited ability to meet in person, the committee and the board engaged with employees virtually throughout the year. Despite the fact that 2020 was a year with many discouraging moments, we find that the\n\nemployees are highly engaged - and willing to speak their minds - which bodes well for the future.\n\nFrom the outset of the pandemic's impact, mental health as well as physical well-being were of concern. Both Bernard and our chair Helge Lund donated 20% of their salaries to charities dealing with mental health issues from April 2020. In addition, Bernard directed the company to make a substantial donation to the UK mental health charity, Mind. This generosity is consistent with the leadership's support for mental health within the company, and given the duration and far-reaching effects of the pandemic, was exceptionally far-sighted.\n\n## Closing thanks\n\nFollowing their retirement from the board, I thank Nils Andersen and Sir Ian Davis for their many contributions to this committee, while welcoming Melody Meyer and, most recently, Tushar Morzaria.\n\nAt the annual general meeting, Brendan Nelson plans to stand down and his particular brand of sober judgement will be greatly missed by the committee.\n\nThe technology we have all deployed in the last year has only served to enhance our consultation with shareholders and their advisors. These virtual face-to-face contacts from our respective homes have allowed for frequent conversations. We thank you for fitting us into your long days, and as you review the details provided in this report, we welcome your comments.\n\n## Paula Rosput Reynolds\n\nChair of the remuneration committee 22 March 2021\n\nIn this directors' remuneration report RC profit (loss), underlying RC profit, return on average capital employed, operating cash flow excluding Gulf of Mexico oil spill payments, margin share for convenience and electrification, net debt and cumulative cash cost reductions are non-GAAP measures.

        "page_content": "## Directors' remuneration report continued\n\n## Alignment with strategy\n\n## The frame for our remuneration policy and practice\n\nLast year we refreshed our remuneration policy following wide consultation, individually and collectively, with shareholders. Through that consultation we decided to retain the strongly performance-oriented reward model that served us well in the previous decade. Thus, we retained and built upon the established policy structure, with the advantage this brings of being wellunderstood and accepted by our executives and wider workforce alike.\n\nBy design, this refreshed policy allows for ongoing alignment to the nearer-term needs of our strategy, with measures intended to evolve in line with the pace and form of the energy transition. This design reflected the four broad themes that emerged from our engagement with shareholders:\n\n- A clear end-to-end alignment from strategy, through measurable performance indicators and reward outcomes, to shareholder experience.\n- To balance our contribution to the energy transition with delivering shareholder returns, with encouragement to use appropriate discretion given the complexity of the environment in the energy transition.\n- To ensure strategic measures align to long-term sustainability, relative to a wide peer group.\n- To use meaningful and transparent performance indicators reflecting our progress in the energy transition and reductions to our carbon impact.\n\n## bp's purpose, ambition and strategy\n\nbp's purpose, to reimagine energy for people and our planet, is complemented with a clear and unambiguous ambition - to be a net zero company by 2050 or sooner and to help the world get to net zero. Our strategy is transformational, to pivot from International Oil Company to Integrated Energy Company, from a focus on developing resources, to a focus on delivering solutions for customers. As seen below, this strategy is grounded in three focus areas and three sources of differentiation, set within a sustainability frame linking our strategy to our purpose.\n\n## Connecting remuneration to strategy\n\nAlignment with strategy is evident in:\n\n- Clearly measurable safety, sustainability, strategic and financial measures for each cycle of annual bonus and/or performance shares.\n- The judgements we make to assess qualitative progress against strategic objectives.\n- Our 'underpin' assessment to take safety outcomes into account prior to determining the final performance shares vesting percentage.\n- Our overarching discretionary decisions to ensure share plan outcomes reflect shareholder experience, environmental, societal, and other inputs.\n\nAchieving balance between safety, sustainability, strategic and financial measures is an essential consideration for the committee in applying policy. Considering the three 'focus areas' of bp's strategy, generating cash from our resilient and focused hydrocarbons business is the critical element to support bp's transition into the two growth areas - low carbon electricity and energy, and convenience and mobility. We expect bp to be directing 40% or more of its investment into these areas by 2030, but that reallocation of\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nspend will be a gradual and non-linear matter, requiring flexibility and judgement from leadership. Our commitment is to oversee this transition with care, applying remuneration policy to incentivize results in the most critical areas.\n\nIn our most recent consideration we have therefore aligned the strategic performance measures of our 2021-23 performance share awards entirely to the three 'focus areas' of bp strategy: low carbon electricity and energy; convenience and mobility; and resilient and focused hydrocarbons. This means that, for now, we are consciously not introducing measures related to the three 'sources of differentiation', in the belief that we need to limit the total number of measures and highlight those which are the most pressing.\n\nThis has also led us to review our decisionmaking from last September when we set strategic measures for the 2020-22 performance share awards. At that time, we had chosen four strategic elements - two of the focus areas, and two of the sources of differentiation. With the hindsight of our more recent discussions and a deeper understanding of how the strategy is likely to yield most value, we realise those earlier decisions were not the best. Therefore, we are taking the unusual step of amending our 2020-22 strategic progress measures mid-cycle, to align them instead with the measures of our 2021-23 cycle. Thus we bring focus to the most critical areas, align the measures for the first two cycles of share award under our 2020 policy, and can develop a common set of performance metrics that will allow us to transparently report progress across all three cycles of award under the 2020 policy (ie. those starting in 2020, 2021 and 2022).\n\nThe table on page 109 summarizes the alignment between performance measures and strategy, showing the weightings associated with each.",

Bernard and Murray were granted 2018-20 performance share awards under the Group Share Value Plan (GSVP) for bp group leaders, rather than under the Executive Director Incentive Plan (EDIP). The GSVP and EDIP both use the same scorecard, therefore the comments in this section apply equally to our former and new executive directors, as well as our group leaders, even though they relate to performance shares awarded under different plans.\n\nThe financial outcomes for the three-year period were disappointing. Return on average capital employed averaged 2.6% over 2019 and 2020 (the ROACE measurement period for this cycle), below our threshold level for vesting on this measure. Total shareholder returns turned negative for bp, alongside all our constituent peer companies. bp placed third among our competitor group, however, which yielded formulaic vesting of 12.5% (of a potential 50%). To counter the impact of share price volatility in TSR measures, bp has continued its standard practice of averaging US market prices over the fourth quarter immediately before, and at the end of, the three-year performance cycle. Peers in our competitor group may use different pricing methods, leading them to report different ranking outcomes from bp.\n\nAs reported last year, we introduced four strategic progress measures in our 2017 policy, and this is now the second cycle for which we have made an assessment on strategic progress. These were the measures that then positioned bp for the future, and the committee found that in all four strategic areas the business has delivered fully against intended outcomes. Thus vesting on this element of the scorecard is determined to be 20%. The key factors that formed our scoring decision were:\n\nGrowing gas and advantaged oil in the upstream. Gas production grew from 1.11mmboed in 2017 to 1.15mmboed by 2020, with eight major gas projects started up in the period. In the same period bp started up seven major oil projects and have a further eight major oil projects under construction. We purchased BHP tight oil assets, accessing some of the best basins onshore in the US.\n\nMarket-led growth in the downstream. We have continued strategic progress with our convenience partnership model now in around 1,900 sites across the network, with 800 opened since 2017. The growth has been driven by the roll-out of REWE to Go in Germany, our Thorntons business in North America, and new partnerships launched in South Africa, Australia, New Zealand and Portugal. Retail store gross margin has grown 6% per annum since 2017 to over $1bn and is showing resilience despite COVID-19. In growth markets, we doubled our retail sites to 2,700 in 2020, expanded our network to over 500 bp-branded retail sites \u00ab in Mexico, and opened over 1,400 sites in India with our Reliance joint venture. In our sustainable aviation fuel business, we added 13 new locations to Air bp's supply network and have struck an innovative collaboration with Neste for supply of sustainable aviation fuel. We have made a further $40 million investment in Fulcrum since 2017.\n\nVenturing and low carbon across multiple fronts. Lightsource bp now has a presence in 14 countries, up from five in 2018. We have created a differentiated strategy in electric vehicle charging through bp pulse and Storedot, which has demonstrated five-minute charging capability. Our focus on reducing emissions has progressed well, with a reduction from 48.8Mte in 2018 to 41.7Mte in 2020, aligning with our net zero ambition. Our 2020 methane intensity is estimated at 0.12%, well below our target of 0.2%\n\nGas power and renewables trading and marketing growth. We remain the largest US gas and power marketing company. In 2018 and 2019 we added six advanced liquified natural gas (LNG) tankers to the bp-operated fleet; our Tangguh LNG expansion started drilling in 2019; and Train 2 of our Freeport LNG began commercial operations in 2020, with first gas deliveries from bp under our 20-year tolling agreement.\n\nAlong with the combination of financial and strategic measures, the committee considers an 'underpin' decision before deciding on the final result, taking a broader view to ensure that the reward outcome aligns with absolute shareholder returns, safety and environmental factors, and low carbon and climate change considerations. The committee has been mindful of the need to take an even broader perspective, and thus consider executive outcomes in relation to societal matters in general and our wider workforce in particular. While absolute returns disappoint, we find that all aspects of the underpin support at least 32.5% vesting, which from a participant's perspective reflects a poor return for the efforts expended. Therefore, our overall judgement is to leave the vesting outcome unadjusted.\n\nAs mentioned above, this scorecard outcome applies to all participants in both the EDIP (for executive directors) and the GSVP (for group leaders).\n\nWith time pro-ration for Bob and Brian to reflect their periods of service during the three-year performance period, this vesting delivers the outcomes detailed below. For Bernard and Murray these values are included in the single figure table on page 113, whereas for Bob and Brian they are reported in the payments for past directors section at page 122.\n\n## 2018-20 performance share plan outcomes (audited)\n\n|                      | Shares  awarded   | Shares  vesting  including  dividends Value of  vested  shares, Feb/ Mar 2021   | Impact of  share price change a   |\n|----------------------|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Bernard Looney       | 158,690 b         | 126,134 \u00a3350,652                                                                | -\u00a3228,991                         |\n| Murray Auchincloss c | 77,958 b          | 62,124 $275,934                                                                 | -$111,497                         |\n| Bob Dudley c         | 1,395,600         | 410,922 $1,566,298                                                              | -$962,923                         |\n| Brian Gilvary        | 696,705           | 227,337 \u00a3618,357                                                                | -\u00a3430,217                         |\n\nThe value of vested shares reflects the share price changes all shareholders have experienced over the three-year period. For this 2018-20 award cycle, the original grant was calculated based on ordinary share and American depositary share (ADS) prices of \u00a35.00 and $39.85 respectively, while the values at vesting were \u00a32.78/\u00a32.72 (on 16 and 19 February respectively), and $22.87/$26.65 (on 19 February and 10 March respectively). Consequently, the share price fall has reduced the initial face value of these awards by approximately 45% for ordinary shares, by 33% for Murray Auchincloss's ADSs, and by 43% for Bob Dudley's ADSs. The committee has made no discretionary adjustment to vesting outcomes related to these share price changes.",

Accordingly, the values shown in the single figure table represent remuneration outcomes from the time of their appointment to the board only. Similarly, because Bob Dudley and Brian Gilvary stepped down on 4 February and 30 June respectively, their 2020 remuneration values relate only to their part-years of service as executive directors. Payments received after they stepped down from their position are included in the payments to past directors section on page 122.\n\n## Salary and benefits\n\nBernard Looney's salary was \u00a31,300,000 from appointment. The amount reported above is before his 20% mental health charitable contribution. Murray Auchincloss's salary was \u00a3695,000 from appointment. Bob Dudley's salary remained at $1,854,000 until his exit on 31 March 2020. Brian Gilvary's salary was unchanged at \u00a3790,500 until his exit on 30 June 2020. All executive directors received car-related benefits, assistance with tax return preparation, security assistance, insurance and medical benefits.\n\n## 2020 annual bonus\n\nThe committee concluded that there should be no bonus for 2020 as the plan was unaffordable. There were no other contributing factors leading us to this decision.\n\n## 2018-20 performance shares\n\nPlease refer to page 112 for details of the performance measures, targets and outcomes for these performance shares.\n\n## Retirement benefits\n\nFrom their appointment as executive directors, Bernard Looney and Murray Auchincloss ceased to receive any retirement benefits for their service, but receive a cash allowance fixed at 15% of salary in line with the majority of similarly situated employees. They may choose to direct these allowances into retirement plans at their sole discretion, and the amounts are therefore identified as cash in lieu of retirement benefits on the single figure table.\n\nBob Dudley was provided with pension benefits and retirement savings through a combination of tax-qualified and non-qualified benefit plans. His normal retirement age is 60. The BP Supplemental Executive Retirement Benefit Plan (SERB) is a non-qualified defined benefit pension plan which provides a proportion of earnings for each year of service. In 2020 his accrued defined benefit pension did not increase, and the amount included in the single figure table is therefore zero.\n\nThe BP Employee Savings Plan (ESP) is a US tax-qualified defined contribution plan to which both Bob and bp contributed. The BP Excess Compensation (Savings) Plan (ECSP) is a non-qualified, unfunded, retirement savings plan to which bp notionally contributed 7% of base salary above the annual IRS limit. In 2020 Bob made contributions to the ESP totalling $28,500 and bp made matching contributions to the ESP, and notional contributions to the ECSP, totalling $32,445. However, investment losses in his unfunded ECSP account (aggregating the unfunded arrangements relating to his overall service with bp and TNK-BP) exceeded these contributions, hence the amount included in the single figure table is zero.",

        "page_content": "## Directors' remuneration report continued\n\nBrian Gilvary was provided with retirement benefits through a combination of tax-qualified and non-qualified plans for service to 31 March 2011, but linked to his final salary. In line with terms offered to UK employees employed prior to 2010 (or before 2014 in the North Sea) Brian was a member of the BP Pension Scheme (bpPS), a UK final salary defined benefit pension plan. Pension benefits accrued in excess of the individual lifetime tax allowance set by legislation were provided to Brian via a non-qualified, unfunded pension arrangement designed to mirror the design of the approved bpPS. His normal retirement age is 60, although due to his long service, benefits accrued before 1 December 2006 may be paid unreduced from age 55 with bp's consent. Brian received no salary increase in 2020, hence his interests in these retirement benefits did not increase and the amount included in the single figure table is therefore zero.\n\nFor service after 31 March 2011 Brian received a cash allowance in lieu of further accrual. This was set at 30% of salary to 30 May, then 25% of salary to 30 June 2020, and the amount has been separately identified in the single figure table.\n\n## Discontinued plans\n\nIn accordance with 2014 policy, Brian Gilvary compulsorily deferred one third of his 2015 annual bonus and received a matching award of bp shares. Both the deferred and matching awards were subject to a three-year performance period which ended on 31 December 2018, however Brian voluntarily requested that the committee delay the performance assessment and vesting of the 2015 matching award for two years, to 31 December 2020.\n\nThe committee considered operational and financial performance and reviewed safety and environmental sustainability performance over the 2016-20 period, seeking input from the strategy and sustainability committee on safety and sustainability measures. The committee concluded that safety performance continues to show improvement, with safety embedded in the culture of the organization and supporting strong operational and financial performance. The committee concluded that this award should vest in full. Because this award vested post-employment, the value is included in the payments to past directors statement on page 122, with further details available in the deferred shares table on page 120.\n\nBob Dudley has previously requested that the committee delay the performance assessment and vesting of all his deferred and matching awards under the 2014 policy. Following the committee's conclusion that the original safety and environmental sustainability conditions have been met, these awards will vest one year after his retirement, and the value will be reported in the payments to past directors statement in our 2021 report.\n\n## History of chief executive officer remuneration\n\n| Year   | Chief executive officer   | Total  remuneration thousand a   |   Annual  bonus % of  maximum |   Performance  shares % of  maximum |\n|--------|---------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| 2011   | Bob Dudley                | $8,439                           |                          66.7 |                                16.7 |\n| 2012   | Bob Dudley                | $9,609                           |                          64.9 |                                 0   |\n| 2013   | Bob Dudley                | $15,086                          |                          88   |                                45.5 |\n| 2014   | Bob Dudley                | $16,390                          |                          73.3 |                                63.8 |\n| 2015   | Bob Dudley                | $19,376                          |                         100   |                                74.3 |\n| 2016   | Bob Dudley                | $11,904                          |                          61   |                                40   |\n| 2017   | Bob Dudley                | $15,108                          |                          71.5 |                                70   |\n| 2018   | Bob Dudley                | $15,253                          |                          40.5 |                                80   |\n| 2019   | Bob Dudley                | $13,336                          |                          67.5 |                                71.2 |\n| 2020 b | Bob Dudley                | $188                             |                           0   |                                32.5 |\n|        | Bernard Looney            | \u00a31,735                           |                           0   |                                32.5 |",

        "page_content": "## Wider workforce in 2020\n\n## Workforce experience\n\nDuring 2020 the committee has continued to receive and review information on pay outcomes and processes for our wider workforce in order to take account of wider workforce pay and conditions when setting executive remuneration, and to consider alignment between pay structures.\n\nAs part of this review we carried out a programme of engagement with a diverse range of employees from different parts of the workforce from the front line to corporate office and covering new joiners, employees with long tenure in the organization, and employees of different gender and nationality. The topics discussed addressed bp's new purpose and ambition, and how this aligns with the organization's reward programmes. Our enquiries ranged from success in attracting and retaining talent, employee preferences in how pay is delivered, the make-up of the reward package, and programmes to support international mobility. A recurring theme was the desire for flexibility, with employees wanting to be empowered to make their own choices about how they work and how they are remunerated for their work.\n\nOverall we continue to observe well-balanced and structured approaches to reward. Although these approaches vary by business area and location, the core offering for the majority of our workforce is summarized in the table on page 116. We also find that financial reward is complemented with strong emphasis on maintaining a supportive and inclusive working environment. For instance, our commitment to family-friendly leave policies; recognition as a top global employer in Stonewall's list of the best multinational employers for LGBT+ staff; and scoring 100% for a fourth consecutive year in the Human Rights Campaign's 2021 Corporate Equality Index, which measures adoption of non-discrimination policies, equitable benefits for LGBT+ employees and families, and supporting an inclusive culture and corporate social responsibility. We are also pleased to confirm that bp is now accredited by the Living Wage Foundation as a real living wage employer in the UK. This ensures all colleagues in our UK businesses and at company-owned sites are paid at least the real living wage and we are now reviewing the position across other bp countries.\n\nWe apply the insights we gain from engaging with the workforce to challenge leadership generally and to make sure we think about remuneration holistically, not just with regard to those leaders whose pay is within our remit. This has been more relevant than ever through a year in which the COVID-19 pandemic has had such a significant impact on our people and business. Wider workforce salary increases were postponed at the normal salary review date 1 April 2020; from 1 October 2020 staff below our senior leadership level did receive increases. Salaries remained frozen for senior leaders (other than promotions) throughout 2020.\n\nOver half of our global workforce participates in an annual cash bonus plan and for 2020 the plan was intended to pay an incentive based equally on individual performance and bp performance. However, as reported in my opening letter, the committee and CEO both concluded that there should be no bonus for 2020 as the plan was unaffordable, and this outcome applies equally to our executive directors, leadership team, and those of our wider workforce who participate in the annual bonus plan. These decisions reflect our principle of consistency for all those rewarded under our common template. Note, however, that a limited number of employees, such as those with specific contractual rights or who work in parts of the business with different remuneration models, have received bonus payments for 2020.\n\nLooking forward, we have reviewed the role of share plans offered to employees with a view to understanding the extent to which these plans align our wider workforce with bp's purpose, particularly whether employees are personally invested in the new ambition and able to share in success. This review has led to our support for a 'one off' equity grant to every bp employee in 2021, vesting in 2025, reflecting our belief in sharing success broadly while aligning employees' longer-term interests with all shareholders.\n\nWe have also devoted time to examine the support provided for employee health and wellbeing, to gain a better understanding of how these aspects of policy support the organization's culture and encourage appropriate behaviours. This is an ongoing study and we will have more to report next year.\n\nTurning to non-discrimination matters, we understand the sharp interest that exists in disclosures of gender and ethnicity pay gaps. Having reviewed the gender pay gap reports of the last several years we are satisfied that reward processes and decisions are designed and managed to effectively avoid bias, and that reported pay gaps relate in the main to differences in gender representation across the pay hierarchy. We therefore conclude that the narrative accompanying our pay gap reporting is better reflected within bp's diversity and inclusion reporting, rather than remuneration reporting. With this in mind, and because bp has committed to annual diversity and inclusion reporting, we will leave additional commentary to that publication, which is expected to be available on the company's website bp.com next month.",

We confirm that no broadly applicable components of pay have been omitted and, where necessary, full-time equivalent pay has been calculated by simple engrossment of part year values.\n\nOur analysis this year covers more than 14,000 UK employees, 45% of whom work in our retail sites. Employee values reflect the zero bonus outcome for the majority of employees, and the delayed salary review date, from 1 April to 1 October.

The 2019 ratio is as originally reported.\n\nThe sharp reduction in 50th percentile ratio from 188:1 to 40:1 reflects the fact that CEO remuneration is more heavily weighted to variable pay which reduces in years of weaker performance such as 2020. This is a natural reason for volatility in pay ratio reporting from year to year, and illustrates one of the challenges in commenting on whether any given year's pay ratio is appropriate. Our considered view as to appropriateness is that the policies for our CEO, and for the wider workforce, are both fit for purpose and that they deliver pay outcomes appropriate to the circumstance of the year. Thus differentials reflect both the relative contributions made at different levels in our hierarchy, and the nature of the year in question.\n\nTaken in the round with all of the insights we have gained into pay policies and practices, we remain satisfied that pay outcomes, and the ratios derived from them, are as they should be. In particular we note that as well as being paid at least the real living wage, our UK employees also benefit from the significant intangible value of working in an inclusive and caring enterprise that is not reflected in pay ratio analyses.\n\n## Percentage change comparisons: Directors' remuneration versus employees\n\nIn the table below, values in column 'a' represent the percentage change in salary and fees; values in column 'b' represent the percentage change in taxable benefits; and values in column 'c' represent the percentage change in bonus outcomes for performance periods in respect of each financial year.\n\nThe employee percentages shown represent the change in median employee pay. This compares the median BP p.l.c. employee on 31 December of the relevant financial year, with the median BP p.l.c. employee on 31 December of the preceding financial year, in each case ranked based on the total of salary, benefits and bonus.\n\nFor the chair and non-executive directors, the decline in the value of taxable benefits largely relates to the sharp drop in business travel arising from pandemic-related travel restrictions.\n\n|                            | 2020 v 2019   | 2020 v 2019   | 2020 v 2019   |\n|----------------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n|                            | a             | b             | c             |\n| Employees                  | 0%            | 0%            | -100%         |\n| Bernard Looney             | -             | -             | -             |\n| Murray Auchincloss         | -             | -             | -             |\n| Bob Dudley                 | 0%            | -5%           | -100%         |\n| Brian Gilvary              | 1%            | 13%           | -100%         |\n| Nils Andersen              | -7%           | -46%          | n/a           |\n| Dame Alison Carnwath       | -4%           | -94%          | n/a           |\n| Pamela Daley               | -15%          | -92%          | n/a           |\n| Sir Ian Davis              | -14%          | -81%          | n/a           |\n| Professor Dame Ann Dowling | -4%           | -96%          | n/a           |\n| Helge Lund (Chair)         | 0%            | -74%          | n/a           |\n| Melody Meyer               | 9%            | -77%          | n/a           |\n| Tushar Morzaria            | -             | -             | n/a           |\n| Brendan Nelson             | -7%           | -71%          | n/a           |\n| Paula Rosput Reynolds      | 2%            | -92%          | n/a           |\n| Sir John Sawers            | -3%           | -83%          | n/a           |\n\nBob Dudley, Brian Gilvary and Nils Andersen resigned during 2020, therefore, other than for one-time items, their 2020 pay has been annualised for comparison.\n\nBernard Looney, Murray Auchincloss and Tushar Morzaria were appointed on the board in 2020 and therefore no comparison to 2019 is available.\n\n## Relative importance of spend on pay ($ million)\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our 2020 remuneration policy therefore requires the CEO and other executive directors to build personal shareholdings of five times salary and four and half times salary, respectively, within five years of their appointment. They are expected to maintain those shareholding levels for two years post employment.\n\n## Directors' shareholdings (audited)\n\nThe table below details the personal shareholdings of each current and former executive director. Both Bob Dudley and Brian Gilvary significantly exceed their post-employment shareholding commitment. Bernard Looney and Murray Auchincloss are building towards the policy requirement that applies five years from their dates of appointment, 5 February and 1 July 2020 respectively. These figures include all beneficial and non-beneficial ownership of shares of bp (or calculated equivalents) that have been disclosed to the company.\n\n| Director           | Ordinary  shares or  equivalents  at 1 Jan  2020   | Ordinary  shares or  equivalents  at 31 Dec  2020   | Changes  from 31 Dec  2020 to   2 Mar 2021   | Ordinary  shares or  equivalents  at 2 Mar  2021   | Appointment date   | Value of  current  shareholding   | Multiple  of salary  achieved   |\n|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Bernard Looney     | -                                                  | 331,711                                             | 212,228                                      | 543,939                                            | 5 February 2020    | \u00a31,615,499 a                      | 1.24x                           |\n| Murray Auchincloss | -                                                  | 139,525                                             | 2,010                                        | 141,535                                            | 1 July 2020        | \u00a3420,359 a                        | 0.60x                           |\n| Bob Dudley b       | 4,592,208                                          | -                                                   | -                                            | -                                                  | October 2010       | -                                 | -                               |\n| Brian Gilvary b    | 2,593,708                                          | -                                                   | -                                            | -                                                  | January 2012       | -                                 | -                               |\n\nThese current and former executive directors have additional interests in restricted and performance shares, and Bob and Brian have various interests in deferred bonus shares.

Represents vesting of shares at the end of the performance period based on performance achieved under rules of the plan and includes reinvested dividends on the shares vested. Bernard Looney's 2018-20 award vested on 16 February 2021, when the market price was \u00a32.78 for each share, and Murray Auchincloss's award vested on 10 March 2021 when the market price for each ADS was $26.65. The amounts reported as 2020 income on the single figure table are therefore \u00a3351k for Bernard Looney and $275k (\u00a3215k) for Murray Auchincloss.\n- c  Face values have been calculated using market prices of ordinary shares at closing on the dates of award, as follows; \u00a35.37 on 19 February 2019; \u00a35.48 on 25 March 2019; and \u00a33.08 on 11 August 2020.\n- d  Minimum vesting under these awards (below threshold performance) is 0%. At the lowest performance outcome that would yield an above-zero score on each measure, vesting would be 10% of maximum.\n- e  These awards were received in the form of ADSs. The above numbers reflect calculated equivalents in ordinary shares. One ADS is equivalent to six ordinary shares.\n- f  Represents vesting of shares at the end of the performance period based on performance achieved under rules of the plan and includes reinvested dividends on the shares vested. This 2017-2019 award vested on 18 February 2020, when the market price was \u00a34.54 for each ordinary share, and $36.09 for each ADS. Reinvested dividends were delivered on 5 November 2020, when the market price was \u00a32.03 for each ordinary share, and $15.83 for each ADS. The adjusted amounts reported as 2019 income on the single figure table are therefore $8.039 million for Bob Dudley, and \u00a32.787 million for Brian Gilvary.\n- g  Represents vestings of shares at the end of the performance period based on performance achieved under rules of the plan, pro-rated for time served, and includes reinvested dividends on the shares vested. This 2018-2020 award vested on 19 February 2021, when the market price was \u00a32.72 for each share, and $22.87 for each ADS. As they were received post-employment, the value of these vested shares are included in the payments to past directors section on page 122.\n\n## Restricted shares (audited)\n\n|                    |                    |                                     | Share element interests Number of restricted shares   | Share element interests Number of restricted shares   | Share element interests Number of restricted shares   |                            |\n|--------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|\n|                    | Restricted  period | Date of award of  restricted shares | At 1 Jan   2020                                       | Awarded  2020                                         | At 31 Dec   2020                                      | Face value  of award c , \u00a3 |\n| Bernard Looney     | 2016-20 a          | 15 Mar 2016                         | 75,000                                                | -                                                     | 75,000                                                | 256,500                    |\n|                    | 2018-20 a          | 20 Mar 2018                         | 104,577                                               | -                                                     | 104,577                                               | 485,237                    |\n|                    | 2018-20 b          | 20 Mar 2018                         | 137,990                                               | -                                                     | 137,990                                               | 640,274                    |\n|                    | 2019-21 b          | 25 Mar 2019                         | 146,055                                               | -                                                     | 146,055                                               | 800,381                    |\n| Murray Auchincloss | 2018-20 a          | 20 Mar 2018                         | 43,170                                                | -                                                     | 43,170                                                | 200,308                    |\n|                    | 2018-22 a          | 20 Mar 2018                         | 43,170                                                | -                                                     | 43,170                                                | 200,308                    |\n|                    | 2018-20 b          | 20 Mar 2018                         | 86,616                                                | -                                                     | 86,616                                                | 401,898                    |\n|                    | 2018-20 d          | 20 Mar 2018                         | 2,755                                                 | -                                                     | 2,755                                                 | 12,783                     |\n|                    | 2019-21 d          | 25 Mar 2019                         | 2,835                                                 | -                                                     | 2,835                                                 | 15,536                     |\n|                    | 2019-21 b          | 25 Mar 2019                         | 86,928                                                | -                                                     | 86,928                                                | 476,365                    |\n|                    | 2020-22 d          | 28 Aug 2020                         | -                                                     | 4,840                                                 | 4,840                                                 | 12,778                     |\n\n- b  Awards made under the Individual Share Value Plan prior to appointment as a director.

Under our 2017 policy, they gave their personal commitment as executive directors to maintain actual holdings equivalent to two and a half times salary for two years post employment. Their ongoing interests in share awards under group plans which remain subject to vesting and/or holding periods materially exceed the two and a half times salary threshold, and thus guarantee that they will continue to meet their minimum shareholding commitment. Although we instituted a formal post employment share ownership requirement as part of our 2020 policy, given the foregoing, we have not modified the requirements for these former executives.\n\n## Chair and non-executive director outcomes and interests\n\nThe remuneration policy for the chair and non-executive directors (NEDs) was approved at the 2020 AGM and implemented during 2020.\n\n## Fee structure\n\nThe table below shows the fee structure for the chair and NEDs, per our 2020 policy.

The implementation of that revised fee structure was postponed on account of the COVID-19 pandemic and actions taken by bp in response.\n\nWith effect from 1 January 2021, a fee for membership of the people and governance committee has been introduced given the increased time commitment associated with the expanded responsibilities of this committee. The fee is in line with other committee membership fees. The senior independent director has waived her entitlement to this committee membership fee.\n\nThe geopolitical advisory council was constituted with effect from 1 January 2021. Fees of \u00a310,000 and \u00a315,000 are payable for membership of and chairing the council, respectively.\n\nThe fee structure for 2021 remains otherwise unchanged and the board will review the situation again during the year.\n\nThe table below shows the fees paid and applicable benefits for the year ended 31 December 2020. Benefits include travel and other expenses relating to the attendance at board and other meetings. As chair throughout 2020, Helge Lund had the use of a fully maintained office for company business, a car and driver, and security advice in London. Benefits values have been grossed up using a tax rate of 45%, where relevant, as an estimation of tax due.\n\n## 2020 remuneration (audited)\n\n|                              |   Fees | Fees   |   Benefits | Benefits   |   Total a | Total a   |\n|------------------------------|--------|--------|------------|------------|-----------|-----------|\n| \u00a3 thousand                   |   2020 | 2019   |       2020 | 2019       |      2020 | 2019      |\n| Nils Andersen b              |     38 | 161    |          1 | 11         |        39 | 172       |\n| Dame Alison Carnwath b       |    110 | 115    |          2 | 33         |       112 | 148       |\n| Pamela Daley                 |    140 | 164    |          3 | 37         |       143 | 201       |\n| Sir Ian Davis b              |    143 | 165    |          1 | 5          |       143 | 170       |\n| Professor Dame Ann Dowling c |    135 | 140    |          0 | 3          |       135 | 143       |\n| Helge Lund (Chair)           |    785 | 785    |         25 | 95         |       810 | 880       |\n| Melody Meyer                 |    166 | 152    |          4 | 16         |       170 | 168       |\n| Tushar Morzaria b            |     37 | -      |          0 | -          |        37 | -         |\n| Brendan Nelson               |    140 | 150    |          3 | 11         |       143 | 161       |\n| Paula Rosput Reynolds        |    174 | 170    |          3 | 36         |       177 | 206       |\n| Sir John Sawers              |    140 | 145    |          0 | 1          |       140 | 146       |",

Of these, awards under the 2014 policy (for bonus years 2014, 2015 and 2016) were not included in the single figures of total remuneration, therefore the values of these awards will be disclosed in the payments to past directors section of the relevant annual report following vesting.\n\nSimilarly, Brian Gilvary deferred the vesting of his 2016 matching share award until at least one year post retirement. The value of this award will be disclosed in the payments to past directors section of the relevant annual report following vesting.\n\n## Payments to past directors (audited)\n\nSince leaving employment, Bob Dudley and Brian Gilvary have received shares upon vesting of the awards listed below:\n\n(1) Bob Dudley received 410,922 shares on vesting of his 2018-20 performance share award on 19 February 2021. Based on a share price of $22.78 this vesting was valued at $1,566,298. This award reflects the 32.5% vesting outcome, and has been pro-rated for 27 months' service through the three-year performance period.\n\n(2) Brian Gilvary received 227,337 shares on vesting of his 2018-20 performance share award on 19 February 2021. Based on a share price of \u00a32.72 this vesting was valued at \u00a3618,357. This award reflects the 32.5% vesting outcome, and has been pro-rated for 30 months' service through the three-year performance period.\n\n(3) Brian Gilvary received 402,227 shares on vesting of his 2015 matching award on 19 February 2021. Based on a share price of \u00a32.72 this vesting was valued at \u00a31,094,057. This award has been pro-rated for 54 months' service through the five-year vesting period.\n\nBob Dudley was also provided with post-employment medical benefits amounting to $14,359, ongoing car and driver benefits in the UK, amounting to $44,429, and relocation benefits to assist his repatriation to the US, amounting to $47,186.\n\nWe made no other payments within the scope of the disclosure requirements to any past director of bp during 2020 (we have no de minimis threshold for such disclosures).",

Further detail on the activities of the committee, advice received, and shareholder engagement is set out in the remuneration committee report on page 105.\n\nDuring 2020 Ben Mathews, who was employed by the company and reported to the chair of the board, acted as secretary to the remuneration committee.\n\nThe committee also received advice on various matters relating to the remuneration of executive directors and senior management from Helmut Schuster, former EVP, group human resources, Kerry Dryburgh, EVP, people and culture (from 1 July 2020) and Ashok Pillai, SVP, reward and wellbeing.\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ('PwC') continued to provide independent advice to the committee in 2020, following its appointment as independent advisor to the committee in September 2017, following a competitive tender process. None of PwC's consultants advising the committee have any connection with the company's directors. PwC advice included, for example, support with remuneration benchmarking and updates on market practice. PwC is a member of the Remuneration Consulting Group and, as such, operates under the code of conduct in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK. The committee is satisfied that the advice received is objective and independent.\n\nFreshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP ('Freshfields') provided legal advice on specific compliance matters to the committee.\n\nPwC and Freshfields provide other advice in their respective areas to the group. During the year, PwC provided bp with services including: subsidiary company secretarial support; digital and IT services; low carbon strategy consulting; internal audit subject matter expertise and trading transformation.\n\nTotal fees or other charges (based on an hourly rate) for the provision of remuneration advice to the committee in 2020 (save in respect of legal advice) were \u00a3110,262 to PwC.\n\n## Considerations related to the Corporate Governance Code\n\nWhen setting the 2020 policy, the committee concluded that the scorecardbased approach to setting targets and measuring outcomes provides great clarity in our ability to engage transparently with shareholders and the wider workforce on remuneration. Thus, bp continues to operate a simple structure of market-aligned salary with annual and three-year performancebased incentives. Risks are managed through careful setting of performance measures and targets, and broad options to apply committee discretion in assessing outcomes, such as the decision to pay no annual bonus for 2020. These are complemented with robust malus and clawback measures. Remuneration outcomes are predictable, as shown in the scenario charts of the 2020 policy, and proportional by virtue of the challenging performance levels required to achieve target pay outcomes. Through material weighting in measures related to safety, sustainability and strategy, as shown on page 109, remuneration aligns closely with bp's culture, as expressed through our purpose and ambition.\n\n## Shareholder engagement\n\nThroughout 2020 we continued to discuss remuneration policy and approach with many of our largest shareholders, as well as investor representative bodies. We plan to continue this dialogue in 2021, as we consider issues and make decisions related to the implementation of our remuneration policy for 2021 and beyond.\n\nThe table below shows the votes on the report for the last three years.\n\n## AGM directors' remuneration report vote results\n\n|   Year | % vote  'for'   | % vote  'against'   | Votes  withheld   |\n|--------|-----------------|---------------------|-------------------|\n|   2020 | 96.05%          | 3.95%               | 67,623,825        |\n|   2019 | 95.93%          | 4.07%               | 337,586,814       |\n|   2018 | 96.42%          | 3.58%               | 42,741,541        |\n\nThe remuneration policy was approved by shareholders at the 2020 AGM last May.

Each executive director is permitted to retain any fee from their external appointments. Such external appointments are subject to agreement by the chair and reported to the board. Any external appointment must not conflict with a director's duties and commitments to bp.

Percentage increases for executive directors will not exceed increases for the broader employee population, other than in specific circumstances identified by the committee (e.g. in response to a substantial change in responsibilities).\n\nExecutive directors normally participate in the company retirement plans that operate in their home country.\n\nNew appointees from within the bp group retain previously accrued benefits. For their service as a director, retirement benefits will be no more than the median provision offered to the wider workforce in the UK.\n\nFor future appointments, the committee will carefully review any retirement benefits to be granted to a new director, taking account of retirement policies across the wider group and any arrangements currently in place.\n\nBonus is measured against an annual scorecard. The committee holds discretion to choose the specific measures and the relative weightings adopted in the annual scorecard, to reflect the annual plan as agreed with the board.\n\nNumeric scales are set for each measure, to score outcomes relative to targets. A scorecard outcome of 1.0 reflects the target outcome, and half of the maximum outcome.\n\nTarget bonus is 112.5% of salary, and maximum bonus is 225% of salary.\n\nHalf of the bonus for each year is paid in cash, and half is delivered as a deferred share award vesting in three years.\n\nPerformance shares are granted with a three-year performance period, measured against scorecard.\n\nThe committee holds discretion to choose the specific measures and the relative weightings adopted in the scorecard, to ensure they are focused on the near-term priorities for delivering the bp strategy in the interests of shareholders.\n\nAnnual grants are 500% of salary for the CEO, and 450% of salary for any other executive director. Awards will vest in proportion to the outcomes measured through the performance scorecard, subject to any adjustment by the committee.\n\n- Bernard Looney's salary will increase by 2.75% to \u00a31,335,750 following the 2021 AGM.\n- Murray Auchincloss's salary will increase by 8% to \u00a3750,500 following the 2021 AGM.\n- This compares to an increase in excess of 4% to our UK salaried staff effective from 1 April, our annual salary review date.\n- Benefits will remain unchanged for 2021 and include car-related provisions (or cash in lieu), security assistance, insurance and medical cover.\n- Bernard and Murray are deferred members of final salary pension plans related to their service prior to appointment as executive directors, but now receive a cash allowance in lieu of retirement benefits.\n- Bernard's cash allowance will be unchanged at 15%, and he accrues no further value under his deferred pension.\n- Murray's cash allowance will be unchanged at 15%, and he accrues no further value under his US deferred pension.\n- For our 2021 bonus, our scorecard will be reweighted to safety (15%), environment (15%), operational (20%) and financial (50%).\n- Please see scorecard measures on page 125 for detail.\n- Awards are subject to malus and clawback provisions described on page 125.\n- For our 2021-23 cycle, 20% each for rTSR, ROACE, and EBIDA CAGR, and 40% for strategic progress.\n- Please see scorecard measures on page 125 for detail.\n- The 2021-23 awards will be granted in June 2021, based on the average closing share price over the 90 days preceding our 2021 AGM.\n- Awards are subject to malus and clawback provisions described on page 125.",

The directors are required by the UK Companies Act 2006 to prepare financial statements for each financial year that give a true and fair view of the financial position of the group and the parent company and the financial performance and cash flows of the group and parent company for that period. Under that law they are required to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union (EU) and applicable law and have elected to prepare the parent company financial statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and United Kingdom accounting standards (United Kingdom generally accepted accounting practice), including FRS 101 'Reduced Disclosure Framework'. In preparing the consolidated financial statements the directors have also elected to comply with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).\n\nIn preparing those financial statements, the directors are required to:\n\n- Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently.\n- Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent.\n- Present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information.\n- Provide additional disclosure when compliance with the specific requirements of IFRS is insufficient to enable users to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the group's financial position and financial performance.\n- State that applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the parent company financial statements.\n- Prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company will continue in business.\n\nThe directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the group and company and enable them to ensure that the consolidated financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006 and the parent company financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the group and company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.\n\nHaving made the requisite enquiries, so far as the directors are aware, there is no relevant audit information (as defined by Section 418(3) of the Companies Act 2006) of which the company's auditors are unaware, and the directors have taken all the steps they ought to have taken to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the company's auditors are aware of that information.\n\nThe directors confirm that to the best of their knowledge:\n\n- The consolidated financial statements, prepared on the basis of IFRS as issued by the IASB, IFRS adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the EU and in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 as applicable to companies reporting under international accounting standards, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the group.\n- The parent company financial statements, prepared in accordance with United Kingdom generally accepted accounting practice, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position, performance and cash flows of the company.\n- The management report, which is incorporated in the strategic report and directors' report, includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the group, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.\n\n## Helge Lund\n\nChairman 22 March 2021\n\n## UK Corporate Governance Code compliance\n\nThroughout 2020, bp applied the principles and complied with all the provisions of the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code.\n\n## Risk management and internal control\n\nUnder the UK Corporate Governance Code 2018 (Code), the board is responsible for the company's risk management and internal control systems. In discharging this responsibility the board, through its governance principles, requires the chief executive officer to operate the company with a comprehensive system of controls and internal audit to identify and manage the risks including emerging risks that are material to bp. In turn, the board, through its monitoring processes, satisfies itself that these material risks are identified and understood by management and that systems of risk management and internal control are in place to mitigate them. These systems are reviewed periodically by the board, have been in place for the year under review and up to the date of this report and are consistent with the requirements of Principle O of the Code.\n\nThe board has processes in place to:\n\n- Assess the principal and emerging risks facing the company.\n- Monitor the company's system of internal control (which includes the ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the principal and emerging risks).\n- Review the effectiveness of that system annually.",

During the year, the board undertook a robust assessment of the principal and emerging risks facing the company. The principal means by which these risks are managed or mitigated are set out on page 65.\n\nIn assessing the risks faced by the company and monitoring the system of internal control, the board and the audit, safety, environment and security assurance and geopolitical committees requested, received and reviewed reports from executive management, including management of the business segments, corporate activities and functions, at their regular meetings. A report by each of these committees, including its activities during the year, is set out on pages 92-102 and 105.\n\nDuring the year, the committees, as relevant, also met with management, the group head of audit and other monitoring and assurance functions (including group ethics and compliance, safety and operational risk, group control, group legal and group risk) and the external auditor. Responses by management to incidents that occurred were considered by the appropriate committee or the board.\n\nAt a meeting in January 2021, the audit committee considered reports from the group risk function on the system of internal control and the function's categorisation of significant failings and weaknesses. The audit committee also considered a report from internal audit on their assessment of bp's systems of internal control and risk management, based on audit work conducted during 2020. In considering these reports and assessments, the audit committee noted that bp's system of internal control and risk management is designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss.\n\nAt its meeting in March 2020, the board considered the review undertaken by the audit committee and the proposed disclosures outlining the company's risk management and internal control systems prior to publication of the annual report and accounts.\n\nA statement regarding the company's internal controls over financial reporting is set out on page 327.\n\n## Longer-term viability\n\nIn accordance with provision 31 of the Code, the directors have assessed the prospects of the company over a period significantly longer than 12 months. The directors believe that, notwithstanding bp's new strategy and the associated 2025 and 2030 net zero carbon targets and aims that it set out in 2020, a viability assessment period of three years remains appropriate. This assessment is based on management's reasonable expectations of the position and performance of the company over this period and the targets and aims that it has set out.\n\nOur risk management system, described in how we manage risk on page 64, outlines our risk identification, assessment and management approach for all risks, including our principal risks, described on page 67.\n\nTaking into account the company's current position and its principal risks, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the company will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the next three years.\n\nThe directors' assessment included a review of the potential financial impact of, and the financial headroom that could be available in the event of, the most severe but plausible scenarios that could threaten the viability of the company. The assessment took into consideration the robust financial position of the group and the potential mitigations that management reasonably believes would be available to the company over this period. Mitigations considered include use of cash, access to debt facilities and credit lines, raising of capital, reductions in capital expenditure, divestments and dividend reductions.\n\nThe scenarios that have been modelled are based on the most severe but plausible outcomes and associated costs are based on actual experience where possible. The scenarios have been considered individually and as a cluster of events. They include:\n\n- a significant process safety incident when operating facilities, drilling wells or transporting hydrocarbons.\n- a sustained significant decline in oil prices over three years.\n- a significant cyber-security incident.\n- a loss of a significant market or producing asset for six months.\n\nThe directors also considered the impact on viability from an extended pandemic scenario, as well as the potential risks associated with the energy transition. They consider that the most likely impacts of these risks are broadly captured and modelled through the sustained low oil price and loss of a producing asset scenarios.\n\nIn assessing the prospects of the company, the directors noted that such assessment is subject to a degree of uncertainty that can be expected to increase looking out over time and, accordingly, that future outcomes cannot be guaranteed or predicted with certainty.\n\n## Going concern\n\nIn accordance with provision 30 of the Code, the directors consider it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements. The impact of COVID-19 and the current economic environment was considered as part of the going concern assessment. Forecast liquidity has been assessed under a number of stressed scenarios, including a significant decline in oil prices over the 12-month period. Reverse stress tests performed indicated that the group will continue to operate as a going concern for at least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements even if the Brent price fell to zero.\n\n## Fair, balance and understandable\n\nThe board considers the annual report and financial statements, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the company's position and performance, business model and strategy.",

Opinion\n\nIn our opinion:\n\n- \u00b7 The financial statements of BP p.l.c. (the 'parent company') and its subsidiaries (the 'group') give a true and fair view of the state of the group's and of the parent company's affairs as at 31 December 2020 and of the group's loss for the year then ended.\n- \u00b7 The group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006, International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).\n- \u00b7 The parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom accounting standards (United Kingdom generally accepted accounting practice), including Financial Reporting Standard (FRS) 101 'Reduced Disclosure Framework'.\n- \u00b7 The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.\n\nWe have audited the financial statements of BP p.l.c. which comprise the:\n\n- \u00b7 Group income statement;\n- \u00b7 Group statement of comprehensive income;\n- \u00b7 Group and parent company statements of changes in equity;\n- \u00b7 Group and parent company balance sheets;\n- \u00b7 Group cash flow statement;\n- \u00b7 Group related Notes 1 to 38 to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies; and\n- \u00b7 Parent company related Notes 1 to 14 to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nThe financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the group financial statements is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and as issued by the IASB. As regards the parent company financial statements, the financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom accounting standards (United Kingdom generally accepted accounting practice), including FRS 101 'Reduced Disclosure Framework'.\n\n## 2. Basis for opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report.\n\nWe are independent of the group and the parent company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the Financial Reporting Council's (the 'FRC's') Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. The non-audit services provided to the group and parent company for the year are disclosed in Note 36 to the financial statements. We confirm that the non-audit services prohibited by the FRC's Ethical Standard were not provided to the group or the parent company.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## 3. Summary of our audit approach\n\n| Key audit matters   | The key audit matters that we identified in the current year were: \u00b7 COVID-19 and the resulting significant changes to the business environment; \u00b7 Potential impact of climate change and the energy transition; \u00b7 Impairment of upstream oil and gas property, plant and equipment (PP&E) assets; \u00b7 Accounting for structured commodity transactions (SCTs) within the trading and shipping (T&S) function, and the valuation of  other level 3 financial instruments, where fraud risks may arise in revenue recognition;   |\n|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                     | \u00b7 Write-off of exploration and appraisal (E&A) assets;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n|                     | \u00b7 IT controls relating to financial systems; and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n|                     | \u00b7 Management override of controls.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| Materiality         | This year we identified COVID-19 and the related significant changes to the business environment as a key audit matter, given  the consequential impact on the financial statements and the focus on this issue by management and by external stakeholders.

Conclusions relating to going concern\n\nIn auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.\n\nOur evaluation of the directors' assessment of the group's and parent company's ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included:\n\n- \u00b7 an assessment of whether material uncertainties existed that could cast significant doubt on the entity's ability to continue as a going concern for at least 12 months after the date of approval of the financial statements;\n- \u00b7 an assessment of the financing facilities including nature of facilities, repayment terms and covenants;\n- \u00b7 testing of clerical accuracy and appropriateness of the model used to prepare the forecasts;\n- \u00b7 an assessment of the assumptions used in the forecasts;\n- \u00b7 an assessment of management's identified potential mitigating actions and the appropriateness of the inclusion of these in the going concern assessment;\n- \u00b7 an assessment of the historical accuracy of forecasts prepared by management;\n- \u00b7 reperformance of management's sensitivity analysis; and\n- \u00b7 an assessment of the disclosures made within the financial statements\n\nBased on our assessment, we concluded that the assumptions used by management were in the acceptable range and the disclosures made within the financial statements were appropriate.\n\nBased on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the group's and parent company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.\n\nIn relation to the reporting on how the group has applied the UK Corporate Governance Code, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to the directors' statement in the financial statements about whether the directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nOur responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report.\n\n## 5. Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team.\n\nThroughout the course of our audit, we identify risks of material misstatement ('risks'). We consider both the likelihood of a risk and the potential magnitude of a misstatement in making the assessment. Certain risks are classified as 'significant' or 'higher' depending on their severity. The category of the risk determines the level of evidence we seek in providing assurance that the associated financial statement item is not materially misstated.\n\nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.",

The principal area in which this has  impacted bp is the demand destruction which led to low oil and gas prices in the year and an expectation that there will  be an enduring impact going forward reducing forecast oil and gas prices. Accordingly this has impacted certain key  estimates and judgements reliant on oil and gas prices. The lower oil and gas prices resulted in a loss for the year and  the lower oil and gas price forecasts have resulted in significant PP&E impairments and reduced the attractiveness of  developing certain E&A assets, leading to significant write-offs.                                     |\n|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                 | The related principal risks that we have identified for our audit are as follows:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n|                                 | \u00b7 The forecast assumptions used in assessing the value of assets within bp's balance sheet for impairment testing,  particularly oil and gas price assumptions relevant to upstream oil and gas PP&E assets, may not appropriately reflect  changes in supply and demand due to COVID-19 (see 'Impairment of upstream oil and gas PP&E assets' below);                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|                                 | \u00b7 The E&A asset write-offs are not aligned with management's intentions.

After the bankruptcies,  allegations have been made that certain of the funding arrangements of these oil trading entities involved finance  schemes whereby funds were raised backed by assets that did not exist or were supported by fraudulent sales.  These finance schemes typically involved back-to-back intra-group arrangements transacted with an independent  third party. There is a risk that bp, as a significant participant in the oil trading sector in Singapore, may have been a  counterparty to such transactions, resulting in exposure to claims by the financiers to these oil trading entities. |\n|                                 | The above considerations were a significant focus of management during the period which led to this being a matter  therefore identified this as a key audit matter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|                                 | that we communicated to the Audit Committee, and which had a significant effect on the overall audit strategy.

We therefore identified this as a key audit matter.\n\n## Overall response\n\nWe held discussions with management, with Deloitte Climate Change specialists and within the Group engagement team to identify the areas where we felt climate change could have a potential impact on the financial statements.\n\nWe also established a climate change steering committee comprising a group of senior partners with specific climate change and technical audit and accounting expertise within Deloitte to provide an independent challenge to our key decisions and conclusions with respect to this area.\n\n## Audit procedures in respect of the three principal audit risks identified\n\nThe audit response related to the two principal audit risks identified is set out under the key audit matters for impairment of upstream oil and gas PP&E assets on page 136-8 and the write-off of exploration and appraisal assets on page 139.\n\n## Other audit procedures performed\n\nWe performed procedures to satisfy ourselves that, other than future oil and gas price assumptions, there were no other assumptions in management's upstream goodwill impairment test to which reasonably possible changes could cause goodwill to be materially misstated. We obtained evidence which supported management's conclusion that goodwill relating to downstream segment activities is not impaired.\n\nWe challenged management's assertion that the impact of potential changes to upstream decommissioning dates would not have a material impact on the amounts reported in the current period by assessing the analysis of decommissioning timing, and conducting sensitivity analysis as part of our audit procedures.\n\nWe challenged the results of the impairment testing of downstream PP&E refining assets by considering internal and external market studies of future supply and demand, and conducting sensitivity analysis. For those refining assets where impairment triggers were identified, we tested the mathematical completeness and accuracy of the impairment models and assessed the appropriateness of key assumptions and inputs. We also tested management's internal controls over the impairment tests.\n\nWe challenged management's assertion that no changes are required to the assessed useful economic lives of refining assets as a consequence of COVID-19 and climate change factors. In doing this, we obtained third party reports assessing future refined petroleum product demand for those countries which are included in our group full audit scope for downstream. The future demand forecasts were prepared under a range of scenarios including scenarios noted as being consistent with achieving the 2015 COP 21 Paris agreement goal to limit temperature rises to well below 2\u00b0C ('Paris 2\u00b0C Goal').\n\nWe challenged management's analysis which supported their judgement that no decommissioning provisions should be recognised in respect of refineries where there is ongoing activity and management has no intention to cease these activities. In doing so we considered the third party forecasts referenced above which, for countries included in our group full audit scope for downstream, show that demand for refined petroleum products is expected to remain significant for at least the current remaining useful economic lives of the refineries, even under scenarios consistent with the Paris 2\u00b0C Goal.\n\nWith regard to climate change litigation, we designed procedures specifically to respond to the risks that provisions could be understated or that contingent liability disclosures may be omitted or be inaccurate including:\n\n- \u00b7 Holding discussions with the group general counsel and other senior bp lawyers regarding climate change matters;\n- \u00b7 Conducting a search for climate change litigation and claims brought against the group; and\n- \u00b7 Making written inquiries of, and holding discussions with, external legal counsel advising bp in relation to climate change litigation.\n\nWe held discussions with management and tested the controls in respect of the restructuring provision. We performed substantive procedures to assess whether the provision was appropriately recognised as required by International Accounting Standard (IAS) 37 'Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets'.\n\nWe read the other information included in the Annual Report and considered (a) whether there was any material inconsistency between the other information and the financial statements; or (b) whether there was any material inconsistency between the other information and our understanding of the business based on audit evidence obtained and conclusions reached in the audit.",

Nevertheless, we are satisfied that it is not possible to estimate reliably a settlement date for any decommissioning obligations prior to a decision being made to cease refining operations and that therefore no triggers have arisen that would require a decommissioning provision to be recorded for the group's operating refinery assets.\n\nBased on the audit evidence obtained both from internal and external legal counsel, we were satisfied with management's assertion that no provision should currently be made in respect of climate change litigation.

As noted above, the estimation  of future prices is subject to increased uncertainty given climate change, the global energy transition and the impact  of COVID-19. There is a risk that management do not forecast reasonable 'best estimate' oil and gas price forecasts  when assessing CGUs for impairment, leading to material misstatements. These price assumptions are highly  judgmental and are pervasive inputs to most upstream impairment tests, such that any misstatements would also  aggregate.                                                      |\n|                                 | \u00b7 Discount rates  - Given the long timeframes involved, certain CGU impairment assessments are sensitive to the  discount rate applied. Discount rates should reflect the return required by the market and the risks inherent in the  cash flows being discounted. There is a risk that management do not assume reasonable discount rates, adjusted as  applicable for country risks and relevant tax rates, leading to material misstatements. Determining a reasonable  discount rate is highly judgmental and, consistent with price assumptions above, the discount rate assumption is also  a pervasive input across upstream impairment tests, before adjustments for asset specific risks and tax rates, such  that any misstatements would also aggregate. |",

We also identified CGUs with a further $16.0 billion (2019 $33.4 billion) of combined carrying value which were less  sensitive.

In forming this view, we included each forecaster's 'base case', 'central case' or 'most likely' estimate. For the purpose of PP&E impairment tests, management is required under IAS 36 to apply its current 'best estimate' of future oil and gas prices.\n\nWe further observed that, as well as publishing a 'base case', 'central case' or 'most likely' estimate, certain third party price forecasters published other price forecasts including some that were stated as, or were interpreted by us as being, 'Paris 2\u00b0C Goal' scenarios. These were typically the lowest of all scenarios from those third parties and we observed that none of those third party forecasters described their 'Paris 2\u00b0C Goal' scenarios as their 'base case', 'central case' or 'most likely' estimate. We noted that not all of these third parties had updated their forecasts for COVID-19 although, unlike for the 'best estimate forecasts' which had typically been reduced significantly post COVID-19, it is less evident that 'Paris 2\u00b0C forecasts' would need changing as a result of COVID-19 at least in the longer term and we noted certain updated forecasts that had not changed significantly. Accordingly, in respect of Paris 2\u00b0C price scenarios only, we continued to place some weight on certain pre-COVID-19 third party forecasts.\n\nManagement note on page 160 that they consider their central price assumptions to be broadly in line with a range of transition paths consistent with the goals of the Paris climate change agreement. We observed that for oil, whilst being within the lower half of our range of 'best estimate' forecasts as described above, bp's price assumptions were overall at the top end of our range of 'Paris 2\u00b0C Goal' scenarios. For gas, as well as being within and towards the low end of our range of 'best estimate' forecasts as described above, bp's price assumptions were within and towards the higher end of our range of 'Paris 2\u00b0C Goal' scenarios. We also noted certain other reputable third party sources that set out or implied even higher prices under a Paris 2\u00b0C scenario. Accordingly, we consider management's view as set out above to be reasonable.\n\nWe reviewed the disclosures included in Note 1 to the accounts in respect of price assumptions, including the sensitivity analysis presented therein. We observed that management's downside sensitivity, in which oil and gas prices are 10% lower than the best estimate in all future periods, is comfortably within a range of third party Paris 2\u00b0C Goal gas price forecasts. For oil, management's downside sensitivity is comfortably within a range of Paris 2\u00b0C Goal forecasts in the period to 2028, but towards the top end of that range by 2050.\n\n## Discount rates\n\nbp's post-tax nominal 6% weighted average cost of capital, being the starting point for setting discount rates used for impairment testing, was within the independent range calculated by our Deloitte valuation specialists.\n\nWe were also satisfied with the calculation of country risk premia. Accordingly, we are satisfied with the discount rates used in the impairment testing.\n\n## Reserves and resources estimates\n\nWe found that the production forecasts used in the impairment tests that we tested were reasonable and appropriately risked where applicable, for the purposes of management's impairment tests.",

There is also a risk that E&A costs remain capitalised on the balance sheet which ought to have been written off or                                                                                                                                                      |\n| Key audit matter  description                                  | impaired, leading to material misstatements.

This included the new key internal controls operated by management for the key decisions taken as a result of  bp's new strategy, which when taken together with the lower forecast oil and gas prices, led to a large portion of the  material write-offs and impairments recorded during 2020.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| How the scope of our  audit responded to the  key audit matter | We challenged management's key E&A judgements, with regards to the impairment criteria of IFRS 6 and bp's  accounting policy. We corroborated key internal and external evidence relevant to significant write-offs and the assets  that remained on the balance sheet. This included analysing evidence of future E&A plans, budgets and capital  allocation decisions, assessing management's key accounting judgement papers, holding discussions to challenge top  level operational and finance management on the key judgements taken and reading meeting minutes, license  documentation and evidence of active dialogue with partners and regulators including negotiations to renew licences or  modify key terms, and external press releases. |\n| How the scope of our  audit responded to the  key audit matter | For E&A assets that were written off or impaired by management in 2020, including in particular those based upon  decisions taken in line with management's new strategy, we considered whether evidence (and potential contradictory  evidence) about activity in the year, future budgeted expenditure and exploration/appraisal plans, including plans and  expectations for licence relinquishment or retention, were consistent with the decisions taken by management to write- off or impair these assets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| How the scope of our  audit responded to the  key audit matter | We assessed whether management had consistently applied IFRS 6 and bp's accounting policy to impairment  assessments, taking account of in year judgements and historical look back considerations, and the relevant facts and  circumstances of specific E&A assets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| How the scope of our  audit responded to the  key audit matter | When considering capital allocation decision making, we considered whether the progression of any projects that                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| How the scope of our  audit responded to the  key audit matter | remain on the balance sheet would be inconsistent with elements of bp's new strategy and in particular its net zero  carbon commitments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| Key observations                                               | We concluded that the key assumptions had been appropriately determined and the judgements management had  made were appropriately supported.

These instruments are classified as level 3  financial assets or liabilities. This degree of subjectivity also gives rise to a risk of potential fraud through management  incorporating bias in determining fair values. Accordingly, we have identified these as a significant audit risk. |\n| How the scope of our  audit responded to the  key audit matter                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Accounting for SCTs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| How the scope of our  audit responded to the  key audit matter                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | For structured commodity transactions, we:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| How the scope of our  audit responded to the  key audit matter                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | \u00b7 Developed an understanding of the commercial rationale of the transactions through reading transaction documents  and executed agreements, and discussions with management.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| How the scope of our  audit responded to the  key audit matter                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | \u00b7 Performed a detailed accounting analysis for a sample of SCTs involving significant day one profits, deferred working  capital arrangements, offtake arrangements and/or commitments.

DevOps is an accepted  way of managing change which bridges the development and operations process with the aim of reducing change  timelines and enabling agility. The implementation of DevOps allows user privileges to be extended so developers are  also able to implement changes, a key segregation of duties (SoD) conflict within the change management lifecycle. To  manage this key SoD conflict, additional controls need to be implemented to ensure a developer cannot undermine the  change management process through the ability to develop and implement the same change. |\n|                                 | We identified that 25 applications using the DevOps change model did not have appropriate preventative SoD controls  in place.

Management has completed a root cause analysis and is implementing a sustainable forward looking governance and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n|                                 | control plan to manage the risk around DevOps.  which could negatively impact the way a system operates and accordingly, the ongoing integrity of the controls, reports                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|                                 | The change management deficiencies identified increase the risk of inappropriate or untested changes being made  and data within key financial systems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|                                 | The change management issues identified impact all components within the scope of our group audit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n|                                 | Both the user access management controls and the controls over change management are pervasive to the group's                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n|                                 | operations and accordingly the level of risk ascribed to our work in this area is dependent on the nature and complexity  of the control itself and the risks addressed by the control.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |",

Management's programme to remediate these deficiencies through the design of processes and controls in respect of the posting and review of manual journals was completed by the end of 2020 but has been impacted by the IT Control issues outlined in section 5.6 above. Accordingly, these control deficiencies remained during 2020 and we tested the mitigating controls which had been identified by management during the previous years' audits or other appropriate controls to mitigate these deficiencies. We expect to be testing the remediated journal controls in 2021 once the related IT control deficiencies have been remediated.\n\nThis had a significant bearing again this year on the allocation of audit resources and has been discussed with the audit committee throughout the year. Accordingly, we identified this as a key audit matter.",

We concluded that loss measures are  not appropriate in our determination of materiality.  Materiality was determined to be $600 million, which is  0.73% of net assets.  In 2019, we determined materiality to be $850 million,  which represented 10.3% of profit before taxation, 5% of                                                                                                     | We determined materiality for our audit of the standalone  parent using 1% (2019 1%) of net assets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Rationale for the  benchmark applied | We conducted an assessment of which line items are the  most important to investors and analysts by reading analyst  reports and bp's communications to shareholders and  lenders, as well as the communications of peer companies.  We then considered the fact that bp reported a loss during  the year. This resulted in us selecting net assets as the  most appropriate benchmark.  Profit before tax is the benchmark ordinarily considered by  us when auditing listed entities. It provides comparability                                                                                                                                      | The materiality determined for the standalone parent  company financial statements exceeds the group  materiality. This is due to the fact that the net asset balance  of the parent company financial statements exceeds the net  asset balance of the group financial statements. As the  company is non\u00adtrading and operates primarily as a holding  company, we believe the net asset position is the most  appropriate benchmark to use.                     |\n| Basis for determining  materiality   | against other companies across all sectors, but has  limitations when auditing companies whose earnings are  strongly correlated to commodity prices, which can be  volatile from one period to the next, and therefore may not  be representative of the volume of transactions and the  overall size of the business in the year, or where the impact  of price volatility may result in material impairment charges  or reversals in a particular year. As noted above, the  COVID-19 pandemic and in particular the decrease in oil and  gas prices resulted in significant losses in 2020. We  therefore placed our emphasis on net assets in our | Where there were balances and transactions within the  parent company accounts that were within the scope of the  audit of the group financial statements, our procedures  were undertaken using the lower materiality level applicable  to the group audit components. It was only for the purposes  of testing balances not relevant to the group audit, such as  intercompany investment balances, that the higher level of  materiality applied in practice. |",

        "page_content": "## Financial statements\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 6.2 Performance materiality\n\nWe set performance materiality at a level lower than materiality to reduce the probability that, in aggregate, uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceed the materiality for the financial statements as a whole. Group performance materiality was set at 60% of group materiality for the 2020 audit (2019 60%) and parent company performance materiality was set at 60% of parent company materiality for the 2020 audit (2019 60%).\n\nGiven the significant changes in the business environment due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we maintained a percentage consistent with that of our 2019 audit rather than increasing it to reflect the quality of the control environment and the fact that we are generally able to rely on controls, the relatively low level of misstatements identified in the current and prior years, as well as the fact that management is generally willing to correct these misstatements.\n\n## 6.3 Error reporting threshold\n\nWe agreed with the audit committee that we would report to the committee all audit differences in excess of $30 million (2019 $35 million), as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the audit committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.\n\n## 7. An overview of the scope of our audit\n\n## 7.1 Identification and scoping of components\n\nAs a result of the highly disaggregated nature of the group, with operations in over 70 countries through approximately 920 cons units, a significant portion of our audit planning effort was ensuring that the scope of our work is appropriate in addressing the identified risks of material misstatement.\n\nThe factors that we considered when assessing the scope of the bp audit, and the level of work to be performed at the cons units that are in scope for group reporting purposes, included the following:\n\n- \u00b7 The financial significance of an operating unit (which will typically include multiple cons units) to bp's revenue and loss before tax, or PP&E, including consideration of the financial significance of specific account balances or transactions.\n- \u00b7 The significance of specific risks relating to an operating unit, history of unusual or complex transactions, identification of significant audit issues or the potential for, or a history of, material misstatements.\n- \u00b7 The effectiveness of the control environment and monitoring activities, including entity-level controls.\n- \u00b7 The findings, observations and audit differences that we noted as a result of our 2019 audit engagement.\n\nOur audit approach was generally to place reliance on management's controls over financial reporting.\n\nTo ensure we were able to obtain sufficient, appropriate audit evidence for the purposes of our audit of the financial statements, we performed full scope audit procedures for 173 reporting cons units (2019 179) which were selected based on their size or risk characteristics. The primary reason for the change in scope is due to certain cons units in the T&S function no longer being used by management to record transactions. Our full-scope audits are in the UK, US, Azerbaijan, Germany, Canada and Singapore. One of the full-scope cons units includes the investment in Rosneft, a material associate not controlled by bp.\n\nIn addition, component teams performed audit procedures on specified account balances in 62 cons units (2019 55) also covering operations in Angola, Alaska, Trinidad & Tobago, Mauritania & Senegal, and Australia. The group engagement team performed audit procedures on specified account balances to component materiality, with certain additional specific procedures performed by component teams, covering an additional 42 cons units (2019 29).\n\nThe remaining cons units are not significant individually and include many small, low risk components and balances. On average, they each represent 0.03% of group revenue (2019 0.03%) and 0.03% of property, plant and equipment (2019 0.03%).\n\nIn our assessment of the residual balances not covered by the above procedures, we have considered in particular the risk that there could be a material misstatement within the large number of geographically dispersed businesses, in particular within the downstream segment. This assessment included use of our analytic tools to interrogate data, preparation of trend analysis and comparison of business performance to market benchmark prices. We also tested management's group-wide controls across a range of locations and segments. We concluded that through this additional risk assessment, we have reduced the audit risk of such a misstatement arising to a sufficiently low level.\n\nOur audit coverage of 'Property, plant and equipment' and 'Sales and other operating revenue' is materially the same as in the prior year.\n\nThis page does not form part of bp's Annual Report on Form 20-F as filed with the SEC.",

As part of our controls testing, we assessed the design and implementation of controls and tested a sample for operating effectiveness through a combination of tests of inquiry, observation, inspection and re-performance.\n\nIn limited situations where we were not able to take a controls reliance approach due to controls being deficient and there not being sufficient mitigating or alternative controls we could rely on instead, we adopted a non-controls reliance approach. All control deficiencies which we considered to be significant, including those in respect of management override (see above) were communicated to the audit committee. All other deficiencies were communicated to management. For all deficiencies identified we considered the impact and updated our audit plan accordingly.\n\nThe group's financial systems environment is complex, with 113 separate IT systems scoped as being relevant to the audit for the following key locations (UK, US, Germany, Angola, Azerbaijan and Australia) as well as other minor locations. These systems are all directly or indirectly relevant to the entity's financial reporting process.\n\nWe planned to rely on the General IT Controls (GITCs) associated with these systems, where the GITCs were appropriately designed and implemented, and these were operating effectively. To assess the operating effectiveness of GITCs we performed testing on access security, change management, data centre operations and network operations. We have included our observations on the IT controls in our key audit matter section, (see 'IT controls relating to financial systems' above).\n\n## 7.3  Working with other auditors\n\nThe group audit team are responsible for the scope and direction of the audit process and provide direct oversight, review, and coordination of our component audit teams. We interacted regularly with the component Deloitte teams during each stage of the audit and reviewed key working papers. We maintained continuous and open dialogue with our component teams in addition to holding formal meetings quarterly to ensure that we were fully aware of their progress and results of their procedures.\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic and the travel restrictions in place during the year, the senior statutory auditor and other group audit partners were unable to conduct visits to meet with the component teams responsible for the full scope locations, and other key locations including the key Global Business Services (GBS) accounting locations. As a result of this, we performed alternative virtual procedures which included attending planning meetings, discussing the audit approach and any issues arising from the component team's work, meetings with local management, and reviewing key audit working papers on higher and significant-risk areas to drive a consistent and high-quality audit. In addition, a global audit planning meeting was held virtually for two days in July led by the senior statutory auditor and involving the group audit team, partners and staff from all full scope component teams, audit teams responsible for testing at key GBS locations, senior management from bp, and the audit committee chairman.\n\nWe were provided with direct access to Rosneft's auditor in order to evaluate their audit work on the financial statements of Rosneft, used as the basis for bp's equity accounting. We held meetings with Rosneft's auditor throughout the year, issued audit instructions to them, reviewed their written clearance reports responding to these instructions and, through our direct access, were able to exercise appropriate supervision and oversight of their audit work. We also tested directly bp's procedures and controls over its accounting for the investment in Rosneft.\n\nThis page does not form part of bp's Annual Report on Form 20-F as filed with the SEC.\n\n## Sales and other operating revenues\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Full audit scope\n- Specified account balances\n- Specified audit procedures\n- Review at group level",

The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other than the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon.\n\nOur opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nIf we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.\n\n## 9. Responsibilities of directors\n\nAs explained more fully in the directors' responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group's and the parent company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## 10. Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nDetails of the extent to which the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud and non-compliance with laws and regulations are set out below.\n\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC's website at: frc.org.uk/ auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor's report.\n\n## 11. Extent to which the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud\n\nWe identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, and then design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, including obtaining audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## 11.1  Identifying and assessing potential risks related to irregularities\n\nIn identifying and assessing risks of material misstatement in respect of irregularities, including fraud and non-compliance with laws and regulations, we considered the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Our meetings throughout the year with the Group Head of Ethics and Compliance and reviews of bp's internal ethics and compliance reporting summaries, including those concerning investigations;\n- \u00b7 Enquiries of management, internal audit, and the audit committee, including obtaining and reviewing supporting documentation, concerning the Group's policies and procedures relating to:\n- \u00b7 identifying, evaluating and complying with laws and regulations and whether they were aware of any instances of non-compliance\n- \u00b7 detecting and responding to the risks of fraud and whether they have knowledge of any actual, suspected or alleged fraud; and\n- \u00b7 the internal controls established to mitigate risks related to fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations;\n- \u00b7 The group's remuneration policies, key drivers for remuneration and bonus levels; and\n- \u00b7 Discussions among the engagement team regarding how and where fraud might occur in the financial statements and any potential indicators of fraud. The engagement team includes audit partners and staff who have extensive experience of working with companies in the same sectors as bp operates, and this experience was relevant to the discussion about where fraud risks may arise. The discussions also involved fraud experts from Deloitte's forensic accounting function in the Financial Advisory service line, who advised the engagement team of fraud schemes that had arisen in similar sectors and industries and participated in the initial fraud risk assessment discussions.\n\nIn common with all audits under ISAs (UK), we are also required to perform specific procedures to respond to the risk of management override.\n\nWe also obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that the group operates in, focusing on provisions of those laws and regulations that had a direct effect on the determination of material amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The key laws and regulations we considered in this context included the UK Companies Act, UK Corporate Governance Code, IFRS as issued by the IASB and adopted by the EU, FRS 101, US Securities Exchange Act 1934 and relevant SEC regulations, as well as laws and regulations prevailing in each country in which we identified a full-scope component.\n\nIn addition, we considered provisions of other laws and regulations that do not have a direct effect on the financial statements but compliance with which may be fundamental to the group's ability to operate or to avoid a material penalty. These included the group's operating licences, environmental regulations etc.\n\n## 11.2  Audit response to risks identified\n\nAs a result of performing the above, we did not identify any key audit matters related to the potential risk of fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations. We did identify two key audit matters relating to fraud risks, as described above, being the accounting for SCTs and Level 3 instruments\n\nThis page does not form part of bp's Annual Report on Form 20-F as filed with the SEC.\n\nWe have nothing to report in respect of these matters.",

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the company as of 31 December 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended 31 December 2020, in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union and IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the company's internal control over financial reporting as of 31 December 2020, based on criteria established in the UK Financial Reporting Council's Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and Business Reporting relating to internal control over financial reporting and our report dated 22 March 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion on the group's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Basis for opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the group's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the group's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the group in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\n## 1. Property, plant and equipment (PP&E) assets - Impairment of upstream oil and gas - Notes 1, 4 and 12 to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nThe group balance sheet at 31 December 2020 includes PP&E of $115 billion, of which $74 billion is oil and gas properties within the upstream segment.\n\nManagement's best estimate of oil and gas price assumptions for value-in-use impairment tests were revised downwards during 2020 compared to the prior year assumptions, as set out in Note 1 on page 161. The downward revisions reflect an expectation that the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic will accelerate the pace of transition to a lower carbon economy and energy system. Given the significance of these revisions, management tested all upstream CGUs for impairment.\n\nManagement recorded $12.9 billion of pre-tax upstream CGU impairment charges, in large part due to the oil and gas prices revisions detailed above, and $0.1 billion of pre-tax upstream CGU impairment reversals. Further information has been provided in Note 1 on page 160, Note 4 on page 179 and Note 12 on page 189.\n\nThrough our audit risk assessment procedures, we have a identified a critical audit matter in respect of PP&E impairment principally due to the following three key management estimates in management's determination of the level of impairment charge and/or reversal to record.\n\n- \u00b7 Oil and gas prices - bp's oil and gas price assumptions have a significant impact on many CGU impairment assessments performed across the upstream segment, and are inherently uncertain. As noted above, the estimation of future prices is subject to increased uncertainty given climate change, the global energy transition and the impact of COVID-19. There is a risk that management do not forecast reasonable 'best estimate' oil and gas price forecasts when assessing CGUs for impairment, leading to material misstatements. These price assumptions are highly judgmental and are pervasive inputs to most upstream impairment tests, such that any misstatements would also aggregate. There is also a risk that management's oil and gas price related disclosures are not reasonable.\n- \u00b7 Discount rates - Given the long timeframes involved, certain CGU impairment assessments are sensitive to the discount rate applied. Discount rates should reflect the return required by the market and the risks inherent in the cash flows being discounted. There is a risk that management do not assume reasonable discount rates, adjusted as applicable for country risks and relevant tax rates, leading to material misstatements. Determining a reasonable discount rate is highly judgmental and, consistent with price assumptions above, the discount rate assumption is also a pervasive input across upstream impairment tests, before adjustments for asset specific risks and tax rates, such that any misstatements would also aggregate.\n- \u00b7 Reserves and resources estimates - A key input to certain CGU impairment assessments is the oil and gas production forecast, which is based on underlying reserves estimates and field specific development assumptions. Certain CGU production forecasts include specific risk adjusted resource volumes, in addition to proved or probable reserves estimates, that are inherently less certain than reserves; and assumptions related to these volumes can be particularly judgemental. There is a risk that material misstatements could arise from unreasonable production forecasts for individually material CGUs and/or from the aggregation of systematic flaws in bp's reserves and resources estimation policies across the segment.",

        "page_content": "We identified certain individual CGUs with a total carrying value of $32.1 billion which we determined would be most at risk of material impairment charges or reversals as a result of a plausible change in the key assumptions, particularly oil and gas price and discount rate assumptions.\n\nWe also identified CGUs with a further $16.0 billion of combined carrying value which were less sensitive as they would be potentially at risk, in aggregate, to a material impairment or reversal by a plausible change in some or all of the key assumptions.\n\nFurther information regarding these sensitivities is given in Note 1 on page 167.\n\n## How the Critical Audit Matter was addressed in the Audit\n\nWe tested management's key internal controls over the estimation of oil and gas prices, discount rates and reserve and resources estimates, as well as key internal controls over the performance of the impairment assessments where we identified audit risks. In addition, we conducted the following substantive procedures.\n\n## Oil and gas prices\n\n- \u00b7 We independently developed a reasonable range of forecasts based on external data obtained, against which we compared management's oil and gas price assumptions in order to challenge whether they are reasonable.\n- \u00b7 In developing this range we obtained a variety of reputable and reliable third party forecasts, peer information and other relevant market data.\n- \u00b7 In challenging management's price assumptions, we considered the extent to which they and each of the forecast pricing scenarios obtained from third parties reflect the impact of lower oil and gas demand due to climate change, the energy transition and COVID-19.\n- \u00b7 We specifically analysed third party forecasts stated as being, or interpreted by us as being, consistent with achieving the Paris 2\u00b0C Goal and considered whether they presented contradictory audit evidence.\n- \u00b7 We challenged management's disclosures in Notes 1 and 4 including in relation to the sensitivity of oil and gas price assumptions to reduced demand scenarios whether due to climate change or other reasons.\n\n## Discount rates\n\n- \u00b7 We independently evaluated bp's discount rates used in impairment tests with input from Deloitte valuation specialists, against relevant third party market and peer data.\n- \u00b7 We assessed whether specific country risks and tax adjustments were reasonably reflected in bp's discount rates.\n- \u00b7 We challenged management's disclosures in Notes 1 and 4 including in relation to the sensitivity of discount rate assumptions.\n\n## Reserves and resources estimates\n\nWith the assistance of Deloitte oil and gas reserves specialists we:\n\n- \u00b7 assessed bp's reserves and resources estimation methods and policies;\n- \u00b7 assessed, guided by our risk assessment, how these policies had been applied to a sample of bp's reserves and resources estimates which included those that we judged to represent the greatest risk of material misstatement;\n- \u00b7 read a sample of reports provided by management's external reserves experts and assessed the scope of work and findings of these third parties;\n- \u00b7 assessed the competence, capability and objectivity of bp's internal and external reserve experts; through understanding their relevant professional qualifications and experience.\n- \u00b7 compared the production forecasts used in the impairment tests with management's approved reserves and resources estimates, those estimates having been subjected to the controls that we had tested; and\n- \u00b7 performed a retrospective assessment to check for indications of estimation bias over time\n\n## Other procedures\n\n- \u00b7 We challenged management's CGU determinations, and considered whether there was any contradictory evidence present.\n- \u00b7 We validated that bp's impairment methodology was acceptable under IFRS and tested the integrity and mechanical accuracy of certain impairment models based on our risk assessment.\n- \u00b7 We challenged other CGU specific valuation input assumptions, including but not limited to material cost and tax forecasts, by comparing forecasts to approved internal and third party budgets, development plans, independent expectations and historical actuals.\n- \u00b7 Where relevant, we assessed management's historical forecasting accuracy and whether the estimates had been determined and applied on a consistent basis across the group.\n\n## 2. Intangible assets - Write-off of Exploration and Appraisal (E&A) assets, included within 'intangible assets' within the Group balance sheet Notes 1, 8 and 15 to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nThe group capitalises E&A expenditure on a project-by-project basis in line with IFRS 6 'Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources'. At 31 December 2020, $4.1 billion of E&A expenditure was carried on the group balance sheet.\n\nE&A activity carries inherent risk and a significant proportion of projects fail, requiring the write-off or impairment of the related capitalised costs when the relevant criteria in IFRS 6 and bp's accounting policy are met.\n\nFurthermore, similar to upstream PP&E assets discussed above, E&A assets are also potentially exposed to climate change, the global energy transition, and COVID-19, in that a greater number of E&A projects may not proceed as a consequence of lower forecast future demand and oil and gas pricing, lower appetite by management and the board to allocate capital to certain projects, and/or increased objections from stakeholders to the development of certain projects.\n\nAs a result of bp's revised strategy announced in 2020, including a reduced capital frame, a net-zero carbon ambition and a decision not to explore in new countries, and reflecting lower oil and gas price assumptions, management identified IFRS 6 impairment indicators at a number of upstream's largest E&A assets during the year. This led to management recording $9.9 billion of pre-tax E&A write-offs and impairments during 2020, detailed further in Notes 1 and 8 on pages 164 and 184.\n\nThe determination of when E&A costs should be written off or impaired, or retained on the balance sheet as E&A assets, can be complex and require significant judgement from management in assessing this. There is a risk that certain capitalised E&A costs are written off or impaired when they",

There is also a risk that E&A costs remain capitalised on the balance sheet which ought to have been written off or impaired, leading to material misstatements.\n\nWe identified a critical audit matter for the individually material E&A write-offs recorded in 2020, specifically the Kaskida and Tigris (Paleogene) licenses that were the largest part of the $2.5 billion Gulf of Mexico write downs, the Terre de Grace oil sands project that was the largest part of the $2.5 billion Canada write downs  and the three  licenses that were the largest part of the $2.1 billion Brazil write-downs. We also identified higher risks in relation to certain other 2020 E&A write-offs and impairments recorded; and higher risks at certain assets within the $4.4 billion of E&A costs that remain capitalised under IFRS 6 at 31 December 2020.\n\n## How the Critical Audit Matter was addressed in the Audit\n\nWe obtained an understanding of the group's E&A assessment processes and tested management's key internal controls. This included the key internal controls operated by management for the key decisions taken as a result of bp's new strategy, which when taken together with the lower forecast oil and gas prices, led to a large portion of the material write-offs and impairments recorded during 2020.\n\nWe challenged management's key E&A judgements, with regards to the impairment criteria of IFRS 6 and bp's accounting policy. We corroborated key internal and external evidence relevant to significant write-offs and the assets that remained on the balance sheet. This included analysing evidence of future E&A plans, budgets and capital allocation decisions, assessing management's key accounting judgement papers, holding discussions to challenge top level operational and finance management on the key judgements taken and reading meeting minutes, license documentation and evidence of active dialogue with partners and regulators including negotiations to renew licences or modify key terms, and external press releases.\n\nFor E&A assets that were written off or impaired by management in 2020, including in particular those based upon decisions taken in line with management's new strategy, we considered whether evidence (and potential contradictory evidence) about activity in the year, future budgeted expenditure and exploration/appraisal plans, including plans and expectations for licence relinquishment or retention, were consistent with the decisions taken by management to write-off or impair these assets.\n\nWe assessed whether management had consistently applied IFRS 6 and bp's accounting policy to impairment assessments, taking account of in year judgements and historical look back considerations, and the relevant facts and circumstances of specific E&A assets.\n\nWhen considering capital allocation decision making, we considered whether the progression of any projects that remain on the balance sheet would be inconsistent with elements of bp's new strategy and in particular its net zero carbon commitments.\n\n- 3. Accounting for structured commodity transactions (SCTs) within the trading and shipping (T&S) function and the valuation of other Level 3 financial instruments, where fraud risks may arise in revenue recognition (potentially impacting all financial statement accounts, in particular finance debt) - Notes 1, 20, 22, 29 and 30 to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nIn the normal course of business, T&S enters into a variety of transactions for delivering value across the group's supply chain. The nature of these transactions requires significant audit effort to be directed towards challenging management's valuation estimates or the adopted accounting treatment.\n\nWe have undertaken an analysis of the portfolio composition and revisited our risk assessment throughout the year focussing particularly on the impact of COVID-19 on the valuation assertion. This process has provided us with a deeper understanding of the impact of market volatility, demand destruction and the changing structure of the markets in which bp operates.\n\n## Accounting for structured commodity transactions:\n\nT&S may also enter into a variety of transactions which we refer to as SCTs. We generally consider a SCT to be an arrangement having one of the following features:\n\n- \u00b7 Two or more counterparties with non-standard contractual terms;\n- \u00b7 Multiple commodity-based transactions; and/or\n- \u00b7 Contractual arrangements entered into in contemplation of each other.\n\nSCTs are often long-dated, can have a significant multi-year financial impact, and may require the use of complex valuation models or unobservable inputs when determining their fair value, in which case they will be classified as level 3 financial instruments under IFRS 13, 'Fair Value Measurement'.\n\nAccounting for SCTs is typically complex and involves significant judgment, as these transactions often feature multiple elements that will have a material impact on the presentation and disclosure of these transactions in the financial statements and on key performance measures, including in particular the classification of liabilities as finance debt. Accordingly, we have identified the accounting for SCTs as a critical audit matter.\n\n## Level 3 financial instruments:\n\nUnlike other financial instruments whose values or inputs are readily observable and therefore more easily independently corroborated, there are certain transactions for which the valuation is inherently more subjective due to the use of either complex valuation models and/or unobservable inputs. These instruments are classified as level 3 financial assets or liabilities. This degree of subjectivity also gives rise to a risk of potential fraud through management incorporating bias in determining fair values. Accordingly, we have identified these as a significant audit risk.\n\nAs at 31 December 2020, the group's total financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value were $12.7 billion and $8.4 billion, of which level 3 derivative financial assets were $6.4 billion and level 3 derivative financial liabilities were $5.3 billion.\n\n## How the Critical Audit Matter was addressed in the Audit\n\n## Accounting for SCTs\n\nFor structured commodity transactions, we:\n\n- \u00b7 Tested controls related to the accounting for complex transactions.\n- \u00b7 Developed an understanding of the commercial rationale of the transactions through reading transaction documents and executed agreements, and discussions with management.\n- \u00b7 Performed a detailed accounting analysis for a sample of SCTs involving significant day one profits, deferred working capital arrangements, offtake arrangements and/or commitments. We confirmed that any day one profits were appropriately deferred.",

Our valuation audit procedures included the following control and substantive procedures:\n\n- \u00b7 We tested the group's valuation controls including the:\n- - Model certification control, which is designed to review a model's theoretical soundness and the appropriateness of its valuation methodology; and\n- - Independent price verification control, which is designed to review the appropriateness of valuation inputs that are not observable and are significant to the financial instrument's valuation.\n- \u00b7 We performed substantive valuation testing procedures at interim and year-end balance sheet date, including:\n- - Comparing management's input assumptions against the expected assumptions of other market participants and observable market data;\n- - Evaluating management's valuation methodologies against standard valuation practice and analysing whether a consistent framework is applied across the business period over period; and\n- - Engaging a Deloitte valuations specialist to challenge models, develop fair value estimates and verify consistency in management's modelling and input assumptions throughout the year. Our independent estimates were established using independently sourced inputs (where available). We evaluated whether the differences between our independent estimates and management's estimates were within a reasonable range. In situations where we utilised management's inputs, these were compared to external data sources to determine whether they were reasonable.\n\n## /s/ Deloitte LLP\n\nLondon United Kingdom 22 March 2021\n\nThe first accounting period we audited was the 12 month period ended 31 December 2018.",

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as at 31 December 2020, based on the criteria established in the UK FRC Guidance.\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2020, of the Company and our report dated 22 March 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Basis for opinion\n\nThe Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's report on internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Definition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting\n\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n/s/ Deloitte LLP London, United Kingdom 22 March 2021\n\n- 1. The maintenance and integrity of the BP p.l.c. web site is the responsibility of BP p.l.c.; the work carried out by the auditors does not involve consideration of these matters and, accordingly, the auditors accept no responsibility for any changes that may have occurred to the financial statements since they were initially presented on the web site.\n- 2.

Significant accounting policies, judgements, estimates and assumptions\n\n## Authorization of financial statements and statement of compliance with International Financial Reporting Standards\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of BP p.l.c and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as bp or the group) for the year ended 31 December 2020 were approved and signed by the chief executive officer and chairman on 22 March 2021 having been duly authorized to do so by the board of directors. BP p.l.c. is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), IFRS adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union (EU) and in accordance with the provisions of the UK Companies Act 2006 as applicable to companies reporting under international accounting standards. IFRS as adopted by the EU differs in certain respects from IFRS as issued by the IASB. The differences have no impact on the group's consolidated financial statements for the years presented. As a result of the UK's withdrawal from the EU, with effect for periods starting subsequent to the year ended 31 December 2020, the consolidated financial statements will also be prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards. There were no differences between IFRS as adopted by the EU and UK-adopted international accounting standards as at 1 January 2021. The UK's withdrawal from the EU has not had and is not expected to have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements.  The significant accounting policies and accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions of the group are set out below.\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and in accordance with IFRS and IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) interpretations issued and effective for the year ended 31 December 2020. The accounting policies that follow have been consistently applied to all years presented, except where otherwise indicated.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are presented in US dollars and all values are rounded to the nearest million dollars ($ million), except where otherwise indicated.\n\n## Significant accounting policies: use of judgements, estimates and assumptions\n\nInherent in the application of many of the accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements is the need for bp management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Actual outcomes could differ from the estimates and assumptions used. The accounting judgements and estimates that have a significant impact on the results of the group are set out in boxed text below, and should be read in conjunction with the information provided in the Notes on financial statements. The areas requiring the most significant judgement and estimation in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are: accounting for the investment in Rosneft; exploration and appraisal intangible assets; the recoverability of asset carrying values, including the estimation of reserves; supplier financing arrangements;  derivative financial instruments; provisions and contingencies; and pensions and other post-retirement benefits. Judgements and estimates, not all of which are significant, made in assessing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and climate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy on the consolidated financial statements are also set out in boxed text below. Where an estimate has a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year this is specifically noted within the boxed text.\n\n## Judgements and estimates made in assessing the impact of climate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy\n\nClimate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy were considered in preparing the consolidated financial statements. These may have significant impacts on the currently reported amounts of the group's assets and liabilities discussed below and on similar assets and liabilities that may be recognized in the future.\n\n## Impairment of property, plant and equipment, and goodwill\n\nThe energy transition is likely to impact the future prices of commodities such as oil and natural gas which in turn may affect the recoverable amount of property, plant and equipment, and goodwill in the oil and gas industry. Management's best estimate of oil and natural gas price assumptions for value-in-use impairment testing were revised downwards during 2020 and the period covered extended to 2050. The revised assumptions sit within the range of external forecasts considered by management and are broadly in line with a range of transition paths consistent with the goals of the Paris climate change agreement. See significant judgements and estimates: recoverability of asset carrying values for further information including sensitivity analysis in relation to reasonably possible changes in the price assumptions.\n\nImpairments were recognized during 2020 on certain Upstream oil and gas properties as a result of the lower price assumptions. See note 4 for further information.\n\nNo material impairments were recognized on Downstream assets. Though the energy transition may impact demand for certain refined products in the future, management anticipates sufficiently robust demand for the remainder of each refinery's useful life.\n\nHeadroom on goodwill balances was reduced, however the recoverable amount exceeds the carrying amount. See note 14 for further information including sensitivity analysis on the assumptions used to test goodwill for impairment.\n\nManagement will continue to review price assumptions as the energy transition progresses and this may result in impairment charges or reversals in the future.\n\n## Exploration and appraisal intangible assets\n\nThe energy transition may affect the future development or viability of exploration prospects. The lower price assumptions and work to develop bp's new strategy resulted in a review of the recoverability of exploration and appraisal intangible assets during 2020. Certain intangible assets were subsequently written-off. See significant judgement: exploration and appraisal intangible assets and note 8 for further information.\n\nThe revised long-term price assumptions for investment appraisal (see page 28) help create a framework that seeks to help ensure that currently unsanctioned future capital expenditure on property plant and equipment, and exploration and appraisal intangibles, is aligned with bp's new strategy.\n\n## Property, plant and equipment - depreciation and expected useful lives\n\nThe energy transition may curtail the expected useful lives of oil and gas industry assets thereby accelerating depreciation charges. However, the significant majority of bp's existing Upstream oil and natural gas properties are likely to be fully depreciated within the next 10 years and, as outlined in bp's new strategy, oil and natural gas production will remain an important part of bp's business activities over that period. Similarly, for Downstream refineries, demand for refined products is expected to remain strong over the remaining useful life of existing assets.",

Significant accounting policies, judgements, estimates and assumptions - continued\n\nTherefore, management does not expect the useful lives of bp's reported property, plant and equipment to change and do not consider this to be a significant accounting judgement or estimate. Significant capital expenditure is still required for ongoing projects and therefore the useful lives of future capital expenditure may, however, be different. See significant accounting policy: property, plant and equipment for more information.\n\n## Provisions: decommissioning\n\nThe energy transition may bring forward the decommissioning of oil and gas industry assets thereby increasing the present value of associated decommissioning provisions. The majority of bp's Upstream oil and gas properties are expected to start decommissioning within the next two decades and management does not expect any reasonable change in the expected timeframe to have a material effect on the Upstream decommissioning provisions, assuming cash flows remain unchanged. Decommissioning cost estimates are based on the known regulatory and external environment. These cost estimates may change in the future, including as a result of the transition to a lower carbon economy. For Downstream refineries, decommissioning provisions are generally not recognized as the associated obligations have indeterminate settlement dates, typically driven by the cessation of manufacturing. Management will continue to review facts and circumstances to assess if decommissioning provisions need to be recognized. See significant judgements and estimates: provisions for further information.\n\n## Judgements and estimates made in assessing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the economic environment\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, the following areas involving judgement and estimates were identified as most relevant with regards to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and current economic environment.\n\n## Going concern\n\nForecast liquidity has been assessed under a number of stressed scenarios, including a significant decline in oil prices over the 12-month period. Reverse stress tests performed indicated that the group will continue to operate as a going concern for at least 12 months from the date of approval of the consolidated financial statements even if the Brent price fell to zero. No material uncertainties over going concern or significant judgements or estimates in the assessment were identified. See also Note 29 Financial instruments and financial risk factors - Liquidity risk for further information.\n\n## Discount rate assumptions\n\nThe discount rates used for impairment testing and provisions were reassessed during the year in light of changing economic and geopolitical outlooks. The impact was determined not to be significant and the post-tax impairment discount rate and nominal provisions discount rate were unchanged from 2019. Pre-tax impairment discount rates and post-tax premiums for certain higher-risk countries were changed but this did not have a material impact. See significant judgements and estimates: recoverability of asset carrying values and provisions for further information.\n\n## Oil and natural gas price assumptions\n\nThe price assumptions used in value-in-use impairment testing were revised downwards during the year, in part due to lower demand for oil and natural gas.  Material impairment charges and exploration write-offs were recognized in the Upstream segment as a consequence of these price assumption changes.  See significant judgements and estimates: recoverability of asset carrying values and exploration and appraisal intangible assets for further information.\n\nDemand constraints for refined products during the year did not result in any material impairment charges on Downstream refinery assets.\n\n## Pensions and other post-retirement benefits\n\nThe volatility in the financial markets during 2020 impacted the assumptions used for determining the fair value of plan assets and the present value of defined benefit obligations in the group's defined benefit pension plans. See significant estimate: pensions and other post-retirement benefits and note 24 for further information.\n\n## Impairment of financial assets measured at amortized cost\n\nThe current economic environment and future credit risk outlook were considered in updating the estimate of expected credit loss allowances on financial assets measured at amortized cost. Whilst credit risk increased relative to 31 December 2019, there was also a significant reduction in the group's trade and other receivables balance. Therefore, the total expected credit loss allowances recognized as at 31 December 2020 did not significantly increase. Management does not consider the calculation of expected credit loss allowances to be a significant accounting estimate. See note 21 and 29 for further information.\n\n## Income taxes\n\nThe carrying amounts of the group's deferred tax assets were reviewed and updated to the extent that there are changes in the probability of sufficient taxable profits being available to utilize the reported deferred tax assets. Management does not consider the measurement of deferred tax assets to be a significant accounting estimate. See significant accounting policy: income taxes and Note 9 for further information.\n\n## Basis of consolidation\n\nThe consolidated group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of BP p.l.c. and its subsidiaries drawn up to 31 December each year. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date of their acquisition, being the date on which the group obtains control, including when control is obtained via potential voting rights, and continue to be consolidated until the date that control ceases. The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent company, using consistent accounting policies. Intra-group balances and transactions, including unrealized profits arising from intra-group transactions, have been eliminated. Unrealized losses are eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Non-controlling interests represent the equity in subsidiaries that is not attributable, directly or indirectly, to bp shareholders. Included within non-controlling interests are perpetual subordinated hybrid bonds issued by a subsidiary and for which the group has the unconditional right to avoid transferring cash or another financial asset to the bondholders. Profit or loss attributable to bp shareholders is adjusted to reflect the coupon related to these hybrid bonds whether or not such distribution has been deferred.\n\n## Interests in other entities\n\n## Business combinations and goodwill\n\nBusiness combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized at their fair values at the acquisition date.\n\nGoodwill is initially measured as the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred, the amount recognized for any non-controlling interest and the acquisition-date fair values of any previously held interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. The amount recognized for any non-controlling interest is measured at the present ownership's proportionate share in",

At the acquisition date, any goodwill acquired is allocated to each of the cashgenerating units, or groups of cash-generating units, expected to benefit from the combination's synergies. Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill arising on business combinations prior to 1 January 2003 is stated at the previous carrying amount under UK generally accepted accounting practice, less subsequent impairments.\n\nGoodwill may arise upon investments in joint ventures and associates, being the surplus of the cost of investment over the group's share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities. Any such goodwill is recorded within the corresponding investment in joint ventures and associates.\n\nGoodwill may also arise upon acquisition of interests in joint operations that meet the definition of a business. The amount of goodwill separately recognized is the excess of the consideration transferred over the group's share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities.\n\n## Interests in joint arrangements\n\nThe results, assets and liabilities of joint ventures are incorporated in these consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting as described below.\n\nCertain of the group's activities, particularly in the Upstream segment, are conducted through joint operations. bp recognizes, on a line-by-line basis in the consolidated financial statements, its share of the assets, liabilities and expenses of these joint operations incurred jointly with the other partners, along with the group's income from the sale of its share of the output and any liabilities and expenses that the group has incurred in relation to the joint operation.\n\n## Interests in associates\n\nThe results, assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting as described below.\n\n## Significant judgement: investment in Rosneft\n\nJudgement is required in assessing the level of control or influence over another entity in which the group holds an interest. For bp, the judgement that the group has significant influence over Rosneft Oil Company (Rosneft), a Russian oil and gas company is significant. As a consequence of this judgement, bp uses the equity method of accounting for its investment and bp's share of Rosneft's oil and natural gas reserves is included in the group's estimated net proved reserves of equity-accounted entities. If significant influence was not present, the investment would be accounted for as an investment in an equity instrument measured at fair value as described under 'Financial assets' below and no share of Rosneft's oil and natural gas reserves would be reported.\n\nSignificant influence is defined in IFRS as the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control of those policies. Significant influence is presumed when an entity owns 20% or more of the voting power of the investee. Significant influence is presumed not to be present when an entity owns less than 20% of the voting power of the investee.\n\nbp owns 19.75%  of the voting shares of Rosneft. Rosneft's largest shareholder is Rosneftegaz JSC (Rosneftegaz), which is wholly owned by the Russian government. At 31 December 2020, Rosneftegaz held 40.4%  (2019 50%  plus one share) of the voting shares of Rosneft . IFRS identifies several indicators that may provide evidence of significant influence, including representation on the board of directors of the investee and participation in policy-making processes. bp's group chief executive, Bernard Looney, was approved as a member of the board of directors of Rosneft in June 2020 as one of bp's two nominated directors. bp's other nominated director, Bob Dudley, has been a member of the Rosneft board since 2013. He is also chairman of the Rosneft board's Strategic and Sustainable Development Committee. bp also holds the voting rights at general meetings of shareholders conferred by its 19.75%  stake in Rosneft. Transactions by Rosneft in its own shares during the year have increased bp's economic interest in Rosneft to 22.03%  (2019 19.75% ). bp's management considers, therefore, that the group has significant influence over Rosneft, as defined by IFRS.\n\n## The equity method of accounting\n\nUnder the equity method, an investment is carried on the balance sheet at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the group's share of net assets of the entity, less distributions received and less any impairment in value of the investment. Loans advanced to equity-accounted entities that have the characteristics of equity financing are also included in the investment on the group balance sheet. The group income statement reflects the group's share of the results after tax of the equity-accounted entity, adjusted to account for depreciation, amortization and any impairment of the equityaccounted entity's assets based on their fair values at the date of acquisition. The group statement of comprehensive income includes the group's share of the equity-accounted entity's other comprehensive income. The group's share of amounts recognized directly in equity by an equity-accounted entity is recognized in the group's statement of changes in equity.\n\nFinancial statements of equity-accounted entities are prepared for the same reporting year as the group. Where material differences arise in the accounting policies used by the equity-accounted entity and those used by bp, adjustments are made to those financial statements to bring the accounting policies used into line with those of the group.\n\nUnrealized gains on transactions, apart from those that meet the definition of a derivative, between the group and its equity-accounted entities are eliminated to the extent of the group's interest in the equity-accounted entity.\n\nThe group assesses investments in equity-accounted entities for impairment whenever there is objective evidence that the investment is impaired. If any such objective evidence of impairment exists, the carrying amount of the investment is compared with its recoverable amount, being the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. If the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount, the investment is written down to its recoverable amount.\n\n## Segmental reporting\n\nThe group's operating segments are established on the basis of those components of the group that are evaluated regularly by the group chief executive, bp's chief operating decision maker, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.\n\nThe accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as the group's accounting policies described in this note, except that IFRS requires that the measure of profit or loss disclosed for each operating segment is the measure that is provided regularly to the chief operating decision maker. For bp, this measure of profit or loss is replacement cost profit before interest and tax which reflects the replacement cost of inventories sold in the period and is arrived at by excluding inventory holding gains and losses from profit before interest and tax. Replacement cost profit for the group is not a recognized measure under IFRS. For further information see Note 5.\n\nFor information on changes to bp's segmental reporting see 'Change in segmentation from 1 January 2021' below.",

Significant accounting policies, judgements, estimates and assumptions - continued\n\n## Foreign currency translation\n\nIn individual subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency of those entities at the spot exchange rate on the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated into the functional currency at the spot exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Any resulting exchange differences are included in the income statement, unless hedge accounting is applied. Non-monetary items, other than those measured at fair value, are not retranslated subsequent to initial recognition.\n\nIn the consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of non-US dollar functional currency subsidiaries, joint ventures, associates, and related goodwill, are translated into US dollars at the spot exchange rate on the balance sheet date. The results and cash flows of non-US dollar functional currency subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are translated into US dollars using average rates of exchange. In the consolidated financial statements, exchange adjustments arising when the opening net assets and the profits for the year retained by non-US dollar functional currency subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are translated into US dollars are recognized in a separate component of equity and reported in other comprehensive income. Exchange gains and losses arising on long-term intra-group foreign currency borrowings used to finance the group's nonUS dollar investments are also reported in other comprehensive income if the borrowings form part of the net investment in the subsidiary, joint venture or associate. On disposal or for certain partial disposals of a non-US dollar functional currency subsidiary, joint venture or associate, the related accumulated exchange gains and losses recognized in equity are reclassified from equity to the income statement.\n\n## Non-current assets held for sale\n\nNon-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.\n\nSignificant non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such assets. Management must be committed to the sale, which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification as held for sale, and actions required to complete the plan of sale should indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment and intangible assets are not depreciated or amortized once classified as held for sale.\n\n## Intangible assets\n\nIntangible assets, other than goodwill, include expenditure on the exploration for and evaluation of oil and natural gas resources, computer software, patents, licences and trademarks and are stated at the amount initially recognized, less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses.\n\nIntangible assets are carried initially at cost unless acquired as part of a business combination. Any such asset is measured at fair value at the date of the business combination and is recognized separately from goodwill if the asset is separable or arises from contractual or other legal rights.\n\nIntangible assets with a finite life, other than capitalized exploration and appraisal costs as described below, are amortized on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives. For patents, licences and trademarks, expected useful life is the shorter of the duration of the legal agreement and economic useful life, and can range from three to fifteen years. Computer software costs generally have a useful life of three to five years.\n\nThe expected useful lives of assets and the amortization method are reviewed on an annual basis and, if necessary, changes in useful lives or the amortization method are accounted for prospectively.\n\n## Oil and natural gas exploration, appraisal and development expenditure\n\nOil and natural gas exploration, appraisal and development expenditure is accounted for using the principles of the successful efforts method of accounting as described below.\n\n## Licence and property acquisition costs\n\nExploration licence and leasehold property acquisition costs are capitalized within intangible assets and are reviewed at each reporting date to confirm that there is no indication that the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount. This review includes confirming that exploration drilling is still under way or planned or that it has been determined, or work is under way to determine, that the discovery is economically viable based on a range of technical and commercial considerations, and sufficient progress is being made on establishing development plans and timing. If no future activity is planned, the remaining balance of the licence and property acquisition costs is written off. Lower value licences are pooled and amortized on a straightline basis over the estimated period of exploration. Upon internal approval for development and recognition of proved or sanctioned probable reserves of oil and natural gas, the relevant expenditure is transferred to property, plant and equipment.\n\n## Exploration and appraisal expenditure\n\nGeological and geophysical exploration costs are recognized as an expense as incurred. Costs directly associated with an exploration well are initially capitalized as an intangible asset until the drilling of the well is complete and the results have been evaluated. These costs include employee remuneration, materials and fuel used, rig costs and payments made to contractors. If potentially commercial quantities of hydrocarbons are not found, the exploration well costs are written off. If hydrocarbons are found and, subject to further appraisal activity, are likely to be capable of commercial development, the costs continue to be carried as an asset. If it is determined that development will not occur, that is, the efforts are not successful, then the costs are expensed.\n\nCosts directly associated with appraisal activity undertaken to determine the size, characteristics and commercial potential of a reservoir following the initial discovery of hydrocarbons, including the costs of appraisal wells where hydrocarbons were not found, are initially capitalized as an intangible asset. Upon internal approval for development and recognition of proved or sanctioned probable reserves, the relevant expenditure is transferred to property, plant and equipment. If development is not approved and no further activity is expected to occur, then the costs are expensed.\n\nThe determination of whether potentially economic oil and natural gas reserves have been discovered by an exploration well is usually made within one year of well completion, but can take longer, depending on the complexity of the geological structure. Exploration wells that discover potentially economic quantities of oil and natural gas and are in areas where major capital expenditure (e.g. an offshore platform or a pipeline) would be required before production could begin, and where the economic viability of that major capital expenditure depends on the successful completion of further exploration or appraisal work in the area, remain capitalized on the balance sheet as long as such work is under way or firmly planned.",

Significant accounting policies, judgements, estimates and assumptions - continued\n\n## Development expenditure\n\nExpenditure on the construction, installation and completion of infrastructure facilities such as platforms, pipelines and the drilling of development wells, including service and unsuccessful development or delineation wells, is capitalized within property, plant and equipment and is depreciated from the commencement of production as described below in the accounting policy for property, plant and equipment.\n\n## Significant judgement: exploration and appraisal intangible assets\n\nJudgement is required to determine whether it is appropriate to continue to carry costs associated with exploration wells and exploratory-type stratigraphic test wells on the balance sheet. This includes costs relating to exploration licences or leasehold property acquisitions. It is not unusual to have such costs remaining suspended on the balance sheet for several years while additional appraisal drilling and seismic work on the potential oil and natural gas field is performed or while the optimum development plans and timing are established.The costs are carried based on the current regulatory and political environment or any known changes to that environment. All such carried costs are subject to regular technical, commercial and management review on at least an annual basis to confirm the continued intent to develop, or otherwise extract value from, the discovery. Where this is no longer the case, the costs are immediately expensed.\n\nAs a result of the revised price assumptions detailed in Significant judgements and estimates: recoverability of asset carrying values below and a review of bp's long-term strategic plan, management reviewed bp's exploration prospects and the carrying value of the associated intangible assets. The outcome of the review resulted in revised judgements over management's expectations to extract value from certain prospects, thereby leading to material write-offs of the associated exploration and appraisal intangible assets in 2020.\n\nThe carrying amount of capitalized costs and further information on the write-offs are included in Note 8.\n\n## Property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment owned by the group is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. The initial cost of an asset comprises its purchase price or construction cost, any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset into the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management, the initial estimate of any decommissioning obligation, if applicable, and, for assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use, directly attributable general or specific finance costs. The purchase price or construction cost is the aggregate amount paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset.\n\nExpenditure on major maintenance refits or repairs comprises the cost of replacement assets or parts of assets, inspection costs and overhaul costs. Where an asset or part of an asset that was separately depreciated is replaced and it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the group, the expenditure is capitalized and the carrying amount of the replaced asset is derecognized. Inspection costs associated with major maintenance programmes are capitalized and amortized over the period to the next inspection. Overhaul costs for major maintenance programmes, and all other maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.\n\nOil and natural gas properties, including certain related pipelines, are depreciated using a unit-of-production method. The cost of producing wells is amortized over proved developed reserves. Licence acquisition, common facilities and future decommissioning costs are amortized over total proved reserves. The unit-of-production rate for the depreciation of common facilities takes into account expenditures incurred to date, together with estimated future capital expenditure expected to be incurred relating to as yet undeveloped reserves expected to be processed through these common facilities. Information on the carrying amounts of the group's oil and natural gas properties, together with the amounts recognized in the income statement as depreciation, depletion and amortization is contained in Note 12 and Note 5 respectively.\n\nEstimates of oil and natural gas reserves determined in accordance with US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations, including the application of  prices using 12-month historical price data in assessing the commerciality of technical volumes, are typically used to calculate depreciation, depletion and amortization charges for the group's oil and gas properties. Therefore, where this approach is adopted, charges are not dependent on management forecasts of future oil and gas prices.\n\nHowever, for certain oil and natural gas assets, the use of reserves determined in accordance with SEC regulations would result in a charge that is not reflective of the pattern in which the future economic benefits are expected to be consumed. In these limited instances other approaches are applied to determine the reserves base used to calculate depreciation, depletion and amortization, including the use of management's best estimate of price assumptions as disclosed in Significant judgements and estimates: recoverability of asset carrying values, to determine the commerciality of technical proved reserves.\n\nThe impact of changes in estimated proved reserves is dealt with prospectively by amortizing the remaining carrying value of the asset over the expected future production.\n\nThe estimation of oil and natural gas reserves and bp's process to manage reserves bookings is described in Supplementary information on oil and natural gas on page 231, which is unaudited. Details on bp's proved reserves and production compliance and governance processes are provided on page 312. The 2020 movements in proved reserves are reflected in the tables showing movements in oil and natural gas reserves by region in Supplementary information on oil and natural gas (unaudited) on page 231.\n\nOther property, plant and equipment is depreciated on a straight-line basis over its expected useful life. The typical useful lives of the group's other property, plant and equipment are as follows:\n\n15 to 25 years\n\n| Land improvements     |                |\n|-----------------------|----------------|\n| Buildings             | 20 to 50 years |\n| Refineries            | 20 to 30 years |\n| Petrochemicals plants | 20 to 30 years |\n| Pipelines             | 10 to 50 years |\n| Service stations      | 15 years       |\n| Office equipment      | 3 to 10 years  |\n| Fixtures and fittings | 5 to 15 years  |\n\nThe expected useful lives and depreciation method of property, plant and equipment are reviewed on an annual basis and, if necessary, changes in useful lives or the depreciation method are accounted for prospectively.An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognized upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the item) is included in the income statement in the period in which the item is derecognized.",

Significant accounting policies, judgements, estimates and assumptions - continued\n\n## Impairment of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, and goodwill\n\nThe group assesses assets or groups of assets, called cash-generating units (CGUs), for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or CGU may not be recoverable; for example, changes in the group's business plans, plans to dispose rather than retain assets, changes in the group's assumptions about commodity prices, low plant utilization, evidence of physical damage or, for oil and gas assets, significant downward revisions of estimated reserves or increases in estimated future development expenditure or decommissioning costs. If any such indication of impairment exists, the group makes an estimate of the asset's or CGU's recoverable amount. Individual assets are grouped into CGUs for impairment assessment purposes at the lowest level at which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets. A CGU's recoverable amount is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. If it is probable that the value of the CGU will be primarily recovered through a disposal transaction, the expected disposal proceeds are considered in determining the recoverable amount. Where the carrying amount of a CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the CGU is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.\n\nThe business segment plans, which are approved on an annual basis by senior management, are the primary source of information for the determination of value in use. They contain forecasts for oil and natural gas production, refinery throughputs, sales volumes for various types of refined products (e.g. gasoline and lubricants), revenues, costs and capital expenditure. Carbon taxes and costs of emissions allowances are included in estimates of future cash flows, where applicable, based on the regulatory environment in each jurisdiction in which the group operates. As an initial step in the preparation of these plans, various assumptions regarding market conditions, such as oil prices, natural gas prices, refining margins, refined product margins and cost inflation rates are set by senior management. These assumptions take account of existing prices, global supply-demand equilibrium for oil and natural gas, other macroeconomic factors and historical trends and variability. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are adjusted for the risks specific to the asset group that are not reflected in the discount rate and are discounted to their present value typically using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money.\n\nFair value less costs of disposal is the price that would be received to sell the asset in an orderly transaction between market participants and does not reflect the effects of factors that may be specific to the group and not applicable to entities in general. In limited circumstances where recent market transactions are not available for reference, discounted cash flow techniques are applied. Where discounted cash flow analyses are used to calculate fair value less costs of disposal, estimates are made about the assumptions market participants would use when pricing the asset, CGU or group of CGUs containing goodwill and the test is performed on a post-tax basis.\n\nAn assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognized impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. If such an indication exists, the recoverable amount is estimated. A previously recognized impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset's recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognized. If that is the case, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the lower of its recoverable amount and the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset in prior years. Impairment reversals are recognized in profit or loss. After a reversal, the depreciation charge is adjusted in future periods to allocate the asset's revised carrying amount, less any residual value, on a systematic basis over its remaining useful life.\n\nGoodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the recoverable amount of the group of CGUs to which the goodwill relates should be assessed. In assessing whether goodwill has been impaired, the carrying amount of the group of CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated is compared with its recoverable amount. Where the recoverable amount of the group of CGUs is less than the carrying amount (including goodwill), an impairment loss is recognized. An impairment loss recognized for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.",

Significant accounting policies, judgements, estimates and assumptions - continued\n\n## Significant judgements and estimates: recoverability of asset carrying values\n\nDetermination as to whether, and by how much, an asset, CGU, or group of CGUs containing goodwill is impaired involves management estimates on highly uncertain matters such as the effects of inflation and deflation on operating expenses, discount rates, capital expenditure, production profiles, reserves and resources, and future commodity prices, including the outlook for global or regional market supply-and-demand conditions for crude oil, natural gas and refined products. Judgement is required when determining the appropriate grouping of assets into a CGU or the appropriate grouping of CGUs for impairment testing purposes. For example, individual oil and gas properties may form separate CGUs whilst certain oil and gas properties with shared infrastructure may be grouped together to form a single CGU. Alternative groupings of assets or CGUs may result in a different outcome from impairment testing. See Note 14 for details on how these groupings have been determined in relation to the impairment testing of goodwill.\n\nAs described above, the recoverable amount of an asset is the higher of its value in use and its fair value less costs of disposal. Fair value less costs of disposal may be determined based on expected sales proceeds or similar recent market transaction data.\n\nDetails of impairment charges and reversals recognized in the income statement are provided in Note 4 and details on the carrying amounts of assets are shown in Note 12, Note 14 and Note 15.\n\nThe estimates for assumptions made in impairment tests in 2020 relating to discount rates and oil and gas properties are discussed below. Changes in the economic environment or other facts and circumstances may necessitate revisions to these assumptions and could result in a material change to the carrying values of the group's assets within the next financial year.\n\n## Discount rates\n\nFor discounted cash flow calculations, future cash flows are adjusted for risks specific to the CGU. Value-in-use calculations are typically discounted using a pre-tax discount rate based upon the cost of funding the group derived from an established model, adjusted to a pre-tax basis and incorporating a market participant capital structure and country risk premiums. Fair value less costs of disposal discounted cash flow calculations use the post-tax discount rate.\n\nThe discount rates applied in impairment tests are reassessed each year and in 2020, the post-tax discount rate was 6%  (2019 6% ). Where the CGU is located in a country that was judged to be higher risk an additional premium of 1%  to 3%  was reflected in the post-tax discount rate (2019 1%  to 4% ). The judgement of classifying a country as higher risk and the applicable premium takes into account various economic and geopolitical factors. The pre-tax discount rate typically ranged from 7%  to 15%  (2019 7%  to 13% ) depending on the risk premium and applicable tax rate in the geographic location of the CGU.\n\n## Oil and natural gas properties\n\nFor Upstream oil and natural gas properties, expected future cash flows are estimated using management's best estimate of future oil and natural gas prices, and production and reserves volumes. The estimated future level of production in all impairment tests is based on assumptions about future commodity prices, production and development costs, field decline rates, current fiscal regimes and other factors.\n\nIn 2020, the group identified Upstream oil and gas properties with carrying amounts totalling $45,027 million (2019 $25,092 million) where the headroom, based on the most recent impairment test performed in the year on those assets, was less than or equal to 20%  of the carrying value. A change in the discount rate, reserves, resources or the oil and gas price assumptions in the next financial year may result in a recoverable amount of one or more of these assets above or below the current carrying amount and therefore there is a risk of impairment reversals or charges in that period. Management considers that reasonably possible changes in the discount rate or forecast revenue, arising from a change in oil and natural gas prices and/or production could result in a material change in their carrying amounts within the next financial year,see Sensitivity analyses, below.\n\nThe recoverability of intangible exploration and appraisal expenditure is covered under Oil and natural gas exploration, appraisal and development expenditure above.\n\n## Oil and natural gas prices\n\nThe price assumptions used for value in use impairment testing are based on those used for investment appraisal. The investment appraisal price assumptions are recommended by the senior vice president economic & energy insights after considering a range of external prices, and supply and demand forecasts under various energy transition scenarios. They are reviewed and approved by management. As a result of the current uncertainty over the pace of transition to lower-carbon supply and demand and the social, political and environmental actions that will be taken to meet the goals of the Paris climate change agreement, the forecasts and scenarios considered include those where those goals are met as well as those where they are not met.\n\nbp sees the prospect of an enduring impact on the global economy as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the potential for weaker demand for energy for a sustained period. bp's management also expects that the aftermath of the pandemic will accelerate the pace of transition to a lower carbon economy and energy system as countries seek to 'build back better' so that their economies will be more resilient in the future. As a result of all the above, bp revised its price assumptions for value-in-use impairment testing, lowering them compared to those used in 2019 and extending the period covered to 2050. These price assumptions are derived from the central case investment appraisal assumptions (see page 28). A summary of the group's revised price assumptions, in real 2020 terms, is provided below. The assumptions represent management's best estimate of future prices, which sit within the range of external forecasts considered as appropriate for the purpose. They are considered by bp to be broadly in line with a range of transition paths consistent with the Paris climate goals. However, they do not correspond to any specific Paris-consistent scenario. An inflation rate of 2%  (2019 2% ) is applied to determine the price assumptions in nominal terms.\n\n|                         |   2021 |   2025 |   2030 |   2040 |   2050 |\n|-------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Brent oil ($/bbl)       |     50 |     50 |     60 |     60 |  50    |\n| Henry Hub gas ($/mmBtu) |      3 |      3 |      3 |      3 |   2.75 |",

        "page_content": "## 1. Significant accounting policies, judgements, estimates and assumptions - continued\n\nMaterial impairment charges were recognized in 2020 following the downward revision of the price assumptions. See Note 4 for further information.\n\nThe long-term price assumptions used to determine recoverable amount based on value-in-use impairments tests in 2019 were $70 per barrel for Brent and $4 per mmBtu for Henry Hub gas, both in 2015 prices. These long-term prices were applied from 2025 and 2032 respectively inflated for the remaining life of the asset.\n\nThe price assumptions used in 2019 over the periods to 2025 and 2032 were set such that there was a linear progression from our best estimate of 2020 prices to the long-term assumptions.\n\nThe majority of bp's reserves and resources that support the carrying value of the group's existing oil and gas properties are expected to be produced over the next 10 years.\n\nOil prices fell 35% in 2020 from 2019 due to trade tensions, a macroeconomic downturn and a slowdown in oil demand, reflecting the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. OPEC+ production restraint, unplanned outages, and sanctions on Venezuela and Iran kept prices from falling further. bp's longterm assumption for oil prices is higher than the 2020 price average, based on the judgement that current price levels would not encourage sufficient investment to meet global oil demand sustainably in the longer term, especially given the financial requirements of key low-cost oil producing economies.\n\nUS gas prices dropped by around 20% in 2020 compared to 2019. Henry Hub gas prices were already low in early 2020 due to mild weather. The drop in demand from the second quarter onward as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as significant US LNG shut-ins contributed to prices remaining below $2/mmBtu during the second and third quarters, despite a record consumption in the power sector and the drop in natural gas production. Prices recovered in the fourth quarter due to the seasonal gas demand increase and the strong recovery in US LNG exports. bp's longterm price assumption for US gas reflects the fact that over the coming decades US gas production increases with an increasing proportion of production being used as feedstock to supply expanding LNG exports, while in the longer-term falling gas consumption and declining demand for global LNG exports leads to increasing competitive pressure on US gas production.\n\n## Oil and natural gas reserves\n\nIn addition to oil and natural gas prices, significant technical and commercial assessments are required to determine the group's estimated oil and natural gas reserves. Reserves estimates are regularly reviewed and updated. Factors such as the availability of geological and engineering data, reservoir performance data, acquisition and divestment activity and drilling of new wells all impact on the determination of the group's estimates of its oil and natural gas reserves. bp bases its reserves estimates on the requirement of reasonable certainty with rigorous technical and commercial assessments based on conventional industry practice and regulatory requirements.\n\nReserves assumptions for value-in-use tests reflect the reserves and resources that management currently intend to develop. The recoverable amount of oil and gas properties is determined using a combination of inputs including reserves, resources and production volumes. Risk factors may be applied to reserves and resources which do not meet the criteria to be treated as proved or probable.\n\n## Sensitivity analyses\n\nA change in revenue from Upstream oil and gas properties can arise either due to changes in oil and natural gas prices, changes in oil and natural gas production, or a combination of the two.\n\nManagement tested the impact of a change in revenue cash flows in value-in-use impairment testing arising from changes in price assumptions and/ or production volumes up to a combined effect on revenue of 10% in all future years.\n\nRevenue reductions of this magnitude in isolation could indicatively lead to a reduction in the carrying amount of bp's Upstream oil and gas properties in the range of $6-7 billion, which is approximately 5-6%  of the net book value of property, plant and equipment as at 31 December 2020.\n\nRevenue increases of this magnitude in isolation could indicatively lead to an increase in the carrying amount of bp's Upstream oil and gas properties in the range of $4-5 billion, which is approximately 3-4%  of the net book value of property, plant and equipment as at 31 December 2020. This potential increase in the carrying amount would arise due to reversals of previously recognized impairments.\n\nThese sensitivity analyses do not, however, represent management's best estimate of any impairment charges or reversals that might be recognized as they do not fully incorporate consequential changes that may arise, such as changes in costs and business plans and phasing of development. For example, costs across the industry are more likely to decrease as oil and natural gas prices fall. The above sensitivity analyses therefore do not reflect a linear relationship between revenue and value that can be extrapolated. The interdependency of these inputs and risk factors plus the diverse characteristics of our Upstream oil and gas properties limits the practicability of estimating the probability or extent to which the overall recoverable amount is impacted by changes to the price assumptions or production volumes.\n\nManagement also tested the impact of a one percentage point change in the discount rate used for value-in-use impairment testing of Upstream oil and gas properties. If the discount rate was one percentage point higher across all tests performed, the impairment charge recognized in 2020 would have been approximately $2.4 billion higher. If the discount rate was one percentage point lower, the impairment charge recognized would have been approximately $2.7 billion lower.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nIrrespective of whether there is any indication of impairment, bp is required to test annually for impairment of goodwill acquired in business combinations. The group carries goodwill of approximately $12.5 billion on its balance sheet (2019 $11.9 billion), principally relating to the Atlantic Richfield, Burmah Castrol, Devon Energy and Reliance transactions. Sensitivities and additional information relating to impairment testing of goodwill in the Upstream segment are provided in Note 14.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories, other than inventories held for short-term trading purposes, are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is determined by the first-in first-out method and comprises direct purchase costs, cost of production, transportation and manufacturing expenses. Net realizable value is determined by reference to prices existing at the balance sheet date, adjusted where the sale of inventories after the reporting period gives evidence about their net realizable value at the end of the period.\n\nInventories held for short-term trading purposes are stated at fair value less costs to sell and any changes in fair value are recognized in the income statement.\n\nSupplies are valued at the lower of cost on a weighted average basis and net realizable value.",

        "page_content": "## 1. Significant accounting policies, judgements, estimates and assumptions - continued\n\n## Leases\n\nAgreements that convey the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration are accounted for as leases. The right to control is conveyed if bp has both the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from, and the right to direct the use of, the identified asset throughout the period of use. An asset is identified if it is explicitly or implicitly specified by the agreement and any substitution rights held by the lessor over the asset are not considered substantive.\n\nAgreements that convey the right to control the use of an intangible asset including rights to explore for or use hydrocarbons are not accounted for as leases. See significant accounting policy: intangible assets.\n\nA lease liability is recognized on the balance sheet on the lease commencement date at the present value of future lease payments over the lease term. The discount rate applied is the rate implicit in the lease if readily determinable, otherwise an incremental borrowing rate is used. The incremental borrowing rate is determined based on factors such as the group's cost of borrowing, lessee legal entity credit risk, currency and lease term. The lease term is the non-cancellable period of a lease together with any periods covered by an extension option that bp is reasonably certain to exercise, or periods covered by a termination option that bp is reasonably certain not to exercise. The future lease payments included in the present value calculation are any fixed payments, payments that vary depending on an index or rate, payments due for the reasonably certain exercise of options and expected residual value guarantee payments. Repayments of principal are presented as financing cash flows and payments of interest are presented as operating cash flows.\n\nPayments that vary based on factors other than an index or a rate such as usage, sales volumes or revenues are not included in the present value calculation and are recognized in the income statement and presented as operating cash flows. The lease liability is recognized on an amortized cost basis with interest expense recognized in the income statement over the lease term, except for where capitalized as exploration, appraisal or development expenditure.\n\nThe right-of-use asset is recognized on the balance sheet as property, plant and equipment at a value equivalent to the initial measurement of the lease liability adjusted for lease prepayments, lease incentives, initial direct costs and any restoration obligations. The right-of-use asset is depreciated typically on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The depreciation charge is recognized in the income statement except for where capitalized as exploration, appraisal or development expenditure. Right-of-use assets are assessed for impairment in line with the accounting policy for impairment of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and goodwill.\n\nAgreements may include both lease and non-lease components. Payments for lease and non-lease components are allocated on a relative stand-alone selling price basis except for leases of retail service stations where the group has elected not to separate non-lease payments from the calculation of the lease liability and right-of-use asset.\n\nIf the lease term at commencement of the agreement is less than 12 months, a lease liability and right-of-use asset are not recognized, and a lease expense is recognized in the income statement on a straight-line basis.\n\nIf a significant event or change in circumstances, within the control of bp, arises that affects the reasonably certain lease term or there are changes to the lease payments, the present value of the lease liability is remeasured using the revised term and payments, with the right-of-use asset adjusted by an equivalent amount.\n\nModifications to a lease agreement beyond the original terms and conditions are accounted for as a re-measurement of the lease liability with a corresponding adjustment to the right-of-use asset. Any gain or loss on modification is recognized in the income statement. Modifications that increase the scope of the lease at a price commensurate with the stand-alone selling price are accounted for as a separate new lease.\n\nThe group recognizes the full lease liability, rather than its working interest share, for leases entered into on behalf of a joint operation if the group has the primary responsibility for making the lease payments. This may be the case if for example bp, as operator of the joint operation, is the sole signatory to the lease. In such cases, bp's working interest share of the right-of-use asset is recognized if it is jointly controlled by the group and the other joint operators, and a receivable is recognized for the share of the asset transferred to the other joint operators. If bp is a non-operator, a payable to the operator is recognized if they have the primary responsibility for making the lease payments and bp has joint control over the right-of-use asset, otherwise no balances are recognized.\n\n## Financial assets\n\nFinancial assets are recognized initially at fair value, normally being the transaction price. In the case of financial assets not measured at fair value through  profit  or  loss,  directly  attributable  transaction  costs  are  also  included.  The  subsequent  measurement  of  financial  assets  depends  on  their classification, as set out below. The group derecognizes financial assets when the contractual rights to the cash flows expire or the rights to receive cash flows have been transferred to a third party and either substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset have been transferred, or substantially all  the  risks  and  rewards  of  the  asset  have  neither  been  retained  nor  transferred  but  control  of  the  asset  has  been  transferred.  This  includes  the derecognition of receivables for which discounting arrangements are entered into.\n\nThe group classifies its financial asset debt instruments as measured at amortized cost, fair value through other comprehensive income or fair value through profit or loss. The classification depends on the business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset.\n\n## Financial assets measured at amortized cost\n\nFinancial assets are classified as measured at amortized cost when they are held in a business model the objective of which is to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest. Such assets are carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method if the time value of money is significant. Gains and losses are recognized in profit or loss when the assets are derecognized or impaired and when interest is recognized using the effective interest method. This category of financial assets includes trade and other receivables.\n\n## Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income\n\nFinancial assets are classified as measured at fair value through other comprehensive income when they are held in a business model the objective of which is both to collect contractual cash flows and sell the financial assets, and the contractual cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest.\n\n## Financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss\n\nFinancial assets are classified as measured at fair value through profit or loss when the asset does not meet the criteria to be measured at amortized cost or fair value through other comprehensive income. Such assets are carried on the balance sheet at fair value with gains or losses recognized in the income statement. Derivatives, other than those designated as effective hedging instruments, are included in this category.",

        "page_content": "## 1. Significant accounting policies, judgements, estimates and assumptions - continued\n\n## Investments in equity instruments\n\nInvestments in equity instruments are subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss unless an election is made on an instrument-byinstrument basis to recognise fair value gains and losses in other comprehensive income.\n\n## Derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge\n\nDerivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge are carried on the balance sheet at fair value. The treatment of gains and losses arising from revaluation is described below in the accounting policy for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities.\n\n## Cash equivalents\n\nCash equivalents are short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash, are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value and generally have a maturity of three months or less from the date of acquisition. Cash equivalents are classified as financial assets measured at amortized cost or, in the case of certain money market funds, fair value through profit or loss.\n\n## Impairment of financial assets measured at amortized cost\n\nThe group assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit losses associated with financial assets classified as measured at amortized cost at each balance sheet date. Expected credit losses are measured based on the maximum contractual period over which the group is exposed to credit risk. As lifetime expected credit losses are recognized for trade receivables and the tenor of substantially all other in-scope financial assets is less than 12 months there is no significant difference between the measurement of 12-month and lifetime expected credit losses for the group. The measurement of expected credit losses is a function of the probability of default, loss given default and exposure at default. The expected credit loss is estimated as the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the present value of the future cash flows the group expects to receive discounted at the financial asset's original effective interest rate. The carrying amount of the asset is adjusted, with the amount of the impairment gain or loss recognized in the income statement.\n\nA financial asset or group of financial assets classified as measured at amortized cost is considered to be credit-impaired if there is reasonable and supportable evidence that one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset (or group of financial assets) have occurred. Financial assets are written off where the group has no reasonable expectation of recovering amounts due.\n\n## Equity instruments\n\nInstruments are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangements. Instruments that cannot be settled in the group's own equity instruments and that include no contractual obligation to deliver cash or another financial asset or to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another entity that are potentially unfavourable are classified as equity. Equity instruments issued by the group are recognized at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.\n\n## Financial liabilities\n\nFinancial liabilities are recognized when the group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. The group derecognizes financial liabilities when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expired. The measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification, as follows:\n\n## Financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss\n\nFinancial liabilities that meet the definition of held for trading are classified as measured at fair value through profit or loss. Such liabilities are carried on the balance sheet at fair value with gains or losses recognized in the income statement. Derivatives, other than those designated as effective hedging instruments, are included in this category.\n\n## Derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge\n\nDerivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge are carried on the balance sheet at fair value. The treatment of gains and losses arising from revaluation is described below in the accounting policy for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities.\n\n## Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost\n\nAll other financial liabilities are initially recognized at fair value, net of directly attributable transaction costs. For interest-bearing loans and borrowings this is typically equivalent to the fair value of the proceeds received, net of issue costs associated with the borrowing.\n\nAfter initial recognition, other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any discount or premium on settlement. Gains and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or cancellation of liabilities are recognized in interest and other income and finance costs respectively.\n\nThis category of financial liabilities includes trade and other payables and finance debt.\n\n## Significant judgement: supplier financing arrangements\n\nThe group's trade payables include some supplier arrangements that utilize letter of credit facilities. Judgement is required to assesses the payables subject to these arrangements to determine whether they should continue to be classified as trade payables and give rise to operating cash flows or finance debt and financing cash flows. The criteria used in making this assessment include the payment terms for the amount due relative to terms commonly seen in the markets in which bp operates and whether the arrangements significantly change the nature of the liability. Liabilities subject to these arrangements with payment terms of up to approximately 60 days are generally considered to be trade payables and give rise to operating cash flows. See Note 29  - Liquidity risk for further information.\n\n## Financial guarantees\n\nThe group issues financial guarantee contracts to make specified payments to reimburse holders for losses incurred because certain associates, joint ventures or third-party entities fail to make payments when due in accordance with the original or modified terms of a debt instrument such as a loan. The liability for a financial guarantee contract is initially measured at fair value and subsequently measured at the higher of the contract's estimated expected credit loss and the amount initially recognized less, where appropriate, cumulative amortization.\n\n## Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities\n\nThe group uses derivative financial instruments to manage certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices, as well as for trading purposes. These derivative financial instruments are recognized initially at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and subsequently remeasured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.",

Significant accounting policies, judgements, estimates and assumptions - continued\n\nContracts to buy or sell a non-financial item (for example, oil, oil products, gas or power) that can be settled net in cash, with the exception of contracts that were entered into and continue to be held for the purpose of the receipt or delivery of a non-financial item in accordance with the group's expected purchase, sale or usage requirements, are accounted for as financial instruments. Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives that are not designated as effective hedging instruments are recognized in the income statement.\n\nIf, at inception of a contract, the valuation cannot be supported by observable market data, any gain or loss determined by the valuation methodology is not recognized in the income statement but is deferred on the balance sheet and is commonly known as a 'day-one gain or loss'. This deferred gain or loss is recognized in the income statement over the life of the contract until substantially all the remaining contract term can be valued using observable market data at which point any remaining deferred gain or loss is recognized in the income statement. Changes in valuation subsequent to the initial valuation at inception of a contract are recognized immediately in the income statement.\n\nFor the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as:\n\n- \u00b7 Fair value hedges when hedging exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability.\n- \u00b7 Cash flow hedges when hedging exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to either a particular risk associated with a recognized asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction.\n\nHedge relationships are formally designated and documented at inception, together with the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. The documentation includes identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged, the existence at inception of an economic relationship and subsequent measurement of the hedging instrument's effectiveness in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged item's fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk, the hedge ratio and sources of hedge ineffectiveness. Hedges meeting the criteria for hedge accounting are accounted for as follows:\n\n## Fair value hedges\n\nThe change in fair value of a hedging derivative is recognized in profit or loss. The change in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged is recorded as part of the carrying value of the hedged item and is also recognized in profit or loss, where it offsets. The group applies fair value hedge accounting when hedging interest rate risk and certain currency risks on fixed rate finance debt.\n\nFair value hedge accounting is discontinued only when the hedging relationship or a part thereof ceases to meet the qualifying criteria. This includes when the risk management objective changes or when the hedging instrument is sold, terminated or exercised. The accumulated adjustment to the carrying amount of a hedged item at such time is then amortized prospectively to profit or loss as finance interest expense over the hedged item's remaining period to maturity.\n\n## Cash flow hedges\n\nThe effective portion of the gain or loss on a cash flow hedging instrument is reported in other comprehensive income, while the ineffective portion is recognized in profit or loss. Amounts reported in other comprehensive income are reclassified to the income statement when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss.\n\nWhere the hedged item is a highly probably forecast transaction that results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, such as a forecast foreign currency transaction for the purchase of property, plant and equipment, the amounts recognized within other comprehensive income are transferred to the initial carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability. Where the hedged item is an equity investment, the amounts recognized in other comprehensive income remain in the separate component of equity until the hedged cash flows affect profit or loss. Where the hedged item is recognized directly in profit or loss, the amounts recognized in other comprehensive income are reclassified to production and manufacturing expenses or sales and other operating revenues as appropriate.\n\nCash flow hedge accounting is discontinued only when the hedging relationship or a part thereof ceases to meet the qualifying criteria. This includes when the designated hedged forecast transaction or part thereof is no longer considered to be highly probable to occur, or when the hedging instrument is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover. When cash flow hedge accounting is discontinued amounts previously recognized within other comprehensive income remain in equity until the forecast transaction occurs and are reclassified to profit or loss or transferred to the initial carrying amount of a non-financial asset or liability as above. If the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, amounts previously recognized within other comprehensive income will be immediately reclassified to profit or loss.\n\n## Costs of hedging\n\nThe foreign currency basis spread of cross-currency interest rate swaps are excluded from hedge designations and accounted for as costs of hedging. Changes in fair value of the foreign currency basis spread are recognized in other comprehensive income to the extent that they relate to the hedged item. For time-period related hedged items, the amount recognized in other comprehensive income is amortized to profit or loss on a straight line basis over the term of the hedging relationship.\n\n## Fair value measurement\n\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. The group categorizes assets and liabilities measured at fair value into one of three levels depending on the ability to observe inputs employed in their measurement. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, other than quoted prices included within level 1 for the asset or liability. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability reflecting significant modifications to observable related market data or bp's assumptions about pricing by market participants.",

Significant accounting policies, judgements, estimates and assumptions - continued\n\n## Significant estimate and judgement: derivative financial instruments\n\nIn some cases the fair values of derivatives are estimated using internal models due to the absence of quoted prices or other observable, marketcorroborated data. This primarily applies to the group's longer-term derivative contracts. The majority of these contracts are valued using models with inputs that include price curves for each of the different products that are built up from available active market pricing data (including volatility and correlation) and modelled using the maximum available external information. Additionally, where limited data exists for certain products, prices are determined using historical and long-term pricing relationships. The use of alternative assumptions or valuation methodologies may result in significantly different values for these derivatives. A reasonably possible change in the price assumptions used in the models relating to index price would not have a material impact on net assets and the Group income statement primarily as a result of offsetting movements between derivative assets and liabilities. For more information, including the carrying amounts of level 3 derivatives, see Note 30.\n\nIn some cases, judgement is required to determine whether contracts to buy or sell commodities meet the definition of a derivative or to determine appropriate presentation and classification of transactions in certain cases. In particular contracts to buy and sell LNG are not considered to meet the definition as they are not considered capable of being net settled due to a lack of liquidity in the LNG market and the inability or lack of history of net settlement and so are accounted for on an accruals basis, rather than as a derivative.\n\n## Offsetting of financial assets and liabilities\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are presented gross in the balance sheet unless both of the following criteria are met: the group currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognized amounts; and the group intends to either settle on a net basis or realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. A right of set off is the group's legal right to settle an amount payable to a creditor by applying against it an amount receivable from the same counterparty. The relevant legal jurisdiction and laws applicable to the relationships between the parties are considered when assessing whether a current legally enforceable right to set off exists.\n\n## Provisions and contingencies\n\nProvisions are recognized when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Where appropriate, the future cash flow estimates are adjusted to reflect risks specific to the liability.\n\nIf the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax risk-free rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money. Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognized within finance costs. Provisions are discounted using a nominal discount rate of 2.5%  (2019 2.5% ).\n\nProvisions are split between amounts expected to be settled within 12 months of the balance sheet date (current) and amounts expected to be settled later (non-current).\n\nContingent liabilities are possible obligations whose existence will only be confirmed by future events not wholly within the control of the group, or present obligations where it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be required or the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability. Contingent liabilities are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements but are disclosed unless the possibility of an outflow of economic resources is considered remote.\n\n## Decommissioning\n\nLiabilities for decommissioning costs are recognized when the group has an obligation to plug and abandon a well, dismantle and remove a facility or an item of plant and to restore the site on which it is located, and when a reliable estimate of that liability can be made. Where an obligation exists for a new facility or item of plant, such as oil and natural gas production or transportation facilities, this liability will be recognized on construction or installation. Similarly, where an obligation exists for a well, this liability is recognized when it is drilled. An obligation for decommissioning may also crystallize during the period of operation of a well, facility or item of plant through a change in legislation or through a decision to terminate operations; an obligation may also arise in cases where an asset has been sold but the subsequent owner is no longer able to fulfil its decommissioning obligations, for example due to bankruptcy. The amount recognized is the present value of the estimated future expenditure determined in accordance with local conditions and requirements. The provision for the costs of decommissioning wells, production facilities and pipelines at the end of their economic lives is estimated using existing technology, at future prices, depending on the expected timing of the activity, and discounted using the nominal discount rate.\n\nAn amount equivalent to the decommissioning provision is recognized as part of the corresponding intangible asset (in the case of an exploration or appraisal well) or property, plant and equipment. The decommissioning portion of the property, plant and equipment is subsequently depreciated at the same rate as the rest of the asset. Other than the unwinding of discount on or utilisation of the provision, any change in the present value of the estimated expenditure is reflected as an adjustment to the provision and the corresponding asset where that asset is generating or is expected to generate future economic benefits.\n\n## Environmental expenditures and liabilities\n\nEnvironmental expenditures that are required in order for the group to obtain future economic benefits from its assets are capitalized as part of those assets. Expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations that do not contribute to future earnings are expensed.\n\nLiabilities for environmental costs are recognized when a clean-up is probable and the associated costs can be reliably estimated. Generally, the timing of recognition of these provisions coincides with the commitment to a formal plan of action or, if earlier, on divestment or on closure of inactive sites.\n\nThe amount recognized is the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation. Provisions for environmental liabilities have been estimated using existing technology, at future prices and discounted using a nominal discount rate.\n\n## Emissions\n\nLiabilities for emissions are recognized when the cumulative volumes of gases emitted by the group at the end of the reporting period exceed the allowances granted free of charge held for own use or a set baseline for emissions. The provision is measured at the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date.  It is based on the excess of actual emissions over the free allowances held or set baseline in tonnes (or other appropriate quantity) and is valued at the actual cost of any allowances that have been purchased and held for own use on a first-in-first-out (FIFO) basis, and, if insufficient allowances are held, for the remaining requirement on the basis of the spot market price of allowances at the balance sheet date.  The cost of allowances purchased to cover a shortfall is recognized separately on the balance sheet as an intangible asset unless the emission allowances acquired or generated by the group are risk-managed by the integrated supply and trading function, then they are recognized on the balance sheet as inventory.",

        "page_content": "## 1. Significant accounting policies, judgements, estimates and assumptions - continued\n\n## Restructuring provisions\n\nThe reinvent bp programme, expected to reduce headcount by around 10,000 positions, has resulted in recognition of provisions where a detailed formal plan exists, and a valid expectation of risk of redundancy has been made to those affected but where the specific outcomes remain uncertain . Where formal redundancy offers have been made, the obligations for those amounts are reported as payables and, if not, as provisions if unpaid at the year-end.\n\n## Significant judgements and estimates: provisions\n\nThe group holds provisions for the future decommissioning of oil and natural gas production facilities and pipelines at the end of their economic lives. The largest decommissioning obligations facing bp relate to the plugging and abandonment of wells and the removal and disposal of oil and natural gas platforms and pipelines around the world. Most of these decommissioning events are many years in the future and the precise requirements that will have to be met when the removal event occurs are uncertain. Decommissioning technologies and costs are constantly changing, as are political, environmental, safety and public expectations. The timing and amounts of future cash flows are subject to significant uncertainty and estimation is required in determining the amounts of provisions to be recognized. Any changes in the expected future costs are reflected in both the provision and the asset.\n\nIf oil and natural gas production facilities and pipelines are sold to third parties, judgement is required to assess whether the new owner will be unable to meet their decommissioning obligations, whether bp would then be responsible for decommissioning, and if so the extent of that responsibility. The group has assessed that no material decommissioning provisions should be recognized as at 31 December 2020 (2019 no material provisions) for assets sold to third parties where the sale transferred the decommissioning obligation to the new owner.\n\nDecommissioning provisions associated with downstream refineries are generally not recognized, as the potential obligations cannot be measured, given their indeterminate settlement dates.Obligations may arise if refineries cease manufacturing operations and any such obligations would be recognized in the period when sufficient information becomes available to determine potential settlement dates.\n\nThe group performs periodic reviews of its downstream refineries for any changes in facts and circumstances including those relating to the energy transition, that might require the recognition of a decommissioning provision.\n\nThe provision for environmental liabilities is estimated based on current legal and constructive requirements, technology, price levels and expected plans for remediation. Actual costs and cash outflows can differ from current estimates because of changes in laws and regulations, public expectations, prices, discovery and analysis of site conditions and changes in clean-up technology.\n\nThe timing and amount of future expenditures relating to decommissioning and environmental liabilities are reviewed annually. The interest rate used in discounting the cash flows is reviewed quarterly. The nominal interest rate used to determine the balance sheet obligations at the end of 2020 was 2.5%  (2019 2.5% ), which was based on long-dated US government bonds. The weighted average period over which decommissioning and environmental costs are generally expected to be incurred is estimated to be approximately 18 years (2019 18 years) and 6 years (2019 6 years) respectively. Costs at future prices are determined by applying an inflation rate of 1.5%  (2019 1.5% ) to decommissioning costs and 2%  (2019 2% ) for all other provisions. A lower rate is applied to decommissioning as certain costs are expected to remain fixed at current or past prices.\n\nFurther information about the group's provisions is provided in Note 23. Changes in assumptions in relation to the group's provisions could result in a material change in their carrying amounts within the next financial year. A 0.5 percentage point decrease in the nominal discount rate applied could increase the group's provision balances by approximately $1.3 billion (2019 $1.4 billion). The pre-tax impact on the group income statement would be a charge of approximately $0.5 billion.\n\nThe discounting impact on the group's Upstream decommissioning provisions of a two-year change in the timing of expected future decommissioning expenditures would not be material. Management currently does not consider a change of greater than two years to be reasonably possible in the next financial year.\n\nIf all expected future decommissioning expenditures were 10% higher, the group's Upstream decommissioning provisions would increase by approximately $1.4 billion and a pre-tax charge of approximately $0.5 billion would be recognized.\n\nAs described in Note 33, the group is subject to claims and actions for which no provisions have been recognized. The facts and circumstances relating to particular cases are evaluated regularly in determining whether a provision relating to a specific litigation should be recognized or revised. Accordingly, significant management judgement relating to provisions and contingent liabilities is required, since the outcome of litigation is difficult to predict.\n\n## Employee benefits\n\nWages, salaries, bonuses, social security contributions, paid annual leave and sick leave are accrued in the period in which the associated services are rendered by employees of the group. Deferred bonus arrangements that have a vesting date more than 12 months after the balance sheet date are valued on an actuarial basis using the projected unit credit method and amortized on a straight-line basis over the service period until the award vests. The accounting policies for share-based payments and for pensions and other post-retirement benefits are described below.\n\n## Share-based payments\n\n## Equity-settled transactions\n\nThe cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments on the date on which they are granted and is recognized as an expense over the vesting period, which ends on the date on which the employees become fully entitled to the award. A corresponding credit is recognized within equity. Fair value is determined by using an appropriate, widely used, valuation model. In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any vesting conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of the company (market conditions). Non-vesting conditions, such as the condition that employees contribute to a savings-related plan, are taken into account in the grant-date fair value, and failure to meet a non-vesting condition, where this is within the control of the employee is treated as a cancellation and any remaining unrecognized cost is expensed.\n\nFor other equity-settled share-based payment transactions, the goods or services received and the corresponding increase in equity are measured at the fair value of the goods or services received unless their fair value cannot be reliably estimated. If the fair value of the goods and services received cannot be reliably estimated, the transaction is measured by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted.",

        "page_content": "## 1. Significant accounting policies, judgements, estimates and assumptions - continued\n\n## Cash-settled transactions\n\nThe cost of cash-settled transactions is recognized as an expense over the vesting period, measured by reference to the fair value of the corresponding liability which is recognized on the balance sheet. The liability is remeasured at fair value at each balance sheet date until settlement, with changes in fair value recognized in the income statement.\n\n## Pensions and other post-retirement benefits\n\nThe cost of providing benefits under the group's defined benefit plans is determined separately for each plan using the projected unit credit method, which attributes entitlement to benefits to the current period to determine current service cost and to the current and prior periods to determine the present value of the defined benefit obligation. Past service costs, resulting from either a plan amendment or a curtailment (a reduction in future obligations as a result of a material reduction in the plan membership), are recognized immediately when the company becomes committed to a change.\n\nNet interest expense relating to pensions and other post-retirement benefits, which is recognized in the income statement, represents the net change in present value of plan obligations and the value of plan assets resulting from the passage of time, and is determined by applying the discount rate to the present value of the benefit obligation at the start of the year, and to the fair value of plan assets at the start of the year, taking into account expected changes in the obligation or plan assets during the year.\n\nRemeasurements of the defined benefit liability and asset, comprising actuarial gains and losses, and the return on plan assets (excluding amounts included in net interest described above) are recognized within other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur and are not subsequently reclassified to profit and loss.\n\nThe defined benefit pension plan surplus or deficit recognized on the balance sheet for each plan comprises the difference between the present value of the defined benefit obligation (using a discount rate based on high quality corporate bonds) and the fair value of plan assets out of which the obligations are to be settled directly. Fair value is based on market price information and, in the case of quoted securities, is the published bid price. Defined benefit pension plan surpluses are only recognized to the extent they are recoverable, either by way of a refund from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.\n\nContributions to defined contribution plans are recognized in the income statement in the period in which they become payable.\n\n## Significant estimate: pensions and other post-retirement benefits\n\nAccounting for defined benefit pensions and other post-retirement benefits involves making significant estimates when measuring the group's pension plan surpluses and deficits. These estimates require assumptions to be made about many uncertainties.\n\nPensions and other post-retirement benefit assumptions are reviewed by management at the end of each year. These assumptions are used to determine the projected benefit obligation at the year end and hence the surpluses and deficits recorded on the group's balance sheet, and pension and other post-retirement benefit expense for the following year.\n\nThe assumptions that are the most significant to the amounts reported are the discount rate, inflation rate, salary growth and mortality levels. Assumptions about these variables are based on the environment in each country. The assumptions used vary from year to year, with resultant effects on future net income and net assets. Changes to some of these assumptions, in particular the discount rate and inflation rate, could result in material changes to the carrying amounts of the group's pension and other post-retirement benefit obligations within the next financial year, in particular for the UK, US and Eurozone plans. Any differences between these assumptions and the actual outcome will also affect future net income and net assets.\n\nThe values ascribed to these assumptions and a sensitivity analysis of the impact of changes in the assumptions on the benefit expense and obligation used are provided in Note 24.\n\n## Income taxes\n\nIncome tax expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax.\n\nIncome tax is recognized in the income statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case the related tax is recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.\n\nCurrent tax is based on the taxable profit for the period. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it is determined in accordance with the rules established by the applicable taxation authorities. It therefore excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other periods as well as items that are never taxable or deductible. The group's liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.\n\nDeferred tax is provided, using the liability method, on temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes. Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences except:\n\n- \u00b7 Where the deferred tax liability arises on the initial recognition of goodwill.\n- \u00b7 Where the deferred tax liability arises on the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.\n- \u00b7 In respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and associates and interests in joint arrangements, where the group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences, carry-forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and the carry-forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilized, except where the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss. In respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and associates and interests in joint arrangements, deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilized.\n\nThe carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable or increased to the extent that it is probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilized.",

        "page_content": "## 1. Significant accounting policies, judgements, estimates and assumptions - continued\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis or to realize the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.\n\nWhere tax treatments are uncertain, if it is considered probable that a taxation authority will accept the group's proposed tax treatment, income taxes are recognized consistent with the group's income tax filings. If it is not considered probable, the uncertainty is reflected within the carrying amount of the applicable tax asset or liability using either the most likely amount or an expected value, depending on which method better predicts the resolution of the uncertainty.\n\nThe computation of the group's income tax expense and liability involves the interpretation of applicable tax laws and regulations in many jurisdictions throughout the world. The resolution of tax positions taken by the group, through negotiations with relevant tax authorities or through litigation, can take several years to complete and in some cases it is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome. Therefore, judgement is required to determine whether provisions for income taxes are required and, if so, estimation is required of the amounts that could be payable.\n\nIn addition, the group has carry-forward tax losses and tax credits in certain taxing jurisdictions that are available to offset against future taxable profit. However, deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the unused tax losses or tax credits can be utilized. Management judgement is exercised in assessing whether this is the case and estimates are required to be made of the amount of future taxable profits that will be available.Such judgements are inherently impacted by estimates affecting future taxable profits such as oil and natural gas prices and decommissioning expenditure, see significant judgements and estimates: recoverability of asset carrying values and provisions\n\nManagement do not assess there to be a significant risk of a material change to the group's tax provisioning or recognition of deferred tax assets within the next financial year, however the tax position remains inherently uncertain and therefore subject to change. To the extent that actual outcomes differ from management's estimates, income tax charges or credits, and changes in current and deferred tax assets or liabilities, may arise in future periods. For more information see Note 9 and Note 33.\n\nJudgement is also required when determining whether a particular tax is an income tax or another type of tax (for example a production tax). Accounting for deferred tax is applied to income taxes as described above, but is not applied to other types of taxes; rather such taxes are recognized in the income statement in accordance with the applicable accounting policy such as Provisions and contingencies. No new significant judgements were made in 2020 in this regard.\n\n## Customs duties and sales taxes\n\nCustoms duties and sales taxes that are passed on or charged to customers are excluded from revenues and expenses. Assets and liabilities are recognized net of the amount of customs duties or sales tax except:\n\n- \u00b7 Customs duties or sales taxes incurred on the purchase of goods and services which are not recoverable from the taxation authority are recognized as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset.\n- \u00b7 Receivables and payables are stated with the amount of customs duty or sales tax included.\n\nThe net amount of sales tax recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included within receivables or payables in the balance sheet.\n\n## Own equity instruments - treasury shares\n\nThe group's holdings in its own equity instruments are shown as deductions from shareholders' equity. Treasury shares represent bp shares repurchased and available for specific and limited purposes. For accounting purposes, shares held in Employee Share Ownership Plans (ESOPs) to meet the future requirements of the employee share-based payment plans are treated in the same manner as treasury shares and are, therefore, included in the consolidated financial statements as treasury shares. The cost of treasury shares subsequently sold or reissued is calculated on a weighted-average basis. Consideration, if any, received for the sale of such shares is also recognized in equity. No gain or loss is recognized in the income statement on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of equity shares. Shares repurchased under the share buy-back programme which are immediately cancelled are not shown as treasury shares, but are shown as a deduction from the profit and loss account reserve in the group statement of changes in equity.\n\n## Revenue and other income\n\nRevenue from contracts with customers is recognized when or as the group satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control of a promised good or service to a customer. The transfer of control of oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids, LNG, petroleum and chemical products, and other items usually coincides with title passing to the customer and the customer taking physical possession. The group principally satisfies its performance obligations at a point in time; the amounts of revenue recognized relating to performance obligations satisfied over time are not significant.\n\nWhen, or as, a performance obligation is satisfied, the group recognizes as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to that performance obligation. The transaction price is the amount of consideration to which the group expects to be entitled. The transaction price is allocated to the performance obligations in the contract based on standalone selling prices of the goods or services promised.\n\nContracts for the sale of commodities are typically priced by reference to quoted prices. Revenue from term commodity contracts is recognized based on the contractual pricing provisions for each delivery. Certain of these contracts have pricing terms based on prices at a point in time after delivery has been made. Revenue from such contracts is initially recognized based on relevant prices at the time of delivery and subsequently adjusted as appropriate.  All revenue from these contracts, both that recognized at the time of delivery and that from post-delivery price adjustments, is disclosed as revenue from contracts with customers.\n\nCertain forward contracts entered into by the group that result in physical delivery of products such as crude oil, natural gas and refined products are required to be accounted for as derivative financial instruments. Revenue recognized relating to such contracts when physical delivery occurs is measured at the contractual transaction price plus the carrying amount of the related derivative at the date of settlement and presented as other operating revenues. Changes in the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities prior to physical delivery are also classified as other operating revenues.

All other finance costs are recognized in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.\n\n## Updates to significant accounting policies\n\n## Impact of new International Financial Reporting Standards\n\nbp adopted 'Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase I - Amendments to IFRS 9 'Financial instruments' and IFRS 7 'Financial instruments: Disclosures'' with effect from 1 January 2020 . There are no other new or amended standards or interpretations adopted during the year that have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## 'Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase I'\n\nFinancial authorities in the US, UK, EU and other territories are currently undertaking reviews of key interest rate benchmarks such as the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) with a view to replacing them with alternative benchmarks. Uncertainty around the method and timing of transition from Inter-bank Offered Rates (IBORs) to alternative risk-free rates (RfRs) may impact the assessment of whether hedge accounting can be applied to certain hedging relationships.\n\nThis first phase of amendments to IFRS 9 provide temporary relief from applying specific hedge accounting requirements to hedging relationships directly affected by interest rate benchmark reforms.\n\nIn accordance with the transition provisions, the amendments have been adopted retrospectively to hedging relationships that existed at the start of the current reporting period and have been applied to new hedging relationships designated after that date.\n\nThe reliefs have meant that the uncertainty over the interest rate benchmark reforms has not resulted in discontinuation of hedge accounting for any of bp's fair value hedges.\n\nSee Note 29 Financial instruments and financial risk factors - interest rate risk and Note 30 Derivative financial instruments - Fair value hedges for further information.\n\n## Impact of new International Financial Reporting Standards - Not yet adopted\n\nThe following pronouncements from the IASB have not been adopted by the group in these financial statements as they will only become effective for future financial reporting periods. There are no other standards, amendments or interpretations in issue but not yet adopted that the directors anticipate will have a material effect on the reported income or net assets of the group.\n\n## IFRS 17 ' Insurance Contracts'\n\nIFRS 17 'Insurance Contracts' provides a new general model for accounting for contracts where the issuer accepts significant insurance risk from another party and agrees to compensate that party if a future uncertain event adversely affects them. IFRS 17 replaces IFRS 4 'Insurance Contracts' and will be effective for bp for the financial reporting period commencing 1 January 2023. The standard has not yet been endorsed by the UK and the EU. bp's assessment of the impact of IFRS 17 is at an initial stage but it is not expected to have a significant effect on future financial reporting.\n\n## 'Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase II'\n\nAmendments to IFRS 9, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 'Leases' were issued by the IASB in August 2020 to provide practical expedients and reliefs in relation to modifications of financial instruments and leases that arise from transition from IBORs to RFRs. Phase II also provides further reliefs to hedge accounting requirements. These amendments were effective for bp from 1 January 2021. The amendments have been endorsed by the UK and by the EU.\n\nbp's working group on interest rate benchmark reform is monitoring and managing the transition to alternative benchmark rates and is currently assessing the impact on contracts and arrangements that are linked to existing interest rate benchmarks for example, borrowings, leases and derivative contracts. bp is also participating on external committees and task forces dedicated to interest rate benchmark reform.\n\n## Other changes to significant accounting policies\n\n## Physically settled derivative contracts\n\nIn March 2019, IFRIC issued an agenda decision on the application of IFRS 9 to the physical settlement of contracts to buy or sell a non-financial item, such as commodities, that are not accounted for as 'own-use' contracts. IFRIC concluded that such contracts are settled by the delivery or receipt of a non-financial item in exchange for both cash and the settlement of the derivative asset or liability.\n\nbp routinely enters into transactions for the sale and purchase of commodities that are physically settled and meet the definition of a derivative financial instrument. As described in the group's accounting policy for revenue in bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2019, revenue recognized at the time such contracts were physically settled was measured at the contractual transaction price and was presented together with revenue from contracts with customers in those financial statements.",

Realized derivative gains and losses on physically settled derivative contracts are included in other revenues.\n- \u00b7 There is no significant effect on current period or comparative information for 'Sales and other operating revenues' and 'Purchases' as presented in the group income statement, therefore no comparative information has been re-stated.\n- \u00b7 There is no significant effect on net assets or on comparative information for 'Profit before taxation' or 'Profit after taxation' as presented in the group income statement.\n\nIn addition, bp chose to change its presentation of revenues from physically settled derivative sales contracts from 1 January 2020. Revenues from physically settled derivative sales contracts are no longer presented together with revenue from contracts with customers. In these financial statements they are now presented as other revenues. Comparative information in Note 6 for revenue from contracts with customers and other revenues have been re-presented to align with the current period as set out below.\n\n|                                                                   | $ million                    | $ million                          | $ million                   | $ million                    | $ million                          | $ million                   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n|                                                                   | 2019  (previously  reported) | 2019 (re- presented -  see note 6) | Presentational  adjustments | 2018  (previously  reported) | 2018 (re- presented -  see note 6) | Presentational  adjustments |\n| Crude oil                                                         | 62,130                       | 9,141                              | 52,989                      | 65,276                       | 10,331                             | 54,945                      |\n| Oil products                                                      | 180,528                      | 102,408                            | 78,120                      | 195,466                      | 108,515                            | 86,951                      |\n| Natural gas, LNG and NGLs                                         | 20,167                       | 18,909                             | 1,258                       | 21,745                       | 20,494                             | 1,251                       |\n| Non-oil products and other revenues from contracts with customers | 13,254                       | 12,169                             | 1,085                       | 13,768                       | 12,489                             | 1,279                       |\n| Revenue from contracts with customers                             | 276,079                      | 142,627                            | 133,452                     | 296,255                      | 151,829                            | 144,426                     |\n| Other operating revenues                                          | 2,318                        | 135,770                            | (133,452)                   | 2,501                        | 146,927                            | (144,426)                   |\n| Total sales and other operating revenues                          | 278,397                      | 278,397                            | -                           | 298,756                      | 298,756                            | -                           |\n\n## Voluntary changes to significant accounting policies - not yet adopted\n\nNet presentation of revenues and purchases relating to physically settled derivative contracts from 1 January 2021\n\nAs described above, bp routinely enters into transactions for the sale and purchase of commodities that are physically settled and meet the definition of a derivative financial instrument. These contracts are within the scope of IFRS 9 and as such, prior to settlement, changes in the fair value of these derivative contracts are presented as gains and losses within other operating revenues. The group currently presents revenues and purchases for such contracts on a gross basis in the group income statement upon physical settlement. These transactions have historically represented a substantial portion of the revenues and purchases reported in the group's consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe change in strategic direction of the group supported by organisational changes to implement the strategy from 1 January 2021, results in the group determining  that the revenue and corresponding purchases relating to such transactions should be presented net as gains or losses within other operating revenues. Additionally the group's trading activity has continued to evolve over time from one of capturing third party physical trades to provide flow assurance to one with increasing levels of optimisation, taking advantage of price volatility and fluctuations in demand and supply, which will continue under the new strategy, further supporting the change in presentation.  The new presentation provides reliable and more relevant information for users of the accounts as the group's revenue recognition will be more closely aligned with its assessment of 'Scope 3' emissions from its products, its 'Net Zero' ambition and how management monitors and manages performance of such contracts. Comparative information for Sales and other operating revenues and purchases for 2019 and 2020 will be restated and will be presented under the new policy alongside group's 2021 financial information.\n\n## Change in segmentation\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2021, the group's reportable segments changed consistent with a change in the way that resources are allocated and performance is assessed by the chief operating decision maker, who for bp is the group chief executive, from that date. From the first quarter of 2021, the group's reportable are gas & low carbon energy, oil production & operations, customers & products, and Rosneft. At 31 December 2020, the group's reportable segments were Upstream, Downstream and Rosneft.\n\nGas & low carbon energy comprises regions with upstream businesses that predominantly produce natural gas, gas trading activities and the group's renewables businesses, including biofuels, solar and wind. Gas producing regions were previously in the Upstream segment. The group's renewables businesses were previously part of 'Other businesses and corporate'.\n\nOil production & operations comprises regions with upstream activities that predominantly produce crude oil. These activities were previously in the Upstream segment.\n\nCustomers & products comprises the group's convenience and mobility business, which manages the sale of fuels to wholesale and retail customers, convenience products, aviation fuels, and Castrol lubricants; and refining, supply and trading. The petrochemicals business will also be reported in restated comparative information as part of the customers and products segment up to its sale in December 2020. The customers & products segment is, therefore, substantially unchanged from the former Downstream segment with the exception of the Petrochemicals disposal.\n\nThe Rosneft segment is unchanged and continues to include equity-accounted earnings from the group's investment in Rosneft.\n\nThe segment measure of profit or loss continues to be replacement cost profit or loss before interest and tax, which reflects the replacement cost of supplies by excluding from profit or loss before interest and tax inventory holding gains and losses. See Note 5 for further information.\n\nIn the group's financial reporting for 2021, comparative information for 2019 and 2020 will be restated to reflect the changes in reportable segments. Reporting under the new segment structure will begin with the first quarter 2021 interim financial statements.\n\nSegmental information presented in these financial statements is based on the segment structure as at 31 December 2020.",

Non-current assets held for sale\n\nThe carrying amount of assets classified as held for sale at 31 December 2020 is $1,326 million (2019 $7,465 million), with associated liabilities of $46 million (2019 $1,393 million).\n\n## Upstream segment\n\nThe balance consists primarily of a 20%  participating interest from bp's 60%  participating interest in Block 61 in Oman. As announced on 1 February 2021, bp has agreed to sell this interest to PTT Exploration and Production Public Company Limited of Thailand for a total consideration of up to $2.6 billion, subject to final adjustments. Under the terms of the agreement, bp will receive $2,450 million on completion, with up to an additional $140 million receivable contingent on pre-agreed future conditions. Subject to approvals, the transaction is expected to complete during 2021. Assets of $1,298 million and associated liabilities of $10 million have been classified as held for sale in the group balance sheet at 31 December 2020.\n\nTransactions that have been classified as held for sale during 2020, but were completed by 31 December 2020, are described below.\n\n## Downstream segment\n\nOn 29 June 2020 bp announced that it had agreed to sell its global petrochemicals business to INEOS for a total consideration of $5 billion, subject to customary closing adjustments. The assets and liabilities of the business were classified as held for sale from that date until the disposal completed on 31 December 2020. Under the terms of the agreement, INEOS paid bp a deposit of $400 million and a further $3.6 billion on completion less $0.1 billion of third-party indebtedness remaining in petrochemicals on completion. The remaining $1 billion was received in February 2021. The business had interests in manufacturing plants in Asia, Europe and the US, including interests held in equity-accounted entities. See note 4 for further information.\n\n## Upstream segment\n\nOn 27 August 2019, bp announced that it had agreed to sell its Alaska operations and interests to Hilcorp Energy for up to $5.6 billion, subject to customary closing adjustments. The sale included bp's upstream and midstream business in the state, including BP Exploration (Alaska) Inc., which owned all of bp's upstream oil and gas interests in Alaska, and BP Pipelines (Alaska) Inc.'s 49%  interest in the Trans Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS). These assets and associated liabilities were classified as held for sale in the 31 December 2019 group balance sheet. The disposal of BP Exploration (Alaska) Inc. completed on 30 June 2020. The disposal of TAPS completed on 18 December 2020.\n\nbp received $800 million prior to or on completion of the disposals and has recognized a loan note with a principal amount of $2,100 million receivable from Hilcorp. The group has also recognized other assets totalling $1,722 million as at 31 December 2020, principally in relation to the 'earn-out' provisions of the agreement. See note 4 for information on impairment charges relating to the Alaska business.\n\nbp retained decommissioning liability relating to the TAPS, which will be partially offset by a 30%  cost reimbursement from Hilcorp when incurred.\n\nIn November 2019, bp agreed to sell its interests in the San Juan basin in Colorado and New Mexico to IKAV. These assets and associated liabilities were classified as held for sale in the 31 December 2019 group balance sheet. The transaction completed on 28 February 2020.\n\nThe total assets and liabilities held for sale at 31 December 2020 and 2019, which are all in the Upstream segment, are set out in the table below.\n\n|                                                                              | $ million   | $ million   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n|                                                                              | 2020        | 2019        |\n| Property, plant and equipment                                                | 1,099       | 6,359       |\n| Goodwill                                                                     | 199         | -           |\n| Intangible assets                                                            | -           | 610         |\n| Investments in associates                                                    | -           | 43          |\n| Inventories                                                                  | -           | 318         |\n| Trade and other receivables                                                  | 28          | 135         |\n| Assets classified as held for sale                                           | 1,326       | 7,465       |\n| Trade and other payables                                                     | (36)        | (33)        |\n| Lease liabilities                                                            | -           | (280)       |\n| Provisions                                                                   | (10)        | (1,012)     |\n| Defined benefit pension plan and other post-retirement benefit plan deficits | -           | (68)        |\n| Liabilities directly associated with assets classified as held for sale      | (46)        | (1,393)     |\n\n## 3. Business combinations and other significant transactions\n\n## Business combinations\n\n## 2020\n\nThe group undertook a number of business combinations during 2020. The fair value of the net assets (including goodwill) and non-controlling interests recognized were $617 million and $574 million, respectively. These principally related to an acquisition in our US Fuels business.\n\n## 2019\n\nAs agreed as part of the original transaction, $3,480 million was paid in 2019 in respect of the 2018 acquisition of Petrohawk Energy Corporation from BHP Billiton. A number of other individually insignificant business combinations were also undertaken by bp in 2019.",

At 31 December 2020, deferred consideration relating to disposals amounted to $1,291 million receivable within one year (2019 $159 million and 2018 $35 million) and $2,402 million receivable after one year (2019 $125 million and 2018 $304 million). The deferred consideration principally relates to the disposals of our Petrochemical and Alaskan businesses. In addition, contingent consideration receivable relating to disposals amounted to $1,999 million at 31 December 2020 (2019 $598 million and 2018 $893 million).The contingent consideration at 31 December 2020 relates to the disposal of our Alaskan business and prior period disposals in the North Sea. These amounts of contingent consideration are reported within Other investments on the group balance sheet  - see Note 18 for further information.\n\n## Gains and losses on sale of businesses and fixed assets, and closures\n\n## Upstream\n\nIn 2020, gains principally resulted from adjustments to disposals in prior periods. Gains include $130 million from the disposal of our Alaska operations and interests and $166 million fair value movements in relation to deferred and contingent consideration in relation to the Alaska disposal and prior disposals in the North Sea. Losses included $134 million fair value movements in relation to deferred and contingent consideration arising from prior period disposals in the North Sea, $120 million in relation to the likely disposal of an exploration asset, and $78 million from the disposal of certain properties in the US.\n\nIn 2019, losses included $191 million fair value movements in relation to contingent consideration arising from the prior period disposal of the Bruce, Keith and Devenick assets and $171 million in relation to severance costs associated with the divestment of our Alaskan business.\n\nIn 2018, gains principally resulted from the disposal of interests in the Bruce, Keith and Rhum fields in the UK North Sea, from the disposal of certain properties in the US, and from adjustments to disposals in prior periods. Losses included $335 million resulting from the disposal of our interest in the Magnus field and associated assets in the UK North Sea, $221 million from the disposal of our interest in the Greater Kuparuk Area in the US, and adjustments to disposals in prior periods.",

Disposals and impairment - continued\n\n## Downstream\n\nIn 2020, gains principally resulted from the $2.3 billion gain recognised on the disposal of our Petrochemicals business which completed in December 2020. Losses included $229 million in relation to cessation of manufacturing operations at the Kwinana Refinery following the decision to cease fuel production.\n\n## Other businesses and corporate\n\nIn 2020 the gain on disposal of businesses and fixed assets was principally in respect of the sale and leaseback of our St James's Square London headquarters  - see Note 28 for further information.\n\nIn 2019 losses on disposal of businesses and fixed assets were principally in respect of the reclassification of accumulated foreign exchange losses from reserves to the income statement upon the contribution of our Brazilian biofuels business to a new 50:50 joint venture BP Bunge Bioenergia.\n\nIn 2018 proceeds from disposals were principally in respect of life insurance policies in the US and wind farms within our US wind business.\n\nSummarized financial information relating to the sale of businesses is shown in the table below.\n\nThe principal transactions categorized as a business disposal in 2020 were the sales of our Petrochemical and Alaskan businesses. See Note 2 for further information.\n\nThe principal transaction categorized as a business disposal in 2019 was the sale of our interests in the Gulf of Suez oil concessions in Egypt.\n\nThe principal transaction categorized as a business disposal in 2018 was the disposal of our interest in the Greater Kuparuk Area in the US.\n\n|                                                              | $ million   | $ million      | $ million   | $ million   | $ million   | $ million   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|----------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\n|                                                              |             |                |             | 2020        | 2019        | 2018        |\n|                                                              | Alaska      | Petrochemicals | Other       | Total       |             |             |\n| Non-current assets                                           | 5,143       | 2,592          | 1,357       | 9,092       | 1,653       | 3,274       |\n| Current assets                                               | 693         | 846            | -           | 1,539       | 507         | 173         |\n| Non-current liabilities                                      | (923)       | (178)          | (538)       | (1,639)     | (257)       | (250)       |\n| Current liabilities                                          | (344)       | (425)          | (13)        | (782)       | (108)       | (97)        |\n| Total carrying amount of net assets disposed                 | 4,569       | 2,835          | 806         | 8,210       | 1,795       | 3,100       |\n| Recycling of foreign exchange on disposal                    | -           | (331)          | 3           | (328)       | 880         | -           |\n| Costs on disposal                                            | (6)         | (25)           | 44          | 13          | 190         | 3           |\n|                                                              | 4,563       | 2,479          | 853         | 7,895       | 2,865       | 3,103       |\n| Gains (losses) on sale of businesses                         | 260         | 2,414          | (104)       | 2,570       | (1,190)     | (221)       |\n| Total consideration                                          | 4,823       | 4,893          | 749         | 10,465      | 1,675       | 2,882       |\n| Non-cash consideration                                       | (219)       | -              | -           | (219)       | (938)       | (282)       |\n| Consideration received (receivable) a                        | (4,257)     | (1,005)        | 5           | (5,257)     | 964         | (689)       |\n| Proceeds from the sale of businesses, net of cash disposed b | 347         | 3,888          | 754         | 4,989       | 1,701       | 1,911       |\n\n## Impairments\n\nImpairment losses and impairment reversals in each segment are described below. For information on significant estimates and judgements made in relation to impairments see Impairment of property, plant and equipment, intangibles and goodwill within Note 1. See also Note 12, and Note 15 for further information on impairments by asset category.\n\n## Upstream\n\nImpairment losses and reversals in all years relate primarily to producing and midstream assets.\n\nThe 2020 impairment loss of $12,917 million primarily relates to losses incurred in respect of producing and development assets in the UK North Sea ($2,796 million), the US ($2,744 million), Trinidad ($2,416 million), Mauritania and Senegal ($1,909 million), India ($1,313 million) and Canada ($865 million). Impairment losses were primarily driven by a reduction in bp's future oil and gas price assumptions and, to a lesser extent, certain technical reserves revisions. The recoverable amount of the impaired CGUs in total is $33,415 million.\n\nThe principal CGUs on which significant impairment losses were incurred in 2020 were $1,909 million for Tortue in Mauritania and Senegal; $1,313 million for KGD6 in India; $1,181 million for Schiehallion in the UK North Sea; $1,044 million for Mahogany in Trinidad, $960 million for Cassia in Trinidad; $1,011 million for Hawkville in BPX Energy; $747 million for ETAP in the UK North Sea and $742 million for Sunrise in Canada. The recoverable amount for each of these CGUs was their value in use, which in total was $13,200 million. In addition, impairment losses of $939 million were incurred relating to the disposal of bp's business in Alaska. The recoverable amount of the Alaska business was its fair value less costs of disposal; see note 2 for further information.\n\nThe 2019 impairment losses of $6,752 million related to various assets, with the most significant charges arising in the US. Impairment losses arose primarily as a result of the decision to dispose of certain assets, including $4,703 million in relation to completed and expected disposals in BPX Energy and $1,264 million relating to the expected disposal of our Alaskan business; of these amounts $355 million primarily relates to impairment of associated goodwill.\n\nThe 2018 impairment losses of $400 million related to a number of different assets, with the most significant charges arising in Australia and the US. Impairment losses arose primarily as a result of changes to project activity, asset obsolescence and the decision to dispose of certain assets. The 2018 impairment reversals of $580 million related to a number of different assets, with the most significant reversals arising in the North Sea and Angola following a change to decommissioning cost estimates.\n\n## Downstream\n\nImpairment losses totalling $840 million, $65 million, and $12 million were recognized in 2020, 2019 and 2018 respectively. The amount for 2020 principally relates to portfolio changes in the fuels business, including the conversion of Kwinana refinery to an import terminal. None of the impairment charges were individually material.",

Disposals and impairment - continued\n\n## Other businesses and corporate\n\nImpairment losses totalling $32 million, $30 million, and $254 million were recognized in 2020, 2019 and 2018 respectively. The amount for 2018 is in respect of assets within our US wind business in advance of their disposal in December 2018.\n\n## 5. Segmental analysis\n\nThe group's organizational structure reflects the various activities in which bp is engaged. At 31 December 2020, bp had three reportable segments: Upstream, Downstream and Rosneft.\n\nUpstream's activities include oil and natural gas exploration, field development and production; midstream transportation, storage and processing; and the marketing and trading of natural gas, including liquefied natural gas (LNG), together with power and natural gas liquids (NGLs).\n\nDownstream's activities include the refining, manufacturing, marketing, transportation, and supply and trading of crude oil, petroleum, petrochemicals products and related services to wholesale and retail customers.\n\nbp's interest in Rosneft is accounted for using the equity method and is reported as a separate operating segment, reflecting the way in which the investment is managed.\n\nOther businesses and corporate comprises the biofuels and wind businesses, the group's shipping and treasury functions, and corporate activities worldwide.\n\nThe accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as the group's accounting policies described in Note 1. However, IFRS requires that the measure of profit or loss disclosed for each operating segment is the measure that is provided regularly to the chief operating decision maker for the purposes of performance assessment and resource allocation. For bp, this measure of profit or loss is replacement cost profit or loss before interest and tax which reflects the replacement cost of supplies by excluding from profit or loss before interest and tax inventory holding gains and losses a . Replacement cost profit or loss before interest and tax for the group is not a recognized measure under IFRS.\n\nSales between segments are made at prices that approximate market prices, taking into account the volumes involved. Segment revenues and segment results include transactions between business segments. These transactions and any unrealized profits and losses are eliminated on consolidation, unless unrealized losses provide evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Sales to external customers by region are based on the location of the group subsidiary which made the sale. The UK region includes the UK-based international activities of Downstream.\n\nAll surpluses and deficits recognized on the group balance sheet in respect of pension and other post-retirement benefit plans are allocated to Other businesses and corporate. However, the periodic expense relating to these plans is allocated to the operating segments based upon the business in which the employees work.\n\nCertain financial information is provided separately for the US as this is an individually material country for bp, and for the UK as this is bp's country of domicile.\n\nIn February 2020, bp announced plans for a reorganization of the group's organizational structure.  The group's segmental reporting structure as described above remained in place throughout 2020.  Changes to this structure, as described in Note 1 - Voluntary changes to significant accounting policies - not yet adopted, came into effect from 1 January 2021.",

These plans typically have a three-year performance or restricted period during which the units accrue net notional dividends which are treated as having been reinvested. Leaving employment will normally preclude the conversion of units into shares, but special arrangements apply for participants that leave for qualifying reasons. The number of shares that are expected to vest each year under employee share plans are shown in the table below. The dilutive effect of the employee share plans at 31 December is also shown.",

The reduction in headroom since the prior period principally relates to the impact of changes to price assumptions.\n\nNo impairment of the Upstream goodwill balance was recognized during 2020 (2019 $386 million).\n\nThe value in use is based on the cash flows expected to be generated by the projected oil or natural gas production profiles up to the expected dates of cessation of production of each producing field, based on current estimates of reserves and resources, appropriately risked. Midstream and supply and trading activities and equity-accounted entities are generally not included in the impairment review of goodwill, as they do not represent part of the grouping of cash-generating units to which the goodwill relates and which is used to monitor the goodwill for internal management purposes. Where such activities form part of a wider Upstream cash-generating unit, they are reflected in the test. As the production profile and related cash flows can be estimated from bp's past experience, management believes that the cash flows generated over the estimated life of field is the appropriate basis upon which to assess goodwill and individual assets for impairment. The estimated date of cessation of production depends on the interaction of a number of variables, such as the recoverable quantities of hydrocarbons, the production profile of the hydrocarbons, the cost of the development of the infrastructure necessary to recover the hydrocarbons, production costs, the contractual duration of the production concession and the selling price of the hydrocarbons produced. As each producing field has specific reservoir characteristics and economic circumstances, the cash flows of each field is computed using appropriate individual economic models and key assumptions agreed by bp management.\n\nEstimated production volumes and cash flows up to the date of cessation of production on a field-by-field basis, including operating and capital expenditure, are derived from the business segment plan. The production profiles used are consistent with the reserve and resource volumes approved as part of bp's centrally controlled process for the estimation of proved and probable reserves and total resources. Oil and gas price assumptions and discount rate assumptions used were as disclosed in Note 1. The average production for the purposes of goodwill impairment testing over the next 15 years is 877 mmboe per year (2019 829 mmboe per year). The weighted average pre-tax discount rate used in the test is 11%  (2019 12% ).",

        "page_content": "## 14. Goodwill and impairment review of goodwill - continued\n\nThe most recent review for impairment was carried out in the fourth quarter. The key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculation are oil and natural gas prices, production volumes and the discount rate. The value-in-use calculation has been prepared solely for the purposes of determining whether the goodwill balance was impaired. Estimated future cash flows were prepared on the basis of certain assumptions prevailing at the time of the test. The actual outcomes may differ from the assumptions made. For example, reserves and resources estimates and production forecasts are subject to revision as further technical information becomes available and economic conditions change. Due to economic developments, regulatory change and emissions reduction activity arising from climate concern and other factors, future commodity prices and other assumptions may differ from the forecasts used in the calculations.\n\nSensitivities to different variables have been estimated using certain simplifying assumptions. For example, lower oil and gas price or production sensitivities do not fully reflect the specific impacts for each contractual arrangement and will not capture all favourable impacts that may arise from cost deflation or savings. A detailed calculation at any given price or production profile may, therefore, produce a different result.\n\nAdverse changes in input assumptions applied in respect to assets carried at or close to their value in use, primarily being those assets previously impaired, would have a limited effect on goodwill headroom, instead resulting in a direct impairment of the particular cash-generating unit's net book value. Conversely, a reduction in the value in use of those assets carried at a value below their respective values in use would result in an adverse impact on the goodwill headroom. It is estimated that a 21%  reduction in revenue throughout each year of the remaining life of those assets, either as a result of adverse price or production conditions or a combination of each, would cause the recoverable amount to be equal to the carrying amount of goodwill and related net non-current assets of the segment.\n\nIt is estimated that no reasonably possible change in the discount rate would cause the recoverable amount to be equal to the carrying amount of goodwill and related net non-current assets of the segment.\n\n## Downstream\n\n|          | $ million   | $ million   | $ million       | $ million   | $ million   | $ million   | $ million   | $ million       | $ million   | $ million   |\n|----------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|-------------|-------------|\n|          | Lubricants  | US Fuels    | European  Fuels | Other       | Total       | Lubricants  | US Fuels    | European  Fuels | Other       | Total       |\n| Goodwill | 2,865       | 606         | 913             | 276         | 4,660       | 2,779       | -           | 858             | 267         | 3,904       |\n\nCash flows for each cash-generating unit are derived from the business segment plans, which cover a period of up to five years. To determine the value in use for each of the cash-generating units, cash flows for a period of 10 years are discounted and aggregated with a terminal value.\n\n## Lubricants\n\nAs permitted by IAS 36, the detailed calculations of Lubricants' recoverable amount performed in the most recent detailed calculation in 2018 was used as the basis for the tests in 2020 as the criteria of IAS 36 were considered satisfied: the headroom was substantial in 2018; there have been no significant changes in the assets and liabilities; and the likelihood that the recoverable amount would be less than the carrying amount is remote.\n\nThe key assumptions to which the calculation of value in use for the Lubricants unit is most sensitive are operating unit margins, sales volumes, and discount rate. Operating margin and sales volumes assumptions used in the detailed impairment review of goodwill calculation are consistent with the assumptions used in the Lubricants unit's business plan and values assigned to these key assumptions reflect past experience. No reasonably possible change in any of these key assumptions would cause the unit's carrying amount to exceed its recoverable amount. Cash flows beyond the plan period are extrapolated using a nominal 2.8%  growth rate.\n\n## 15.

Investments in associates - continued\n\nbp owns 19.75%  of the voting shares of Rosneft which are listed on the MICEX stock exchange in Moscow and its global depository receipts are listed on the London Stock Exchange. Rosneft's largest shareholder is Rosneftegaz JSC (Rosneftegaz), which is wholly owned by the Russian government. At 31 December 2020, Rosneftegaz held 40.4%  (2019 50.0%  plus one share) of the voting shares of Rosneft.\n\nbp classifies its investment in Rosneft as an associate because, in management's judgement, bp has significant influence over Rosneft; see Interests in other entities within Note 1 for further information. The group's investment in Rosneft is a foreign operation whose functional currency is the Russian rouble. The decrease in the group's equity-accounted investment balance for Rosneft at 31 December 2020 compared with 31 December 2019 principally relates to adverse foreign exchange effects, which have been recognized in other comprehensive income, and dividends, partially offset by bp's share of Rosneft's changes in equity.\n\nDuring 2020 Rosneft completed a transaction to transfer all of its interest and cease participation in its Venezuelan businesses to a company owned by the government of the Russian Federation. In consideration, Rosneft received shares equal to a 9.6%  share of its own equity. The shares are held by a 100% subsidiary of Rosneft and accounted for as treasury shares. Rosneft also entered into share buyback transactions during the year. These are also accounted for as treasury shares. bp retains 19.75%  of the voting rights at meetings of Rosneft shareholders and will continue to be entitled to dividends based on its current shareholding. bp's economic interest, however, increased as a result of its indirect interest in the shares held by the subsidiary of Rosneft. bp's share of profit or loss of Rosneft reflects its economic interest. At 31 December 2020, bp's economic interest was 22.03% .\n\nOn 28 December 2020 Rosneft completed the acquisition of 100%  stakes in JSC Taimyrneftegaz and LLC Taimyrburservis, and the sale of a 10% interest in LLC Vostok Oil. A preliminary assessment of the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired and the consideration transferred in respect of the acquisitions has been undertaken and the further impact, if any, on bp's accounting for its equity-accounted investment in Rosneft will be updated once this has been finalised.\n\nThe value of bp's 19.75%  shareholding in Rosneft based on the quoted market share price of $5.64 per share (2019 $7.21 per share) was $11,804 million at 31 December 2020 (2019 $15,090 million). The value of bp's 22.03%  economic interest based on the quoted market share price was $13,167 million at 31 December 2020.\n\nThe following table provides summarized financial information relating to Rosneft. This information is presented on a 100%  basis and reflects adjustments made by bp to Rosneft's own results in applying the equity method of accounting. bp adjusts Rosneft's results for the accounting required under IFRS relating to bp's purchase of its interest in Rosneft and the amortization of the deferred gain relating to the disposal of bp's interest in TNKBP.\n\n|                                     | $ million Gross amount   | $ million Gross amount   | $ million Gross amount   |\n|-------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n|                                     | 2020                     | 2019                     | 2018                     |\n| Sales and other operating revenues  | 82,786                   | 134,046                  | 131,322                  |\n| Profit before interest and taxation | 1,270                    | 17,473                   | 18,886                   |\n| Finance costs                       | 1,742                    | 1,281                    | 2,785                    |\n| Profit (loss) before taxation       | (472)                    | 16,192                   | 16,101                   |\n| Taxation                            | 208                      | 3,058                    | 2,957                    |\n| Non-controlling interests           | 482                      | 1,514                    | 1,585                    |\n| Profit (loss) for the year          | (1,162)                  | 11,620                   | 11,559                   |\n| Other comprehensive income          | 1,653                    | 572                      | 2,086                    |\n| Total comprehensive income          | 491                      | 12,192                   | 13,645                   |\n| Non-current assets                  | 175,978                  | 161,327                  |                          |\n| Current assets                      | 42,459                   | 38,657                   |                          |\n| Total assets                        | 218,437                  | 199,984                  |                          |\n| Current liabilities                 | 49,781                   | 44,459                   |                          |\n| Non-current liabilities             | 96,727                   | 79,327                   |                          |\n| Total liabilities                   | 146,508                  | 123,786                  |                          |\n| Net assets                          | 71,929                   | 76,198                   |                          |\n| Less: non-controlling interests     | 10,897                   | 10,744                   |                          |\n|                                     | 61,032                   | 65,454                   |                          |\n\nThe group received dividends, net of withholding tax, of $480 million from Rosneft in 2020 (2019 $785 million and 2018 $620 million).",

The fair value is determined using an estimate of discounted future cash flows that are expected to be received and is considered a level 3 valuation under the fair value hierarchy. Future cash flows are estimated based on inputs including oil and natural gas prices, production volumes and operating costs related to the disposed operations. The discount rate used is based on a risk-free rate adjusted for asset-specific risks. The contingent consideration principally relates to the disposal of our Alaskan business.\n\n## 19.

The adjustment on adoption of IFRS 9 relates to the additional loss allowance required by IFRS 9's expected credit loss model. The expected credit loss allowance comprises $456 million (2019 $414 million, 2018 $327 million) relating to receivables that were credit-impaired at the end of the year and $99 million (2019 $95 million, 2018 $89 million) relating to receivables that were not credit-impaired at the end of the year. Whilst credit risk has increased since 31  December 2019, there has also been a significant reduction in the group's trade and other receivables balance. Therefore, the total expected credit loss allowances recognized as at 31 December 2020 have not significantly increased during the year.\n\nValuation and qualifying accounts relating to fixed asset investments comprise impairment provisions for investments in equity-accounted entities. The adjustment on adoption of IFRS 9 primarily relates to amounts provided against investments in equity instruments that were held at cost less impairment losses under IAS 39 but that are classified as measured at fair value through profit or loss under IFRS 9.\n\nIn addition to the amounts presented above, expected loss allowances on cash and cash equivalents classified as measured at amortized cost totalled $11 million (2019 $11 million). For further information on the group's credit risk management policies and how the group recognizes and measures expected losses see Note 29.\n\nValuation and qualifying accounts are deducted in the balance sheet from the assets to which they apply.\n\n## 22.

See Note 29 (c) for further information.\n\nPayables related to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill include amounts payable under the 2016 consent decree and settlement agreement with the United States and five Gulf coast states, including amounts payable for natural resource damages, state claims and Clean Water Act penalties. On a discounted basis the amounts included in payables related to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill for these elements of the agreements are $4,837 million payable over 12 years, $2,584 million payable over 13 years and $3,549 million payable over 12 years respectively at 31 December 2020. Reported within net cash provided by operating activities in the group cash flow statement is a net cash outflow of $1,786 million (2019 outflow of $2,694 million, 2018 outflow of $3,531 million) related to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, which includes payments made in relation to these agreements. For 2018 payments under the 2012 agreement with the US government to resolve all federal criminal claims arising from the incident are also included. For full details of these agreements, see bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2015 - Legal Proceedings.\n\nPayables related to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill at 31 December 2020 also include amounts payable for settled economic loss and property damage claims which are payable over a period of up to seven years.",

In addition to the Litigation and claims narrative provided in this note, for further information see Notes 7, 9, 20, 22, 29, 33.\n\n## Litigation and claims\n\nThe Economic and Property Damages Settlement Agreement (EPD Settlement Agreement) with the Plaintiff's Steering Committee (PSC) provides for a court-supervised settlement programme, the Deepwater Horizon Court Supervised Settlement Programme (DHCSSP), which commenced operation on 4 June 2012. On 22 January 2021, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana issued an order determining the completion of all claims processing operations of the DHCSSP. The Court also concluded that future issues concerning EPD Settlement Agreement claims would be time barred under the DHCSSP and the claim administrator would proceed to complete post-closure administrative wind down activities. Amounts payable for settled economic and property damage claims are reported within payables - see Note 22 for further information.\n\nA separate claims administrator was appointed to pay medical claims and to implement other aspects of the Medical Benefits Class Action Settlement. For further information on the PSC settlements, see Legal proceedings on page 226.\n\nThe litigation and claims provision reflects the latest estimate for the remaining costs associated with the Gulf of Mexico oil spill. The amounts payable may differ from the amount provided and the timing of payments is uncertain.\n\n## 24. Pensions and other post-retirement benefits\n\nMost group companies have pension plans, the forms and benefits of which vary with conditions and practices in the countries concerned. Pension benefits may be provided through defined contribution plans (money purchase schemes) or defined benefit plans (final salary and other types of schemes with committed pension benefit payments). For defined contribution plans, retirement benefits are determined by the value of funds arising from contributions paid in respect of each employee. For defined benefit plans, retirement benefits are based on such factors as an employee's pensionable salary and length of service. Defined benefit plans may be funded or unfunded. The assets of funded plans are generally held in separately administered trusts.\n\nFor information on significant estimates and judgements made in relation to accounting for these plans see Pensions and other post-retirement benefits in Note 1.\n\nThe primary pension arrangement in the UK is a funded final salary pension plan under which retired employees draw the majority of their benefit as an annuity. This pension plan is governed by a corporate trustee whose board is composed of four member-nominated directors, four company-nominated directors, one independent director and one independent chairman nominated by the company. The trustee board is required by law to act in the best interests of the plan participants and is responsible for setting certain policies, such as investment policies of the plan. The UK plan is closed to new joiners and is currently under consultation for closure to future accrual. As at 31 December 2020, it remained open to ongoing accrual for current members. New joiners in the UK are eligible for membership of a defined contribution plan.\n\nIn the US, all pension benefits now accrue under a cash balance formula. Benefits previously accrued under final salary formulas are legally protected. Retiring US employees typically take their pension benefit in the form of a lump sum payment upon retirement. The plan is funded and its assets are overseen by a fiduciary Investment Committee. During 2020 the committee was composed of seven bp employees appointed by the president of bp Corporation North America Inc. (the appointing officer). The Investment Committee is required by law to act in the best interests of the plan participants and is responsible for setting certain policies, such as the investment policies of the plan. US employees are also eligible to participate in a defined contribution (401k) plan in which employee contributions are matched with company contributions. In the US, group companies also provide postretirement healthcare to most retired employees and their dependants (and, in certain cases, life insurance coverage); the entitlement to these benefits is usually based on the employee remaining in service until a specified age and completion of a minimum period of service.",

        "page_content": "## 24. Pensions and other post-retirement benefits - continued\n\nIn the Eurozone, there are defined benefit pension plans in Germany, France, the Netherlands and other countries. In Germany and France, the majority of the pensions are unfunded, in line with market practice. In Germany, the group's largest Eurozone plan, employees receive a pension and also have a choice to supplement their core pension through salary sacrifice. For employees who joined since 2002, the core pension benefit is a career average plan with retirement benefits based on such factors as an employee's pensionable salary and length of service. The returns on the notional contributions made by both the company and employees are based on the interest rate which is set out in German tax law. Retired German employees take their pension benefit typically in the form of an annuity. The German plans are governed by legal agreements between bp and the works council or between bp and the trade union.\n\nThe level of contributions to funded defined benefit plans is the amount needed to provide adequate funds to meet pension obligations as they fall due. During 2020 the aggregate level of contributions was $325 million (2019 $349 million and 2018 $610 million). The aggregate level of contributions in 2021 is expected to be approximately $400 million, and includes contributions in all countries that we expect to be required to make contributions by law or under contractual agreements, as well as an allowance for discretionary funding.\n\nFor the primary UK plan there is a funding agreement between the group and the trustee. On an annual basis a schedule of contributions is agreed covering the next five years. Contractually committed funding amounted to $1,014 million at 31 December 2020, all of which relates to future service. This amount is included in the group's committed cash flows relating to pensions and other post-retirement benefit plans as set out in the table of contractual obligations on page 307.\n\nThe surplus relating to the primary UK pension plan is recognized on the balance sheet on the basis that the company is entitled to a refund of any remaining assets once all members have left the plan.\n\nMinimum pension funding in the US is determined by legislation and is supplemented by discretionary contributions. No contributions were made into the primary US pension plan in 2020 and no statutory funding requirement is expected in the next 12 months.\n\nThe surplus relating to the primary US fund is recognized on the balance sheet on the basis that economic benefit can be gained from the surplus through a reduction in future contributions.\n\nThere was no minimum funding requirement for the US plan, and no significant minimum funding requirements in other countries at 31 December 2020.\n\nThe obligation and cost of providing pensions and other post-retirement benefits is assessed annually using the projected unit credit method. The date of the most recent actuarial review was 31 December 2020. The UK plans are subject to a formal actuarial valuation every three years; valuations are required more frequently in many other countries.The most recent formal actuarial valuation of the UK pension plans was as at 31 December 2017, and a valuation as at 31 December 2020 is currently underway. A valuation of the US plan and largest Eurozone plans are carried out annually.\n\nThe material financial assumptions used to estimate the benefit obligations of the various plans are set out below. The assumptions are reviewed by management at the end of each year and are used to evaluate the accrued benefit obligation at 31 December and pension expense for the following year.\n\n|                                                            |      |      |         |      | %    | %       | %    | %    | %             |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|------|------|---------|------|------|---------|------|------|---------------|\n| Financial assumptions used to determine benefit obligation | 2020 | 2019 | UK 2018 | 2020 | 2019 | US 2018 | 2020 | 2019 | Eurozone 2018 |\n| Discount rate for plan liabilities                         | 1.4  | 2.1  | 2.9     | 2.2  | 3.1  | 4.1     | 1.0  | 1.3  | 2.0           |\n| Rate of increase in salaries                               | 3.6  | 3.4  | 3.8     | 4.1  | 3.9  | 3.9     | 2.9  | 3.1  | 3.1           |\n| Rate of increase for pensions in payment                   | 2.8  | 2.7  | 3.0     | -    | -    | -       | 1.3  | 1.5  | 1.5           |\n| Rate of increase in deferred pensions                      | 2.8  | 2.7  | 3.0     | -    | -    | -       | 0.5  | 0.5  | 0.5           |\n| Inflation for plan liabilities                             | 2.9  | 2.7  | 3.1     | 1.7  | 1.5  |         |      | 1.7  | 1.7           |\n|                                                            |      |      |         |      |      | 1.5     | 1.5  |      | %             |\n| Financial assumptions used to determine benefit expense    | 2020 | 2019 | 2018    | 2020 | 2019 | 2018    | 2020 | 2019 | 2018          |\n| Discount rate for plan service cost                        | 2.1  | 3.0  | 2.6     | 3.2  | 4.2  | 3.6     | 1.8  | 2.5  | 2.4           |\n| Discount rate for plan other finance expense               | 2.1  | 2.9  | 2.5     | 3.1  | 4.1  | 3.5     | 1.3  | 2.0  | 1.9           |\n| Inflation for plan service cost                            | 2.6  | 3.1  | 3.1     | 1.5  | 1.5  | 1.7     | 1.7  | 1.7  | 1.6           |\n\nThe discount rate assumptions are based on third-party AA corporate bond indices and for our largest plans in the UK, US and the Eurozone we use yields that reflect the maturity profile of the expected benefit payments. The inflation rate assumptions for our UK and US plans are based on the difference between the yields on index-linked and fixed-interest long-term government bonds. In other countries, including the Eurozone, we use this approach, or advice from the local actuary depending on the information available. The inflation assumptions are used to determine the rate of increase for pensions in payment and the rate of increase in deferred pensions where there is such an increase.\n\nThe assumptions for the rate of increase in salaries are based on the inflation assumption plus an allowance for expected long-term real salary growth. These include an allowance for promotion-related salary growth, of up to 0.8%  depending on country.",

The mortality assumptions reflect best practice in the countries in which we provide pensions and have been chosen with regard to applicable published tables adjusted where appropriate to reflect the experience of the group and an extrapolation of past longevity improvements into the future. bp's most substantial pension liabilities are in the UK, the US and the Eurozone where our mortality assumptions are as follows:\n\n| Mortality assumptions                                     | Years   | Years   | UK   | Years   | Years   | Years   | Years   | Years   | Eurozone   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|------------|\n|                                                           |         |         |      | US      | US      | US      | US      |         |            |\n|                                                           | 2020    | 2019    | 2018 | 2020    | 2019    | 2018    | 2020    | 2019    | 2018       |\n| Life expectancy at age 60 for a male currently  aged 60   | 26.9    | 27.3    | 27.4 | 24.7    | 24.9    | 25.1    | 25.7    | 25.7    | 25.6       |\n| Life expectancy at age 60 for a male currently  aged 40   | 28.4    | 28.9    | 28.9 | 26.4    | 26.7    | 26.9    | 28.2    | 28.3    | 28.1       |\n| Life expectancy at age 60 for a female currently  aged 60 | 28.8    | 28.7    | 28.8 | 27.7    | 28.0    | 28.5    | 29.0    | 29.1    | 29.0       |\n| Life expectancy at age 60 for a female currently  aged 40 | 30.4    | 30.5    | 30.6 | 29.2    | 29.7    | 30.1    | 31.2    | 31.2    | 31.2       |\n\nPension plan assets are generally held in trusts, the primary objective of which is to accumulate assets sufficient to meet the obligations of the plans. The assets of the trusts are invested in a manner consistent with fiduciary obligations and principles that reflect current practices in portfolio management.\n\nA significant proportion of the assets are held in equities, which are expected to generate a higher level of return over the long term, with an acceptable level of risk. In order to provide reasonable assurance that no single security or type of security has an unwarranted impact on the total portfolio, the investment portfolios are highly diversified.\n\nThe trustee's long-term investment objective for the primary UK plan as it matures is to invest in assets whose value changes in the same way as the plan liabilities, in order to reduce the level of funding risk. To move towards this objective, the UK plan uses a liability driven investment (LDI) approach for part of the portfolio, investing primarily in government bonds to achieve this matching effect for the most significant plan liability assumptions of interest rate and inflation rate. This is partly funded by short-term sale and repurchase agreements, whereby the plan borrows money using existing bonds as security and which will be bought back at a specified price at an agreed future date. The funds raised are used to invest in further bonds to increase the proportion of assets which match the plan liabilities. The borrowings are shown separately in the analysis of pension plan assets in the table below.\n\nFor the primary UK pension plan there is an agreement with the trustee to increase the proportion of assets with liability matching characteristics over time primarily by reducing the proportion of plan assets held as equities and increasing the proportion held as bonds. During 2020, the UK plan switched 11%  of plan assets from equities to bonds (2019 2% ). There is a similar agreement in place for the primary US plan, although no switches have taken place in 2019 or 2020.\n\nThe current asset allocation policy for the major plans at 31 December 2020 was as follows:\n\n|                                         | UK   | US   |\n|-----------------------------------------|------|------|\n| Asset category                          | %    | %    |\n| Total equity (including private equity) | 17   | 40   |\n| Bonds/cash (including LDI)              | 76   | 60   |\n| Property/real estate                    | 7    | -    |\n\nThe amounts invested under the LDI programme by the primary UK pension plan as at 31 December 2020 were $4,217 million (2019 $4,804 million) of government-issued nominal bonds and $24,576 million (2019 $19,462 million) of index-linked bonds.\n\nSome of the group's pension plans in the Eurozone and other countries use derivative financial instruments as part of their asset mix to manage the level of risk. The fair value of these instruments is included in other assets in the table below.\n\nThe group's main pension plans do not invest directly in either securities or property/real estate of the company or of any subsidiary.\n\nThe fair values of the various categories of assets held by the defined benefit plans at 31 December are presented in the table below, including the effects of derivative financial instruments. Movements in the fair value of plan assets during the year are shown in detail in the table on page 201.",

The effects shown for the expense in 2021 comprise the total of current service cost and net finance income or expense.\n\n|                                          | $ million   | $ million        | $ million   | $ million   | $ million                     | $ million                     |\n|------------------------------------------|-------------|------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n|                                          | UK          | UK               | US          | US          | One percentage point Eurozone | One percentage point Eurozone |\n|                                          | Increase    | Decrease         | Increase    | Decrease    | Increase                      | Decrease                      |\n| Discount rate a                          |             |                  |             |             |                               |                               |\n| Effect on expense in 2021                | (274)       | 198              | (51)        | 36          | (2)                           | (11)                          |\n| Effect on obligation at 31 December 2020 | (5,658)     | 7,690            | (1,272)     | 1,556       | (1,149)                       | 1,452                         |\n| Inflation rate b                         |             |                  |             |             |                               |                               |\n| Effect on expense in 2021                | 145         | (116)            | 10          | (8)         | 35                            | (28)                          |\n| Effect on obligation at 31 December 2020 |             | 5,337    (4,482) | 66          | (55)        | 1,025                         | (870)                         |\n| Salary growth                            |             |                  |             |             |                               |                               |\n| Effect on expense in 2021                | 31          | (27)             | 12          | (10)        | 7                             | (7)                           |\n| Effect on obligation at 31 December 2020 | 670         | (585)            | 82          | (69)        | 91                            | (89)                          |\n\n|                                          | $ million One year increase   | $ million One year increase   | $ million One year increase   |\n|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n|                                          | UK                            | US                            | Eurozone                      |\n| Longevity                                |                               |                               |                               |\n| Effect on expense in 2021                | 28                            | 5                             | 8                             |\n| Effect on obligation at 31 December 2020 | 1,406                         | 150                           | 333                           |\n\n## Estimated future benefit payments and the weighted average duration of defined benefit obligations\n\nThe expected benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, but exclude plan expenses, up until 2030 and the weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligations at 31 December 2020 are as follows:\n\n| Estimated future benefit payments   | UK    | US    | Eurozone   |   Other | $ million Total   |\n|-------------------------------------|-------|-------|------------|---------|-------------------|\n| 2021                                | 1,072 | 1,568 | 357        |   112   | 3,109             |\n| 2022                                | 1,086 | 612   | 346        |   109   | 2,153             |\n| 2023                                | 1,120 | 593   | 339        |   107   | 2,159             |\n| 2024                                | 1,141 | 575   | 332        |   108   | 2,156             |\n| 2025                                | 1,135 | 583   | 328        |   107   | 2,153             |\n| 2026-2030                           | 5,939 | 2,696 | 1,521      |   528   | 10,684            |\n| Weighted average duration           | 19.2  | 13.8  | 16.1       |    12.7 |                   |",

Finance debt does not include accrued interest, which is reported within other payables. As part of actively managing its debt portfolio, during the year the group bought back $4.0 billion equivalent (2019 $nil) of euro and sterling bonds and terminated derivatives associated with the debt bought back. In addition on 18 December 2020 the group exercised its option to redeem finance debt with an outstanding aggregate principal amount of $2.0 billion on 22 January 2021. On 19 March 2021 the group bought back a further $1.9 billion equivalent of euro and sterling bonds and terminated associated derivatives. These transactions have no significant impact on net debt or gearing.\n\nThe following table shows the weighted-average interest rates achieved through a combination of borrowings and derivative financial instruments entered into to manage interest rate and currency exposures.\n\n|                  | Fixed rate debt                  | Fixed rate debt                                     | Fixed rate debt   | Floating rate debt               | Floating rate debt   | Total            |\n|------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------|------------------|\n|                  | Weighted average interest rate % | Weighted average time for which rate is fixed Years | Amount $ million  | Weighted average interest rate % | Amount $ million     | Amount $ million |\n|                  |                                  |                                                     |                   |                                  |                      | 2020             |\n| US dollar        | 3                                | 8                                                   | 39,452            | 2                                | 32,891               | 72,343           |\n| Other currencies | 6                                | 9                                                   | 178               | 5                                | 143                  | 321              |\n|                  |                                  |                                                     | 39,630            |                                  | 33,034               | 72,664           |\n|                  |                                  |                                                     |                   |                                  |                      | 2019             |\n| US dollar        | 4                                | 5                                                   | 25,634            | 3                                | 41,871               | 67,505           |\n| Other currencies | 6                                | 10                                                  | 183               | 7                                | 36                   | 219              |\n|                  |                                  |                                                     | 25,817            |                                  | 41,907               | 67,724           |\n\n## Fair values\n\nThe estimated fair value of finance debt is shown in the table below together with the carrying amount as reflected in the balance sheet.\n\nLong-term borrowings in the table below include the portion of debt that matures in the 12 months from 31 December 2020, whereas in the group balance sheet the amount is reported within current finance debt.\n\nThe carrying amount of the group's short-term borrowings, comprising mainly of commercial paper, approximates their fair value. The fair values of the significant majority of the group's long-term borrowings are determined using quoted prices in active markets, and so fall within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Where quoted prices are not available, quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets are used and such measurements are therefore categorized in level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\n\n|                       | 2020       | 2020            | $ million 2019   | $ million 2019   |\n|-----------------------|------------|-----------------|------------------|------------------|\n|                       | Fair value | Carrying amount | Fair value       | Carrying amount  |\n| Short-term borrowings | 1,237      | 1,237           | 2,321            | 2,321            |\n| Long-term borrowings  | 74,855     | 71,427          | 67,055           | 65,403           |\n| Total finance debt    | 76,092     | 72,664          | 69,376           | 67,724           |",

We maintain our financial framework to support the pursuit of value growth for shareholders, while ensuring a secure financial base.\n\nThe group monitors capital on basis of gearing, that is, the ratio of net debt to net debt plus equity. Net debt is calculated as finance debt, as shown in the balance sheet, plus the fair value of associated derivative financial instruments that are used to hedge foreign exchange and interest rate risks relating to finance debt for which hedge accounting is applied, less cash and cash equivalents. Net debt and gearing are non-GAAP measures. bp believes these measures provide useful information to investors. Net debt enables investors to see the economic effect of finance debt, related hedges and cash and cash equivalents in total. Gearing enables investors to see how significant net debt is relative to total equity. The derivatives are reported on the balance sheet within the headings 'Derivative financial instruments'. All components of equity are included in the denominator of the calculation.\n\nAt 31 December 2020, gearing was 31.3%  (2019 31.1% ).\n\n| At 31 December                                                         | 2020   | $ million 2019   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|------------------|\n| Finance debt                                                           | 72,664 | 67,724           |\n| Less: fair value asset (liability) of hedges related to finance debt a | 2,612  | (190)            |\n|                                                                        | 70,052 | 67,914           |\n| Less: cash and cash equivalents                                        | 31,111 | 22,472           |\n| Net debt                                                               | 38,941 | 45,442           |\n| Total equity b                                                         | 85,568 | 100,708          |\n| Gearing                                                                | 31.3 % | 31.1 %           |\n\nAn analysis of changes in liabilities arising from financing activities is provided below.\n\n|                                                     | $ million    | $ million         | $ million         | $ million                                                                      | $ million                                              |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                     | Finance debt | Currency  swaps a | Lease liabilities | Net partner  payable for  leases entered  into on behalf  of joint  operations | Total liabilities  arising from  financing  activities |\n| At 1 January 2020                                   | 67,724       | 918               | 9,722             | 290                                                                            | 78,654                                                 |\n| Exchange adjustments                                | 349          | -

This primarily includes drilling rigs in the Upstream segment and retail service stations, oil depots and storage tanks in the Downstream segment as well as office accommodation and vessel charters across the group. The weighted-average remaining lease term for the total lease portfolio is around 8 years (2019 9 years). Some leases will have payments that vary with market interest or inflation rates. Certain leases contain residual value guarantees, which may be triggered in certain circumstances such as if market values have significantly declined at the conclusion of the lease.\n\nThe table below shows the timing of the undiscounted cash outflows for the lease liabilities included on the balance sheet.\n\n|                                              | $ million   | $ million       |\n|----------------------------------------------|-------------|-----------------|\n|                                              | 2020        | 2019            |\n| Undiscounted lease liability cash flows due: |             |                 |\n| Within 1 year                                | 2,262       | 2,514           |\n| 1 to 2 years                                 | 1,672       | 1,839           |\n| 2 to 3 years                                 | 1,340       | 1,364           |\n| 3 to 4 years                                 | 1,025       | 1,105           |\n| 4 to 5 years                                 | 878         | 876             |\n| 5 to 10 years                                | 2,192       | 2,427           |\n| Over 10 years                                | 1,515       | 1,174           |\n|                                              | 10,884      | 11,299  (1,577) |\n| Impact of discounting                        | (1,622)     |                 |\n| Lease liabilities at 31 December             | 9,262       | 9,722           |\n| Of which - current                           | 1,933       | 2,067           |\n| - non-current                                | 7,329       | 7,655           |\n\nThe group may enter into lease arrangements a number of years before taking control of the underlying asset due to construction lead times or to secure future operational requirements.

Fair value gains and losses related to other assets and liabilities classified as measured at fair value through profit or loss totalled a net gain of $367 million (2019 net loss of $129 million). Dividend income of $17 million (2019 $20 million) from investments in equity instruments classified as measured at fair value through profit or loss is presented within other income  - see Note 7.\n\nInterest income and expenses arising on financial instruments are disclosed in Note 7.\n\n## Financial risk factors\n\nThe group is exposed to a number of different financial risks arising from natural business exposures as well as its use of financial instruments including market risks relating to commodity prices; foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates; credit risk; and liquidity risk.\n\nThe group financial risk committee (GFRC) advises the group chief financial officer (CFO) who oversees the management of these risks. The GFRC is chaired by the CFO and consists of a group of senior managers including the group treasurer and the heads of the group finance, tax and the integrated supply and trading functions. The purpose of the committee is to advise on financial risks and the appropriate financial risk governance framework for the group. The committee provides assurance to the CFO and the group chief executive (GCE), and via the GCE to the board, that the group's financial risk-taking activity is governed by appropriate policies and procedures and that financial risks are identified, measured and managed in accordance with group policies and group risk appetite.\n\nThe group's trading activities in the oil, natural gas, LNG and power markets are managed within the integrated supply and trading function. Treasury holds foreign exchange and interest-rate products in the financial markets to hedge group exposures related to debt and hybrid bond issuance; the compliance, control, and risk management processes for these activities are managed within the treasury function. All other foreign exchange and interest rate activities within financial markets are performed within the integrated supply and trading function and are also underpinned by the compliance, control and risk management infrastructure common to the activities of bp's integrated supply and trading function. All derivative activity is carried out by specialist teams that have the appropriate skills, experience and supervision. These teams are subject to close financial and management control.\n\nThe integrated supply and trading function maintains formal governance processes that provide oversight of market risk, credit risk and operational risk associated with trading activity. A policy and risk committee approves value-at-risk delegations, reviews incidents and validates risk-related policies, methodologies and procedures. A commitments committee approves the trading of new products, instruments and strategies and material commitments.\n\nIn addition, the integrated supply and trading function undertakes derivative activity for risk management purposes under a control framework as described more fully below.\n\n## (a) Market risk\n\nMarket risk is the risk or uncertainty arising from possible market price movements and their impact on the future performance of a business. The primary commodity price risks that the group is exposed to include oil, natural gas and power prices that could adversely affect the value of the group's financial assets, liabilities or expected future cash flows. The group enters into derivatives in a well-established entrepreneurial trading operation. In addition, the group has developed a control framework aimed at managing the volatility inherent in certain of its natural business exposures. In accordance with the control framework the group enters into various transactions using derivatives for risk management purposes.\n\nThe major components of market risk are commodity price risk, foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk, each of which is discussed below.\n\n## (i) Commodity price risk\n\nThe group's integrated, supply and trading function is responsible for delivering value across the overall crude, oil products, gas and power supply chains.  As such, it routinely enters into spot and term physical commodity contracts in addition to optimising physical storage, pipeline and transportation capacity. These activities expose the group to commodity price risk which is managed by entering into oil and natural gas swaps, options and futures.\n\nThe group measures market risk exposure arising from its trading positions in liquid periods using value-at-risk techniques based on Variance/ Covariance or Monte Carlo simulation models. These techniques make a statistical assessment of the market risk arising from possible future changes in market prices over a one-day holding period within a 95% confidence level. The value-at-risk measure is supplemented by stress testing and scenario analysis through simulating the financial impact of certain physical, economic and geo-political scenarios. Trading activity occurring in liquid periods is",

The board has delegated a limit of $100 million (2019 $100 million) value at risk in support of this trading activity. Alternative measures are used to monitor exposures which are outside liquid periods and for which value-at-risk techniques are not appropriate.\n\n## (ii) Foreign currency exchange risk\n\nSince bp has global operations, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can have a significant effect on the group's reported results and future expenditure commitments. The effects of most exchange rate fluctuations are absorbed in business operating results through changing cost competitiveness, lags in market adjustment to movements in rates and translation differences accounted for on specific transactions. For this reason, the total effect of exchange rate fluctuations is not identifiable separately in the group's reported results. The main underlying economic currency of the group's cash flows is the US dollar. This is because bp's major product, oil, is priced internationally in US dollars. bp's foreign currency exchange management policy is to limit economic and material transactional exposures arising from currency movements against the US dollar. The group coordinates the handling of foreign currency exchange risks centrally, by netting off naturally-occurring opposite exposures wherever possible and then managing any material residual foreign currency exchange risks.\n\nMost of the group's borrowings are in US dollars or are hedged with respect to the US dollar. At 31 December 2020, the total foreign currency borrowings not swapped into US dollars amounted to $321 million (2019 $219 million). During the year the group issued perpetual subordinated hybrid bonds in euro, sterling and US dollars. Whilst the contractual terms of these instruments allow the group to defer coupon payments and the repayment of principal indefinitely, the group has chosen to manage the foreign currency exposure relating to the non-US dollar hybrid bonds to their respective first call periods.\n\nThe group manages the net residual foreign currency exposures by constantly reviewing the foreign currency economic value at risk and aims to manage such risk to keep the 12-month foreign currency value at risk below $400 million. At no point over the past three years did the value at risk exceed the maximum risk limit. A continuous assessment is made in respect to the group's foreign currency exposures to capture hedging requirements.\n\nDuring the year, hedge accounting was applied to foreign currency exposure to highly probable forecast capital expenditure commitments. The group fixes the US dollar cost of non-US dollar supplies by using currency forwards for the highly probable forecast capital expenditure; the exposures are in sterling, euro, Australian dollar and Korean won. At 31 December 2020 the most significant open contracts in place were for $124 million sterling (2019 $106 million sterling).\n\nWhere the group enters into foreign currency exchange contracts for entrepreneurial trading purposes the activity is controlled using trading value-atrisk techniques as explained in (i) commodity price risk above.\n\n## (iii) Interest rate risk\n\nbp is also exposed to interest rate risk from the possibility that changes in interest rates will affect future cash flows or the fair values of its financial instruments, principally finance debt. While the group issues debt and hybrid bonds in a variety of currencies based on market opportunities, it uses derivatives to swap the economic exposure to a floating rate basis, mainly to US dollar floating, but in certain defined circumstances maintains a US dollar fixed rate exposure for a proportion of debt. The proportion of floating rate debt net of interest rate swaps at 31 December 2020 was 45%  of total finance debt outstanding (2019 62% ). The weighted average interest rate on finance debt at 31 December 2020 was 3%  (2019 3% ) and the weighted average maturity of fixed rate debt was eight years (2019 five years).\n\nThe group's earnings are sensitive to changes in interest rates on the element of the group's finance debt that has been swapped to floating rates. If the interest rates applicable to these floating rate instruments were to have changed by one percentage point on 1 January 2021, it is estimated that the group's finance costs for 2021 would change by approximately $330 million (2019 $419 million).\n\nFinancial authorities in the US, UK, EU and other territories are currently undertaking reviews of key interest rate benchmarks such as the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) with a view to replacing them with alternative benchmarks. bp is significantly exposed to benchmark interest rate components; predominantly USD LIBOR, GBP LIBOR, EURIBOR and CHF LIBOR. Following the completion of consultation processes, these financial authorities have begun to announce the timing of both benchmark transitions and continued publication of synthetic benchmarks .\n\nIn October 2020 the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) published its fallback protocol containing clauses to amend derivative contracts on the cessation of LIBOR should an entity and its counterparties adhere to the protocol. The protocol's pricing mechanism is at fair market value and bp has signed up to the protocol as this removes transition uncertainty for any interest rate and cross-currency interest rate swap contracts of the Group without fall-back clauses. The ISDA fallback protocol is expected to increase market activity and certainty such that corporates can finalize their plans for implementation of the transition. bp continues to monitor regulatory and market developments over the course of the transition .\n\nIn response to the cessation of the interbank offered rates (IBORs), bp has set up an internal working group to monitor market developments and manage the transition to alternative benchmark rates and is currently assessing the impact on contracts and arrangements that are linked to existing interest rate benchmarks, for example, borrowings, leases and derivative contracts. bp is also participating on external committees and task forces dedicated to interest rate benchmark reform.\n\n## (b) Credit risk\n\nCredit risk is the risk that a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument will fail to perform or fail to pay amounts due causing financial loss to the group and arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with financial institutions and principally from credit exposures to customers relating to outstanding receivables. Credit exposure also exists in relation to guarantees issued by group companies under which the outstanding exposure incremental to that recognized on the balance sheet at 31 December 2020 was $1,405 million (2019 $692 million) in respect of liabilities of joint ventures and associates and $661 million (2019 $523 million) in respect of liabilities of other third parties.\n\nThe group has a credit policy, approved by the CFO that is designed to ensure that consistent processes are in place throughout the group to measure and control credit risk. Credit risk is considered as part of the risk-reward balance of doing business. On entering into any business contract the extent to which the arrangement exposes the group to credit risk is considered. Key requirements of the policy include segregation of credit approval authorities from any sales, marketing or trading teams authorized to incur credit risk; the establishment of credit systems and processes to ensure that all counterparty exposure is rated and that all counterparty exposure and limits can be monitored and reported; and the timely identification and reporting of any non-approved credit exposures and credit losses. While each segment is responsible for its own credit risk management and reporting consistent with group policy, the treasury function holds group-wide credit risk authority and oversight responsibility for exposure to banks and financial institutions. Standing credit controls and processes were augmented intra-year given heightened uncertainty from increased oil price volatility and the evolving COVID-19 pandemic. Constraints on incoming credit risks were tightened, credit reporting and frequency was enhanced from the operational to board level, and key credit risk strategies were reviewed and vetted.",

Financial instruments and financial risk factors - continued\n\nFor the purposes of financial reporting the group calculates expected loss allowances based on the maximum contractual period over which the group is exposed to credit risk. Lifetime expected credit losses are recognized for trade receivables and the credit risk associated with the significant majority of financial assets measured at amortized cost is considered to be low. Since the tenor of substantially all of the group's in-scope financial assets is less than 12 months there is no significant difference between the measurement of 12-month and lifetime expected credit losses. Expected loss allowances for financial guarantee contracts are typically lower than their initial fair value less, where appropriate, amortization. Financial assets are considered to be credit-impaired when there is reasonable and supportable evidence that one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred. This includes observable data concerning significant financial difficulty of the counterparty; a breach of contract; concession being granted to the counterparty for economic or contractual reasons relating to the counterparty's financial difficulty, that would not otherwise be considered; it becoming probable that the counterparty will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganization or an active market for the financial asset disappearing because of financial difficulties. The group also applies a rebuttable presumption that an asset is credit-impaired when contractual payments are more than 30 days past due. Where the group has no reasonable expectation of recovering a financial asset in its entirety or a portion thereof, for example where all legal avenues for collection of amounts due have been exhausted, the financial asset (or relevant portion) is written off.\n\nThe measurement of expected credit losses is a function of the probability of default, loss given default (i.e. the magnitude of the loss after recovery if there is a default) and the exposure at default (i.e. the asset's carrying amount). The group allocates a credit risk rating to exposures based on data that is determined to be predictive of the risk of loss, including but not limited to external ratings. Probabilities of default derived from historical, current and future-looking market data are assigned by credit risk rating with a loss given default based on historical experience and relevant market and academic research applied by exposure type. Experienced credit judgement is applied to ensure probabilities of default are reflective of the credit risk associated with the group's exposures. Credit enhancements that would reduce the group's credit losses in the event of default are reflected in the calculation when they are considered integral to the related asset.\n\nThe maximum credit exposure associated with financial assets is equal to the carrying amount. The group does not aim to remove credit risk entirely but expects to experience a certain level of credit losses. As at 31 December 2020, the group had in place credit enhancements designed to mitigate approximately $5.4 billion (2019 $7.0 billion) of credit risk, of which substantially all relates to assets in the scope of IFRS 9's impairment requirements. Credit enhancements include standby and documentary letters of credit, bank guarantees, insurance and liens which are typically taken out with financial institutions who have investment grade credit ratings, or are liens over assets held by the counterparty of the related receivables. Reports are regularly prepared and presented to the GFRC that cover the group's overall credit exposure and expected loss trends, exposure by segment, and overall quality of the portfolio.\n\nManagement information used to monitor credit risk, which reflects the impact of credit enhancements, indicates that the risk profile of financial assets which are subject to review for impairment under IFRS 9 is as set out below.\n\n| As at 31 December   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|---------------------|--------|--------|\n| AAA to AA-          | 11 %   | 16 %   |\n| A+ to A-            | 59 %   | 51 %   |\n| BBB+ to BBB-        | 8 %    | 13 %   |\n| BB+ to BB-          | 6 %    | 7 %    |\n| B+ to B-            | 13 %   | 11 %   |\n| CCC+ and below      | 3 %    | 2 %    |\n\nMovements in the impairment provision for trade and other receivables are shown in Note 21.\n\n## Financial instruments subject to offsetting, enforceable master netting arrangements and similar agreements\n\nThe following table shows the amounts recognized for financial assets and liabilities which are subject to offsetting arrangements on a gross basis, and the amounts offset in the balance sheet.\n\nAmounts which cannot be offset under IFRS, but which could be settled net under the terms of master netting agreements if certain conditions arise, and collateral received or pledged, are also presented in the table to show the total net exposure of the group.\n\n|                             | $ million                                                       | $ million       | $ million                                        | $ million                                        | $ million                                        | $ million   |\n|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------|\n|                             |                                                                 |                 | Related amounts not set off in the balance sheet | Related amounts not set off in the balance sheet | Related amounts not set off in the balance sheet |             |\n| At 31 December 2020         | Gross  amounts of  recognized  financial  assets  (liabilities) | Amounts set off | Net amounts presented on the balance sheet       | Master netting arrangements                      | Cash collateral (received) pledged               | Net amount  |\n| Derivative assets           | 14,765                                                          | (2,019)         | 12,746                                           | (2,075)                                          | (386)                                            | 10,285      |\n| Derivative liabilities      | (10,414)                                                        | 2,019           | (8,395)                                          | 2,075                                            | -

Financial instruments and financial risk factors - continued\n\n## (c) Liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk that suitable sources of funding for the group's business activities may not be available. The group's liquidity is managed centrally with operating units forecasting their cash and currency requirements to the central treasury function. Unless restricted by local regulations, generally subsidiaries pool their cash surpluses to the treasury function, which will then arrange to fund other subsidiaries' requirements, or invest any net surplus in the market or arrange for necessary external borrowings, while managing the group's overall net currency positions.\n\nThe group benefits from open credit provided by suppliers who generally sell on five to 60-day payment terms in accordance with industry norms. bp utilizes various arrangements in order to manage its working capital and reduce volatility in cash flow. This includes discounting of receivables and, in the supply and trading businesses, managing inventory, collateral and supplier payment terms within a maximum of 60 days.\n\nIt is normal practice in the oil and gas supply and trading business for customers and suppliers to utilise letter of credit (LC) facilities to mitigate credit and non-performance risk. Consequently, LCs facilitate active trading in a global market where credit and performance risk can be significant. In common with the industry, bp routinely provides LCs to some of its suppliers.\n\nThe group has committed LC facilities totalling $11,325 million (2019 $12,175 million), allowing LCs to be issued for a maximum 24-month duration. There were also uncommitted secured LC facilities in place at 31 December 2020 for $3,460 million (2019 $4,440 million), which are secured against inventories or receivables when utilized. The facilities are held with over 25 international banks. The uncommitted secured LC facilities can only be terminated by either party giving a stipulated termination notice to the other.\n\nIn certain circumstances, the supplier has the option to request accelerated payment from the LC provider in order to further reduce their exposure. bp's payments are made to the provider of the LC rather than the supplier according to the original contractual payment terms. At 31 December 2020, $5,250 million (2019 $4,755 million) of the group's trade payables subject to these arrangements were payable to LC providers, with no material exposure to any individual provider. If these facilities were not available, this could result in renegotiation of payment terms with suppliers such that settlement periods were shorter.\n\nStandard & Poor's Ratings long-term credit rating for bp is A- (negative outlook) and Moody's Investors Service rating is A1 (negative outlook) and the Fitch Ratings' long-term credit rating is A (stable).\n\nDuring 2020, $14 billion (2019 $8 billion) of long-term taxable bonds were issued with terms ranging from two to thirty years. In addition the group issued perpetual hybrid bonds with a US dollar equivalent value of $11.9 billion . Commercial paper is issued at competitive rates to meet short-term borrowing requirements as and when needed.\n\nAs a further liquidity measure, the group continues to maintain suitable levels of cash and cash equivalents, amounting to $31.1 billion at 31 December 2020 (2019 $22.5 billion), primarily invested with highly rated banks or money market funds and readily accessible at immediate and short notice. At 31 December 2020, the group had substantial amounts of undrawn borrowing facilities available, consisting of an undrawn committed $10.0 billion credit facility and $7.6 billion (2019 $7.6 billion) of standby facilities. On 1st March 2021, following an assessment of liquidity requirements, the group replaced these with new facility agreements, consisting of an undrawn committed $8.0 billion credit facility and $4.0 billion of standby facilities. The facilities are available for three and five years respectively at pre-agreed margins and are with 27 international banks, and borrowings under them would be at pre-agreed rates.\n\nFor further information on the group's sources and uses of cash see Liquidity and capital resources on page 306.\n\nThe group manages liquidity risk associated with derivative contracts, other than derivative hedging instruments, based on the expected maturities of both derivative assets and liabilities as indicated in Note 30. Management does not currently anticipate any cash flows, other than noted below, that could be of a significantly different amount or could occur earlier than the expected maturity analysis provided.\n\nThe table below shows the timing of cash outflows relating to finance debt, trade and other payables and accruals.

Financial instruments and financial risk factors - continued\n\nThe table below shows the timing of cash outflows for derivative financial instruments entered into for the purpose of managing interest rate and foreign currency exchange risk, whether or not hedge accounting is applied, based upon contractual payment dates. As part of actively managing the group's debt portfolio it is possible that cash flows in relation to associated derivatives could be accelerated from the profile provided. The amounts reflect the gross settlement amount where the pay leg of a derivative will be settled separately from the receive leg, as in the case of cross-currency swaps hedging non-US dollar finance debt or hybrid bonds. The swaps are with high investment-grade counterparties and therefore the settlement-day risk exposure is considered to be negligible. Not shown in the table are the gross settlement amounts (inflows) for the receive leg of derivatives that are settled separately from the pay leg, which amount to $33,704 million at 31 December 2020 (2019 $24,787 million) to be received on the same day as the related cash outflows. As a result of the termination of derivatives associated with the 19 March 2021 debt buy back (see Note 26 for further information) $1.8 billion of cash outflows that are presented in the table with maturities of 2-8 years and $1.9 billion equivalent of cash inflows on the receive legs have occurred within one year of the balance sheet date.\n\n| Cash outflows for derivative financial instruments at 31 December   | 2020   | $ million 2019   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|------------------|\n| Within one year                                                     | 2,384  | 1,678            |\n| 1 to 2 years                                                        | 1,976  | 2,384            |\n| 2 to 3 years                                                        | 2,017  | 2,838            |\n| 3 to 4 years                                                        | 3,074  | 2,906            |\n| 4 to 5 years                                                        | 2,582  | 3,321            |\n| 5 to 10 years                                                       | 15,263 | 10,633           |\n| Over 10 years                                                       | 4,483  | 2,224            |\n|                                                                     | 31,779 | 25,984           |\n\nFor further information on our derivative financial instruments, see Note 30.\n\n## 30. Derivative financial instruments\n\nIn the normal course of business the group enters into derivative financial instruments (derivatives) to manage its normal business exposures in relation to commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, including management of the balance between floating rate and fixed rate debt, consistent with risk management policies and objectives. An outline of the group's financial risks and the objectives and policies pursued in relation to those risks is set out in Note 29. Additionally, the group has a well-established entrepreneurial trading operation that is undertaken in conjunction with these activities using a similar range of contracts.\n\nFor information on significant estimates and judgements made in relation to the valuation of derivatives see Derivative financial instruments within Note 1.\n\nThe fair values of derivative financial instruments at 31 December are set out below.\n\nExchange traded derivatives are valued using closing prices provided by the exchange as at the balance sheet date. These derivatives are categorized within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Exchange traded derivatives are typically considered settled through the (normally daily) payment or receipt of variation margin.\n\nOver-the-counter (OTC) financial swaps and physical commodity sale and purchase contracts are generally valued using readily available information in the public markets and quotations provided by brokers and price index developers. These quotes are corroborated with market data and are categorized within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\n\nIn certain less liquid markets, or for longer-term contracts, forward prices are not as readily available. In these circumstances, OTC financial swaps and physical commodity sale and purchase contracts are valued using internally developed methodologies that consider historical relationships between various commodities, and that result in management's best estimate of fair value. These contracts are categorized within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.",

The contracts may be entered into for risk management purposes, to satisfy supply requirements or for entrepreneurial trading. Certain contracts are classified as held for trading, regardless of their original business objective, and are recognized at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in the income statement. Trading activities are undertaken by using a range of contract types in combination to create incremental gains by arbitraging prices between markets, locations and time periods. The net of these exposures is monitored using market value-at-risk techniques as described in Note 29.\n\nThe following tables show further information on the fair value of derivatives and other financial instruments held for trading purposes.\n\nDerivative assets held for trading have the following fair values and maturities.\n\n|                               | $ million 2020   | $ million 2020   | $ million 2020   | $ million 2020   | $ million 2020   | $ million 2020   | $ million 2020   |\n|-------------------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n|                               | Less than 1 year | 1-2 years        | 2-3 years        | 3-4 years        | 4-5 years        | Over 5 years     | Total            |\n| Currency derivatives          | 153              | 9                | 3                | 2                | 2                | 689              | 858              |\n| Oil price derivatives         | 1,159            | 197              | 90               | 63               | 7                | 3                | 1,519            |\n| Natural gas price derivatives | 1,210            | 731              | 596              | 525              | 476              | 2,868            | 6,406            |\n| Power price derivatives       | 425              | 223              | 161              | 107              | 76               | 266              | 1,258            |\n| Other derivatives             | -                | -                | 7                | -                | -                | -                | 7                |\n|                               | 2,947            | 1,160            | 857              | 697              | 561              | 3,826            | 10,048           |\n\n|                               | $ million 2019   | $ million 2019   | $ million 2019   | $ million 2019   | $ million 2019   | $ million 2019   | $ million 2019   |\n|-------------------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n|                               | Less than 1 year | 1-2 years        | 2-3 years        | 3-4 years        | 4-5 years        | Over 5 years     | Total            |\n| Currency derivatives          | 48               | 23               | 9                | 1                | -                | -                | 81               |\n| Oil price derivatives         | 1,619            | 114              | 76               | 53               | 45               | 11               | 1,918            |\n| Natural gas price derivatives | 1,889            | 824              | 615              | 489              | 433              | 2,319            | 6,569            |\n| Power price derivatives       | 556              | 269              | 146              | 94               | 67               | 174              | 1,306            |\n| Other derivatives             | 33               | -                | -                | 77               | -                | -                | 110              |\n|                               | 4,145            | 1,230            | 846              | 714              | 545              | 2,504            | 9,984            |",

Gains or losses arise on contracts entered into for risk management purposes, optimization activity and entrepreneurial trading. They also arise on certain contracts that are for normal procurement or sales activity for the group but that are required to be fair valued under accounting standards. These gains and losses are included within sales and other operating revenues in the income statement. Also included within this line item are gains and losses on inventory held for trading purposes. The total amount relating to all these items was a net gain of $2,808 million. This number does not include gains and losses on the change in value of contracts which are not recognized under IFRS such as transportation and storage contracts, but does include the associated financially settled contracts. The net amounts for actual gains and losses relating to these derivative contracts and all related items therefore differ significantly from the amounts disclosed above.\n\nThe group also enters into derivative contracts relating to foreign currency risk management activities including contracts that the group has entered into to manage the foreign currency exposure relating to the non-US dollar hybrid bonds to their respective first call periods. Gains and losses on these contracts are included within production and manufacturing expenses in the income statement. The change in the unrealized value of these contracts was a net gain of $829 million (2019 $160 million net gain and 2018 $351 million net loss), however where these gains and losses arise on derivatives hedging finance debt they are largely offset by opposing net foreign exchange differences on retranslation of the associated non-US dollar debt. The net amounts for actual gains and losses relating to these derivative contracts and all related items therefore differ significantly from the amounts disclosed above.\n\n## Cash flow hedges\n\n## (i) Foreign currency risk of highly probable forecast capital expenditure\n\nAt 31 December 2020, the group held currency forwards designated as hedging instruments in cash flow hedge relationships of highly probable forecast non-US dollar capital expenditure. Note 29 outlines the group's approach to foreign currency exchange risk management. When the highly probable forecast capital expenditure designated as a hedged item occurs, a non-financial asset is recognized and is presented within the fixed asset section of the balance sheet.\n\nThe group claims hedge accounting only for the spot value of the currency exposure in line with the strategy to fix the volatility in the spot exchange rate element. The fair value on the instrument attributable to forward points and foreign currency basis spreads is taken immediately to the income statement.\n\nThe group applies hedge accounting where there is an economic relationship between the hedged item and hedging instrument. The existence of an economic relationship is determined at inception and prospectively by comparing the critical terms of the hedging instrument and those of the hedged item. The group enters into hedging derivatives that match the currency and notional of the hedged items on a 1:1 hedge ratio basis. The hedge ratio is determined by comparing the notional amount of the derivative with the notional designated on the forecast transaction. The group determines the extent to which it hedges highly probable forecast capital expenditures on a project by project basis.\n\nThe group has identified the following sources of ineffectiveness, which are not expected to be material:\n\n- \u00b7 counterparty's credit risk, the group mitigates counterparty credit risk by entering into derivative transactions with high credit quality counterparties; and",

The latter impacts the discount factor used in the calculation of the hedge ineffectiveness. The group mitigates differences in timing between the derivatives and hedged items by applying a rolling strategy and by hedging currency pairs from stable economies (i.e. sterling/US dollar, Korean won/US dollar). The group's cash flow hedge designations are highly effective as the sources of ineffectiveness identified are expected to result in minimal hedge ineffectiveness.\n\nThe group has not designated any net positions as hedged items in cash flow hedges of foreign currency risk.\n\n## (ii) Commodity price risk of highly probable forecast sales\n\nDuring the period the group held Henry Hub NYMEX futures designated as hedging instruments in cash flow hedge relationships of certain highly probable forecast future sales. Henry Hub NYMEX futures are subject to daily settlement, where their fair value at the end of each day is required to be cash settled, such that the carrying amount of these hedging instruments within continuing hedge relationships is always zero at the end of each day.\n\nThe group is exposed to the variability in the gas price, but only applied hedge accounting to the risk of Henry Hub price movements for a percentage of future gas sales from its BPX Energy business.\n\nThe group applied hedge accounting in relation to these highly probable future sales where there was an economic relationship between the hedged item and hedging instrument. The existence of an economic relationship was determined at inception and prospectively by comparing the critical terms of the hedging instrument and those of the hedged item. The group entered into hedging derivatives that matched the notional amounts of the hedged items on a 1:1 hedge ratio basis. The hedge ratio was determined by comparing the notional amount of the derivative with the notional amount designated on the forecast transaction.\n\nThe hedge was highly effective due to the price index of the hedging instruments matching the price index of the hedged item. The group did not designate any net positions as hedged items in cash flow hedges of commodity price risk.\n\nThe tables below summarize the change in the fair value of hedging instruments and the hedged item used to calculate ineffectiveness in the period.\n\n|                                                                    | Change in fair  value of  hedging  instrument  used to  calculate  ineffectiveness   | Change in fair  value of  hedged item  used to  calculate  ineffectiveness   | Hedge  ineffectiveness  recognized in  profit or (loss)   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|\n| At 31 December 2020                                                |                                                                                      |                                                                              |                                                           |\n| Cash flow hedges                                                   |                                                                                      |                                                                              |                                                           |\n| Foreign exchange risk                                              |                                                                                      |                                                                              |                                                           |\n| Highly probable forecast capital expenditure                       | 4                                                                                    | (4)                                                                          | -

Note 29 outlines the group's approach to interest rate and foreign currency exchange risk management. The interest rate swaps are used to convert US dollar denominated fixed rate borrowings into floating rate debt. The cross-currency interest rate swaps are used to convert sterling, euro, Swiss franc, Canadian dollar and Norwegian krone denominated fixed rate borrowings into US dollar floating rate debt. The group manages all risks derived from debt issuance, such as credit risk, however, the group applies hedge accounting only to certain components of interest rate and foreign currency risk in order to minimize hedge ineffectiveness. The interest rate and foreign currency exposures are identified and hedged on an instrument-by-instrument basis. For interest rate exposures, the group designates as a fair value hedge the benchmark interest rate component only. This is an observable and reliably measurable component of interest rate risk.\n\nAll of the fair value hedge accounting relationships currently in place are directly affected by the interest rate benchmark reform which will replace interbank offered rates (IBORs) with alternative benchmark rates as they all manage interest rate risk. The Group is significantly exposed to benchmark interest rate components; predominantly USD LIBOR, GBP LIBOR, EURIBOR and CHF LIBOR. The nominal amounts of the applicable hedging instruments represent the extent of the risk exposure bp manages for financial derivatives designated in fair value hedge relationships that is directly affected by the interest rate benchmark reform. These are disclosed in the table below. Uncertainty around the method and timing of transition from Inter-bank Offered Rates (IBORs) to alternative risk-free rates (RfRs) may impact the assessment of whether hedge accounting can be applied to certain hedging relationships. However, the temporary reliefs provided by IFRS 9 allow bp to assume that in the event that significant uncertainty around the reform arises:\n\n- \u00b7 the interest rate benchmark component of fair value hedges only needs to be assessed as separately identifiable at initial designation; and\n- \u00b7 the interest rate benchmark is not altered for the purposes of assessing the economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument for fair value hedges.\n\nJudgement will be required to determine when the uncertainty arising from interest rate benchmark reform is no longer present and when the temporary reliefs no longer apply. However, at 31 December 2020 the reliefs apply and bp continues to monitor regulatory and market developments as it manages the contractual transition.\n\nFor foreign currency exposures, the group excludes from the designation the foreign currency basis spread component implicit in the cross-currency interest rate swaps. This is separately calculated at hedge designation, is recognized in other comprehensive income over the life of the hedge and amortized to the income statement on a straight-line basis, in accordance with the group's policy on costs of hedging.\n\nThe group applies hedge accounting where there is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument. The existence of an economic relationship is determined initially by comparing the critical terms of the hedging instrument and those of the hedged item and it is prospectively assessed using linear regression analysis. The group issues fixed rate debt and enters into interest rate and cross-currency interest rate swaps with critical terms that match those of the debt and on a 1:1 hedge ratio basis. The hedge ratio is determined by comparing the notional amount of the derivative with the notional amount of the debt. The hedge relationship is designated for the full term and notional value of the debt. Both the hedging instrument and the hedged item are expected to be held to maturity.\n\nThe group has identified the following sources of ineffectiveness, which are not expected to be material:\n\n- \u00b7 derivative counterparty's credit risk which is not offset by the hedged item. This risk is mitigated by entering into derivative transactions only with high credit quality counterparties; and\n- \u00b7 sensitivity to interest rate between the hedged item and the derivatives. This is driven by differences in payment frequencies between the instrument and the bond.\n\nThe tables below summarize the change in the fair value of hedging instruments and the hedged item used to calculate ineffectiveness in the period. The signage convention for changes in fair value presented in this table is consistent with that presented in Note 27.\n\n| At 31 December 2020                                     | Change in fair  value of hedging  instrument used  to calculate  ineffectiveness   | Change in fair  value of hedged  item used to  calculate  ineffectiveness   | Hedge  ineffectiveness  recognized in  profit or (loss)   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|\n| Fair value hedges                                       |                                                                                    |                                                                             |                                                           |\n| Interest rate risk on finance debt                      | (258)                                                                              | 258                                                                         | -                                                         |\n| Interest rate and foreign currency risk on finance debt | (2,743)                                                                            | 2,549                                                                       | 194                                                       |\n| At 31 December 2019                                     |                                                                                    |                                                                             |                                                           |\n| Fair value hedges                                       |                                                                                    |                                                                             |                                                           |\n| Interest rate risk on finance debt                      | (764)                                                                              | 737                                                                         | 27                                                        |\n| Interest rate and foreign currency risk on finance debt | (336)                                                                              | 286                                                                         | 50                                                        |",

        "page_content": "## 32. Capital and reserves - continued\n\n## Share capital\n\nThe balance on the share capital account represents the aggregate nominal value of all ordinary and preference shares in issue, including treasury shares.\n\n## Share premium account\n\nThe balance on the share premium account represents the amounts received in excess of the nominal value of the ordinary and preference shares.\n\n## Capital redemption reserve\n\nThe balance on the capital redemption reserve represents the aggregate nominal value of all the ordinary shares repurchased and cancelled.\n\n## Merger reserve\n\nThe balance on the merger reserve represents the fair value of the consideration given in excess of the nominal value of the ordinary shares issued in an acquisition made by the issue of shares.\n\n## Treasury shares\n\nTreasury shares represent bp shares repurchased and available for specific and limited purposes. For accounting purposes shares held in Employee Share Ownership Plans (ESOPs) and bp's US share plan administrator to meet the future requirements of the employee share-based payment plans are treated in the same manner as treasury shares and are, therefore, included in the financial statements as treasury shares. The ESOPs are funded by the group and have waived their rights to dividends in respect of such shares held for future awards. Until such time as the shares held by the ESOPs vest unconditionally to employees, the amount paid for those shares is shown as a reduction in shareholders' equity. Assets and liabilities of the ESOPs are recognized as assets and liabilities of the group.\n\n## Foreign currency translation reserve\n\nThe foreign currency translation reserve records exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign operations. Upon disposal of foreign operations, the related accumulated exchange differences are reclassified to the income statement.\n\n## Available-for-sale investments\n\nThis reserve recorded the changes in fair value of investments classified as available-for-sale under IAS 39 except for impairment losses, foreign exchange gains or losses, or changes arising from revised estimates of future cash flows. On adoption of IFRS 9 the balance in this reserve was transferred to the profit and loss account reserve. Under the new standard the group recognizes fair value gains and losses on these investments in profit or loss.\n\n## Cash flow hedges\n\nThis reserve records the portion of the gain or loss on a hedging instrument in a cash flow hedge that is determined to be an effective hedge. It includes $651 million relating to the acquisition of an 18.5%  interest in Rosneft in 2013 which will only be reclassified to the income statement if the investment in Rosneft is either sold or impaired. For further information on the accounting for cash flow hedges see Note 1 - Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities.\n\n## Costs of hedging\n\nThis reserve records the change in fair value of the foreign currency basis spread of financial instruments to which cost of hedge accounting has been applied. The accumulated amount relates to time-period related hedged items and is amortized to profit or loss over the term of the hedging relationship.\n\nPrior to the group's adoption of IFRS 9 changes in the fair value of such foreign currency basis spreads were recognized in profit or loss. On adoption of the new standard a transfer from the profit and loss account reserve to the costs of hedging reserve was made in order to reflect the opening reserves position for relevant hedging instruments existing on transition. For further information on the accounting for costs of hedging see Note 1 - Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities.\n\n## Profit and loss account\n\nThe balance held on this reserve is the accumulated retained profits of the group.\n\n## Non-controlling interests\n\nNon-controlling interests represent the equity in subsidiaries that is not attributable, directly or indirectly, to bp shareholders. Included within noncontrolling interests are perpetual subordinated hybrid bonds issued by BP Capital Markets PLC, a group subsidiary, on 17 June 2020 in euro, sterling and US dollars for a US dollar equivalent amount of $11.9 billion. The hybrid bonds include redemption options exercisable at the group's discretion from June 2025 to March 2030 (the first 'call date'), on specified dates thereafter, or in the event of specific circumstances (such as a change in IFRS or tax regime) as set out in the individual terms of each issue. Coupons are fixed for an initial period up to dates from September 2025 to June 2030 at rates of 3.25%  to 4.875%  and reset to rates determined by the contractual terms of each instrument on certain dates thereafter. The contractual terms of the hybrid bonds allow the group to defer coupon payments and the repayment of principal indefinitely, however their terms and conditions stipulate that any deferred payments must be made in the event of an announcement of an ordinary share or parity equity dividend distribution or certain share repurchases or redemptions. As the group has the unconditional right to avoid transferring cash or another financial asset in relation to these hybrid bonds, they are classified as equity instruments and reported within non-controlling interests in the consolidated financial statements.",

Contingent liabilities and legal proceedings\n\n## Contingent liabilities\n\nThere were contingent liabilities at 31 December 2020 in respect of guarantees and indemnities entered into as part of the ordinary course of the group's business. No material losses are likely to arise from such contingent liabilities. Further information on financial guarantees is included in Note 29.\n\nIn the normal course of the group's business, bp group entities are subject to legal and regulatory proceedings arising out of current and past operations, including matters related to commercial disputes, product liability, antitrust, commodities trading, premises-liability claims, consumer protection, general health, safety, climate change and environmental claims and allegations of exposures of third parties to toxic substances, such as lead pigment in paint, asbestos and other chemicals. The amounts claimed could be significant and could be material to the group's results of operations, financial position or liquidity. While it is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome in some cases, bp expects that the impact of current legal and regulatory proceedings on the group's results of operations, liquidity or financial position will not be material.\n\nThe group files tax returns in many jurisdictions across the world. Various tax authorities are currently examining these returns, which contain matters that could be subject to differing interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations. The resolution of tax positions through negotiations with relevant tax authorities, or through litigation, can take several years to complete and the amounts could be significant and could, in aggregate, be material to the group's results of operations, financial position or liquidity. While it is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome in some cases, bp does not expect there to be any material impact upon the group's results of operations, financial position or liquidity.",

        "page_content": "## 33. Contingent liabilities and legal proceedings - continued\n\nThe group is subject to numerous national and local health, safety and environmental laws and regulations concerning its products, operations and other activities. These laws and regulations may require the group to take future action to remediate the effects on the environment of prior disposal or release of chemicals or petroleum substances by the group or other parties. Such contingencies may exist for various sites including refineries, chemical plants, oil fields, commodities extraction sites, service stations, terminals and waste disposal sites. In addition, the group may have obligations relating to prior asset sales or closed facilities. The ultimate requirement for remediation and its costs are inherently difficult to estimate. However, the estimated cost of environmental obligations has been provided in these accounts in accordance with the group's accounting policies. While the amounts of future possible costs that are not provided for could be significant and material to the group's results of operations in the period in which they are recognized, it is not possible to estimate the amounts involved. bp does not expect these costs to have a material impact on the group's results of operations, financial position or liquidity.\n\nIf oil and natural gas production facilities and pipelines are sold to third parties and the subsequent owner is unable to meet their decommissioning obligations it is possible that, in certain circumstances, bp could be partially or wholly responsible for decommissioning. While the amounts associated with decommissioning provisions reverting to the group could be significant and could be material, bp is not currently aware of any such material cases that have a greater than remote chance of reverting to the group. In one current case in the US, the owner of facilities has filed for bankruptcy and submitted a proposed restructuring plan. It is considered possible that certain decommissioning costs associated with some of these facilities may in the future revert to bp in relation to assets previously disposed. No provision has been recognised and no reliable estimate of this potential exposure is available, however any amount which may revert is not expected to have a material impact on the group's financial position. Furthermore, as described in Provisions and contingencies within Note 1, decommissioning provisions associated with downstream facilities are not generally recognized as the potential obligations cannot be measured given their indeterminate settlement dates.\n\n## Contingent liabilities related to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill\n\nFor information on legal proceedings relating to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, see Legal proceedings below. Any further outstanding Deepwater Horizon related claims are not expected to have a material impact on the group's financial performance.\n\n## Legal proceedings\n\n## Proceedings relating to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill\n\n## Introduction\n\nBP Exploration & Production Inc. (BPXP) was lease operator of Mississippi Canyon, Block 252 in the Gulf of Mexico, where the semi-submersible rig Deepwater Horizon was deployed at the time of the 20 April 2010 explosion and fire and resulting oil spill (the Incident). Lawsuits and claims arising from the Incident were brought principally in US federal and state courts. The remaining proceedings arising from the Incident are discussed below.\n\n## Economic and Property Damages Settlement\n\nOn 22 January 2021, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana issued an order determining the completion of all claims processing operations of the court supervised settlement programme. That settlement programme had been established to administer claims pursuant to the Economic and Property Damages Settlement (EPD Settlement) which was entered into with the plaintiffs' steering committee (PSC) acting on behalf of individual and business plaintiffs in the multi-district litigation proceedings in 2012 to resolve certain economic and property damage claims. The Court also ordered that all future issues concerning EPD Settlement claims would be considered time barred under the settlement programme and that the claims administrator should proceed to complete post-closure administrative wind down activities.\n\n## Medical Benefits Class Action Settlement\n\nIn 2012 the Medical Benefits Class Action Settlement (Medical Settlement) was entered into with the PSC. It involves payments to qualifying class members based on a matrix for certain Specified Physical Conditions (SPCs), as well as a 21-year Periodic Medical Consultation Program (PMCP) for qualifying class members. As of 31 December 2020, 1 claim remained pending determination. In total, 27,603 claims (comprising 22,833 SPC claims and 4,770 PMCP claims) have been approved for compensation totalling approximately $67 million and 9,623 claims have been denied.\n\nThe Medical Settlement also includes provisions regarding class members pursuing claims for later-manifested physical conditions (LMPCs). In order to seek compensation from bp for an LMPC, class members must file a notice with the Medical Claims Administrator within 4 years after the date of first diagnosis of the LMPC. As of 31 December 2020, there were 612 pending lawsuits brought by class members claiming LMPCs.\n\n## Other civil complaints - economic loss\n\nNearly all economic loss and property damage claims from individuals and businesses that either opted out of the EPD Settlement and/or were excluded from that settlement have been settled or dismissed.\n\nThe claims of 10 US-resident private plaintiffs remain in the multi-district litigation proceedings in federal district court in New Orleans. Those claims have been scheduled for a process of discovery and dispositive motions which is expected to conclude around mid-2021.\n\n## Other civil complaints - personal injury\n\nThe vast majority of post-explosion clean-up, medical monitoring and personal injury claims from individuals that either opted out of the Medical Settlement and/or were excluded from that settlement have been dismissed.\n\nIn 2019, the federal district court in New Orleans determined in a series of proceedings that 923 plaintiffs had post-explosion clean-up, medical monitoring and personal injury claims that complied with the court's prior order to show cause why their claims should not be dismissed. As a result of several subsequent dismissals, approximately 881 plaintiffs' claims remained as of 31 December 2020.\n\nOn 23 February 2021, the district court issued a Case Management Order announcing its intent to sever the personal injury cases from the multidistrict litigation proceedings and staying the litigation of any punitive damages claims until plaintiffs can establish a right to compensatory damages.  The district court also stated that the order severing and re-allotting these cases is forthcoming. Most cases will remain in the federal district court in New Orleans and be re-allotted among the judges of that court.\n\n## Individual securities litigation\n\nIn October 2020, bp engaged with the plaintiffs in a mediation of all remaining multi-district litigation proceedings in federal district court in Houston. 28 such actions on behalf of 115 plaintiffs remained pending on 31 December 2020. The mediation resulted in settlements of all these cases and settlement agreements have now been executed with all plaintiffs.",

        "page_content": "## 33. Contingent liabilities and legal proceedings - continued\n\n## Canadian class actions\n\nFollowing various legal proceedings, a plaintiff seeking to assert claims under Canadian law against bp on behalf of a class of Canadian residents who allegedly suffered losses because of their purchase of bp ordinary shares and ADSs appealed the motion to dismiss the case in its entirety granted on 8 November 2019. On 20 January 2021, the Court of Appeal affirmed that dismissal.\n\n## Non-US government lawsuits\n\nOn 18 October 2012, before a Mexican Federal District Court located in Mexico City, a class action complaint was filed against BP America Production Company (BPAPC) and other bp subsidiaries. On 27 June 2018, bp answered the complaint by seeking dismissal on various grounds including that no oil reached Mexican waters or land and there was no economic or environmental harm in Mexico.  There has been no material development in these proceedings during 2020 and up to the date of publication of this BP Annual Report and Form 20-F 2020 in 2021.\n\nOn 3 December 2015 and 29 March 2016, Acciones Colectivas de Sinaloa (ACS) filed two class actions (which have since been consolidated) in a Mexican Federal District Court on behalf of several Mexican states against BPXP, BPAPC, and other purported bp subsidiaries. In these class actions, plaintiffs seek an order requiring the bp defendants to repair the damage to the Gulf of Mexico, to pay penalties, and to compensate plaintiffs for damage to property, to health and for economic loss. BPXP and BPAPC opposed class certification and sought dismissal, principally on the basis that no oil reached Mexican waters or land and there was no economic or environmental harm in Mexico. The court certified the class on 25 September 2019 and bp appealed that decision including by way of constitutional challenge (amparo). The amparo action was denied on 8 October 2020 and on 18 January 2021, bp's appeal of that ruling was also denied. Class notification procedures have not yet been finally determined.\n\nThese legal actions remain at a relatively early stage and while it is not possible to predict the outcome, bp believes that it has valid defences, and it intends to defend such actions vigorously.\n\n## Other legal proceedings\n\n## FERC and CFTC matters\n\nFollowing an investigation by the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) of several bp entities, the Administrative Law Judge of the FERC ruled on 13 August 2015 that bp manipulated the market by selling next-day, fixed price natural gas at Houston Ship Channel in 2008 in order to suppress the Gas Daily index and benefit its financial position. On 11 July 2016 the FERC issued an Order affirming the initial decision and directing bp to pay a civil penalty of $20.16 million and to disgorge $207,169 in unjust profits. On 10 August 2016, bp filed a request for rehearing with the FERC. On 17 December 2020, the FERC denied the rehearing request, sustaining the prior decision and ordering payment of the penalty and disgorgement amounts. bp has complied with the order but strongly disagrees with the FERC's decision and is pursuing an appeal to the US Court of Appeals.\n\n## Lead paint matters\n\nSince 1987, Atlantic Richfield Company (Atlantic Richfield), a subsidiary \u00ab of bp, has been named as a co-defendant in numerous lawsuits brought in the US alleging injury to persons and property caused by lead pigment in paint. The majority of the lawsuits have been abandoned or dismissed against Atlantic Richfield. Atlantic Richfield is named in these lawsuits as alleged successor to International Smelting and Refining and another company that manufactured lead pigment during the period 1920-1946. The plaintiffs include individuals and governmental entities. Several of the lawsuits purport to be class actions. The lawsuits seek various remedies including compensation to lead-poisoned children, cost to find and remove lead paint from buildings, medical monitoring and screening programmes, public warning and education of lead hazards, reimbursement of government healthcare costs and special education for lead-poisoned citizens and punitive damages. No lawsuit against Atlantic Richfield has been settled nor has Atlantic Richfield been subject to a final adverse judgment in any proceeding. The amounts claimed and, if such suits were successful, the costs of implementing the remedies sought in the various cases could be substantial. While it is not possible to predict the outcome of these legal actions, Atlantic Richfield believes that it has valid defences. It intends to defend such actions vigorously and believes that the incurrence of liability is remote. Consequently, bp believes that the impact of these lawsuits on the group's results, financial position or liquidity will not be material.\n\n## Climate change\n\nBP p.l.c., BP America Inc. and BP Products North America Inc. are co-defendants with other oil and gas companies in multiple lawsuits brought in various state and federal courts on behalf of various governmental and private parties.  The lawsuits generally assert claims under a variety of legal theories seeking to hold the defendant companies responsible for impacts allegedly caused by and/or relating to climate change and seek remedies including payment of money and other forms of equitable relief.  If such suits were successful, the cost of the remedies sought in the various cases could be substantial.  All of these lawsuits remain at relatively early stages and while it is not possible to predict the outcome of these legal actions, BP believes that it has valid defences, and it intends to defend such actions vigorously .\n\n## Louisiana Coastal restoration\n\nSix coastal parishes and the State of Louisiana have filed over 40 separate lawsuits in state courts in Louisiana against various oil and gas companies seeking damages for coastal erosion. bp entities are defendants in 17 of these cases. The lawsuits allege that the defendants' historical operations in oil fields within the Louisiana onshore coastal zone failed to comply with state permits and/or were conducted without the required coastal use permits. The plaintiffs seek unspecified statutory penalties and damages, including the costs of restoring coastal wetlands allegedly impacted by oil field operations.\n\nIn addition, four private landowners have filed separate claims in the state courts in Jefferson and Plaquemines Parishes of Louisiana for restoration damages related to alleged impacts to their marshlands associated with historic oil field operations. bp entities are defendants in two of these private landowner cases.\n\nAll of these lawsuits remain at relatively early stages and while it is not possible to predict the outcome of these legal actions, bp believes that it has valid defences, and it intends to defend such actions vigorously.",

In addition to the amounts shown in the table above, in 2018 $0.75 million of additional fees were paid to EY in respect of their audit for 2017. Auditor's remuneration is included in the income statement within distribution and administration expenses.\n\nTax services (in relation to income tax, indirect tax compliance, employee tax services and tax advisory services) were $nil in all periods presented.\n\nThe audit committee has established pre-approval policies and procedures for the engagement of Deloitte to render audit and certain assurance and other services. The audit fees payable to Deloitte were considered as part of the audit tender process in 2016 and challenged by the audit committee through comparison with the audit pricing proposals of the other bidding firms. Changes in audit fees subsequent to the audit tender, including matters relevant to the 2020 audit, have been reviewed and challenged by the Audit Committee, before being approved. Deloitte performed further assurance services that were not prohibited by regulatory or other professional requirements and were pre-approved by the Committee. Deloitte is engaged for these services when its expertise and experience of bp are important. Most of this work is of an audit-related or assurance nature.\n\nUnder SEC regulations, the remuneration of the auditor of $54 million (2019 $49 million and 2018 $42 million) is required to be presented as follows: audit $41 million (2019 $43 million and 2018 $35 million); other audit-related $11 million (2019 $4 million and 2018 $4 million); tax $nil (2019 $nil and 2018 $nil); and all other fees $2 million (2019 $2 million and 2018 $3 million).",

The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time.\n\n- (i) The area of the reservoir considered as proved includes:\n- (A) The area identified by drilling and limited by fluid contacts, if any; and\n- (B) Adjacent undrilled portions of the reservoir that can, with reasonable certainty, be judged to be continuous with it and to contain economically producible oil or gas on the basis of available geoscience and engineering data.\n- (ii) In the absence of data on fluid contacts, proved quantities in a reservoir are limited by the lowest known hydrocarbons (LKH) as seen in a well penetration unless geoscience, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establishes a lower contact with reasonable certainty.\n- (iii) Where direct observation from well penetrations has defined a highest known oil (HKO) elevation and the potential exists for an associated gas cap, proved oil reserves may be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir only if geoscience, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establish the higher contact with reasonable certainty.\n- (iv) Reserves which can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques (including, but not limited to, fluid injection) are included in the proved classification when:\n- (A) Successful testing by a pilot project in an area of the reservoir with properties no more favourable than in the reservoir as a whole, the operation of an installed programme in the reservoir or an analogous reservoir, or other evidence using reliable technology establishes the reasonable certainty of the engineering analysis on which the project or programme was based; and\n- (B) The project has been approved for development by all necessary parties and entities, including governmental entities.\n- (v) Existing economic conditions include prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined. The price shall be the average price during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, excluding escalations based upon future conditions.\n\n## Undeveloped oil and gas reserves\n\nUndeveloped oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.\n\n- (i) Reserves on undrilled acreage shall be limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, unless evidence using reliable technology exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater distances.\n- (ii) Undrilled locations can be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless the specific circumstances, justify a longer time.\n- (iii) Under no circumstances shall estimates for undeveloped reserves be attributable to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other improved recovery technique is contemplated, unless such techniques have been proved effective by actual projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir, or by other evidence using reliable technology establishing reasonable certainty.\n\n## Developed oil and gas reserves\n\nDeveloped oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that can be expected to be recovered:\n\n- (i) Through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well; and\n- (ii) Through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by means not involving a well.\n\nFor details on bp's proved reserves and production compliance and governance processes, see pages 312-317.",

This information is prepared in compliance with FASB Oil and Gas Disclosures requirements.\n\nFuture net cash flows have been prepared on the basis of certain assumptions which may or may not be realized. These include the timing of future production, the estimation of crude oil and natural gas reserves and the application of average crude oil and natural gas prices and exchange rates from the previous 12 months. Furthermore, both proved reserves estimates and production forecasts are subject to revision as further technical information becomes available and economic conditions change. bp cautions against relying on the information presented because of the highly arbitrary nature of the assumptions on which it is based and its lack of comparability with the historical cost information presented in the financial statements.\n\n|                                                               | $ million 2020   | $ million 2020   | $ million 2020   | $ million 2020        | $ million 2020   | $ million 2020   | $ million 2020   | $ million 2020   | $ million 2020   | $ million 2020   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|-----------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n|                                                               | Europe           | Europe           | North  America   | North  America        | South  America   | Africa           | Asia             | Asia             | Australasia      | Total            |\n|                                                               | UK               | Rest of Europe   | US               | Rest of North America |                  |                  | Russia           | Rest of Asia     |                  |                  |\n| At 31 December                                                |                  |                  |                  |                       |                  |                  |                  |                  |                  |                  |\n| Subsidiaries                                                  |                  |                  |                  |                       |                  |                  |                  |                  |                  |                  |\n| Future cash inflows a                                         | 13,900           | -

A 'gross' well or acre is one in which a whole or fractional working interest is owned, while the number of 'net' wells or acres is the sum of the whole or fractional working interests in gross wells or acres. Productive wells are producing wells and wells capable of production. Developed acreage is the acreage within the boundary of a field, on which development wells have been drilled, which could produce the reserves; while undeveloped acres are those on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities, whether or not such acres contain proved reserves.\n\n|                                                                    |                                                                    | Europe                                                             | Europe                                                             | North  America                                                     | North  America                                                     | South  America                                                     | Africa                                                             | Asia                                                               |                                                                    | Australasia                                                        | Total b                                                            |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                                    |                                                                    | UK                                                                 | Rest of Europe                                                     | US                                                                 | Rest of North America                                              |                                                                    |                                                                    | Russia a                                                           | Rest of Asia                                                       |                                                                    |                                                                    |\n| Number of productive wells at 31 December 2020                     | Number of productive wells at 31 December 2020                     | Number of productive wells at 31 December 2020                     | Number of productive wells at 31 December 2020                     | Number of productive wells at 31 December 2020                     | Number of productive wells at 31 December 2020                     | Number of productive wells at 31 December 2020                     | Number of productive wells at 31 December 2020                     | Number of productive wells at 31 December 2020                     | Number of productive wells at 31 December 2020                     | Number of productive wells at 31 December 2020                     | Number of productive wells at 31 December 2020                     |\n| Oil wells c                                                        | -

If one of the multiple completions in a well is an oil completion, the well is classified as an oil well.\n\n## Net oil and gas wells completed or abandoned\n\nThe following table shows the number of net productive and dry exploratory and development oil and natural gas wells completed or abandoned in the years indicated by the group and its equity-accounted entities. Productive wells include wells in which hydrocarbons were encountered and the drilling or completion of which, in the case of exploratory wells, has been suspended pending further drilling or evaluation. A dry well is one found to be incapable of producing hydrocarbons in sufficient quantities to justify completion.\n\n|             | Europe   | Europe         | North  America   | North  America        | South  America Africa   | South  America Africa   | Asia   | Asia         | Australasia Total   | Australasia Total   |\n|-------------|----------|----------------|------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|--------|--------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n|             | UK       | Rest of Europe | US               | Rest of North America |                         |                         | Russia | Rest of Asia |                     |                     |\n| 2020        |          |                |                  |                       |                         |                         |        |              |                     |                     |\n| Exploratory |          |                |                  |                       |                         |                         |        |              |                     |                     |\n| Productive  | -

Accordingly, these financial statements have been prepared in accordance with FRS 101 and in accordance with the provisions of the UK Companies Act 2006.\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\nThe financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and applicable UK accounting standards.\n\nThe financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for the assets.\n\nAs permitted by FRS 101, the company has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available in relation to:\n\n- (a) the requirements of IFRS 7 'Financial Instruments: Disclosures';\n- (b) the requirements of paragraphs 10(d), 10(f), 16, 38A, 38B, 38C, 38D, 40A, 40B, 40C, 40D, 111 and 134 to 136 of IAS 1 'Presentation of Financial Statements';\n- (c) the requirements in paragraph 38 of IAS 1 'Presentation of Financial Statements' to present comparative information in respect of paragraph 79(a)(iv) of IAS 1.\n- (d) the requirements of IAS 7 'Statement of Cash Flows';\n- (e) the requirements of paragraphs 30 and 31 of IAS 8 'Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors' in relation to standards not yet effective;\n- (f) the requirements of paragraphs 17 and 18A of IAS 24 'Related Party Disclosures';\n- (g) the requirements of IAS 24 'Related Party Disclosures' to disclose related party transactions entered into between two or more members of a group, provided that any subsidiary which is a party to the transaction is wholly owned by such a member;\n- (h)    the requirements of paragraphs 130(f)(ii), 130(f)(iii), 134(d) to 134(f) and 135(c)-135(e) of IAS 36, Impairment of Assets; and\n- (i) the requirement of the second sentence of paragraph 110 and paragraphs 113(a), 114,115, 118, 119(a) to (c), 120 to 127 and 129 of IFRS 15 'Revenue from Contracts with Customers'.\n\nWhere required, equivalent disclosures are given in the consolidated financial statements of BP p.l.c.\n\nAs permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the income statement of the company is not presented as part of these financial statements.\n\nThe financial statements are presented in US dollars and all values are rounded to the nearest million dollars ($ million), except where otherwise indicated.\n\nComparative employee cost information in note 13 has been restated due the correction of an accounting error. There is no impact on the company balance sheet or the statement of changes in equity as a result of this error.\n\n## Significant accounting policies: use of judgements, estimates and assumptions\n\nInherent in the application of many of the accounting policies used in preparing the financial statements is the need for management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Actual outcomes could differ from the estimates and assumptions used. The accounting judgements and estimates that have a significant impact on the results of the company are set out in boxed text below, and should be read in conjunction with the information provided in the Notes to the financial statements.\n\nThe areas requiring the most significant judgement and estimation in the preparation of the financial statements are the recoverability of investment carrying values and pensions. Judgements and estimates, not all of which are significant, made in assessing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and climate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy on the financial statements are also set out in boxed text below.  Where an estimate has a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year this is specifically noted within the boxed text.\n\n## Judgements and estimates made in assessing the impact of climate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy\n\nClimate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy were considered in preparing the financial statements. These may have significant impacts on the currently reported amounts of the company's assets and liabilities discussed below.\n\n## Impairment of investments\n\nThe energy transition is likely to impact the future prices of commodities such as oil and natural gas which in turn may affect the recoverable amount of property, plant and equipment, and goodwill in the oil and gas industry. Management's best estimate oil and natural gas price assumptions for value-in-use impairment testing were revised downwards during 2020 and the period covered extended to 2050. The revised assumptions sit within the range of external forecasts considered by management and are broadly in line with a range of transition paths consistent with the goals of the Paris climate change agreement. Impairments were recognized during 2020 on certain investments where the subsidiary company holds Upstream oil and gas properties, as a result of the lower price assumptions. See note 2 for further information.\n\nThe energy transition may also affect the future development or viability of exploration prospects. The lower price assumptions and work to develop bp's new strategy resulted in a review of the recoverability of exploration and intangible assets during 2020. Certain intangible assets were subsequently written-off, which has resulted in the company recognizing impairments against investments in subsidiary companies holding these assets.\n\nThe parent company financial statements of BP p.l.c. on pages 259-300 do not form part of bp's Annual Report on Form 20-F as filed with the SEC.",

        "page_content": "## 1. Significant accounting policies, judgements, estimates and assumptions - continued\n\n## Judgements and estimates made in assessing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the economic environment\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the following areas involving judgement and estimates were identified as most relevant with regards to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and current economic environment.\n\n## Going concern\n\nLiquidity and financing is managed within bp under pooled group-wide arrangements which include the company. As part of assuring the going concern basis of preparation for the company, the ability and intent of the bp group to support the company has been taken into consideration. The most recent bp group financial statements (see pages 129 to 230) continue to be prepared on a going concern basis. Forecast liquidity has been assessed at a group level under a number of scenarios and a reverse stress test performed to support the group's going concern assertion. In addition, group management of bp have confirmed that the existing intra-group funding and liquidity arrangements as currently constituted are expected to continue for the foreseeable future, being no less than twelve months from the approval of these financial statements. No material uncertainties over going concern or significant judgements or estimates in the assessment were identified. Accordingly, the company will be able to draw on support from the bp group for the foreseeable future and these financial statements have therefore been prepared on the going concern basis.\n\n## Pensions\n\nThe volatility in the financial markets during 2020 impacted the assumptions used for determining the fair value of plan assets and the present value of defined benefit obligations in the company's defined benefit pension plans. See significant estimate: pensions and Note 4 for further information.\n\n## Investments\n\nInvestments in subsidiaries are recorded at cost. The company assesses investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If any such indication of impairment exists, the company makes an estimate of its recoverable amount. Where the carrying amount of an investment exceeds its recoverable amount, the investment is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. Where these circumstances have reversed, the impairment previously made is reversed to the extent of the original cost of the investment.\n\n## Significant judgements and estimates: recoverability of asset carrying values\n\nDetermination as to whether, and by how much, an asset, CGU, or investment holding company chain (defined as each direct subsidiary and its own investments), is impaired involves management estimates on highly uncertain matters such as the effects of inflation and deflation on operating expenses, discount rates, capital expenditure, production profiles, reserves and resources, and future commodity prices, including the outlook for global or regional market supply-and-demand conditions for crude oil, natural gas and refined products. Alternative groupings of assets or CGUs may result in a different outcome from impairment testing.\n\nThe recoverable amount of an asset is the higher of its value in use and its fair value less costs of disposal. Fair value less costs of disposal may be determined based on expected sales proceeds or similar recent market transaction data. Details of impairment charges recognized in the profit and loss account and the carrying amounts of investments are shown in Note 2. The estimates for assumptions made in impairment tests in 2020 relating to discount rates and oil and gas properties are discussed below. Changes in the economic environment or other facts and circumstances may necessitate revisions to these assumptions and could result in a material change to the carrying values of the group's assets within the next financial year.\n\n## Discount rates\n\nFor discounted cash flow calculations, future cash flows are adjusted for risks specific to the CGU. Value-in-use calculations are typically discounted using a pre-tax discount rate based upon the cost of funding the group derived from an established model, adjusted to a pre-tax basis and incorporating a market participant capital structure and country risk premiums. Fair value less costs of disposal discounted cash flow calculations use the post-tax discount rate. The discount rates applied in impairment tests are reassessed each year and in 2020, the pre-tax discount rate typically ranged from 7% to 15% (2019 7% to 13%) depending on the risk premium and applicable tax rate in the geographic location of the CGU.\n\n## Oil and natural gas properties\n\nFor Upstream oil and natural gas properties in subsidiaries, expected future cash flows are estimated using management's best estimate of future oil and natural gas prices, and production and reserves volumes. The estimated future level of production in all impairment tests is based on assumptions about future commodity prices, production and development costs, field decline rates, current fiscal regimes and other factors. A change in the discount rate, reserves, resources or the oil and gas price assumptions in the next financial year may result in a recoverable amount of one or more of these assets above or below the current carrying amount and therefore there is a risk of impairment reversals or charges in that period. Management consider that reasonably possible changes in the discount rate or forecast revenue, arising from a change in oil and natural gas prices and/or production could result in a material change in their carrying amounts within the next financial year.\n\n## Oil and natural gas prices\n\nThe price assumptions used for value in use impairment testing are based on those used for investment appraisal. The investment appraisal price assumptions are recommended by the senior vice president economic & energy insights after considering a range of external prices, and supply and demand forecasts under various energy transition scenarios. They are reviewed and approved by management. As a result of the current uncertainty over the pace of transition to lower-carbon supply and demand and the social, political and environmental actions that will be taken to meet the goals of the Paris climate change agreement, the forecasts and scenarios considered include those where those goals are met as well as those where they are not met.\n\nbp sees the prospect of an enduring impact on the global economy as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the potential for weaker demand for energy for a sustained period. bp's management also expects that the aftermath of the pandemic will accelerate the pace of transition to a lower carbon economy and energy system as countries seek to 'build back better' so that their economies will be more resilient in the future. As a result of all the above, bp revised its price assumptions for value-in-use impairment testing, lowering them compared to those used in 2019 and extending the period covered to 2050. A summary of the group's revised price assumptions, in real 2020 terms, is provided below. The assumptions represent management's best estimate of future prices, which sit within the range of external forecasts considered as appropriate for the purpose. They are considered by bp to be broadly in line with a range of transition paths consistent with the Paris climate goals. However, they do not correspond to any specific Paris-consistent scenario. An inflation rate of 2% (2019 2%) is applied to determine the price assumptions in nominal terms.\n\nThe parent company financial statements of BP p.l.c. on pages 259-300 do not form part of bp's Annual Report on Form 20-F as filed with the SEC.",

See Note 2 for further information. The majority of reserves and resources that support the carrying value of the company's subsidiaries holding oil and gas properties are expected to be produced over the next 10 years.\n\n## Oil and natural gas reserves\n\nIn addition to oil and natural gas prices, significant technical and commercial assessments are required to estimate oil and natural gas reserves held by the company's subsidiaries. Reserves estimates are regularly reviewed and updated. Factors such as the availability of geological and engineering data, reservoir performance data, acquisition and divestment activity and drilling of new wells all impact on the determination of estimates of oil and natural gas reserves. bp bases its reserves estimates on the requirement of reasonable certainty with rigorous technical and commercial assessments based on conventional industry practice and regulatory requirements.\n\nReserves assumptions used for value-in-use tests in the company's subsidiaries reflect the reserves and resources that management currently intend to develop. The recoverable amount of oil and gas properties is determined using a combination of inputs including reserves, resources and production volumes. Risk factors may be applied to reserves and resources which do not meet the criteria to be treated as proved or probable.\n\n## Foreign currency translation\n\nThe functional and presentation currency of the financial statements is US dollars. Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency by applying the spot exchange rate on the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated into the functional currency at the spot exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Any resulting exchange differences are included in the income statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities, other than those measured at fair value, are not retranslated subsequent to initial recognition.\n\nExchange adjustments arising when the opening net assets and the profits for the year retained by a non-US dollar functional currency branch are translated into US dollars are recognized in a separate component of equity and reported in other comprehensive income. Income statement transactions are translated into US dollars using the average exchange rate for the reporting period.\n\n## Financial guarantees\n\nThe company enters into financial guarantee contracts with its subsidiaries. At the inception of a financial guarantee contract, a liability is recognized initially at fair value and then subsequently measured at the higher of the contract's estimated expected credit loss and the amount initially recognized less, where appropriate, cumulative amortization.\n\n## Share-based payments\n\n## Equity-settled transactions\n\nThe cost of equity-settled transactions with employees of the company and other members of the group is measured by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments on the date on which they are granted and is recognized as an expense over the vesting period, which ends on the date on which the employees become fully entitled to the award. A corresponding credit is recognized within equity. Fair value is determined by using an appropriate, widely used, valuation model. In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any vesting conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of the company (market conditions). Non-vesting conditions, such as the condition that employees contribute to a savings-related plan, are taken into account in the grant-date fair value, and failure to meet a non-vesting condition, where this is within the control of the employee, is treated as a cancellation and any remaining unrecognized cost is expensed.\n\nFor other equity-settled share-based payment transactions, the goods or services received and the corresponding increase in equity are measured at the fair value of the goods or services received, unless their fair value cannot be reliably estimated. If the fair value of the goods and services received cannot be reliably estimated, the transaction is measured by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted.\n\n## Cash-settled transactions\n\nThe cost of cash-settled transactions is recognized as an expense over the vesting period, measured by reference to the fair value of the corresponding liability which is recognized on the balance sheet. The liability is remeasured at fair value at each balance sheet date until settlement, with changes in fair value recognized in the income statement.\n\n## Pensions\n\nThe defined benefit pension plans are plans that share risks between entities under common control. In each instance BP p.l.c. is the principal employer and carries the whole plan surplus or deficit on its balance sheet. The cost of providing benefits under the company's defined benefit plans is determined separately for each plan using the projected unit credit method, which attributes entitlement to benefits to the current period to determine current service cost and to the current and prior periods to determine the present value of the defined benefit obligation. Past service costs, resulting from either a plan amendment or a curtailment (a reduction in future obligations as a result of a material reduction in the plan membership), are recognized immediately when the company becomes committed to a change.\n\nNet interest expense relating to pensions, which is recognized in the income statement, represents the net change in present value of plan obligations and the value of plan assets resulting from the passage of time, and is determined by applying the discount rate to the present value of the benefit obligation at the start of the year, and to the fair value of plan assets at the start of the year, taking into account expected changes in the obligation or plan assets during the year.",

        "page_content": "## 1. Significant accounting policies, judgements, estimates and assumptions - continued\n\nRemeasurements of the defined benefit liability and asset, comprising actuarial gains and losses, and the return on plan assets (excluding amounts included in net interest described above) are recognized within other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur and are not subsequently reclassified to profit and loss.\n\nThe defined benefit pension plan surplus or deficit recognized on the balance sheet for each plan comprises the difference between the present value of the defined benefit obligation (using a discount rate based on high quality corporate bonds) and the fair value of plan assets out of which the obligations are to be settled directly. Fair value is based on market price information and, in the case of quoted securities, is the published bid price. Defined benefit pension plan surpluses are only recognized to the extent they are recoverable, typically by way of refund.\n\nContributions to defined contribution plans are recognized in the income statement in the period in which they become payable.\n\n## Significant estimate: pensions\n\nAccounting for defined benefit pensions involves making significant estimates when measuring the company's pension plan surpluses and deficits. These estimates require assumptions to be made about many uncertainties.\n\nPension assumptions are reviewed by management at the end of each year. These assumptions are used to determine the projected benefit obligation at the year end and hence the surpluses and deficits recorded on the company's balance sheet, and pension expense for the following year. The assumptions used are provided in Note 4.\n\nThe assumptions that are the most significant to the amounts reported are the discount rate, inflation rate, salary growth and mortality levels. Assumptions about these variables are based on the environment in each country. The assumptions used vary from year to year, with resultant effects on future net income and net assets. Changes to some of these assumptions, in particular the discount rate and inflation rate, could result in material changes to the carrying amounts of the company's pension obligations within the next financial year for the UK plan. Any differences between these assumptions and the actual outcome will also affect future net income and net assets.\n\nThe values ascribed to these assumptions and a sensitivity analysis of the impact of changes in the assumptions on the benefit expense and obligation used are provided in Note 4.\n\n## Income taxes\n\nIncome tax expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax.\n\nIncome tax is recognized in the income statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case the related tax is recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.\n\nCurrent tax is based on the taxable profit for the period. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it is determined in accordance with the rules established by the applicable taxation authorities. It therefore excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other periods as well as items that are never taxable or deductible. The company's liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.\n\nDeferred tax is provided, using the liability method, on temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes. Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences.\n\nDeferred tax assets are only recognized to the extent that it is probable that they will be realized in the future.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted. See Note 6 for further details.\n\n## Financial assets\n\nFinancial assets are recognized initially at fair value, normally being the transaction price. In the case of financial assets not at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs are also included. The subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on their classification, as set out below. The company derecognizes financial assets when the contractual rights to the cash flows expire or the rights to receive cash flows have been transferred to a third party along with substantially all of the risks and rewards or control of the asset.This includes the derecognition of receivables for which discounting arrangements are entered into.\n\n## Financial assets measured at amortized cost\n\nFinancial assets are classified as measured at amortized cost when they are held in a business model the objective of which is to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest. Such assets are carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method if the time value of money is significant. Gains and losses are recognized in profit or loss when the assets are derecognized or impaired and when interest is recognized using the effective interest method. This category of financial assets includes trade and other receivables.\n\n## Cash equivalents\n\nCash equivalents are short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash, are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value and generally have a maturity of three months or less from the date of acquisition. Cash equivalents are classified as financial assets measured at amortized cost.\n\n## Financial liabilities\n\nAll financial liabilities held by the company are classified as financial liabilities measured at amortized cost. Financial liabilities include other payables, accruals, and finance debt. The company determines the classification of its financial liabilities at initial recognition.\n\n## Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost\n\nAll financial liabilities are initially recognized at fair value, net of directly attributable transaction costs. For interest-bearing loans and borrowings this is typically equivalent to the fair value of the proceeds received, net of issue costs associated with the borrowing.\n\nAfter initial recognition, financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any discount or premium on settlement. Gains and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or cancellation of liabilities are recognized in interest and other income and finance costs respectively.\n\nThe parent company financial statements of BP p.l.c. on pages 259-300 do not form part of bp's Annual Report on Form 20-F as filed with the SEC.",

This is identified by IAS 36 Impairment of Assets as an indicator that assets may be impaired.\n\nManagement's best estimate oil and natural gas price assumptions for value-in-use impairment testing were revised downwards during 2020 and the period covered extended to 2050. Management also undertook a re-assessment of expectations to extract value from certain exploration prospects as a result of a review of the group's long-term strategic plan. As a result, management performed a review of the carrying value of the company's major investments to identify potential impairment triggers, in line with the requirements of IAS 36 Impairment of Assets. Potential indicators of impairment were identified in those subsidiaries which hold, or whose own investments hold, significant Upstream assets, requiring further tests to be performed. The cash generating units assessed were considered to be each investment holding company chain (defined as each direct subsidiary and its own investments), as this is judged to be the smallest identifiable group of assets from the company's perspective that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. Further tests were performed on BP International Ltd (BPI), BP Holdings North America Ltd (BPHNA) and BP Holdings Canada Ltd.\n\nA recoverable amount for each investment company holding chain was calculated based on the value in use cash flows from Upstream and Downstream goodwill impairment calculations, combined with additional sources of uplift in value identified. The value in use tests used the present value of pre-tax cash flows discounted using a pre-tax rate which varies depending on the country of operation of the underlying assets.\n\n## Upstream\n\nFor Upstream assets held by the company's subsidiaries, the value in use is based on the cash flows expected to be generated by the projected oil or natural gas production profiles up to the expected dates of cessation of production of each producing field, based on current estimates of reserves and resources, appropriately risked.\n\nAs the production profile and related cash flows can be estimated from bp's past experience, management believes that the cash flows generated over the estimated life of field is the appropriate basis upon which to assess assets for impairment. The estimated date of cessation of production depends on the interaction of a number of variables, such as the recoverable quantities of hydrocarbons, the production profile of the hydrocarbons, the cost of the development of the infrastructure necessary to recover the hydrocarbons, production costs, the contractual duration of the production concession and the selling price of the hydrocarbons produced. As each producing field has specific reservoir characteristics and economic circumstances, the cash flows of each field is computed using appropriate individual economic models and key assumptions agreed by bp management.\n\nEstimated production volumes and cash flows up to the date of cessation of production on a field-by-field basis, including operating and capital expenditure, are derived from the business segment plan. The production profiles used are consistent with the reserve and resource volumes approved as part of bp's centrally controlled process for the estimation of proved and probable reserves and total resources.\n\nThe key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculation are oil and natural gas prices, production volumes and the discount rate. Oil and gas price assumptions and discount rate assumptions used were as disclosed in Note 1.\n\nDue to economic developments, regulatory change and emissions reduction activity arising from climate concern and other factors, future commodity prices and other assumptions may differ from the forecasts used in the calculations.\n\nThe parent company financial statements of BP p.l.c. on pages 259-300 do not form part of bp's Annual Report on Form 20-F as filed with the SEC.",

Investments  - continued\n\nThe Upstream impairment review on BPHNA assets calculated that a 10% price increase would add $1,780 million to the value of the assets, while a 10% price reduction would result in a $2,728 million reduction. A 1% increase in discount rate would likely generate a reduction in the value of assets of $796 million, while a 1% reduction in the rate would have increased the value by $1,151 million.\n\nThe Upstream impairment review on BPI assets calculated that a 10% price increase would add $2,032 million to the value of the assets, while a 10% price reduction would result in a $3,741 million reduction. A 1% increase in discount rate would likely generate a reduction in the value of assets of $1,467 million, while a 1% reduction in the rate would have increased the value by $1,365 million.\n\nThe Upstream impairment review on BP Holdings Canada assets calculated that a 10% price increase would add $574 million to the value of the assets, while a 10% price reduction would result in a $574 million reduction. A 1% increase in discount rate would likely generate a reduction in the value of assets of $178 million, while a 1% reduction in the rate would have increased the value by $204 million.\n\nThese price sensitivity analyses do not, however, represent management's best estimate of any impairment charges or reversals that might be recognized as they do not fully incorporate consequential changes that may arise, such as changes in costs and business plans and phasing of development. For example, costs across the industry are more likely to decrease as oil and natural gas prices fall. The above sensitivity analyses therefore do not reflect a linear relationship between revenue and value that can be extrapolated. The interdependency of these inputs and risk factors plus the diverse characteristics of Upstream oil and gas properties limits the practicability of estimating the probability or extent to which the overall recoverable amount is impacted by changes to the price assumptions or production volumes.\n\n## Downstream\n\nRecoverable amounts for BPHNA also included the value of key Downstream assets held by the refinery, midstream and retail businesses. For the Downstream, cash flows for each cash-generating unit are derived from the business segment plans, which cover a period of up to five years. To determine the value in use for each of the cash-generating units, cash flows for a period of 10 years are discounted at an 8% pre-tax rate and aggregated with a terminal value.\n\nDiscount rates are a key assumption in the value-in-use calculations for the downstream businesses. A 1% increase in discount rate would likely generate a reduction in the value of assets of $2,200 million, while a 1% reduction in the rate would have increased the value by $2,200 million.\n\n## Other\n\nThe valuation of BPI also included the Upstream activity of the company's equity-accounted investment in Rosneft.\n\nThe BPI and BPHNA investment holding chains include the bp group's Oil and Gas trading function. These have been included in the valuation based on a multiple of underlying replacement cost profit.\n\n## Conclusions for Investment holding company chains\n\nAs a result of this review, the company has recognized total impairment charges of $5,710 million (2019 $nil) against its investments. Impairments were calculated on a value in use basis, applying discount rates of 8% to investments in North America and a weighted average rate of 11% overall. Charges of $2,565 million related to Upstream investments in Canada held through BP Holdings Canada Ltd. Impairments of $2,638 million were recognized against the BPHNA investment holding chain and $507 million against the BPI investment holding chain.\n\nThe residual value of the investment holding chains which have recognized impairment charges during the year was $138,688 m illion .\n\nThe more important subsidiaries of the company at 31 December 2020 and the percentage holding of ordinary share capital (to the nearest whole number) are set out below.

        "page_content": "## 4. Pensions\n\nThe primary pension arrangement is a funded final salary pension plan in the UK under which retired employees draw the majority of their benefit as an annuity. This pension plan is governed by a corporate trustee whose board is composed of four member-nominated directors, four company-nominated directors, an independent director, and an independent chairman nominated by the company. The trustee board is required by law to act in the best interests of the plan participants and is responsible for setting certain policies, such as investment policies of the plan. The plan is closed to new joiners and is currently under consultation for closure to future accrual. As at 31 December 2020, it remains open to ongoing accrual for current members. New joiners are eligible for membership of a defined contribution plan.\n\nThe level of contributions to funded defined benefit plans is the amount needed to provide adequate funds to meet pension obligations as they fall due. During 2020 the aggregate level of contributions was $189 million (2019 $236 million). The aggregate level of contributions in 2021 is expected to be approximately $180 million, and includes contributions we expect to be required to make by law or under contractual agreements, as well as an allowance for discretionary funding.\n\nFor the primary UK plan there is a funding agreement between the company and the trustee. On an annual basis a schedule of contributions is agreed covering the next five years. Contractually committed funding amounted to $1,014 million at 31 December 2020, all of which relates to future service. The surplus relating to the primary UK pension plan is recognized on the balance sheet on the basis that the company is entitled to a refund of any remaining assets once all members have left the plan.\n\nThe obligation and cost of providing the pension benefits is assessed annually using the projected unit credit method. The date of the most recent actuarial review was 31 December 2020. The principal plans are subject to a formal actuarial valuation every three years in the UK. The most recent formal actuarial valuation of the main pension plan was as at 31 December 2017 and a valuation as at 31 December 2020 is currently under way.\n\nThe material financial assumptions used for estimating the benefit obligations of the plans are set out below. The assumptions are reviewed by management at the end of each year and are used to evaluate accrued pension benefits at 31 December and pension expense for the following year.\n\n| Financial assumptions used to determine benefit obligation   | %    | %    |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|------|------|\n|                                                              | 2020 | 2019 |\n| Discount rate for pension plan liabilities                   | 1.4  | 2.1  |\n| Rate of increase in salaries                                 | 3.6  | 3.4  |\n| Rate of increase for pensions in payment                     | 2.8  | 2.7  |\n| Rate of increase in deferred pensions                        | 2.8  | 2.7  |\n| Inflation for pension plan liabilities                       | 2.9  | 2.7  |\n| Financial assumptions used to determine benefit expense      |      | %    |\n|                                                              | 2020 | 2019 |\n| Discount rate for pension plan service costs                 | 2.1  | 3.0  |\n| Discount rate for pension plan other finance expense         | 2.1  | 2.9  |\n| Inflation for pension plan service costs                     | 2.6  | 3.1  |\n\nThe discount rate assumption is based on third-party AA corporate bond indices and we use yields that reflect the maturity profile of the expected benefit payments. The inflation rate assumption is based on the difference between the yields on index-linked and fixed-interest long-term government bonds. The inflation assumption is used to determine the rate of increase for pensions in payment and the rate of increase in deferred pensions.\n\nThe assumption for the rate of increase in salaries is based on our inflation assumption plus an allowance for expected long-term real salary growth. This comprises of an allowance for promotion-related salary growth of 0.7% .\n\nIn addition to the financial assumptions, we regularly review the demographic and mortality assumptions. The mortality assumptions reflect best practice in the UK and have been chosen with regard to the latest available published tables adjusted to reflect the experience of the plans and an extrapolation of past longevity improvements into the future. For the main pension plan the mortality assumptions are as follows:\n\n| Mortality assumptions                                    |   Years |   Years |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n|                                                          |  2020   |  2019   |\n| Life expectancy at age 60 for a male currently aged 60   |    26.9 |    27.3 |\n| Life expectancy at age 60 for a male currently aged 40   |    28.4 |    28.9 |\n| Life expectancy at age 60 for a female currently aged 60 |    28.8 |    28.7 |\n| Life expectancy at age 60 for a female currently aged 40 |    30.4 |    30.5 |\n\nThe assets of the primary plan are held in a trust, the primary objective of which is to accumulate pools of assets sufficient to meet the obligations of the plan. The assets of the trusts are invested in a manner consistent with fiduciary obligations and principles that reflect current practices in portfolio management.\n\nA proportion of the assets are held in equities, owing to a higher expected level of return over the long term of such assets with an acceptable level of risk. In order to provide reasonable assurance that no single security or type of security has an unwarranted impact on the total portfolio, the investment portfolios are highly diversified.\n\nThe trustee's long-term investment objective for the primary UK plan as it matures is to invest in assets whose value changes in the same way as the plan liabilities, in order to reduce the level of funding risk. To move towards this objective, the UK plan uses a liability driven investment (LDI) approach for part of the portfolio, investing primarily in government bonds to achieve this matching effect for the most significant plan liability assumptions of interest rate and inflation rate. This is partly funded by short-term sale and repurchase agreements, whereby the plan borrows money using existing bonds as security and which will be bought back at a specified price at an agreed future date. The funds raised are used to invest in further bonds to increase the proportion of assets which match the plan liabilities. The borrowings are shown separately in the analysis of pension plan assets in the table below.\n\nThe parent company financial statements of BP p.l.c. on pages 259-300 do not form part of bp's Annual Report on Form 20-F as filed with the SEC.",

Also included in current amounts payable is an interest-bearing payable of $5,033 million (2019 $5,031 million) with BP Finance plc. On 30 April 2020 the facility was renewed for 10 years until 30 April 2030 with interest being charged based on a 3-month USD LIBOR rate minus 0.14%. Though due in 2030, the loan is repayable to BP Finance plc at one business days notice. Non-current amounts payable to subsidiaries includes an interest-bearing payable of $27,100 million (2019 $27,100 million) with BP International Limited, with interest being charged based on a 3-month USD LIBOR rate plus 65 basis points and a maturity date of May 2023.\n\nCurrent liabilities of $27,933m are payable to wholly owned subsidiaries of the company within the bp group. As such, the company has control over whether these balances can be called in by the counterparties. Though the $5,033 million loan from BP Finance plc can be called at one business days notice, this loan is recorded as a non-current receivable in the financial statements of BP Finance plc, since the counterparty has no intent to call the loan at short notice. The balance of $4,236 million payable to BP International Ltd is due in December 2021, though it is the intent of management to extend this amount into a longer term loan. The company also has current liabilities of $18,652 million on Internal Funding Accounts (IFAs) payable to BP International Ltd. Whilst IFA credit balances are legally repayable on demand, in practice they have no termination date. These balances  form a key part of the bp group's liquidity and funding arrangements under its centralised treasury funding model. The bp group regularly looks to optimize its funding position, as part of which management will consider whether any part of these IFA balances should be converted into longer term loans, or maintained as current payables.\n\nThe maturity profile of the financial liabilities included in the balance sheet at 31 December is shown in the table below. These amounts are included within payables.\n\n|                   | 2020   | $ million 2019   |\n|-------------------|--------|------------------|\n| Due within        |        |                  |\n| 1 to 2 years      | 30     | 48               |\n| 2 to 5 years      | 27,259 | 31,499           |\n| More than 5 years | 795    | 380              |\n|                   | 28,084 | 31,927           |",

On a poll, shareholders present in person or by proxy have two votes for every \u00a35 in nominal amount of the first and second preference shares held and one vote for every ordinary share held. On a show-of-hands vote on other resolutions (procedural matters) at a general meeting, shareholders present in person or by proxy have one vote each.\n\nIn the event of the winding-up of the company, preference shareholders would be entitled to a sum equal to the capital paid up on the preference shares, plus an amount in respect of accrued and unpaid dividends and a premium equal to the higher of (i) 10%  of the capital paid up on the preference shares and (ii) the excess of the average market price of such shares on the London Stock Exchange during the previous six months over par value.\n\nDuring 2020 the company repurchased 120 million ordinary shares at a cost of $776 million, including transaction costs of $4 million, as part of the share repurchase programme announced on 31 October 2017. All shares purchased were for cancellation. The repurchased shares represented 0.6% of ordinary share capital.",

Capital and reserves\n\nSee statement of changes in equity for details of all reserves balances.\n\n## Share capital\n\nThe balance on the share capital account represents the aggregate nominal value of all ordinary and preference shares in issue, including treasury shares.\n\n## Share premium account\n\nThe balance on the share premium account represents the amounts received in excess of the nominal value of the ordinary and preference shares.\n\n## Capital redemption reserve\n\nThe balance on the capital redemption reserve represents the aggregate nominal value of all the ordinary shares repurchased and cancelled.\n\n## Merger reserve\n\nThe balance on the merger reserve represents the fair value of the consideration given in excess of the nominal value of the ordinary shares issued in an acquisition made by the issue of shares.\n\n## Treasury shares\n\nTreasury shares represent bp shares repurchased and available for specific and limited purposes. For accounting purposes, shares held in Employee Share Ownership Plans (ESOPs) and by bp's US share plan administrator to meet the future requirements of the employee share-based payment plans are treated in the same manner as treasury shares and are, therefore, included in the financial statements as treasury shares. The ESOPs are funded by the company and have waived their rights to dividends in respect of such shares held for future awards. Until such time as the shares held by the ESOPs vest unconditionally to employees, the amount paid for those shares is shown as a reduction in shareholders' equity. Assets and liabilities of the ESOPs are recognized as assets and liabilities of the company.\n\n## Foreign currency translation reserve\n\nThe foreign currency translation reserve records exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial information of the foreign currency branch. Upon disposal of foreign operations, the related accumulated exchange differences are recycled to the income statement.\n\n## Profit and loss account\n\nThe balance held on this reserve is the accumulated retained profits of the company.\n\nThe profit and loss account reserve includes $23,600 million (2019 $24,107 million), the distribution of which is limited by statutory or other restrictions.\n\nThe financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2020 do not reflect the dividend announced on 2 February 2021 which will be paid in March 2021; this will be treated as an appropriation of profit in the year ended 31 December 2021.\n\n## 9. Financial guarantees\n\nThe company has issued guarantees under which the maximum aggregate liabilities at 31 December 2020 were $80,891 million (2019 $78,586 million), the majority of which relate to finance debt of subsidiaries. Also included are guarantees of subsidiaries' liabilities under the Consent Decree between the United States, the Gulf states and bp and under the settlement agreement with the Gulf states in relation to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill. The company has also issued uncapped indemnities and guarantees, including a guarantee of subsidiaries' liabilities under the Plaintiffs' Steering Committee  agreement relating to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill. See note 33 in the consolidated group financial statements of BP p.l.c. for further information.\n\nThe parent company financial statements of BP p.l.c. on pages 259-300 do not form part of bp's Annual Report on Form 20-F as filed with the SEC.",

        "page_content": "## Liquidity and capital resources\n\n## Financial framework\n\nbp has a resilient financial framework that, taken together with our strategy,  creates a compelling investor proposition offering committed distributions, profitable growth and sustainable value. The framework comprises a coherent approach to capital allocation, a resilient balance sheet, a disciplined approach to investment allocation and a relentless focus on executing bp's business plan.\n\nbp's approach to capital allocation leads to a clear set of priorities funding our resilient dividend as the first priority, deleveraging the balance sheet, investment in low carbon \u00ab and convenience and mobility to advance our energy transition strategy, investment in resilient hydrocarbons to generate sustainable cash flow, and then returning surplus cash \u00ab as share buybacks. In a period of low prices, the group has the flexibility to reduce cash costs and to reduce or defer capital investment, as appropriate.\n\nOur shareholder distribution policy reflects these priorities for the uses of cash alongside an ongoing consideration of factors, including changes in the environment, the underlying performance of the business, the outlook for the group financial framework, and other market factors which may vary quarter to quarter.\n\nNet debt \u00ab at 31 December 2020 was $38.9 billion and is expected to reduce in line with the receipt of divestment proceeds and the growth in operating cash flow \u00ab . bp is targeting $25 billion of proceeds by 2025 (from mid 2020), and at the end of 2020 bp had completed or agreed transactions for over half of this target.\n\nWe expect operating cash flow to cover capital expenditure \u00ab and the dividend, with capital expenditure initially in a range of $13-15 billion, before increasing to $14-16 billion once net debt reaches $35 billion. Capital expenditure is expected to be at the lower end of the initial range in 2021. Looking further out across 2021-25, bp's cash balancing point is expected to average around $40 per barrel (assuming an average refining marker margin of around $11 and Henry Hub gas price at $3) in 2020 real terms. Gulf of Mexico oil spill payments on a post-tax basis were just over $1.6 billion in 2020 and are expected to be around $1 billion in 2021.\n\nIn 2020, the return on average capital employed \u00ab was (3.8)% a at an average of $42 per barrel. The return on average capital employed is targeted to grow to 12-14% by 2025 at $50 to 60 per barrel in 2020 real terms, and assuming bp planning assumptions, as we continue to execute our strategy. This is supported by an expected 7-9% growth in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (compound annual growth rate) across the same period and subject to the same price and planning assumptions.\n\n## Dividends and other distributions to shareholders\n\nThe dividend is determined in US dollars, the economic currency of bp, and the dividend level is reviewed by the board each quarter. The quarterly dividend was reset to 5.25 cents per ordinary share per quarter as part of a wider distribution policy announced in August 2020, and is intended to remain fixed at this level.\n\nThe total dividend distributed to bp shareholders in 2020 was $6.4 billion (2019 $8.3 billion). This dividend was all paid in cash as shareholders no longer have the option to receive a scrip dividend in place of receiving cash.\n\nIncluded in the distribution policy is a commitment that, once net debt reaches $35 billion and subject to maintaining a strong investment grade credit rating, at least 60% of surplus cash  will be distributed to shareholders through share buybacks.\n\nThe share buyback programme to offset the dilutive impact of the legacy scrip dividend concluded in January 2020 and purchased 120 million ordinary shares in 2020 at a cost of $776 million (2019 $1.5 billion), including fees and stamp duty.\n\n## Financing the group's activities\n\nThe group's principal commodities, oil and gas, are priced internationally in US dollars. Group policy has generally been to minimize economic exposure to currency movements by financing operations with US dollar debt. Where debt and hybrid bonds are issued in other currencies, they are generally swapped back to US dollars using derivative contracts, or else hedged by maintaining offsetting cash positions in the same currency. Cash balances of the group are mainly held in US dollars or swapped to US dollars and holdings are well diversified to reduce concentration risk. The group is not, therefore, exposed to significant currency risk regarding its cash or borrowings. Also see Risk factors on page 67 for further information on risks associated with prices and markets and Financial statements - Note 29.\n\nThe group's finance debt at 31 December 2020 amounted to $72.7 billion (2019 $67.7 billion). Of the total finance debt, $9.4 billion is classified as short term at the end of 2020 (2019 $10.5 billion). See Financial statements - Note 26 for more information on the short-term balance. Net debt \u00ab was $38.9 billion at the end of 2020, a decrease of $6.5 billion from the 2019 year-end position of $45.4 billion.\n\nOn 17 June 2020, a group subsidiary \u00ab issued perpetual subordinated hybrid bonds in EUR, GBP and USD for a US dollar equivalent amount of $11.9 billion. As the group has the unconditional right to avoid transferring cash or another financial asset in relation to these hybrid bonds, they are classified as equity instruments and reported within non-controlling interests.\n\nThe ratio of finance debt to finance debt plus total equity at 31 December 2020 was 45.9% (2019 40.2%). Gearing was 31.3%  at the end of 2020 (2019 31.1%). See Financial statements -  Note 27 for finance debt, which is the nearest equivalent measure on an IFRS basis, and for further information on net debt.\n\nCash and cash equivalents of $31.1 billion at 31 December 2020 (2019 $22.5 billion) are included in net debt. We manage our cash position so that the group has adequate cover to respond to potential short-term market liquidity, short term price environment volatility and expect to maintain a robust cash position.\n\nThe group also has an undrawn committed $8 billion credit facility and undrawn committed bank facilities of $4 billion (see Financial statements - Note 29 for more information).\n\nWe believe that the group has sufficient working capital for foreseeable requirements, taking into account the amounts of undrawn borrowing facilities and levels of cash and cash equivalents, and its ongoing ability to generate cash.\n\nbp utilizes various arrangements in order to manage its working capital including discounting of receivables and, in the supply and trading business, the active management of supplier payment terms, inventory and collateral.\n\nStandard & Poor's Ratings' long-term credit rating for BP p.l.c. is A(negative outlook), the Moody's Investors Service rating is A1 (negative outlook) and the Fitch Ratings' long-term credit rating is A (stable).\n\nThe group's sources of funding, its access to capital markets and maintaining a strong cash position are described in Financial statements Note 25 and Note 29. Further information on the management of liquidity risk and credit risk, and the maturity profile and fixed/floating rate characteristics of the group's debt are also provided in Financial statements- Note 26 and Note 29.\n\nThe information above contains forward-looking statements, which by their nature involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that will or may occur in the future and are outside the control of bp. You are urged to read the Cautionary statement on page 329 and Risk factors on page 67, which describe the risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results and developments to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.",

These amounts are not reflected in the group's debt on the balance sheet. The group has issued third-party guarantees under which amounts outstanding, incremental to amounts recognized on the balance sheet, at 31 December 2020 were $1,405 million (2019 $692 million) in respect of liabilities of joint ventures \u00ab and associates \u00ab and $661 million (2019 $523 million) in respect of liabilities of other third parties. Of these amounts, $1,393 million (2019 $681 million) of the joint ventures and associates guarantees relate to borrowings and for other third-party guarantees, $568 million (2019 $494 million) relate to guarantees of borrowings.\n\n## Contractual obligations\n\nThe following table summarizes the group's capital expenditure commitments for property, plant and equipment at 31 December 2020 and the proportion of that expenditure for which contracts have been placed.\n\n|                        | $ million Payments due by period   | $ million Payments due by period   | $ million Payments due by period   | $ million Payments due by period   |   $ million Payments due by period |   $ million Payments due by period | $ million Payments due by period   |\n|------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| Capital expenditure    | Total                              | 2021                               | 2022                               | 2023                               |                               2024 |                               2025 | 2026 and  thereafter               |\n| Committed              | 18,025                             | 9,016                              | 5,467                              | 1,747                              |                                747 |                                505 | 543                                |\n| of which is contracted | 8,009                              | 4,878                              | 2,805                              | 166                                |                                 65 |                                 27 | 68                                 |\n\nIn addition, at 31 December 2020, the group had committed to capital expenditure relating to investments in equity-accounted entities amounting to $3,774 million.

        "page_content": "## Oil and gas disclosures for the group\n\n## Analysis by region\n\nOur oil and gas operations are set out below by geographical area, with associated significant events for 2020. bp's percentage working interest in oil and gas assets is shown in brackets. Working interest is the costbearing ownership share of an oil or gas lease. Consequently, the percentages disclosed for certain agreements do not necessarily reflect the percentage interests in proved reserves, production or revenue. See page 320 for more information on Rosneft.\n\nIn addition to exploration, development and production activities, our Upstream business also includes certain midstream and liquefied natural gas (LNG) supply activities. Midstream activities involve the ownership and management of crude oil and natural gas pipelines, processing facilities and export terminals, LNG processing facilities and transportation, and our natural gas liquids (NGLs) processing business.\n\nOur LNG activities are located in Abu Dhabi, Angola, Australia, Indonesia and Trinidad. In 2020 we marketed around 5.0 million tonnes of LNG production from these assets to IST which supplements equity production with merchant third party volumes to build a global trading portfolio. The LNG is marketed through contractual rights to access import terminal capacity in the liquid markets of Europe, UK and US, and relationships to market directly to end user customers or trading entities. LNG is supplied to all major LNG demand centres for example Argentina, Brazil, Caribbean, China, Croatia, Mediterranean and North West Europe, India, Israel, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey and the UK.\n\n## Europe\n\nbp is active in the North Sea and the Norwegian Sea. In 2020 bp's production came from three key areas: the Shetland area comprising the Clair, Foinaven, and Schiehallion fields; the central area comprising the Andrew area, Culzean, ETAP and Shearwater fields; and Norway, through our equity accounted 30%  interest in Aker BP.\n\n- \u00b7 On 29 March, bp confirmed completion of the restructuring of contractual arrangements for the Petrojari Foinaven floating production, storage and offloading vessel on the Foinaven field to the west of the Shetlands (bp 72% and operator).\n- \u00b7 During the year, impairment charges of $2,796 million were recognized in respect of certain North Sea assets, primarily as a result of changes to the group's long-term price assumptions.\n- \u00b7 In March 2020, EnQuest, the Thistle field operator, announced it no longer expected to re-start production at the Thistle field (bp 82%) . A Cessation of Production application was approved by the regulator in July, with an effective decommissioning date of 31 May 2020.\n- \u00b7 During the third quarter, bp was awarded eight operated and three nonoperated blocks in the North Sea as part of the UK Oil & Gas Authority 32nd offshore licensing round.\n- \u00b7 On 6 October, bp confirmed that the planned divestment to Premier Oil of its interests in the Andrew area and Shearwater assets, both located in the UK North Sea, would not proceed following the announcement of a proposed merger between Chrysaor and Premier Oil.  bp had announced this divestment in January 2020.  The divestment was to cover the Andrew, Arundel, Cyrus, Farragon and Kinnoull fields plus bp's interest in Shearwater. Marketing of both assets continues.\n- \u00b7 On 26 November, bp announced that production had started at the Vorlich field (bp 66%), just two years after the project was sanctioned. Vorlich is the latest in a programme of fast-paced, high-return subsea tiebacks in the UK North Sea. bp and partner Ithaca Energy invested \u00a3230 million to develop the field, which was discovered in 2014 and received regulatory approval for development in 2018.\n\n## North America\n\nOur upstream activities in North America are located in four areas: deepwater Gulf of Mexico, the Lower 48 states, Canada and Mexico. Our interests in Alaska were disposed of during the year, further details are provided below.\n\nbp has around 260 lease blocks in the Gulf of Mexico and operates four production hubs.\n\n- \u00b7 On 25 August, bp confirmed it started production at Atlantis Phase 3 in the US Gulf of Mexico (bp 56% and operator).\n- \u00b7 Construction and installation at the Thunder Horse South Expansion Phase 2 project is underway and drilling set to commence in the first half of 2021. First oil from the project is expected in the third quarter of 2021 .\n- \u00b7 bp was awarded 12 leases in the lease sale conducted in March and 10 leases in the sale held in November.\n- \u00b7 The Mad Dog 2 project execute timeline was impacted by both COVID-19 and delays to fabrication of the floating production unit. The unit has now set sail from Korea, and wells activity and subsea installation are once again progressing. First oil is now expected in the second quarter of 2022.\n- \u00b7 During the year, exploration write-offs of $2,643 million were recognized in relation to certain Gulf of Mexico assets, primarily due to management's re-assessment of expectations to extract value from certain exploration prospects as a result of a review of the group's longterm strategic plan and changes in the group's long-term price assumptions.\n\nSee also Financial Statements - Note 1 for further information on exploration leases.\n\nbpx energy, bp's onshore oil and gas business in the Lower 48 states, has significant operated and non-operated activities across Louisiana, Texas and Wyoming producing natural gas, oil, NGLs and condensate, with primary focus on developing unconventional resources in Texas. It had a 1.5 billion boe proved reserve base at 31 December 2020, predominantly in unconventional reservoirs (tight gas \u00ab , shale gas and newly acquired shale oil). BPX Energy's assets span 2.1 million net developed acres and it had over 7,000 operated gross wells at 31 December 2020, with daily net production around 370mboe/d.\n\nbpx energy operated as a separate business in 2020 while remaining part of the Upstream segment. With its own governance, systems and processes, it is structured to increase competitive performance through swift decision making and innovation, while maintaining bp's commitment to safe, reliable and compliant operations.\n\n- \u00b7 During the year, impairment charges of  $1,444 million were recognized in respect of certain bpx energy assets, primarily as a result of changes to the group's long term price assumptions.\n- \u00b7 In December bp announced that it had reached agreement to sell its interest in the Wamsutter asset in Wyoming to Williams Field Services LLC. The transaction completed in January 2021.\n\nbp's onshore US crude oil and product pipelines and related transportation assets were included in the Downstream segment in 2020.\n\nIn Alaska, BP Exploration (Alaska) Inc. (BPXA) operated nine North Slope oilfields in the Greater Prudhoe Bay area and held interests in three producing fields operated by others, as well as a non-operating interest in the Liberty development project prior to the completion in the second quarter of 2020 of the divestment of its Upstream business to Hilcorp Energy announced in 2019.\n\nBP Pipelines (Alaska) Inc. (BPPA) owned a 49% interest in the TransAlaska Pipeline System (TAPS) prior to completion in the fourth quarter of 2020 of the divestment of its Midstream interests to Hilcorp Energy announced in 2019. As part of this transaction impairments of $1,002 million were recognized in 2020. bp retained the decommissioning liability relating to its interest in TAPS which will be partially offset by a 30% reimbursement of costs incurred from Hilcorp.\n\nIn Canada bp is focused on pursuing offshore exploration opportunities and its Sunrise Oil Sands operations. We have offshore exploration licences in Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Labrador and the Canadian Beaufort Sea. In addition to Sunrise Oil Sands we hold interests in two further oil sands lease areas through the Terre de Grace partnership and the Pike Oil Sands joint operation \u00ab . In-situ steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) technology is utilized in our existing oil sands operations, which uses the injection of steam into the reservoir to warm the bitumen so that it can flow to the surface through producing wells.",

We also have a 10% equity shareholding in ADNOC LNG and a 10% shareholding in the shipping company NGSCO. ADNOC LNG supplied approximately 5.69 million tonnes of LNG (0.748bcfe/d regasified) in 2020. Our interest in the ADNOC Onshore concession expires at the end of 2054.\n\nIn 2016 bp signed an enhanced technical service agreement for south and east Kuwait conventional oilfields, which includes the Burgan field, with Kuwait Oil Company. Delivery of the  2019-2020 plan was above target performance and implementation of the 2020-21 plan is underway.\n\nIn India we have a participating interest in two oil and gas PSAs (KG D6 33.33% and NEC25 33.33%),  and one oil and gas block under a Revenue Sharing Contract (KG-UDWHP-2018/1 40%), all operated by Reliance Industries Limited (RIL). We also have a 50% stake in India Gas Solutions Private Limited, a joint venture with RIL, for the sourcing and marketing of gas in India.\n\n- \u00b7 On 3 February, bp and RIL confirmed that they had completed the safe cessation of production in a planned manner, from the D1 D3 field in Block KG D6, off the east coast of India (bp 33.33%).\n- \u00b7 During the year, impairment charges of $1,313 million were recognized in respect of certain assets in India, primarily as a result of changes to the group's long-term price assumptions.\n- \u00b7 Also during the year, exploration write-offs of $333 million were recognized in relation to certain assets in India following management's re-assessment of expectations to extract value from certain exploration prospects as a result of a review of the group's long-term strategic plan and changes in the group's long-term price assumptions.\n- \u00b7 On 18 December, bp and RIL announced the start of gas production from R-Series, the first of the three projects in Block KG D6. The other two projects (Satellites Cluster and MJ) are under development with first gas production phased over 2021-2022 .\n\nIn Indonesia bp successfully completed the purchase of a 30% nonoperated working interest in the Andaman II PSC from KrisEnergy in April. Andaman II is a deep-water block covering 7,400 square kilometres area in the North Sumatra basin, offshore from Aceh. Other interest holders are Premier Oil (40%, operator) and Mubadala Petroleum (30%).\n\nIn Iraq bp holds a 47.6% working interest and is the lead contractor in the Rumaila technical service contract in southern Iraq. The technical services contract runs to December 2034. Rumaila is one of the world's largest oil fields, comprising five producing reservoirs. bp's activities have not been materially impacted by the continued political instability and public protests which have occurred in 2020.\n\nIn Russia in addition to its interest in Rosneft as detailed on page 320, bp holds a 20% interest in Taas-Yuryakh Neftegazodobycha (Taas) together with Rosneft (50.1%) and a consortium comprising Oil India Limited, Indian Oil Corporation Limited and Bharat PetroResources Limited (29.9%). Taas is developing the Srednebotuobinskoye oil and gas condensate field in East Siberia. Also with Rosneft, we hold a 49% interest in Kharampurneftegaz LLC (Kharampur) to develop subsoil resources within the Kharampurskoe and Festivalnoye licence areas in Yamalo-Nenets.  Rosneft (51%) and bp (49%) jointly own Yermak Neftegaz LLC (Yermak), which conducts onshore exploration in the West Siberian and Yenisei-Khatanga basins and currently holds six exploration and production licences.\n\n- \u00b7 During the year bp received $86 million of dividends net of withholding taxes and $51 million of distribution of paid in capital from Taas.\n\n## Australasia\n\nbp has activities in Australia and Eastern Indonesia.\n\nIn Australia bp is one of seven participants in the North West Shelf (NWS) venture, which has been producing LNG, pipeline gas, condensate, LPG and oil since the 1980s. Six partners (including bp) hold an equal 16.67% interest in the gas infrastructure and an equal 15.78%  interest in the gas and condensate reserves, with a seventh partner owning the remaining 5.32% . bp also has a 16.67% interest in some of the NWS oil reserves and related infrastructure. The NWS venture is currently the largest single source supplier to the domestic market in Western Australia and one of the largest LNG export projects in the region, with five LNG trains in operation. bp's net share of the capacity of NWS LNG trains 1-5 is 2.7 million tonnes of LNG per year.\n\nbp is also one of five participants in the Browse LNG venture (operated by Woodside) and holds a  17.33%  interest.\n\n- \u00b7 The Browse joint venture participants continue to progress the development of Browse by connecting it via a 900km pipeline to the NWS Venture's Karratha Gas Plant.\n\nIn Papua Barat, Eastern Indonesia, bp operates the Tangguh LNG plant (bp 40.22%). The asset currently comprises 16 producing wells, two offshore platforms, two pipelines and an LNG plant with two production trains. It has a total capacity of 7.6 million tonnes of LNG per annum. Tangguh supplies LNG to customers in Indonesia, Mexico, China, South Korea, and Japan through a combination of long, medium and short-term contracts.\n\nThe Tangguh expansion project comprises a third LNG processing train, two offshore platforms, 10 new production wells, an expanded LNG loading facility, and supporting infrastructure. The project will add 3.8 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of production capacity to the existing facility, bringing total plant capacity to 11.4mtpa. Due to COVID-19 and the need to relocate personnel from the remote project,  the start-up is expected to be delayed to 2022.",

        "page_content": "## Oil and natural gas\n\n## Resource progression\n\nbp manages its hydrocarbon resources in three major categories: prospect inventory, contingent resources and reserves. When a discovery is made, volumes usually transfer from the prospect inventory to the contingent resources category. The contingent resources move through various sub-categories as their technical and commercial maturity increases through appraisal activity.\n\nAt the point of final investment decision, most proved reserves will be categorized as proved undeveloped (PUD). Volumes will subsequently be recategorized from PUD to proved developed (PD) as a consequence of development activity. When part of a well's proved reserves depends on a later phase of activity, only that portion of proved reserves associated with existing, available facilities and infrastructure moves to PD. The first PD bookings will typically occur at the point of first oil or gas production. Major development projects typically take one to five years from the time of initial booking of PUD to the start of production. Changes to proved reserves bookings may be made due to analysis of new or existing data concerning production, reservoir performance, commercial factors and additional reservoir development activity.\n\nVolumes can also be added or removed from our portfolio through acquisition or divestment of properties and projects. When we dispose of an interest in a property or project, the volumes associated with our adopted plan of development for which we have a final investment decision will be removed from our proved reserves upon completion of the transaction. When we acquire an interest in a property or project, the volumes associated with the existing development and any committed projects will be added to our proved reserves if bp has made a final investment decision and they satisfy the SEC's criteria for attribution of proved status. Following the acquisition, additional volumes may be progressed to proved reserves from non-proved reserves or contingent resources.\n\nNon-proved reserves and contingent resources in a field will only be recategorized as proved reserves when all the criteria for attribution of proved status have been met and the volumes are included in the business plan and scheduled for development, typically within five years. bp will only book proved reserves where development is scheduled to commence after more than five years, if these proved reserves satisfy the SEC's criteria for attribution of proved status and bp management has reasonable certainty that these proved reserves will be produced.\n\nAt the end of 2020 bp had material volumes of proved undeveloped reserves held for more than five years in Russia, Trinidad, Gulf of Mexico, Azerbaijan, Indonesia and the North Sea. These are part of ongoing infrastructure-led development activities for which bp has a historical track record of completing comparable projects in these countries. We have no proved undeveloped reserves held for more than five years in our onshore US developments.\n\nIn each case the volumes are being progressed as part of an adopted development plan where there are physical limits to the development timing such as infrastructure limitations, contractual limits including gas delivery commitments, late life compression and the complex nature of working in remote locations, or where there are significant commitments on delivery to the relevant authority.\n\nOver the past five years, bp has annually progressed a weighted average 17% ( 19%  for 2019 five-year average) of our group proved undeveloped reserves (including the impact of disposals and price acceleration effects in PSAs) to proved developed reserves. This equates to a turnover time of six years.\n\nProved reserves as estimated at the end of 2020 meet bp's criteria for project sanctioning and SEC tests for proved reserves. We have not halted or changed our commitment to proceed with any material project to which proved undeveloped reserves have been attributed.\n\nIn 2020 we progressed 897 mmboe of proved undeveloped reserves (512 mmboe for our subsidiaries \u00ab alone) to proved developed reserves through ongoing investment in our subsidiaries' and equity-accounted entities' upstream development activities. Total development expenditure, excluding midstream activities, was $11,041 million in 2020 ($7,650 million for subsidiaries and $3,391 million for equity-accounted\n\nentities). The major areas with progressed volumes in 2020 were Russia, US, Egypt and Oman. Revisions of previous estimates for proved undeveloped reserves are due to changes relating to field performance, well results or changes in commercial conditions including price impacts. The following tables describe the changes to our proved undeveloped reserves position through the year for our subsidiaries and equityaccounted entities and for our subsidiaries alone.\n\n| Subsidiaries and equity-accounted entities                                                    | volumes in mmboe a   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|\n| Proved undeveloped reserves at 1 January 2020                                                 | 8,152                |\n| Revisions of previous estimates                                                               | 298                  |\n| Improved recovery                                                                             | 133                  |\n| Discoveries and extensions                                                                    | 436                  |\n| Purchases                                                                                     | 442                  |\n| Sales                                                                                         | (940)                |\n| Total in year proved undeveloped reserves changes                                             | 369                  |\n| Proved developed reserves reclassified as undeveloped                                         | 247                  |\n| Progressed to proved developed reserves by  development activities (e.g. drilling/completion) | (897)                |\n| Proved undeveloped reserves at 31 December 2020                                               | 7,871                |\n\n| Subsidiaries only                                                                             | volumes in mmboe a   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|\n| Proved undeveloped reserves at 1 January 2020                                                 | 3,771                |\n| Revisions of previous estimates                                                               | 42                   |\n| Improved recovery                                                                             | 122                  |\n| Discoveries and extensions                                                                    | 84                   |\n| Purchases                                                                                     | -                    |\n| Sales                                                                                         | (8)                  |\n| Total in year proved undeveloped reserves changes                                             | 240                  |\n| Proved developed reserves reclassified as undeveloped                                         | 173                  |\n| Progressed to proved developed reserves by  development activities (e.g. drilling/completion) | (512)                |\n| Proved undeveloped reserves at 31 December 2020                                               | 3,673                |\n\nbp bases its proved reserves estimates on the requirement of reasonable certainty with rigorous technical and commercial assessments based on conventional industry practice and regulatory requirements. bp only applies technologies that have been field tested and have been demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation. bp applies high-resolution seismic data for the identification of reservoir extent and fluid contacts only where there is an overwhelming track record of success in its local application. In certain cases bp uses numerical simulation as part of a holistic assessment of recovery factor for its fields, where these simulations have been field tested and have been demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation. In certain deepwater fields bp has booked proved reserves before production flow tests are conducted, in part because of the significant safety, cost and environmental implications of conducting these tests. The industry has made substantial technological improvements in understanding, measuring and delineating reservoir properties without the need for flow tests. To determine reasonable certainty of commercial recovery, bp employs a general method of reserves assessment that relies on the integration of three types of data:\n\n- \u00b7 well data used to assess the local characteristics and conditions of reservoirs and fluids\n- \u00b7 field scale seismic data to allow the interpolation and extrapolation of these characteristics outside the immediate area of the local well control\n- \u00b7 data from relevant analogous fields.\n\nWell data includes appraisal wells or sidetrack holes, full logging suites, core data and fluid samples. bp considers the integration of this data in certain cases to be superior to a flow test in providing understanding of overall reservoir performance. The collection of data from logs, cores, wireline formation testers, pressures and fluid samples calibrated to each other and to the seismic data can allow reservoir properties to be",

There is a strong track record of proved reserves recorded using these methods, validated by actual production levels.\n\n## Governance\n\nbp's centrally controlled process for proved reserves estimation approval forms part of a holistic and integrated system of internal control. It consists of the following elements:\n\n- \u00b7 Accountabilities of certain officers of the group to ensure that there is review and approval of proved reserves bookings independent of the operating business and that there are effective controls in the approval process and verification that the proved reserves estimates and the related financial impacts are reported in a timely manner.\n- \u00b7 Capital allocation processes, whereby delegated authority is exercised to commit to capital projects that are consistent with the delivery of the group's business plan. A formal review process exists to ensure that both technical and commercial criteria are met prior to the commitment of capital to projects.\n- \u00b7 Group audit, whose role is to consider whether the group's system of internal control is adequately designed and operating effectively to respond appropriately to the risks that are significant to bp.\n- \u00b7 Approval hierarchy, whereby proved reserves changes above certain threshold volumes require immediate review and all proved reserves require annual central authorization and have scheduled periodic reviews. The frequency of periodic review ensures that 100% of the bp proved reserves base undergoes central review every three years.\n\nbp's vice president of segment reserves is the individual primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of the reserves estimate. He has more than 27 years of diversified industry experience in reserves estimation with the past 2 years managing the governance and compliance. He is a past Chairman of the Society of Petroleum Engineers (Russia & Caspian) and a member of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe Expert Group on Resource Management.\n\nNo specific portion of compensation bonuses for senior management is directly related to proved reserves targets. Additions to proved reserves is one of several indicators by which the performance of the Upstream segment is assessed by the remuneration committee for the purposes of determining compensation bonuses for the executive directors. Other indicators include a number of financial and operational measures.\n\nbp's variable pay programme for the other senior managers in the Upstream segment is based on individual performance contracts. Individual performance contracts are based on agreed items from the business performance plan, one of which, if chosen, could relate to proved reserves.\n\n## Compliance\n\nInternational Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) do not provide specific guidance on reserves disclosures. bp estimates proved reserves in accordance with SEC Rule 4-10 (a) of Regulation S-X and relevant Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations (C&DI) and Staff Accounting Bulletins as issued by the SEC staff.\n\nBy their nature, there is always risk involved in the ultimate development and production of proved reserves including, but not limited to: final regulatory approval; the installation of new or additional infrastructure, as well as changes in oil and gas prices; changes in operating and development costs; and the continued availability of additional development capital. All the group's proved reserves held in subsidiaries and equity-accounted entities are estimated by the group's petroleum engineers or by independent petroleum engineering consulting firms and then assured by the group's petroleum engineers.\n\nDeGolyer & MacNaughton (D&M), an independent petroleum engineering consulting firm, has estimated the net proved crude oil, condensate, natural gas liquids (NGLs) and natural gas reserves, as of 31 December 2020, of certain properties owned by Rosneft as part of our equityaccounted proved reserves. The properties evaluated by D&M account for 100% of Rosneft's net proved reserves as of  31 December 2020. The net proved reserves estimates prepared by D&M were prepared in accordance with the reserves definitions of Rule 4-10(a)(1)-(32) of\n\n\u00ab\n\n## Additional disclosures\n\nRegulation S-X. All reserves estimates involve some degree of uncertainty. bp has filed D&M's independent report on its reserves estimates as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 20-F filed with the SEC.\n\nNetherland, Sewell & Associates (NSAI), an independent petroleum engineering consulting firm, has estimated the net proved crude oil, condensate, natural gas liquids (NGLs) and natural gas reserves, as of 31 December 2020, of certain properties owned by bp in the US Lower 48. The properties evaluated by NSAI account for 100% of bp's net proved reserves in the US Lower 48 as of 31 December 2020. The net proved reserves estimates prepared by NSAI were prepared in accordance with the reserves definitions of Rule 4-10(a)(1)-(32) of Regulation S-X. All reserves estimates involve some degree of uncertainty. bp has filed NSAI's independent report on its reserves estimates as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 20-F filed with the SEC.\n\nOur proved reserves are associated with both concessions (tax and royalty arrangements) and agreements where the group is exposed to the upstream risks and rewards of ownership, but where our entitlement to the hydrocarbons is calculated using a more complex formula, such as with PSAs. In a concession, the consortium of which we are a part is entitled to the proved reserves that can be produced over the licence period, which may be the life of the field. In a PSA, we are entitled to recover volumes that equate to costs incurred to develop and produce the proved reserves and an agreed share of the remaining volumes or the economic equivalent. As part of our entitlement is driven by the monetary amount of costs to be recovered, price fluctuations will have an impact on both production volumes and reserves.\n\nWe disclose our share of proved reserves held in equity-accounted entities (joint ventures \u00ab and associates \u00ab ), although we do not control these entities or the assets held by such entities.\n\n## bp's estimated net proved reserves and proved reserves replacement\n\n92%  of our total proved reserves of subsidiaries at 31 December 2020 were held through joint operations \u00ab (91% in  2019), and 31% of the proved reserves were held through such joint operations where we were not the operator (28% in  2019).\n\n## Estimated net proved reserves of crude oil at 31 December 2020 a b c\n\n|                           | Developed   | Undeveloped   | million barrels Total   |\n|---------------------------|-------------|---------------|-------------------------|\n| UK                        | 162         | 148           | 309                     |\n| US d                      | 697         | 742           | 1,438                   |\n| Rest of North America d   | 37          | 195           | 232                     |\n| South America e           | 8           | 9             | 16                      |\n| Africa                    | 116         | 21            | 137                     |\n| Rest of Asia              | 1,100       | 547           | 1,647                   |\n| Australasia               | 34          | 5             | 38                      |\n| Subsidiaries              | 2,154       | 1,666         | 3,819                   |\n| Equity-accounted entities | 3,517       | 2,776         | 6,293                   |\n| Total                     | 5,671       | 4,441         | 10,112                  |\n\nEstimated net proved reserves of natural gas liquids at 31 December 2020 a b\n\n|                           |           | million barrels   | million barrels   |\n|---------------------------|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|\n|                           | Developed | Undeveloped       | Total             |\n| UK                        | 7         | -                 | 7                 |\n| US                        | 115       | 218               | 333               |\n| Rest of North America     | -         | -                 | -                 |\n| South America             | 2         | 19                | 21                |\n| Africa                    | 13        | 1                 | 14                |\n| Rest of Asia              | -         | -                 | -                 |\n| Australasia               | 2         | -                 | 2                 |\n| Subsidiaries              | 139       | 237               | 376               |\n| Equity-accounted entities | 129       | 44                | 172               |\n| Total                     | 268       | 281               | 549               |",

Natural gas represented about 41% (47% for subsidiaries and 36% for equity-accounted entities) of these reserves. The change includes a net decrease from acquisitions and disposals of 1,069mmboe (decrease of 1,072mmboe within our subsidiaries and increase of 3mmboe within our equity-accounted entities). Acquisition and divestment activity occurred in our equityaccounted entities in Russia, and divestment activity in our subsidiaries in the US including Alaska.\n\nThe proved reserves replacement ratio \u00ab is the extent to which production is replaced by proved reserves additions. This ratio is expressed in oil equivalent terms and includes changes resulting from revisions to previous estimates, improved recovery, and extensions and discoveries. For 2020, the proved reserves replacement ratio excluding acquisitions and disposals was 78% (67% in 2019 and 100% in  2018) for subsidiaries and equity-accounted entities, 47% for subsidiaries alone and 127% for equity-accounted entities alone.  There was a net decrease (373mmboe) of reserves due to lower gas and oil prices  within the US, North Sea and Angola partly offset by increases related to price in some of our PSAs  in Iraq and Azerbaijan.\n\nIn 2020 net additions to the group's proved reserves (excluding production and sales and purchases of reserves-in-place) amounted to 1,006mmboe (380mmboe for subsidiaries and 626mmboe for equityaccounted entities), through revisions to previous estimates including price, improved recovery from, and extensions to, existing fields and discoveries of new fields. The subsidiary additions were through improved recovery from, and extensions to, existing fields and discoveries of new fields where they represented a mixture of proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves. Volumes added in 2020 principally resulted from the application of conventional technologies and extensions of field size by development drilling. The principal proved reserves additions in our subsidiaries by region were in the US, Oman, Azerbaijan and Angola. The principal reserves additions in our equity-accounted entities were in Rosneft and Pan American Energy Group.\n\n16%  of our proved reserves are associated with PSAs. The countries in which we produced under PSAs in 2020 were Algeria, Angola, Azerbaijan, Egypt, India, Indonesia and Oman. In addition, the technical service contract (TSC) governing our investment in the Rumaila field in Iraq functions as a PSA.\n\nThe group holds no licences due to expire within the next three years that would have a significant impact on bp's reserves or production. bp holds reserves classified as Assets held for sale in Oman.\n\nFor further information on our reserves see page 238.",

        "page_content": "## Additional information for Rosneft\n\n## About Rosneft\n\nRosneft is the largest oil company in Russia, with a strong portfolio of current and future opportunities. Russia has one of the largest and lowest-cost hydrocarbon resource bases in the world and its resources play an important role in long-term energy supply to the global economy.\n\nRosneft is one of the largest publicly traded oil companies in the world based on hydrocarbon production volume. And it has a major resource base of hydrocarbons onshore and offshore, with assets in all of Russia's key hydrocarbon regions and abroad. bp's share of Rosneft hydrocarbon production in 2020 was 1,098mboe/d, compared with 1,144mboe/d in 2019.\n\nRosneft is a member of the Methane Guiding Principles initiative that aims to reduce methane emissions along the natural gas value chain. It reaffirmed its commitment to the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals and the core principles of the UN Global Compact.\n\nRosneft is the leading Russian refining company based on throughput. It owns and operates 13 refineries in Russia and holds stakes in three refineries in Germany, one in India and one in Belarus. Rosneft refinery throughput in 2020 was 2,103mb/d, compared with 2,236mb/d in 2019.\n\nDownstream operations include jet fuel, bunkering, bitumen and lubricants. Rosneft also owns and operates over 3,055 retail service stations in Russia and abroad. These includes Rosneft-branded sites, as well as bp-branded sites operating under a licensing agreement.\n\nRosneft's largest shareholder is Rosneftegaz JSC (Rosneftegaz), which is wholly owned by the Russian government. At 31 December 2020, Rosneftegaz held 40.4% (2019: 50% plus one share) of the voting share capital of Rosneft.\n\n## 2020 summary\n\nbp remains committed to our strategic investment in Rosneft, while complying with all relevant sanctions.\n\nbp's two nominees, Bernard Looney and Bob Dudley, were elected to Rosneft's board at Rosneft's annual general meeting (AGM) in June. Bob Dudley is a chairman of the Rosneft board's Strategy and Sustainable Development Committee. At the AGM, shareholders also approved a resolution to pay a dividend. bp received a payment of $480 million, after the deduction of withholding tax, in July.\n\nOn 30 April, Rosneft completed a transaction to transfer all of its interest and cease participation in its Venezuelan businesses to a company owned by the government of the Russian Federation. In consideration, it received shares equal to a 9.6% share of its own equity. The shares are held by a 100% subsidiary of Rosneft and accounted for as treasury shares. Rosneft also has an approved programme of share buybacks under which shares are being repurchased. Those shares are also accounted for as treasury shares.\n\nbp retains 19.75% of the voting rights at meetings of Rosneft shareholders and continues to be entitled to dividends based on that shareholding. bp's economic interest as of 31 December 2020, however, has increased to 22.03% as a result of its indirect interest in the shares held by the subsidiaries of Rosneft. bp's share of profit or loss of Rosneft reflects its economic interest.\n\nOn 14 December 2020, Rosneft announced the sale of a 49% stake in Krasgeonats to Equinor for approximately $550 million. Krasgeonats owns 12 licences for exploration and production in Eastern Siberia, including the recently launched North-Danilovskoye field.\n\nOn 28 December, Rosneft announced completion of the acquisition of 100% stakes in JSC Taimyrneftegaz and LLC Taimyrburservis, and the sale of a 10% interest in LLC Vostok Oil to Trafigura for Euro 7 billion.\n\nIn December, Rosneft announced that it has developed a 2035 Carbon Management Plan, a long-term framework for its development in the context of transitioning to a low carbon economy, including management of climate risks and identification of opportunities related to future energy demand.\n\n2020 marked the 10th anniversary of Rosneft's participation in UN Global Compact, the world's largest sustainability initiative. In 2020, Rosneft\n\npresented its public statement regarding human rights and the Declaration on Human Rights for interacting with suppliers of goods, works and services.\n\n\ud834\udd7a\n\nIn February 2021,Rosneft and bp signed a Strategic Collaboration Agreement focused on supporting carbon management and sustainability activities of both companies.\n\nThe agreement builds on bp's longstanding strategic partnership with Rosneft and will explore opportunities for new investment and collaboration in Russia across several key focus areas:\n\n- \u00b7 Developing industry methodologies and standards on carbon management, including methane reduction initiatives and energy efficiency applications.\n- \u00b7 Evaluating new projects in renewables, carbon capture and hydrogen.\n- \u00b7 Assessing opportunities in the downstream including advanced fuels, natural forest sinks and carbon offset credits.\n- \u00b7 Sustainable development and social investment, including biodiversity.",

Instead, it forms part of a larger transaction that includes, for example, normal operations and maintenance expenditure. The figures for environmental operating and capital expenditure in the table are therefore estimates, based on the definitions and guidelines of the American Petroleum Institute.\n\nEnvironmental operating expenditure of $531 million in 2020 (2019 $511 million) showed an overall increase of 4% , with increases in BP Products and Shipping expenditure largely balanced out by a reduction in expenditure for BPX Energy.\n\nEnvironmental capital expenditure of $241 million in 2020 was significantly down (2019 $468 million) largely due to decreased expenditure in the BPX Energy and BP Products North America business.\n\nClean-up costs were $29 million in 2020 (2019 $23 million) representing oil spill clean-up costs and other associated remediation and disposal costs. The increase compared to 2019 results largely from increased expenditure in three businesses, namely BP Pipelines (North America), Alaska and Remediation Management.\n\nIn addition to operating and capital expenditure, we also establish provisions for future environmental remediation work. Expenditure against such provisions normally occurs in subsequent periods and is not included in environmental operating expenditure reported for such periods.\n\nProvisions for environmental remediation are made when a clean-up is probable and the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated. Generally, this coincides with the commitment to a formal plan of action or, if earlier, on divestment or on closure of inactive sites.\n\nThe extent and cost of future environmental restoration, remediation and abatement programmes are inherently difficult to estimate. They often depend on the extent of contamination, and the associated impact and timing of the corrective actions required, technological feasibility and bp's share of liability. Though the costs of future programmes could be significant and may be material to the results of operations in the period in which they are recognized, it is not expected that such costs will be material to the group's overall results of operations or financial position.\n\nAdditions to our environmental remediation provision was similar to prior years and also reflects scope reassessments of the remediation plans of a number of our sites in the US. The charge for environmental remediation provisions in 2020 included $8 million in respect of provisions for new sites (2019 $9 million and 2018 $8 million).\n\nIn addition, we make provisions on installation of our oil and gas producing assets and related pipelines to meet the cost of eventual decommissioning. On installation of an oil or natural gas production facility, a provision is established that represents the discounted value of the expected future cost of decommissioning the asset.\n\nIn 2020, the net decrease in the decommissioning provision was due to a change in the discount rate and a change in cost estimate assumptions.\n\nWe undertake periodic reviews of existing provisions. These reviews take account of revised cost assumptions, changes in decommissioning requirements and any technological developments.\n\nProvisions for environmental remediation and decommissioning are usually established on a discounted basis, as required by IAS 37 'Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets'.\n\nFurther details of decommissioning and environmental provisions appear in Financial statements - Note 23.\n\n\u00ab\n\n## Regulation of the group's business\n\nOur businesses and operations are subject to the laws and regulations applicable in each country, state or other regional or local area in which they occur.  These cover virtually all aspects of bp's activities and include matters such as licence acquisition, production rates, royalties, environmental, health and safety protection, fuel specifications and transportation, trading, pricing, anti-trust, export, taxes, and foreign exchange .\n\n## Oil and gas contractual and regulatory framework\n\nThe terms and conditions of the leases, licences and contracts under which our upstream oil and gas interests are held vary from country to country. These leases, licences and contracts are generally granted by or entered into with a government entity or state-owned or controlled company and are sometimes entered into with private property owners. Arrangements with governmental or state entities usually take the form of licences or production-sharing agreements \u00ab (PSAs), although arrangements with private entities and the US government entities are usually by lease.\n\nLicences (or concessions) give the holder the right to explore for, develop and produce a commercial discovery. Under a licence, the holder bears the risk of exploration, development and production activities and provides the financing for these operations. In principle, the licence holder is entitled to all production, minus any royalties that are payable in kind. A licence holder is generally required to pay production taxes or royalties, which may be in cash or in kind.\n\nIn certain countries, separate licences are required for exploration and production activities, and in some cases production licences are limited to only a portion of the area covered by the original exploration licence.\n\nPSAs entered into with a government entity or state-owned or controlled company generally require bp (alone or with other contracting companies) to provide all the financing and bear the risk of exploration and production activities in exchange for a share of the production remaining after royalties, if any. Less typically, bp may explore for, develop and produce hydrocarbons under a service agreement with the host entity in exchange for reimbursement of costs and/or a fee paid in cash rather than production.\n\nbp frequently conducts its exploration and production activities in joint arrangements \u00ab or co-ownership arrangements with other international oil companies, state-owned or controlled companies and/or private companies. Conventionally, all costs, benefits, rights, obligations, liabilities and risks incurred in carrying out joint arrangement or co-ownership operations under a lease, licence or PSA are shared among the joint arrangement or co-owning parties according to agreed ownership interests among them. To the extent that any liabilities arise, whether to governments or third parties, or as between the joint arrangement parties or co-owners themselves, each joint arrangement party or co-owner will generally be liable to meet these in proportion to its ownership interest. In many upstream operations, a party (known as the operator) will be appointed (pursuant to a joint operating agreement) to carry out day to-day operations on behalf of the joint arrangement or co-ownership.  The operator is typically one of the joint arrangement parties or a coowner and will carry out its duties either through its own staff, or by contracting out various elements to third-party contractors or service providers. bp acts as operator on behalf of joint arrangements and coownerships in a number of countries.\n\nFrequently, work (including drilling and related activities) will be contracted out to third-party service providers. The relevant contract will specify the work, the remuneration, and typically the risk allocation between the parties. Depending on the service to be provided, the contract may also contain provisions allocating risks and liabilities associated with pollution and environmental damage, damage to a well or hydrocarbon reservoirs and for claims from third parties or other losses. The allocation of those risks vary among contracts and are determined through negotiation between the parties .",

        "page_content": "In general, bp incurs income tax on income generated from production activities (whether under a licence or PSA). In addition, depending on the area, bp's production activities may be subject to a range of other taxes, levies and assessments, including special petroleum taxes and revenue taxes. The taxes imposed on oil and gas production profits and activities may be substantially higher than those imposed on other activities, for example in Abu Dhabi, Angola, Egypt, Norway, the UK, the US, Russia and Trinidad & Tobago.\n\n## Sustainable finance\n\nOn 12 July 2020, elements of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 on the establishment of a framework to facilitate sustainable investment (Taxonomy Regulation) entered into force and form part of UK law pursuant to the European Union (Withdrawal) Act of 2018.   The Taxonomy Regulation establishes a classification system for determining whether an economic activity is environmentally sustainable for the purposes of guiding investors in financial products which are marketed as promoting environmental objectives. Although the UK government has expressed its intention to retain the overall taxonomy framework and objectives as set forth in the Taxonomy Regulation, it is not yet clear to what extent UK law will align with elements of the Taxonomy Regulation which were not in effect as of the end of the Brexit transition period on 31 December 2020. bp may in the future be required to comply with the Taxonomy Regulation or any parallel or similar legislation which may come into force in the UK .\n\n## Greenhouse gas regulation\n\nIn December 2015, nearly 200 nations at the United Nations climate change conference in Paris (COP21) agreed the Paris Agreement which aims to hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. Signatories aim to reach global peaking of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as soon as possible and to undertake rapid reductions thereafter, so as to achieve a balance between human caused emissions and removals by sinks of GHGs in the second half of this century. The Paris Agreement commits all signatories to submit Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) (i.e. pledges or plans of climate action) and pursue domestic measures aimed at achieving the objectives of their NDCs. Signatories are required to submit revised NDCs every five years, and the revised NDC's are expected to be more ambitious with each revision. Global assessments of progress will occur every five years, starting in 2023.\n\nAgreement of rules which could enable international carbon trading to assist in meeting NDCs, has been deferred to COP26 which is expected to take place in Glasgow, Scotland in November 2021. More stringent national and regional measures relating to the transition to a lower carbon economy, such as the UK's 2050 net zero carbon emissions commitment, can be expected in the future. These measures could increase bp's production costs for certain products, increase compliance and litigation costs, increase demand for competing energy alternatives or products with lower-carbon intensity, and affect the sales and specifications of many of bp's products. Further, such measures could lead to constraints on production and supply and access to new reserves, particularly due to the long term nature of many of bp's projects. Certain current and announced GHG measures and developments potentially affecting bp's businesses in various markets in which bp operates are summarized below. For information on steps that bp is taking in relation to climate change issues and for details of bp's GHG reporting, see Sustainability - Net zero aims on page 49.\n\n## United States\n\nIn the US, bp's operations are affected by GHG regulation in a number of ways. The federal Clean Air Act (CAA), for example, regulates air emissions, permitting, fuel specifications and other aspects of our production, refining, distribution and marketing activities.\n\nEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations aimed at limiting methane emissions from new and modified sources in the oil and natural gas sector in the US by 40-45% from 2012 levels by 2025 were the subject of an August 2020, EPA final 'policy rule' intended to significantly revise that regulation. This rule is the subject of  litigation in the D.C.\n\nCircuit.  In addition, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) in 2018 issued a new waste prevention rule which rescinded the prior 2017 rule regarding methane regulation on federal lands. While litigation around both rules is expected to continue, the Biden administration has taken executive action with respect to Federal regulations promulgated during the Trump administration relating to climate change, including a review of both of these rules. Other EPA GHG regulations which may affect electricity generation practices and prices and have an impact on the market for fuels used to generate electricity and on renewable energy installations are in flux due to changes in approach between presidential administrations, as well as lawsuits challenging proposed regulations. In 2019, the EPA issued the final Affordable Clean Energy ( ACE) Rule, which is intended to address GHG emissions from certain existing sources in the electricity sector, and which is intended to replace the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan (CPP). A number of lawsuits have been filed regarding the legality of the ACE Rule and the repeal of the CPP regulations, and on 19 January  2021, the DC Circuit struck down the ACE rule in its entirety. The Biden administration may develop new regulations that more closely mirror the CPP.\n\nThe Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 impose the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), requiring transportation fuel sold in the United States to contain a minimum volume of renewable fuels. Certain state initiatives impose lower GHG emissions thresholds for transportation fuels (e.g., in California and Oregon). In 2020, EPA changed its approach to Small Refinery Exemptions based on court activity. EPA is behind schedule in setting RFS requirements for 2021 and we expect the administration to begin the process of setting 2023 and beyond volumes in 2021 as well.\n\nThe GHG mandatory reporting rule, requires operators of certain facilities and producers and importers/exporters of petroleum products to file annual GHG emissions reports with the EPA quantifying direct emissions from affected facilities, as well as volumes of petroleum products, certain natural gas liquids and GHG products and notional GHG emissions as if these products were fully combusted.\n\nA number of states, municipalities and regional organizations have responded to current and proposed federal changes easing environmental regulation with separate initiatives that affect our US operations. For example, the California cap and trade programme started in January 2012 and expanded to cover emissions from transportation fuels in 2015. The State of Washington has adopted a carbon cap rule although the state's Supreme Court has modified the rule to exclude coverage of sales and distribution of petroleum fuels. We expect a number of states to advance economy-wide and transport/fuels specific regulations in 2021.\n\nOur US businesses are subject to increased GHG and other environmental requirements and regulatory uncertainty, including that the Biden or any future US administrations could revise or revoke current or prior administration programs, as well as increased expenditures in having to comply with numerous diverse and nonuniform regulatory initiatives at the state and local level.\n\nUS fuel markets are affected by EPA regulation of light, medium and heavy duty vehicle emissions (both fuel economy and tailpipe standards) as well as for non-road engines and vehicles and certain large GHG stationary emission sources. California also imposes Low Emission Vehicle (LEV) and Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) standards on vehicle manufacturers and a number of other states, as allowed by CAA authority, have adopted standards identical to California's standards. These regulations may impact bp's product mix and demand for particular products in those states. In August 2020, California also entered into agreements with several carmakers to meet more demanding emissions standards in California.\n\nIn 2019 the Trump administration issued the Safer Affordable FuelEfficient Vehicles rule rolling back the Obama administration's fuel economy and tailpipe carbon dioxide emissions standards for passenger cars and light trucks covering model years (MY) 2021 through 2026 by locking in the 2020 standards until 2026. It has also proposed eliminating the waiver allowing California to set its own LEV and ZEV standards and for other states to adopt those standards. Litigation challenging these regulations is ongoing although the Biden",

        "page_content": "administration is expected to restore the California waiver and commence rulemaking to reinstate the stricter fuel economy and tailpipe carbon dioxide emissions standards.\n\nIn January 2020, EPA solicited on a proposed rulemaking known as the Cleaner Trucks Initiative. The rule would, among other things, establish new emission standards for oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and other pollutants for highway heavy-duty engines and the Biden administration is expected to modify and continue this proposed rulemaking. California has also adopted a 'Heavy-Duty Low NOx Omnibus Regulation' which will require manufacturers to comply with stricter emissions standards.  The rule is being phased in, with the first phase effective in 2024. bp continues to monitor these rules for implications for fuels .\n\n## European Union\n\n- \u00b7 The EU and its member states have adopted various measures seeking to reduce GHG emissions and encourage renewables. A set of regulatory measures adopted by the EU include: a collective national reduction target for emissions not covered by the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) Directive; binding national renewable energy targets (including targets in the transport sector) under the Renewable Energy Directive; and a legal framework to promote carbon capture and storage.\n- \u00b7 In 2014, EU leaders adopted a climate and energy framework setting targets for the year 2030 including at least 40% reductions in GHG emissions from 1990 levels and in December 2020 the Council agreed an increase to a 55% reductions target from 1990 levels which is pending before the European Parliament.\n- \u00b7 In December 2019, the European Commission proposed an ambitious 'European Green Deal'. These proposals, which require formal approval by EU Member States to be adopted and include climate neutrality and increased GHG reduction targets, tightening of the emissions caps in the EU ETS, extending the EU ETS to include the maritime sector and reducing allowances allocated to airlines, implement a carbon border tax adjustment and harmonise energy taxation across the EU Member States.\n- \u00b7 In October 2020 the European Commission presented an EU strategy to reduce methane emissions. The strategy sets out measures to cut methane emissions in Europe and internationally. It presents legislative and non-legislative actions in the energy, agriculture and waste sectors, which account for around 95% of methane emissions associated with human activity worldwide.\n- \u00b7 European regulations also establish passenger car performance standards for CO2 tailpipe emissions (European Regulation (EC) No 443/2009). By 2021, the European passenger fleet emissions target for new vehicles will be 95 grams of CO2 per kilometre. This target will be achieved by manufacturing fuel efficient vehicles and vehicles using alternative, low carbon fuels such as hydrogen and electricity.\n- \u00b7 In 2019, the European Parliament and the Council adopted Regulation (EU) 2019/631 setting CO2 emission performance standards for new passenger cars and for new light commercial vehicles (vans) in the EU for the period after 2020. From a 2021 baseline, it requires EU fleetwide reductions of 15% by 2025 and 37.5% by 2030 for passenger cars, and 15% by 2025 and 31% by 2030 for new light commercial vehicles.\n- \u00b7 The EU Fuel Quality Directive affects our production and marketing of transport fuels including mandating reductions in the life cycle GHG emissions per unit of energy and tighter environmental fuel quality standards for petrol and diesel.\n- \u00b7 Germany is expected to launch a national emissions trading system in 2021 for transport and heating fuels. Impacted fuel suppliers in Germany will pay a fixed price for emissions certificates of EUR 25 per tonne CO2 in 2021 rising to EUR 55 per tonne by 2025. In 2026, emissions certificates will be auctioned but with prices limited between EUR 55 and EUR 65 per tonne CO2 emitted.  A review of the system is expected to take place in 2025 to determine the position beyond 2026.\n\n## Other\n\n- \u00b7 In December 2020 the UK Government announced a targeted reduction in the UK's GHG emissions of at least 68% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels. The UK also announced an emissions trading system from 1\n\n## Additional disclosures\n\nJanuary 2021 onwards which would include the same installations in the UK that were previously subject to the EU ETS.\n\n- \u00b7 China is operating emission trading pilot programmes in five cities and three provinces. One of bp's subsidiaries \u00ab and one of bp's joint venture \u00ab companies in China are participating in these schemes. China launched its national emissions trading market (National ETS), initially covering the power sector only, politically in 2017. On 31 December 2020, China promulgated the national regulation on National ETS which became effective on 1 February 2021, when the National ETS was officially launched .\n- \u00b7 China has also adopted more stringent vehicle tailpipe emission standards and vehicle efficiency standards to address air pollution and GHG emissions. These standards will have an impact on transportation fuel product mix and overall demand. In addition, China has also introduced a mandate for sales of new energy vehicles (NEVs) commencing in 2020. This has been accelerating NEV penetration into the light vehicle sector and impact light fuel demand.\n\n## Other environmental regulation\n\nIn addition to GHG regulations including current and proposed fuel and product specifications and emission controls (including control of vehicle emissions) referred to above, climate change programmes and regulation of unconventional oil and gas extraction under a number of environmental laws may have a significant effect on the production, sale and profitability of many of bp's products.\n\nEnvironmental laws also require bp to remediate and restore areas affected by the release of hazardous substances or hydrocarbons associated with our operations or properties. These laws may apply to sites that bp currently owns or operates, sites that it previously owned or operated, or sites used for the disposal of its and other parties' waste. See Financial Statements - Note 23 for information on provisions for environmental restoration and remediation.\n\nA number of pending or anticipated governmental proceedings against certain bp group companies under environmental laws could result in monetary or other sanctions. Group companies are also subject to environmental claims for personal injury and property damage alleging the release of, or exposure to, hazardous substances. The costs associated with future environmental remediation obligations, governmental proceedings and claims could be significant and may be material to the results of operations in the period in which they are recognized. We cannot accurately predict the effects of future developments, such as stricter environmental laws and regulations or enforcement policies, or future events at our facilities, on the group, and there can be no assurance that material liabilities and costs will not be incurred in the future. For a discussion of the group's environmental expenditure, see page 321 and for a discussion of legal proceedings, see page 226.\n\nSignificant legislation and regulation in the US and the EU affecting our businesses and profitability, in addition to those referred to above, include the following:\n\n## United States\n\n- \u00b7 The Clean Water Act regulates wastewater and other effluent discharges from bp's facilities, and bp is required to obtain discharge permits, install control equipment and implement operational controls and preventative measures.\n- \u00b7 The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act regulates the generation, storage, transportation and disposal of wastes associated with our operations and can require corrective action at locations where such wastes have been disposed of or released. bp has incurred, or is likely to incur, liability under RCRA or similar state laws in connection with sites bp operates or previously operated.\n- \u00b7 The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) can, in certain circumstances, impose the entire cost of investigation and remediation on a party who owned or operated a site contaminated with a hazardous substance, or who arranged for disposal of a hazardous substance at a site. bp has incurred, or is likely to incur, liability under CERCLA or similar state laws, including costs attributed to insolvent or unidentified parties. bp is also subject to claims for remediation costs and natural resource damages under CERCLA and other federal and state laws.",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 The Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act requires reporting on the storage, use and releases of certain quantities of listed hazardous substances to designated government agencies.\n- \u00b7 The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) regulates bp's manufacture, import, export, sale and use of chemical substances and products. In addition, EPA has revised processes and procedures for prioritisation of existing chemicals for risk evaluation, assessment and management. Agency actions and announcements are monitored regularly to identify developments with potential impacts on chemical substances important to bp products and operations. Thus far, bp has identified two substances for specific ongoing monitoring of developments and impacts.\n- \u00b7 The Occupational Safety and Health Act imposes workplace safety and health requirements on bp operations along with significant process safety management obligations, requiring continuous evaluation and improvement of operational practices to enhance safety and reduce workplace emissions at gas processing, refining and other regulated facilities.\n- \u00b7 The Oil Pollution Act 1990 (OPA) imposes operational requirements, liability standards and other obligations governing the transportation of petroleum products in US waters. States may impose additional obligations. Alaska and the West Coast states currently have the most demanding state requirements.\n- \u00b7 The Outer Continental Shelf Land Act, the Mineral Leasing Act and other statutes give the Department of Interior (DOI) and the BLM authority to regulate operations and air emissions, including equipment and testing, on offshore and onshore operations on federal lands subject to DOI authority .\n- \u00b7 The Endangered Species Act (ESA) and Marine Mammal Protection Act protect certain species' habitats from adverse human impacts by restricting operations or development at certain times and in certain places. In 2020, the US Fish and Wildlife Service published two proposed rules impacting designations under ESA, but on 20 January 2021 the Biden administration announced a review of these proposed rules reducing the scope of habitat protections.\n\n## European Union\n\n- \u00b7 The Industrial Emissions Directive (IED) 2010 provides the framework for granting permits for major industrial sites. It lays down rules on integrated prevention and control of air, water and soil pollution arising from industrial activities. As part of the IED framework, additional emission limit values are informed by sector specific and cross-sector Best Available Technology (BAT) Conclusions. These include the BAT Conclusions for the refining sector, for large combustion plants as well as common wastewater and waste gas treatment and management systems in the chemical sector. These may require bp to further reduce its emissions, particularly its air and water emissions .\n- \u00b7 The EU Regulation on substances that deplete the ozone layer 2009 (ODS Regulation) requires companies to reduce the use of ozone depleting substances (ODSs) and phase out use of certain ODSs. bp continues to replace ODSs in refrigerants and/or equipment in the EU and elsewhere, in accordance with the Montreal Protocol and related legislation.\n- \u00b7 The Medium Combustion Plants Directive 2015 (MCPD) regulates sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulates emissions and monitoring of carbon monoxide (CO) emissions from certain midsize plants. It applies to new plants and by 2025 or 2030 to existing plants, depending on their size.\n- \u00b7 The National Emission Ceilings Directive 2016 (NECD) introduces stricter emissions limits from 2020 and 2030, with new indicative national targets applying from 2025. NECD has been implemented in the UK by the National Emission Ceilings Regulations 2018. Each EU Member State was also required to produce a National Air Pollution Control Programme setting out the measures it will take to ensure compliance with the 2020 and 2030 reduction commitments.\n- \u00b7 The EU Registration, Evaluation Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) Regulation 2006 requires registration of chemical substances manufactured in or imported into the EU, together with the submission of relevant hazard and risk data.  REACH affects our manufacturing or trading/import operations in the EU. bp maintains\n\ncompliance by checking whether imports are covered by the registrations of non-EU suppliers' representatives, preparing and submitting registration dossiers to cover new manufactured and imported substances, and updating previously submitted registrations as required. Some substances registered previously, including substances supplied to us by third parties for our use, are now subject to evaluation and review for potential authorization or restriction procedures, and possible banning, by the European Chemicals Agency and EU Member State authorities.  In addition, bp's facilities and operations in several EU countries continue to undergo REACH compliance inspections by the competent authority for the respective EU Member State. An amendment to the Annex of the Regulation on classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixture (CLP Regulation) requires harmonized notification of information on hazardous materials (certain lubricant and fuel formations) to EU Member State poison centres. The uniform notification rules apply as of January 2020 for consumer products, from 2021 for professional and 2024 for industrial uses.\n\n- \u00b7 The EU Offshore Safety Directive was adopted in 2013. Its purpose is to introduce a harmonized regime aimed at reducing the potential environmental, health and safety impacts of the offshore oil and gas industry throughout EU waters. The Directive has been implemented in the UK primarily through the Offshore Installations (Offshore Safety Directive) (Safety Case etc.) Regulations 2015.\n- \u00b7 The Water Framework Directive (WFD) published in 2000 aims to protect the quantity and quality of ground and surface waters of the EU Member States. The implementation in the EU Member States is still ongoing, planned to be finalised by 2027. A Fitness Check (comprehensive policy evaluation) of the EU Water Legislation launched in 2019 concluded that the WFD is broadly fit for purpose. Future proceedings on the determination of pollutants/priority substances as well as environmental quality standards in line with the WFD may require additional compliance efforts and increased costs for managing freshwater withdrawals and discharges from bp's EU operations.\n\n## United Kingdom\n\nFollowing the UK's exit from the European Union on 31 January 2020, the UK entered a transition period which ran until 31 December 2020. During the transition period, most EU law continued to apply to the UK and therefore to bp's UK business during that period. From 1 January 2021, operative EU laws were retained in UK law by the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018. The vast majority of environment related statutory instruments passed by the UK Government in anticipation of Brexit have included no substantive changes to the current EU underlying regime, but rather seek to make the amendments required to allow their continued operation after the transition period.  The UK Government's Environment Bill and 25 Year Plan will be central to the UK's environmental regime going forward but further changes are as yet uncertain.\n\n## Other countries and regions\n\nRegulations governing the discharge of treated water have also been developed in countries outside of the US and EU. This includes regulations in Trinidad and Angola which impacts bp's production operations in those countries. In Trinidad, bp commissioned a new waste water treatment plant in 2020 to meet consent levels agreed with the regulators to apply water discharge rules arising from the Certificate of Environmental Clearance (CEC) Regulations 2001 and associated Water Pollution Rules 2007. In Angola, bp has upgraded produced water treatment systems to meet revised oil in water limits for produced water discharge under Executive Decree ED 97-14.\n\nThe Abidjan Convention, along with the Additional Protocol published in 2012, sets environmental quality standards for the discharge of chemicals to the marine environment. The convention and associated protocols has been ratified by 19 African nations including Senegal and Mauritania. bp is currently constructing the offshore facilities to include produced water management systems to meet the environmental quality standards for our future gas operations in Mauritania and Senegal.",

        "page_content": "## Environmental maritime regulations\n\nbp's shipping operations are subject to extensive national and international regulations governing operations, training, pollution prevention, liability, and insurance. These include:\n\n- \u00b7 Liability and spill prevention and planning requirements governing, among others, tankers, barges, and offshore facilities are imposed by OPA in US waters. OPA also mandates a levy on imported and domestically produced oil to fund oil spill responses. Some states, including Alaska, Washington, Oregon and California, impose additional liability for oil spills. Outside US territorial waters, bp shipping tankers are subject to international pollution prevention, liability, spill response and preparedness regulations developed through the UN's International Maritime Organization (IMO), including the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL), the International Convention on Oil Pollution, Preparedness, Response and Co-operation, and the International Convention on Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage. In April 2010, the Hazardous and Noxious Substance (HNS) Protocol 2010 was adopted to address issues that have inhibited ratification of the International Convention on Liability and Compensation for Damage in Connection with the Carriage of Hazardous and Noxious Substances by Sea 1996. As at 31 December 2020, the HNS Convention had not entered into force.\n- \u00b7 A global sulphur cap of 0.5% applies to marine fuel under MARPOL. In order to comply, ships either need to consume low sulphur marine fuels, operate on alternative low sulphur fuels such as LNG or implement approved abatement technology to enable them to meet the low sulphur emissions requirements while continuing to use higher sulphur fuel. This global cap does not alter the lower limits that apply in the sulphur oxides Emissions Control Areas established by the IMO.\n- \u00b7 The Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic (OSPAR), aims to protect the marine environment of the North-East Atlantic. The OSPAR 2012 Recommendation and Guideline for the implementation of a riskbased approach to the management of produced water discharges from offshore installations in the North Sea supports a key goal of working towards eliminating harmful discharges. In 2020 the International Association of Oil and Gas Producers issued a report 'Oil And Gas Risk Based Assessment of Offshore Produced Water Discharges' which presents industry good practice and aims to broaden the understanding and acceptance of Risk Based Assessment (RBA) techniques internationally and improve consistency in the application of assumptions, levels of conservatism, and selection of risk endpoints.\n\nTo meet its financial responsibility requirements, bp Shipping maintains marine oil pollution liability insurance in respect of its operated ships to a maximum limit of $1 billion for each occurrence through mutual insurance associations (P&I Clubs), although there can be no assurance that a spill would necessarily be adequately covered by insurance or that liabilities would not exceed insurance recoveries.\n\n## International trade sanctions\n\nDuring the period covered by this report, non-US subsidiaries \u00ab , or other non-US entities of BP, conducted limited activities in, or with persons from, certain countries identified by the US Department of State as State Sponsors of Terrorism or otherwise subject to US and EU sanctions (Sanctioned Countries). Sanctions restrictions continue to be insignificant to the group's financial condition and results of operations. BP monitors its activities with Sanctioned Countries, persons from Sanctioned Countries and individuals and companies subject to US, EU and (following the end of the Brexit transition period) UK sanctions and seeks to comply with applicable sanctions laws and regulations.\n\nBP has a 28.83% interest in and operates the Shah Deniz field in Azerbaijan (Shah Deniz), has a 28.83% interest in and performs some operations for a related gas pipeline entity, South Caucasus Pipeline Company Limited (SCPC), and has a 23% non-operating interest in a related gas marketing entity, Azerbaijan Gas Supply Company Limited (AGSC). Naftiran Intertrade Co. Limited and NICO SPV Limited (collectively, NICO) have a 10% non-operating interest in each of Shah\n\n\u00ab\n\nDeniz and SCPC and an 8% non-operating interest in AGSC. Shah Deniz, SCPC and AGSC continue in operation as they were excluded from the application of US sanctions and fall within the exception for certain natural gas projects under Section 603 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 (ITRA).\n\nOn 3 December 2018 BP entered into an agreement with, among others, SOCAR and NICO pursuant to which SOCAR pays to BP Exploration (Shah Deniz) Limited (BPXSD), as the Shah Deniz operator, compensation for NICO's waiver of its right to lift its share of Shah Deniz condensate. Such amounts are used to cover cash calls to NICO in respect of operating costs due from NICO to BPXSD. On 26 October 2020, OFAC issued an amended licence in relation to these arrangements.\n\nFollowing the imposition in 2011 of further US and EU sanctions against Syria, BP terminated all sales of crude oil and petroleum products into Syria, though BP continues to supply aviation fuel to non-governmental Syrian resellers outside of Syria.\n\nBP has a joint arrangement in Cuba which imports, manufactures, markets and sells lubricants.\n\nDuring 2014, the US and the EU imposed sanctions on certain sectors of the Russian economy (energy, finance and defence/military) and on certain individuals and entities, including Rosneft. These sectoral sanctions include restrictions on the provision of financial assistance, technical assistance, and services in relation to exploration and production activity in deep water, shale, and offshore Arctic.\n\nAdditional US sanctions have been imposed since 2014, broadening the scope of US sanctions on Russia-related activity to include certain international deep water, shale, and offshore Arctic projects as well as the provision of goods and services for Russian energy export pipelines. As of 1 January 2021, as a result of the UK's exit from the EU, the UK has also imposed Russian-related sanctions, which are broadly similar to existing EU sanctions.\n\nWe are not aware of any material adverse effect on our current income and investment in Russia or elsewhere as a consequence of these sanctions.\n\nBP maintains bank accounts and has registered and paid required fees to maintain registrations of patents and trademarks in certain Sanctioned Countries.\n\nBP has equity interests in non-operated joint arrangements \u00ab with air fuel sellers, resellers, and fuel delivery services around the world.\n\nFrom time to time, the joint arrangement operator or other partners may sell or deliver fuel to airlines from Sanctioned Countries or flights to Sanctioned Countries, without BP's involvement.\n\nBP has no control over the activities non-controlled associates \u00ab may undertake in Sanctioned Countries or with persons from Sanctioned Countries.\n\n## Disclosure pursuant to ITRA Section 219\n\nTo our knowledge, none of BP's activities, transactions or dealings are required to be disclosed pursuant to ITRA Section 219, with the following possible exceptions.\n\nOn 17 July 2018, BP Iran Limited terminated its lease of an office in Tehran. The office had been used for administrative activities. In 2020, taxes with an aggregate US dollar equivalent value of approximately $20,000 were paid from a BP trust account held with Tadvin Co. to Iranian public entities. No gross revenues or net profits were attributable to these activities.\n\nBP has a 29.3% interest in Middle East Lubricants Company LLC (Melubco), which is established and manufactures lubricants in the United Arab Emirates. In May 2020,  Melubco successfully appealed an Iranian court judgment obtained against it in absentia for non-payment of shipping fees. The applicant, an Iranian shipping company, had confused Melubco with an unrelated, but similarly named, Iranian entity. In order to do so, Melubco paid court filing fees equivalent to approximately $3,000 to the Tehran Judicial Services Office. Melubco does not, and has never, done business in Iran.",

For further details of the Consent Decree and the Settlement Agreement, see Legal proceedings in bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2015 .\n\n## Property, plant and equipment\n\nbp has freehold and leasehold interests in real estate and other tangible assets in numerous countries, but no individual property is significant to the group as a whole. For more on the significant subsidiaries \u00ab of the group at 31 December 2020 and the group percentage of ordinary share capital see Financial statements - Note 37. For information on significant joint ventures \u00ab and associates \u00ab of the group see Financial statements Notes 16 and 17.\n\n## Related-party transactions\n\nTransactions between the group and its significant joint ventures and associates are summarized in Financial statements - Note 16 and Note 17. In the ordinary course of its business, the group enters into transactions with various organizations with which some of its directors or executive officers are associated. Except as described in this report, the group did not have any material transactions or transactions of an unusual nature with, and did not make loans to, related parties in the period commencing 1 January 2020 to 2 March 2021.\n\n## Corporate governance practices\n\nIn the US, bp ADSs are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The significant differences between bp's corporate governance practices as a UK company and those required by NYSE listing standards for US companies are listed as follows:\n\n## Independence\n\nIn 2020 bp continued to apply its board governance principles. These reflect the UK Corporate Governance Code approach to corporate governance. As such, the way in which bp makes determinations of directors' independence differs from the NYSE rules. As set out on page 88, from 1 January 2021 bp has adopted terms of reference for the board and each of its committees.\n\nbp's board governance principles require that all non-executive directors be determined by the board to be 'independent in character and judgement and free from any business or other relationship which could materially interfere with the exercise of their judgement'. The bp board has determined that, in its judgement, all of the non-executive directors are independent. In doing so, however, the board did not explicitly take into consideration the independence requirements outlined in the NYSE's listing standards.\n\n## Committees\n\nbp has a number of board committees that are broadly comparable in purpose and composition to those required by NYSE rules for domestic US companies. For instance, bp has a remuneration (rather than a compensation) committee. bp also has an audit committee, which NYSE rules require for both US companies and foreign private issuers. These committees are composed solely of non-executive directors whom the board has determined to be independent, in the manner described above.\n\nThe bp board governance principles prescribe the composition, main tasks and requirements of each of the committees (see the board committee\n\nreports on pages 92-102 and 105). Therefore, during 2020 bp did not have separate charters for each committee. As from the start of 2021 each of the board committees has adopted its own terms of reference which set out their respective roles and responsibilities.\n\nUnder US securities law and the listing standards of the NYSE, bp is required to have an audit committee that satisfies the requirements of Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act and Section 303A.06 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual. bp's audit committee complies with these requirements. The bp audit committee does not have direct responsibility for the appointment, reappointment or removal of the independent auditors. Instead, it follows the UK Companies Act 2006 and the UK Corporate Governance code 2018 by making recommendations to the board on these matters for it to put forward for shareholder approval at the AGM.\n\nOne of the NYSE's additional requirements for the audit committee states that at least one member of the audit committee is to have 'accounting or related financial management expertise'. The board determined that Brendan Nelson possesses such expertise and also possesses the financial and audit committee experiences set forth in both the UK Corporate Governance Code and SEC rules (see Audit committee report on page 94). Mr Nelson is the audit committee financial expert as defined in Item 16A of Form 20-F.\n\n## Shareholder approval of equity compensation plans\n\nThe NYSE rules for US companies require that shareholders must be given the opportunity to vote on all equity-compensation plans and material revisions to those plans. bp complies with UK requirements that are similar to the NYSE rules. The board, however, does not explicitly take into consideration the NYSE's detailed definition of what are considered 'material revisions'.\n\n## Code of ethics\n\nThe NYSE rules require that US companies adopt and disclose a code of business conduct and ethics for directors, officers and employees. bp has adopted a code of conduct, which applies to all employees and members of the board, and has board governance principles that address the conduct of directors. In addition bp has adopted a code of ethics for senior financial officers as required by the SEC. bp considers that these codes and policies address the matters specified in the NYSE rules for US companies.\n\n## Code of ethics\n\nThe company has adopted a code of ethics for its group chief executive, chief financial officer, group controller, group head of audit and chief accounting officer as required by the provisions of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules issued by the SEC. There have been no waivers from the code of ethics relating to any officers.\n\nbp also has a code of conduct, which is applicable to all employees, officers and members of the board. This was updated (and published) in July 2014.\n\n## Controls and procedures\n\n## Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures\n\nThe company maintains 'disclosure controls and procedures', as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports the company files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the company's group chief executive and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\n\nIn designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management, including the group chief executive and chief financial officer, recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud within the company, if any, have been",

        "page_content": "detected. Further, in the design and evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures our management necessarily was required to apply its judgement in evaluating the costs and benefits of possible control and procedure design options. Also, we have investments in unconsolidated entities. As we do not control these entities, our disclosure controls and procedures with respect to such entities are necessarily substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries \u00ab . Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. The company's disclosure controls and procedures have been designed to meet, and management believes that they meet, reasonable assurance standards.\n\nThe company's management, with the participation of the company's group chief executive and chief financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the company's disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b) as of the end of the period covered by this annual report. Based on that evaluation, the group chief executive and chief financial officer have concluded that the company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level.\n\n## Management's report on internal control over financial reporting\n\nManagement of bp is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. bp's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the principal executive and financial officers to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of bp's financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with IFRS.\n\nAs of the end of the 2020 fiscal year, management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the criteria in the UK Financial Reporting Council's Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and Business Reporting relating to internal control over financial reporting. Based on this assessment, management has determined that bp's internal control over financial reporting as of 31 December 2020 was effective.\n\nThe company's internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets; provide reasonable assurances that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors of bp; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of bp's assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. bp's internal control over financial reporting as of 31 December 2020 has been audited by Deloitte LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report appearing on page 154 of bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2020 .\n\n## Changes in internal control over financial reporting\n\nThere were no changes in the group's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by the Form 20-F that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Principal accountant's fees and services\n\nThe audit committee has established policies and procedures for the engagement of the independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte LLP, to render audit and certain assurance services. The policies provide for pre-approval by the audit committee of specifically defined audit, audit-related, non-audit and other services that are not prohibited by regulatory or other professional requirements. Deloitte is engaged for these services when its expertise and experience of bp are important. Most of this work is of an audit nature. The committee regularly reviews\n\n\u00ab\n\nthe policy, including in 2020, when it was updated to reflect changes resulting from the FRC Ethical Standard (December 2019).\n\nUnder the policy, pre-approval is given for specific services within the following categories: advice on accounting, auditing and financial reporting matters; internal accounting and risk management control reviews (excluding any services relating to information systems design and implementation); non-statutory audit; project assurance and advice on business and accounting process improvement (excluding any services relating to information systems design and implementation relating to bp's financial statements or accounting records); provision of, or access to, Deloitte publications, workshops, seminars and other training materials; provision of reports from data gathered on non-financial policies and information; provision of the independent third party audit in accordance with US Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards, over the company's Conflict Minerals Report - where such a report is required under the SEC rule 'Conflict Minerals', issued in accordance with Section 1502 of the Dodd Frank Act; and assistance with understanding non-financial regulatory requirements. bp operates a two-tier system for audit and non-audit services. For audit related services, the audit committee has a pre-approved aggregate level, within which specific work may be approved by management. Non-audit services are preapproved for management to authorize per individual engagement, but above a defined level must be approved by the chairman of the audit committee or the full committee. In response to the revised regulatory guidelines of the UK Financial Reporting Council, the audit committee reviewed and updated its policies with effect from 1 January 2017 and in 2018 further updated its policies to clarify the engagement of the incoming auditor, Deloitte, and the outgoing auditor Ernst & Young to ensure independence. The defined maximum level for pre-approval has been reduced in line with FRC guidance on 'non-trivial' engagements. The audit committee has delegated to the chairman of the audit committee authority to approve permitted services provided that the chairman reports any decisions to the committee at its next scheduled meeting. Any proposed service not included in the approved service list must be approved in advance by the audit committee chairman and reported to the committee, or approved by the full audit committee in advance of commencement of the engagement.\n\nThe audit committee evaluates the performance of the auditor each year. The audit fees payable to Deloitte are reviewed by the committee in the context of other global companies for cost effectiveness. The committee keeps under review the scope and results of audit work and the independence and objectivity of the auditor. External regulation and bp policy requires the auditor to rotate its lead audit partner every five years. See Financial statements - Note 36 and Audit committee report on page 94 for details of fees for services provided by the auditor.\n\n## Directors' report information\n\nThis section of bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2020 forms part of, and includes certain disclosures which are required by law to be included in, the Directors' report.\n\n## Indemnity provisions\n\nIn accordance with BP's Articles of Association, on appointment each director is granted an indemnity from the company in respect of liabilities incurred as a result of their office, to the extent permitted by law. These indemnities were in force throughout the financial year and at the date of this report. In respect of those liabilities for which directors may not be indemnified, the company maintained a directors' and officers' liability insurance policy throughout 2020. During the year, a review of the terms and scope of the policy was undertaken as part of the annual renewal. Although their defence costs may be met, neither the company's indemnity nor insurance provides cover in the event that the director is proved to have acted fraudulently or dishonestly. Certain subsidiaries \u00ab are trustees of the group's pension schemes. Each director of these subsidiaries is granted an indemnity from the company in respect of liabilities incurred as a result of such a subsidiary's activities as a trustee of the pension scheme, to the extent permitted by law. These indemnities were in force throughout the financial year and at the date of this report.",

        "page_content": "## Share prices and listings\n\n## Markets and market prices\n\nThe primary market for the company's ordinary shares (trading symbol 'BP.'), 8% cumulative first preference shares (trading symbol 'BP.A') and 9% cumulative second preference shares (trading symbol 'BP.B') is the London Stock Exchange (LSE). The company's ordinary shares are a constituent element of the Financial Times Stock Exchange 100 Index.\n\nIn the US, the company's securities are listed and traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in the form of ADSs (trading symbol 'BP'), for which JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is the depositary (the Depositary) and transfer agent. The Depositary's principal office is 383 Madison Avenue, Floor 11, New York, NY, 10179, US. Each ADS represents six ordinary shares. ADSs are evidenced by American depositary receipts (ADRs), which may be issued in either certificated or book entry form.\n\nThe company's ordinary shares are also traded in the form of a global depositary certificate representing the company's ordinary shares on the Frankfurt, Hamburg and Dusseldorf Stock Exchanges.\n\nOn 25 February 2021, 849,802,947 ADSs (equivalent to approximately 5,098,817,682 ordinary shares or some 25.06%  of the total issued share capital, excluding shares held in treasury) were outstanding and were held by approximately  72,535 ADS holders. Of these, about 71,703 had registered addresses in the US at that date. One of the registered holders of ADSs represents approximately 1,087,342 underlying holders.\n\nOn 25 February 2021, there were approximately 225,319 ordinary shareholders. Of these shareholders, around 1,539 had registered addresses in the US and held a total of some 4,381,925 ordinary shares.\n\nSince a number of the ordinary shares and ADSs were held by brokers and other nominees, the number of holders in the US may not be representative of the number of beneficial holders or their respective country of residence.\n\n## Dividends\n\nThe company's current policy is to pay interim dividends on a quarterly basis on its ordinary shares.\n\nIts policy is also to announce dividends for ordinary shares in US dollars and state an equivalent sterling dividend. Dividends on the company's ordinary shares will be paid in sterling and on the company's ADSs in US dollars. The rate of exchange used to determine the sterling amount equivalent is the average of the market exchange rates in London over the four business days prior to the sterling equivalent announcement date. The directors may choose to declare dividends in any currency provided that a sterling equivalent is announced. It is not the company's intention to change its current policy of announcing dividends on ordinary shares in US dollars.\n\nInformation regarding dividends announced and paid by the company on ordinary shares and preference shares is provided in Financial statements - Note 10.\n\nA Scrip Dividend Programme (Scrip Programme) was approved by shareholders in 2010 and was renewed for a further three years at the 2018 AGM. It is proposed that the Scrip Programme be renewed for a further three years at the 2021 AGM. It enabled the company's ordinary shareholders and ADS holders to elect to receive dividends by way of new fully paid ordinary shares (or ADSs in the case of ADS holders) instead of cash. The operation of the Scrip Programme is always subject to the directors' decision to make the Scrip Programme offer available in respect of any particular dividend.\n\nThe company announced on 29 October 2019 and as part of all subsequent quarterly results announcements made since that the board had suspended the Scrip Programme in respect of those quarterly dividends. Ordinary shareholders and ADS holders (subject to certain exceptions) may be able to participate in dividend reinvestment plans. Any decisions with respect to future dividends will be made by the board of BP p.l.c. following the end of each quarter.\n\nFuture dividends will be dependent on future earnings, the financial condition of the group, the Risk factors set out on page 67 and other matters that may affect the business of the group set out in Our strategy on page 15 and in Liquidity and capital resources on page 306.\n\n\u00ab\n\nThe following table shows dividends announced and paid by the company per ADS for the past five years.\n\n| Dividends per ADS a   | Dividends per ADS a   | March   |   June |   September | December   | Total           |\n|-----------------------|-----------------------|---------|--------|-------------|------------|-----------------|\n| 2016                  | UK pence   42.08      |         |  41.5  |       45.35 |            | 47.59    176.52 |\n|                       | US cents              | 60      |  60    |       60    | 60         | 240             |\n| 2017                  | UK pence   48.95      |         |  46.54 |       45.73 |            | 44.66    185.88 |\n|                       | US cents              | 60      |  60    |       60    | 60         | 240             |\n| 2018                  | UK pence   43.01      |         |  44.66 |       47.58 |            | 48.15    183.40 |\n|                       | US cents              | 60      |  60    |       61.5  | 61.50      | 243             |\n| 2019                  | UK pence   46.43      |         |  48.39 |       50.09 |            | 46.95    191.86 |\n|                       | US cents   61.50      |         |  61.5  |       61.5  | 61.50      | 246             |\n| 2020                  | UK pence   48.94      |         |  50.05 |       24.26 |            | 23.50    146.75 |\n|                       | US cents              | 63.00   |  63    |       31.5  | 31.50      | 189             |\n\nThere are currently no UK foreign exchange controls or restrictions on remittances of dividends on the ordinary shares or on the conduct of the company's operations, other than restrictions applicable to certain countries and persons subject to EU economic sanctions or those sanctions adopted by the UK government which implement resolutions of the Security Council of the United Nations.\n\n## Shareholder taxation information\n\nThis section describes the material US federal income tax and UK taxation consequences of owning ordinary shares or ADSs to a US holder who holds the ordinary shares or ADSs as capital assets for tax purposes. It does not apply, however, inter alia to members of special classes of holders some of which may be subject to other rules, including: taxexempt entities, life insurance companies, dealers in securities, traders in securities that elect a mark-to-market method of accounting for securities holdings, investors liable for alternative minimum tax, holders that, directly or indirectly, hold 10% or more of the company's shares (as measured by voting power or value), holders that hold the shares or ADSs as part of a straddle or a hedging or conversion transaction, holders that purchase or sell the shares or ADSs as part of a wash sale for US federal income tax purposes, or holders whose functional currency is not the US dollar. In addition, if a partnership holds the shares or ADSs, the US federal income tax treatment of a partner will generally depend on the status of the partner and the tax treatment of the partnership and may not be described fully below.\n\nA US holder is any beneficial owner of ordinary shares or ADSs that is for US federal income tax purposes (1) a citizen or resident of the US, (2) a US domestic corporation, (3) an estate whose income is subject to US federal income taxation regardless of its source, or (4) a trust if a US court can exercise primary supervision over the trust's administration and one or more US persons are authorized to control all substantial decisions of the trust.\n\nThis section is based on the tax laws of the United States, including the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, its legislative history, existing and proposed US Treasury regulations thereunder, published rulings and court decisions, and the taxation laws of the UK, all as currently in effect, as well as the income tax convention between the US and the UK that entered into force on 31 March 2003 (the 'Treaty'). These laws are subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis. This section further assumes that each obligation under the terms of the deposit agreement relating to bp ADSs and any related agreement will be performed in accordance with its terms.\n\nFor purposes of the Treaty and the estate and gift tax Convention (the 'Estate Tax Convention') and for US federal income tax and UK taxation purposes, a holder of ADRs evidencing ADSs will be treated as the owner of the company's ordinary shares represented by those ADRs. Exchanges of ordinary shares for ADRs and ADRs for ordinary shares generally will not be subject to US federal income tax or to UK taxation other than stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax, as described below.",

        "page_content": "Investors should consult their own tax adviser regarding the US federal, state and local, UK and other tax consequences of owning and disposing of ordinary shares and ADSs in their particular circumstances, and in particular whether they are eligible for the benefits of the Treaty in respect of their investment in the shares or ADSs.\n\n## Taxation of dividends\n\n## UK taxation\n\nUnder current UK taxation law, no withholding tax will be deducted from dividends paid by the company, including dividends paid to US holders. A shareholder that is a company resident for tax purposes in the UK or trading in the UK through a permanent establishment generally will not be taxable in the UK on a dividend it receives from the company. A shareholder who is an individual resident for tax purposes in the UK is subject to UK tax on dividends received from the company, including dividends received under the dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP) for ordinary shareholders, but until 5 April 2016, was entitled to a tax credit on cash dividends paid on ordinary shares or ADSs of the company equal to one-ninth of the cash dividend.\n\nFrom 6 April 2016 the dividend tax credit was replaced by a new tax-free dividend allowance and dividends paid by the company on or after 6 April 2016 do not carry a UK tax credit. The dividend allowance was \u00a35,000 but this has been reduced to \u00a32,000 as of 6 April 2018.\n\nThe dividend allowance of \u00a32,000 means there is no UK tax due on the first \u00a32,000 of dividends received. Dividends above this level are subject to tax at 7.5%  for basic tax payers, 32.5%  for higher rate tax payers and 38.1%  for additional rate tax payers.\n\nAlthough the first \u00a32,000 of dividend income is not subject to UK income tax, it does not reduce the total income for tax purposes. Dividends within the dividend allowance still count towards basic or higher rate bands, and may therefore affect the rate of tax paid on dividends received in excess of the \u00a32,000 allowance. For instance, if an individual has an annual gross salary of \u00a350,000 and also receives a dividend of \u00a312,000 they will be subject to the following scenario. The individual's personal allowance and the basic rate tax band will be used up by the gross salary. The remaining part of the salary and the whole of the dividend will be subject to tax at the higher rate, although the dividend allowance will reduce the amount of dividend subject to tax. The dividend of \u00a312,000 will be reduced by the dividend allowance of \u00a32,000 leaving taxable dividend income of \u00a310,000. The dividend will be taxed at 32.5%  so that the total tax payable on the dividends is \u00a33,250.\n\nHow the shareholder pays the tax arising on the dividend income depends on the amount of dividend income and salary they receive in the tax year. If less than \u00a32,000 they will not need to report anything or pay any tax. If between \u00a32,000 and \u00a310,000, the shareholder can pay what they owe by: contacting the helpline; asking HMRC to change their tax code - the tax will be taken from their wages or pension or through completion of the 'Dividends' section of their tax return, where one is being filed. If over \u00a310,000 they will be required to file a self-assessment tax return and should complete the 'Dividends' section with details of the amounts received.\n\n## US federal income taxation\n\nA US holder is subject to US federal income taxation on the gross amount of any dividend paid by the company (including dividends paid but reinvested received under the Global Invest Direct (GID) Dividend Reinvestment Plan for ADS holders)  out of its current or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined for US federal income tax purposes). Dividends paid to a non-corporate US holder that constitute qualified dividend income will be taxable to the holder at a preferential rate, provided that the holder has a holding period in the ordinary shares or ADSs of more than 60 days during the 121-day period beginning 60 days before the ex-dividend date and meets other holding period requirements. Dividends paid by the company with respect to the ordinary shares or ADSs will generally be qualified dividend income.\n\nFor US federal income tax purposes, a dividend must be included in income when the US holder, in the case of ordinary shares, or the Depositary, in the case of ADSs, actually or constructively receives the dividend and will not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction generally allowed to US corporations in respect of dividends received from other US corporations. US ADS holders should consult their own tax\n\n## Shareholder information\n\nadviser regarding the US tax treatment of the dividend fee in respect of dividends. Dividends will be income from sources outside the US and generally will be 'passive category income' or, in the case of certain US holders, 'general category income', each of which is treated separately for purposes of computing a US holder's foreign tax credit limitation.\n\nAs noted above in UK taxation, a US holder will not be subject to UK withholding tax. Accordingly, the receipt of a dividend will not entitle the US holder to a foreign tax credit.\n\nThe amount of the dividend distribution on the ordinary shares that is paid in pounds sterling will be the US dollar value of the pounds sterling payments made, determined at the spot pounds sterling/US dollar rate on the date the dividend distribution is includible in income, regardless of whether the payment is, in fact, converted into US dollars. Generally, any gain or loss resulting from currency exchange fluctuations during the period from the date the pounds sterling dividend payment is includible in income to the date the payment is converted into US dollars will be treated as ordinary income or loss and will not be eligible for the preferential tax rate on qualified dividend income. The gain or loss generally will be income or loss from sources within the US for foreign tax credit limitation purposes.\n\nDistributions in excess of the company's earnings and profits, as determined for US federal income tax purposes, will be treated as a return of capital to the extent of the US holder's basis in the ordinary shares or ADSs and thereafter as capital gain, subject to taxation as described in Taxation of capital gains - US federal income taxation section below.\n\nIn addition, the taxation of dividends may be subject to the rules for passive foreign investment companies (PFIC), described below under 'Taxation of capital gains - US federal income taxation'. Distributions made by a PFIC do not constitute qualified dividend income and are not eligible for the preferential tax rate applicable to such income.\n\n## Taxation of capital gains\n\n## UK taxation\n\nA US holder may be liable for both UK and US tax in respect of a gain on the disposal of ordinary shares or ADSs if the US holder is (1) resident for tax purposes in the United Kingdom at the date of disposal, (2) if he or she has left the UK for a period not exceeding five complete tax years between the year of departure from and the year of return to the UK and acquired the shares before leaving the UK and was resident in the UK in the previous four out of seven tax years before the year of departure, (3) a US domestic corporation resident in the UK by reason of its business being managed or controlled in the UK or (4) a citizen of the US that carries on a trade or profession or vocation in the UK through a branch or agency or a corporation that carries on a trade, profession or vocation in the UK, through a permanent establishment, and that has used, held, or acquired the ordinary shares or ADSs for the purposes of such trade, profession or vocation of such branch, agency or permanent establishment. However, such persons may be entitled to a tax credit against their US federal income tax liability for the amount of UK capital gains tax or UK corporation tax on chargeable gains (as the case may be) that is paid in respect of such gain.\n\nUnder the Treaty, capital gains on dispositions of ordinary shares or ADSs generally will be subject to tax only in the jurisdiction of residence of the relevant holder as determined under both the laws of the UK and the US and as required by the terms of the Treaty.\n\nUnder the Treaty, individuals who are residents of either the UK or the US and who have been residents of the other jurisdiction (the US or the UK, as the case may be) at any time during the six years immediately preceding the relevant disposal of ordinary shares or ADSs may be subject to tax with respect to capital gains arising from a disposition of ordinary shares or ADSs of the company not only in the jurisdiction of which the holder is resident at the time of the disposition but also in the other jurisdiction.\n\nFor gains on or after 23 June 2010, the UK Capital Gains Tax rate will be dependent on the level of an individual's taxable income. Where total taxable income and gains after all allowable deductions are less than the upper limit of the basic rate income tax band of \u00a337,500 (for 2020/21), the rate of Capital Gains Tax will be 10% . For gains (and any parts of gains) above that limit the rate will be 20% .",

        "page_content": "From 6 April 2008, entitlement to the annual exemption is based on an individual's circumstances (taking into account Domicile status, remittance basis of taxation and number of years in the UK). For individuals who are entitled to the exemption for 2020/21, this has been set at \u00a312,300. Corporation tax on chargeable gains is levied at 19 per cent for companies from 1 April 2017.\n\n## US federal income taxation\n\nA US holder who sells or otherwise disposes of ordinary shares or ADSs will recognize a capital gain or loss for US federal income tax purposes equal to the difference between the US dollar value of the amount realized on the disposition and the US holder's tax basis, determined in US dollars, in the ordinary shares or ADSs. Any such capital gain or loss generally will be long-term gain or loss, subject to tax at a preferential rate for a non-corporate US holder, if the US holder's holding period for such ordinary shares or ADSs exceeds one year. The tax basis of shares acquired through reinvested dividends under the GID Dividend Reinvestment Plan for ADS holders) is equal to the fair market value of the stock on the investment date. The holding period for shares acquired under the plan begins the day after the applicable investment date.\n\nGain or loss from the sale or other disposition of ordinary shares or ADSs will generally be income or loss from sources within the US for foreign tax credit limitation purposes. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.\n\nWe do not believe that ordinary shares or ADSs will be treated as stock of a passive foreign investment company (PFIC) for US federal income tax purposes, but this conclusion is a factual determination that is made annually and thus is subject to change. If we are treated as a PFIC, unless a US holder elects to be taxed annually on a mark-to-market basis with respect to ordinary shares or ADSs, any gain realized on the sale or other disposition of ordinary shares or ADSs would in general not be treated as capital gain. Instead, a US holder would be treated as if he or she had realized such gain rateably over the holding period for ordinary shares or ADSs and would be taxed at the highest tax rate in effect for each such year to which the gain was allocated, in addition to which an interest charge in respect of the tax attributable to each such year would apply. Certain 'excess distributions' would be similarly treated if we were treated as a PFIC.\n\n## Additional tax considerations\n\n## Scrip Programme\n\nUntil the publication of the 2019 third quarter results, the company had an optional Scrip Programme, wherein holders of bp ordinary shares or ADSs could elect to receive any dividends in the form of new fully paid ordinary shares or ADSs of the company instead of cash. Please consult your tax adviser for the consequences to you.\n\n## UK inheritance tax\n\nThe Estate Tax Convention applies to inheritance tax. ADSs held by an individual who is domiciled for the purposes of the Estate Tax Convention in the US and is not for the purposes of the Estate Tax Convention a national of the UK will not be subject to UK inheritance tax on the individual's death or on transfer during the individual's lifetime unless, among other things, the ADSs are part of the business property of a permanent establishment situated in the UK used for the performance of independent personal services. In the exceptional case where ADSs are subject to both inheritance tax and US federal gift or estate tax, the Estate Tax Convention generally provides for tax payable in the US to be credited against tax payable in the UK or for tax paid in the UK to be credited against tax payable in the US, based on priority rules set forth in the Estate Tax Convention.\n\n## UK stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax\n\nThe statements below relate to what is understood to be the current practice of HM Revenue & Customs in the UK under existing law.\n\nProvided that any instrument of transfer is not executed in the UK and remains at all times outside the UK and the transfer does not relate to any matter or thing done or to be done in the UK, no UK stamp duty is payable on the acquisition or transfer of ADSs. Neither will an agreement to transfer ADSs in the form of ADRs give rise to a liability to stamp duty reserve tax.\n\nPurchases of ordinary shares, as opposed to ADSs, through the CREST system of paperless share transfers will be subject to stamp duty reserve tax at 0.5% . The charge will arise as soon as there is an agreement for the transfer of the shares (or, in the case of a conditional agreement, when the condition is fulfilled). The stamp duty reserve tax will apply to agreements to transfer ordinary shares even if the agreement is made outside the UK between two non-residents. Purchases of ordinary shares outside the CREST system are subject either to stamp duty at a rate of \u00a35 per \u00a31,000 (or part, unless the stamp duty is less than \u00a35, when no stamp duty is charged), or stamp duty reserve tax at 0.5% . Stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax are generally the liability of the purchaser.\n\nA subsequent transfer of ordinary shares to the Depositary's nominee will give rise to further stamp duty at the rate of \u00a31.50 per \u00a3100 (or part) or stamp duty reserve tax at the rate of 1.5%  of the value of the ordinary shares at the time of the transfer. For ADR holders electing to receive ADSs instead of cash, after the 2012 first quarter dividend payment, HM Revenue & Customs no longer seeks to impose 1.5%  stamp duty reserve tax on issues of UK shares and securities to non-EU clearance services and depositary receipt systems.\n\n## Major shareholders\n\nThe disclosure of certain major and significant shareholdings in the share capital of the company is governed by the Companies Act 2006, the UK Financial Conduct Authority's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules (DTR) and the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\n\n## Register of members holding bp ordinary shares as at 31 December 2020\n\n| Range of holdings   | Number of  ordinary shareholders   |   Percentage of  total ordinary  shareholders |   Percentage of  total ordinary  share capital excluding shares held in treasury |\n|---------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1-200               | 52,385                             |                                         23.06 |                                                                             0.01 |\n| 201-1,000           | 75,742                             |                                         33.35 |                                                                             0.21 |\n| 1,001-10,000        | 86,759                             |                                         38.2  |                                                                             1.36 |\n| 10,001-100,000      | 10,733                             |                                          4.73 |                                                                             1.1  |\n| 100,001-1,000,000   | 824                                |                                          0.36 |                                                                             1.45 |\n| Over 1,000,000 a    | 674                                |                                          0.3  |                                                                            95.87 |\n| Totals              | 227,117                            |                                        100    |                                                                           100    |\n\n## Register of holders of American depositary shares (ADSs) as at 31 December 2020 a\n\n| Range of holdings   | Number of ADS holders   |   Percentage of  total ADS holders |   Percentage of  total ADSs |\n|---------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| 1-200               | 43,236                  |                              59.04 |                        0.27 |\n| 201-1,000           | 19,362                  |                              26.44 |                        1.07 |\n| 1,001-10,000        | 10,198                  |                              13.92 |                        3.06 |\n| 10,001-100,000      | 432                     |                               0.59 |                        0.82 |\n| 100,001-1,000,000   | 7                       |                               0.01 |                        0.22 |\n| Over 1,000,000 b    | 1                       |                               0    |                       94.56 |\n| Totals              | 73,236                  |                             100    |                      100    |\n\nAs at 31 December 2020 there were also 1,212 preference shareholders.

A separate notice convening the meeting is distributed to shareholders, which includes an explanation of the items of business to be considered at the meeting.\n\nAll resolutions for which notice has been given will be decided on a poll. Deloitte LLP have expressed their willingness to continue in office as auditors and a resolution for their reappointment is included in the Notice of  bp Annual General Meeting  2021 .\n\n## Memorandum and Articles of Association\n\nThe following summarizes certain provisions of the company's Memorandum and Articles of Association and applicable English law. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the UK Companies Act 2006 (the Act) and the company's Memorandum and Articles of Association. The Memorandum and Articles of Association are available online at bp.com/usefuldocs .\n\nThe company's Articles of Association may be amended by a special resolution at a general meeting of the shareholders. At the annual general meeting (AGM) held on 21 May 2018 shareholders voted to adopt new Articles of Association to reflect developments in market practice and to provide clarification and additional flexibility where necessary or appropriate.\n\n## Objects and purposes\n\n## Shareholder information\n\nbp is a public company limited by shares, incorporated under the name BP p.l.c. and is registered in England and Wales with the registered number 102498. The provisions regulating the operations of the company, known as its 'objects', were historically stated in a company's memorandum. The Act abolished the need to have object provisions and so at the AGM held on 15 April 2010 shareholders approved the removal of its objects clause together with all other provisions of its Memorandum that, by virtue of the Act, are treated as forming part of the company's Articles of Association.\n\n## Directors and secretary\n\nThe business and affairs of bp shall be managed by the directors. The company's Articles of Association provide that directors may be appointed by the existing directors or by the shareholders in a general meeting. Any person appointed by the directors will hold office only until the next general meeting, notice of which is first given after their appointment and will then be eligible for re-election by the shareholders. A director may be removed by bp as provided for by applicable law and shall vacate office in certain circumstances as set out in the Articles of Association. In addition the company may, by special resolution, remove a director before the expiration of his/her period of office and, subject to the Articles of Association, may by ordinary resolution appoint another person to be a director instead. There is no requirement for a director to retire on reaching any age.\n\nThe Articles of Association place a general prohibition on a director voting in respect of any contract or arrangement in which the director has a material interest other than by virtue of such director's interest in shares in the company. However, in the absence of some other material interest not indicated below, a director is entitled to vote and to be counted in a quorum for the purpose of any vote relating to a resolution concerning the following matters:\n\n- \u00b7 The giving of security or indemnity with respect to any money lent or obligation taken by the director at the request or benefit of the company or any of its subsidiary undertakings.\n- \u00b7 Any proposal in which the director is interested, concerning the underwriting of company securities or debentures or the giving of any security to a third party for a debt or obligation of the company or any of its subsidiary undertakings.\n- \u00b7 Any proposal concerning any other company in which the director is interested, directly or indirectly (whether as an officer or shareholder or otherwise) provided that the director and persons connected with such director are not the holder or holders of 1%  or more of the voting interest in the shares of such company.\n- \u00b7 Any proposal concerning the purchase or maintenance of any insurance policy under which the director may benefit.\n- \u00b7 Any proposal concerning the giving to the director of any other indemnity which is on substantially the same terms as indemnities given or to be given to all of the other directors or to the funding by the company of his expenditure on defending proceedings or the doing by the company of anything to enable the director to avoid incurring such expenditure where all other directors have been given or are to be given substantially the same arrangements.\n- \u00b7 Any proposal concerning an arrangement for the benefit of the employees and directors or former employees and former directors of the company or any of its subsidiary undertakings, including but without being limited to a retirement benefits scheme and an employees' share scheme, which does not accord to any director any privilege or advantage not generally accorded to the employees or former employees to whom the arrangement relates.\n\nThe Act requires a director of a company who is in any way interested in a contract or proposed contract with the company to declare the nature of the director's interest at a meeting of the directors of the company. The definition of 'interest' includes the interests of spouses, children, companies and trusts. The Act also requires that a director must avoid a situation where a director has, or could have, a direct or indirect interest that conflicts, or possibly may conflict, with the company's interests. The Act allows directors of public companies to authorize such conflicts where appropriate, if a company's Articles of Association so permit. bp's Articles of Association permit the authorization of such conflicts. The directors may exercise all the powers of the company to borrow money, except",

        "page_content": "that the amount remaining undischarged of all moneys borrowed by the company shall not, without approval of the shareholders, exceed two times the amount paid up on the share capital plus the aggregate of the amount of the capital and revenue reserves of the company. Variation of the borrowing power of the board may only be affected by amending the Articles of Association.\n\nRemuneration of non-executive directors shall be determined in the aggregate by resolution of the shareholders. Remuneration of executive directors is determined by the remuneration committee. This committee is made up of non-executive directors only. There is no requirement of share ownership for a director's qualification.\n\nThe Articles of Association provide entitlement to the directors' pensions and death and disability benefits to the directors' relations and dependants respectively.\n\nThe circumstances in which a director's office will automatically terminate include: when a director ceases to hold an executive office of the company and the directors resolve that he should cease to be a director; if a medical practitioner provides an opinion that a director has become incapable of acting as a director and may remain so incapable for a further three months and the directors resolve that he should cease to be a director; and if all of the other directors vote in favour of a resolution stating that the person should cease to be a director.\n\nThe company secretary has express powers to delegate any of the powers or discretions conferred on him or her.\n\n## Dividend rights; other rights to share in company profits; capital calls\n\nIf recommended by the directors of bp, shareholders of bp may, by resolution, declare dividends but no such dividend may be declared in excess of the amount recommended by the directors. The directors may also pay interim dividends without obtaining shareholder approval. No dividend may be paid other than out of profits available for distribution, as determined under IFRS and the Act. Dividends on ordinary shares are payable only after payment of dividends on bp preference shares. Any dividend unclaimed after a period of 10 years from the date of declaration of such dividend shall be forfeited and reverts to bp. If the company exercises its right to forfeit shares and sells shares belonging to an untraced shareholder then any entitlement to claim dividends or other monies unclaimed in respect of those shares will be for a period of twelve months after the sale. The company may take such steps as the directors decide are appropriate in the circumstances to trace the member entitled and the sale may be made at such time and on such terms as the directors may decide.\n\nThe directors have the power to declare and pay dividends in any currency provided that a sterling equivalent is announced. It is not the company's intention to change its current policy of paying dividends in US dollars. At the company's AGM held on 15 April 2010, shareholders approved the introduction of a Scrip Dividend Programme (Scrip Programme) and to include provisions in the Articles of Association to enable the company to operate the Scrip Programme. The Scrip Programme was renewed at the company's AGM held on 21 May 2018 for a further three years. The Scrip Programme enables ordinary shareholders and bp ADS holders to elect to receive new fully paid ordinary shares (or bp ADSs in the case of bp ADS holders) instead of cash. The operation of the Scrip Programme is always subject to the directors' decision to make the scrip offer available in respect of any particular dividend. Should the directors decide not to offer the scrip in respect of any particular dividend, cash will automatically be paid instead. The directors may determine in relation to any scrip dividend plan or programme how the costs of the programme will be met, the minimum number of ordinary shares required in order to be able to participate in the programme and any arrangements to deal with legal and practical difficulties in any particular territory.\n\nApart from shareholders' rights to share in bp's profits by dividend (if any is declared or announced), the Articles of Association provide that the directors may set aside:\n\n- \u00b7 A special reserve fund out of the balance of profits each year to make up any deficit of cumulative dividend on the bp preference shares.\n- \u00b7 A general reserve out of the balance of profits each year, which shall be applicable for any purpose to which the profits of the company may properly be applied. This may include capitalization of such sum, pursuant to an ordinary shareholders' resolution, and distribution to\n\nshareholders as if it were distributed by way of a dividend on the ordinary shares or in paying up in full unissued ordinary shares for allotment and distribution as bonus shares.\n\nAny such sums so deposited may be distributed in accordance with the manner of distribution of dividends as described above.\n\nHolders of shares are not subject to calls on capital by the company, provided that the amounts required to be paid on issue have been paid off. All shares are fully paid.\n\n## Share transfers and share certificates\n\nThe directors may permit transfers to be effected other than by an instrument in writing and that share certificates will not be required to be issued by the company if they are not required by law.\n\nThe company may charge an administrative fee in the event that a shareholder wishes to replace two or more certificates representing shares with a single certificate or wishes to surrender a single certificate and replace it with two or more certificates. All certificates are sent at the member's risk.\n\n## Voting rights\n\nThe Articles of Association of the company provide that voting on resolutions at a shareholders' meeting will be decided on a poll other than resolutions of a procedural nature, which may be decided on a show of hands. If voting is on a poll, every shareholder who is present in person or by proxy has one vote for every ordinary share held and two votes for every \u00a35 in nominal amount of bp preference shares held. If voting is on a show of hands, each shareholder who is present at the meeting in person or whose duly appointed proxy is present in person will have one vote, regardless of the number of shares held, unless a poll is requested.\n\nShareholders do not have cumulative voting rights.\n\nFor the purposes of determining which persons are entitled to attend or vote at a shareholders' meeting and how many votes such persons may cast, the company may specify in the notice of the meeting a time, not more than 48 hours before the time of the meeting, by which a person who holds shares in registered form must be entered on the company's register of members in order to have the right to attend or vote at the meeting or to appoint a proxy to do so.\n\nHolders on record of ordinary shares may appoint a proxy, including a beneficial owner of those shares, to attend, speak and vote on their behalf at any shareholders' meeting, provided that a duly completed proxy form is received not less than 48 hours (or such shorter time as the directors may determine) before the time of the meeting or adjourned meeting or, where the poll is to be taken after the date of the meeting, not less than 24 hours (or such shorter time as the directors may determine) before the time of the poll.\n\nRecord holders of bp ADSs are also entitled to attend, speak and vote at any shareholders' meeting of bp by the appointment by the approved depositary, JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A., of them as proxies in respect of the ordinary shares represented by their ADSs. Each such proxy may also appoint a proxy. Alternatively, holders of bp ADSs are entitled to vote by supplying their voting instructions to the depositary, who will vote the ordinary shares represented by their ADSs in accordance with their instructions.\n\nProxies may be delivered electronically.\n\nCorporations who are members of the company may appoint one or more persons to act as their representative or representatives at any shareholders' meeting provided that the company may require a corporate representative to produce a certified copy of the resolution appointing them before they are permitted to exercise their powers.\n\nMatters are transacted at shareholders' meetings by the proposing and passing of resolutions, of which there are two types: ordinary or special.\n\nAn ordinary resolution requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes of those persons voting at a meeting at which there is a quorum. A special resolution requires the affirmative vote of not less than three quarters of the persons voting at a meeting at which there is a quorum. Any AGM requires 21 clear days' notice. The notice period for any other general meeting is 14 clear days subject to the company obtaining annual shareholder approval, failing which, a 21 clear day notice period will apply.",

        "page_content": "## Liquidation rights; redemption provisions\n\nIn the event of a liquidation of bp, after payment of all liabilities and applicable deductions under UK laws and subject to the payment of secured creditors, the holders of bp preference shares would be entitled to the sum of (1) the capital paid up on such shares plus, (2) accrued and unpaid dividends and (3) a premium equal to the higher of (a) 10%  of the capital paid up on the bp preference shares and (b) the excess of the average market price over par value of such shares on the LSE during the previous six months. The remaining assets (if any) would be divided pro rata among the holders of ordinary shares.\n\nWithout prejudice to any special rights previously conferred on the holders of any class of shares, bp may issue any share with such preferred, deferred or other special rights, or subject to such restrictions as the shareholders by resolution determine (or, in the absence of any such resolutions, by determination of the directors), and may issue shares that are to be or may be redeemed.\n\n## Variation of rights\n\nThe rights attached to any class of shares may be varied with the consent in writing of holders of 75%  of the shares of that class or on the adoption of a special resolution passed at a separate meeting of the holders of the shares of that class. At every such separate meeting, all of the provisions of the Articles of Association relating to proceedings at a general meeting apply, except that the quorum with respect to a meeting to change the rights attached to the preference shares is 10%  or more of the shares of that class, and the quorum to change the rights attached to the ordinary shares is one third or more of the shares of that class.\n\n## Shareholders' meetings and notices\n\nShareholders must provide bp with a postal or electronic address in the UK to be entitled to receive notice of shareholders' meetings. Holders of bp ADSs are entitled to receive notices under the terms of the deposit agreement relating to bp ADSs. The substance and timing of notices are described above under the heading Voting rights.\n\nUnder the Act, the AGM of shareholders must be held once every year, within each six month period beginning with the day following the company's accounting reference date. All general meetings shall be held at a time and place determined by the directors. If any shareholders' meeting is adjourned for lack of quorum, notice of the time and place of the adjourned meeting may be given in any lawful manner, including electronically. Powers exist for action to be taken either before or at the meeting by authorized officers to ensure its orderly conduct and safety of those attending.\n\nThe directors have power to convene a general meeting which is a hybrid meeting, that is to provide facilities for shareholders to attend a meeting which is being held at a physical place by electronic means as well (but not to convene a purely electronic meeting).\n\nThe provisions of the Articles of Association in relation to satellite meetings permit facilities being provided by electronic means to allow those persons at each place to participate in the meeting.\n\n## Limitations on voting and shareholding\n\nThere are no limitations, either under the laws of the UK or under the company's Articles of Association, restricting the right of non-resident or foreign owners to hold or vote bp ordinary or preference shares in the company other than limitations that would generally apply to all of the shareholders and limitations applicable to certain countries and persons subject to EU economic sanctions or those sanctions adopted by the UK government which implement resolutions of the Security Council of the United Nations.\n\n## Disclosure of interests in shares\n\nThe Act permits a public company to give notice to any person whom the company believes to be or, at any time during the three years prior to the issue of the notice, to have been interested in its voting shares requiring them to disclose certain information with respect to those interests. Failure to supply the information required may lead to disenfranchisement of the relevant shares and a prohibition on their transfer and receipt of dividends and other payments in respect of those shares and any new shares in the company issued in respect of those shares. In this context the term 'interest' is widely defined and will generally include an interest of any kind whatsoever in voting shares, including any interest of a holder of bp ADSs.\n\n## Called-up share capital\n\nDetails of the allotted, called-up and fully-paid share capital at 31 December 2020 are set out in Financial statements - Note 31. In accordance with institutional investor guidelines, the company deems it appropriate to grant authority to the directors to allot shares and other securities and to disapply pre-emption rights by way of shareholders' resolutions at each AGM in place of authority granted by virtue of the company's Articles of Association. At the AGM on 27 May 2020, authorization was given to the directors to allot shares in the company and to grant rights to subscribe for, or to convert any\n\nsecurity into, shares in the company up to an aggregate nominal amount as set out in the Notice of Meeting 2020. These authorities were given for the period until the next AGM in 2021 or 27 August 2021, whichever is the earlier. These authorities are renewed annually at the AGM.\n\n## Company records and service of notice\n\nIn relation to notices not covered by the Act, the reference to notice by advertisement in a national newspaper also includes advertisements via other means such as a public announcement.",

        "page_content": "## Purchases of equity securities by the issuer and affiliated purchasers\n\nIn November 2017 bp began a share repurchase or buyback programme (the programme). The sole purpose of the programme was to reduce the issued share capital of the company to offset the ongoing dilutive effect of scrip dividends over time, as announced by the company on 31 October 2017. In January 2020 the share dilution buyback programme had fully offset the impact of scrip dilution since the third quarter 2017. Authorization for the company to make market purchases (as defined in section 693(4) of the Companies Act 2006) of ordinary shares with a nominal value of $0.25 each in the company was renewed at the company's 2020 AGM covering the period until the date of the company's 2021 AGM or 27 August 2021, whichever is earlier. The maximum number of ordinary shares to be purchased under this authority will not exceed 2,025,610,110 ordinary shares. The shares purchased will be cancelled.\n\nThe following table provides details of ordinary share purchases made (1) under the programme and (2) by the Employee Share Ownership Plans (ESOPs) and other

Any linkage between the above targets and executive remuneration.\n- (3) Progress reporting: an annual review of progress against (1) and (2) above.\n\nSuch disclosure and reporting to include the criteria and summaries of the methodology and core assumptions used, and to omit commercially confidential or competitively sensitive information and be prepared at reasonable cost; and provided that nothing in this resolution shall limit the company's powers to set and vary its strategy, or associated targets or metrics, or to take any action which it believes in good faith, would best promote the long-term success of the company.\n\n## The Paris goals\n\n- (1) Article 2.1(a) of the Paris Agreement states the goal of 'Holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, recognizing that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change'.\n- (2) Article 4.1 of the Paris Agreement: In order to achieve the long-term temperature goal set out in Article 2, parties aim to reach global peaking of greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible, recognizing that peaking will take longer for developing country parties, and to undertake rapid reductions thereafter in accordance with best available science, so as to achieve a balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases in the second half of this century, on the basis of equity, and in the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty.\n- (3) U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference of Parties, Twenty-First Session, Adoption of the Paris Agreement, U.N. Doc. FCCC/CP/2015/L.9/Rev.1 (Dec. 12, 2015).\n\n## New material capex investment\n\nFor the purposes of the 2020 evaluation discussed on pages 28-32, 'new material capex investment' means a decision taken by the resource commitment meeting (RCM) in 2020 to incur inorganic or organic investments greater than $250 million that relate to a new project or asset, extending an existing project or asset, or acquiring or increasing a share in a project, asset or entity.\n\nThere were three investments that met the above criteria in 2020.\n\n## Material capex evaluation: Paris-consistency quantitative tests.\n\nFor the purposes of evaluating material capex investments for consistency with the Paris goals, two quantitative tests were applied, see page 32.\n\n- 1. Operational carbon intensity (CI)\n\nThe annual average operational GHG emissions (TeCO2e/unit), divided by the relevant unit of output:\n\n- \u00b7 per thousand barrels of oil equivalent in Upstream\n- \u00b7 per utilized equivalent distillation capacity in refining\n- \u00b7 per thousand tonnes in petrochemicals.\n\n## Net zero aims and ambition glossary\n\n## Net zero\n\nReferences to global net zero in the phrase, 'to help the world get to net zero', means achieving '...a balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases...on the basis of equity, and in the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty', as set out in Article 4(1) of the Paris Agreement.\n\nReferences to net zero for bp in the context of our ambition and Aims 1 and 2 as set out on page 49 (such as 'be a net zero company by 2050 or sooner'), means achieving a balance between (a) the relevant Scope 1 and 2 emissions (for our Aim 1), or Scope 3 emissions (for our Aim 2), and (b) the aggregate of applicable deductions from qualifying activities such as sinks under our methodology at the applicable time.\n\n## Emissions from the carbon in our Upstream oil and gas production\n\nEstimated CO2 emissions from the combustion of upstream production of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGLs) on a bp equity-share basis based on bp's net share of production, excluding bp's share of Rosneft production and assuming that all produced volumes undergo full stoichiometric combustion to CO2.\n\n## Average emissions intensity of marketed energy products\n\nThe weighted average GHG emissions per unit of energy delivered (in grams CO2e/MJ), estimated in respect of marketing sales of energy products. GHG emissions are estimated on a lifecycle basis covering production, distribution and use of the relevant products (assuming full stoichiometric combustion of the product to CO2).\n\n## Methane intensity\n\nMethane intensity refers to the amount of methane emissions from bp's operated upstream oil and gas assets as a percentage of the total gas that goes to market from those operations. Our methodology is aligned with the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative's (OGCI).\n\n## Sustainable emissions reductions (SER)\n\nSERs result from actions or interventions that have led to ongoing reductions in Scope 1 (direct) and/or Scope 2 (indirect) greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (carbon dioxide and methane) such that GHG emissions would have been higher in the reporting year if the intervention had not taken place. SERs must meet three criteria:  a specific intervention that has reduced GHG emissions, the reduction must be quantifiable and the reduction is expected to be ongoing. Reductions are reportable for a 12month period from the start of the intervention/action.\n\n## Adjusted EBIDA\n\nNon-GAAP measure. Adjusted EBIDA is defined as underlying replacement cost profit before interest and tax, add back depreciation, depletion and amortization and exploration expenditure written-off (net of non-operating items), less taxation on an underlying RC basis. bp believes that adjusted EBIDA is a useful measure for investors because it is a measure closely tracked by management to evaluate bp's operating performance and to make financial, strategic and operating decisions and because it may help investors to understand and evaluate, in the same manner as management, the underlying trends in bp's operational performance on a comparable basis, period on period. The nearest equivalent measure on an IFRS basis is profit or loss before interest and tax. Adjusted EBIDA per share is calculated based on the shares in issue at period-end.\n\n## Adjusted effective tax rate (ETR)\n\nNon-GAAP measure. The adjusted ETR is calculated by dividing taxation on an underlying replacement cost (RC) basis excluding the impact of reductions in the rate of the UK North Sea supplementary charge in 2016 by underlying RC profit or loss before tax. Taxation on an underlying RC basis is taxation on a RC basis for the period adjusted for taxation on nonoperating items and fair value accounting effects, and certain foreign exchange impacts on the group's tax charge for the period. Information on underlying RC profit or loss is provided below. bp believes it is helpful to disclose the adjusted ETR because this measure may help investors to understand and evaluate, in the same manner as management, the underlying trends in bp's operational performance on a comparable basis, period on period. The nearest equivalent measure on an IFRS basis is the ETR on profit or loss for the period. A reconciliation to GAAP information is provided on page 348.\n\n## Associate\n\nAn entity over which the group has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor a joint arrangement of the group. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.\n\n## Bioenergy production\n\nBioenergy production is average thousands of barrels of biofuel production per day during the period covered, net to bp. This includes equivalent ethanol production, bp Bunge biopower for grid export, biogas and refining co-processing and standalone hydrogenated vegetable oil (HVO).",

        "page_content": "## Brent\n\nA trading classification for North Sea crude oil that serves as a major benchmark price for purchases of oil worldwide.\n\n## Capital expenditure\n\nTotal cash capital expenditure as stated in the group cash flow statement.\n\n## Castrol sales and other operating revenues\n\nCastrol sales and other operating revenues, are sales and other operating revenues generated by our Castrol business.\n\n## Commodity trading contracts\n\nbp participates in regional and global commodity trading markets in order to manage, transact and hedge the crude oil, refined products and natural gas that the group either produces or consumes in its manufacturing operations. The range of contracts the group enters into in its commodity trading operations is described below. Using these contracts, in combination with rights to access storage and transportation capacity, allows the group to access advantageous pricing differences between locations, time periods and grades.\n\n## Exchange-traded commodity derivatives\n\nContracts that are typically in the form of futures and options traded on a recognized exchange, such as Nymex and ICE. Such contracts are traded in standard specifications for the main marker crude oils, such as Brent and West Texas Intermediate; the main product grades, such as gasoline and gasoil; and for natural gas and power. Gains and losses, otherwise referred to as variation margin, are generally settled on a daily basis with the relevant exchange. These contracts are used for the trading and risk management of crude oil, refined products, and natural gas and power. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on exchange-traded commodity derivatives are included in sales and other operating revenues for accounting purposes.\n\n## Over-the-counter (OTC) contracts\n\nContracts that are typically in the form of forwards, swaps and options. Some of these contracts are traded bilaterally between counterparties or through brokers, others may be cleared by a central clearing counterparty. These contracts can be used both for trading and risk management activities. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on OTC contracts are included in sales and other operating revenues for accounting purposes. Many grades of crude oil bought and sold use standard contracts including US domestic light sweet crude oil, commonly referred to as West Texas Intermediate, and a standard North Sea crude blend - Brent, Forties, Oseberg and Ekofisk (BFOE). Forward contracts are used in connection with the purchase of crude oil supplies for refineries and for marketing and sales of the group's oil production and refined products. The contracts typically contain standard delivery and settlement terms. These transactions call for physical delivery of oil with consequent operational and price risk. However, various means exist and are used from time to time, to settle obligations under the contracts in cash rather than through physical delivery. Physically settled BFOE contracts delivered by cargo additionally specify a standard volume and tolerance.\n\nGas and power OTC markets are highly developed in North America and the UK, where commodities can be bought and sold for delivery in future periods. These contracts are negotiated between two parties to purchase and sell gas and power at a specified price, with delivery and settlement at a future date. Typically, the contracts specify delivery terms for the underlying commodity. Some of these transactions are not settled physically as they can be net settled by transacting offsetting sale or purchase contracts for the same location and delivery period. The contracts contain standard terms such as delivery point, pricing mechanism, settlement terms and specification of the commodity. Typically, volume, price and term (e.g. daily, monthly and balance of month) are the main variable contract terms.\n\nSwaps are typically contractual obligations to exchange cash flows between two parties. A typical swap transaction usually references a floating price and a fixed price with the net difference of the cash flows being settled. Options give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell crude, oil products, natural gas or power at a specified price on or before a specific future date. Amounts under these derivative financial instruments are settled at expiry. Typically, netting agreements are used to limit credit exposure and support liquidity.\n\n## Spot and term contracts\n\nSpot contracts are contracts to purchase or sell a commodity at the market price prevailing on or around the delivery date when title to the inventory is taken. Term contracts are contracts to purchase or sell a commodity at regular intervals over an agreed term. Though spot and term contracts may have a standard form, there is no offsetting mechanism in place. As such, these transactions result in physical delivery with operational and price risk. Spot and term contracts typically relate to purchases of crude for a refinery, products for marketing, or third-party natural gas, or sales of the group's oil production, oil products or gas production to third parties. For accounting purposes, spot and term sales are included in sales and other operating revenues when title passes. Similarly, spot and term purchases are included in purchases for accounting purposes.\n\n## Consolidation adjustment - UPII\n\nUnrealized profit in inventory arising on inter-segment transactions.\n\n## Convenience gross margin\n\nNon-GAAP measure. Convenience gross margin comprises store gross margin as well as other merchandise and service contribution, not considered as retail fuels or store gross margin, received from the retail service stations operated under a bp brand, excluding equity-accounted entities.\n\n## Convenience, retail fuels and electrification gross margin\n\nNon-GAAP measure. Convenience, retail fuels and electrification gross margin is RC profit before interest and tax for Downstream, adjusted for non-operating items and fair value accounting effects to derive underlying RC profit before interest and tax. Downstream underlying RC profit before interest and tax is further adjusted by subtracting underlying RC profit before interest and tax for the petrochemicals, refining and trading and lubricants businesses; adding-back depreciation, depletion and amortization, production and manufacturing, distribution and administration expenses for fuels (excluding refining and trading); subtracting earnings from equity-accounted entities in fuels (excluding refining and trading) and gross margin for aviation, B2B and midstream businesses.\n\nMargin share for convenience and electrification is the ratio of convenience and electrification gross margin to total consumer energy (retail fuels and electrification) and convenience gross margin.\n\nbp believes it is helpful to disclose the margin share from convenience and electrification because this measure may help investors to understand and evaluate, in the same way as management, our progress against our strategic objectives of redefining convenience and scaling up our next-gen mobility solutions. The nearest GAAP measures of the numerator and denominator are RC profit before interest and tax. A reconciliation to GAAP information is provided on page 318.\n\nWe are unable to present forward-looking information of the nearest GAAP measures of the numerator and denominator for margin share for convenience and electrification, because without unreasonable efforts, we are unable to forecast accurately certain adjusting items required to calculate a meaningful comparable GAAP forward-looking financial measure. These items include inventory holding gains or losses, that is difficult to predict in advance in order to include in a GAAP estimate.\n\n## Cumulative cash costs reductions\n\nNon-GAAP measure. Cash costs are a subset of production and manufacturing expenses plus distribution and administration expenses and they exclude costs that are classified as non-operating items. They represent the substantial majority of the remaining expenses in these line items but exclude certain costs that are variable, primarily with volumes (such as freight costs). Management believes that cash costs is a performance measure that provides investors with useful information regarding the company's financial performance, because it considers these expenses to be the principal operating and overhead expenses that are most directly under their control although they also include certain foreign exchange and commodity price effects. Cumulative cash cost reductions in 2021 compared to 2019, as applicable to the directors' remuneration usage, are further defined as 2021 exit rate, less agreed portfolio changes compared to 2019 baseline.",

These include transactions involving fuel and/or convenience across all channels of trade.\n\n## Developed renewables to final investment decision (FID)\n\nTotal generating capacity for assets developed to FID by all entities where bp has an equity share (proportionate to equity share). If asset is subsequently sold bp will continue to record capacity as developed to FID. If bp equity share increases developed capacity to FID will increase proportionately to share increase for any assets where bp held equity at the point of FID.\n\n## Divestment proceeds\n\nDisposal proceeds as per the group cash flow statement.\n\n## Dividend yield\n\nSum of the four quarterly dividends announced in respect of the year as a percentage of the year-end share price.\n\n## Effective tax rate (ETR) on replacement cost (RC) profit or loss\n\nNon-GAAP measure. The ETR on RC profit or loss is calculated by dividing taxation on a RC basis by RC profit or loss before tax. Information on RC profit or loss is provided below. bp believes it is helpful to disclose the ETR on RC profit or loss because this measure excludes the impact of price changes on the replacement of inventories and allows for more meaningful comparisons between reporting periods. The nearest equivalent measure on an IFRS basis is the ETR on profit or loss for the period. A reconciliation to GAAP information is provided on page 348.\n\n## Electric vehicle charge points\n\nDefined as charge points operated by either bp or a bp joint venture.\n\n## Fair value accounting effects\n\nNon-GAAP adjustments to our IFRS profit or loss. We use derivative instruments to manage the economic exposure relating to inventories above normal operating requirements of crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products. Under IFRS, these inventories are recorded at historical cost. The related derivative instruments, however, are required to be recorded at fair value with gains and losses recognized in the income statement. This is because hedge accounting is either not permitted or not followed, principally due to the impracticality of effectiveness-testing requirements. Therefore, measurement differences in relation to recognition of gains and losses occur. Gains and losses on these inventories are not recognized until the commodity is sold in a subsequent accounting period. Gains and losses on the related derivative commodity contracts are recognized in the income statement, from the time the derivative commodity contract is entered into, on a fair value basis using forward prices consistent with the contract maturity.\n\nbp enters into physical commodity contracts to meet certain business requirements, such as the purchase of crude for a refinery or the sale of bp's gas production. Under IFRS these physical contracts are treated as derivatives and are required to be fair valued when they are managed as part of a larger portfolio of similar transactions. Gains and losses arising are recognized in the income statement from the time the derivative commodity contract is entered into.\n\nIFRS require that inventory held for trading is recorded at its fair value using period-end spot prices, whereas any related derivative commodity instruments are required to be recorded at values based on forward prices consistent with the contract maturity. Depending on market conditions, these forward prices can be either higher or lower than spot prices, resulting in measurement differences.\n\nbp enters into contracts for pipelines and other transportation, storage capacity, oil and gas processing and liquefied natural gas (LNG) that, under IFRS, are recorded on an accruals basis. These contracts are riskmanaged using a variety of derivative instruments that are fair valued under IFRS. This results in measurement differences in relation to recognition of gains and losses.\n\nThe way that bp manages the economic exposures described above, and measures performance internally, differs from the way these activities are measured under IFRS. bp calculates this difference for consolidated entities by comparing the IFRS result with management's internal measure of performance. Under management's internal measure of performance the inventory, transportation and capacity contracts in\n\nquestion are valued based on fair value using relevant forward prices prevailing at the end of the period. The fair values of derivative instruments used to risk manage certain oil, gas and other contracts, are deferred to match with the underlying exposure and the commodity contracts for business requirements are accounted for on an accruals basis. We believe that disclosing management's estimate of this difference provides useful information for investors because it enables investors to see the economic effect of these activities as a whole.\n\nFair value accounting effects also include changes in the fair value of the near-term portions of LNG contracts that fall within bp's risk management framework. LNG contracts are not considered derivatives, because there is insufficient market liquidity, and they are therefore accrual accounted under IFRS. However, oil and natural gas derivative financial instruments (used to risk manage the near-term portions of the LNG contracts) are fair valued under IFRS. The fair value accounting effect reduces timing differences between recognition of the derivative financial instruments used to risk manage the LNG contracts and the recognition of the LNG contracts themselves, which therefore gives a better representation of performance in each period.\n\nIn addition, from 2020 fair value accounting effects include changes in the fair value of derivatives entered into by the group to manage currency exposure and interest rate risks relating to hybrid bonds to their respective first call periods. The hybrid bonds which were issued on 17 June 2020 are classified as equity instruments and were recorded in the balance sheet at that date at their USD equivalent issued value. Under IFRS these equity instruments are not remeasured from period to period, and do not qualify for application of hedge accounting. The derivative instruments relating to the hybrid bonds, however, are required to be recorded at fair value with mark to market gains and losses recognized in the income statement. Therefore, measurement differences in relation to the recognition of gains and losses occur. The fair value accounting effect, which is reported in the Other businesses and corporate segment, eliminates the fair value gains and losses of these derivative financial instruments that are recognized in the income statement. We believe that this gives a better representation of performance, by more appropriately reflecting the economic effect of these risk management activities, in each period .\n\n## Finance debt ratio\n\nFinance debt ratio is defined as the ratio of finance debt to the total of finance debt plus total equity.\n\n## Free cash flow\n\nOperating cash flow less net cash used in investing activities and lease liability payments included in financing activities, as presented in the group cash flow statement.\n\n## Gearing and net debt\n\nNon-GAAP measures. Net debt is calculated as finance debt, as shown in the balance sheet, plus the fair value of associated derivative financial instruments that are used to hedge foreign currency exchange and interest rate risks relating to finance debt, for which hedge accounting is applied, less cash and cash equivalents. Gearing is defined as the ratio of net debt to the total of net debt plus total equity. bp believes these measures provide useful information to investors. Net debt enables investors to see the economic effect of finance debt, related hedges and cash and cash equivalents in total. Gearing enables investors to see how significant net debt is relative to total equity. The derivatives are reported on the balance sheet within the headings 'Derivative financial instruments'. See Financial statements - Note 27 for information on finance debt, which is the nearest equivalent measure to net debt on an IFRS basis. The nearest equivalent GAAP measure to gearing on an IFRS basis is finance debt ratio.\n\nWe are unable to present reconciliations of forward-looking information for gearing to finance debt ratio, because without unreasonable efforts, we are unable to forecast accurately certain adjusting items required to present a meaningful comparable GAAP forward-looking financial measure. These items include fair value asset (liability) of hedges related to finance debt and cash and cash equivalents, that are difficult to predict in advance in order to include in a GAAP estimate.",

        "page_content": "## Gearing including leases and net debt including leases\n\nNon-GAAP measure. Net debt including leases is calculated as net debt plus lease liabilities, less the net amount of partner receivables and payables relating to leases entered into on behalf of joint operations. Gearing including leases is defined as the ratio of net debt including leases to the total of net debt including leases plus total equity. bp believes these measures provide useful information to investors as they enable investors to understand the impact of the group's lease portfolio on net debt and gearing. See Financial statements - Note 27 for information on finance debt, which is the nearest equivalent measure to net debt including leases on an IFRS basis. The nearest equivalent GAAP measure to gearing including leases on an IFRS basis is finance debt ratio.\n\n## Henry Hub\n\nA distribution hub on the natural gas pipeline system in Erath, Louisiana, that lends its name to the pricing point for natural gas futures contracts traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange and the over-the-counter swaps traded on Intercontinental Exchange.\n\n## Hydrocarbons\n\nLiquids and natural gas. Natural gas is converted to oil equivalent at 5.8 billion cubic feet = 1 million barrels.\n\n## Inorganic capital expenditure\n\nA subset of capital expenditure on a cash basis and is a non-GAAP measure. Inorganic capital expenditure comprises consideration in business combinations and certain other significant investments made by the group. It is reported on a cash basis. bp believes that this measure provides useful information as it allows investors to understand how bp's management invests funds in projects which expand the group's activities through acquisition. Further information and a reconciliation to GAAP information is provided on page 303.\n\n## Inventory holding gains and losses\n\nThe difference between the cost of sales calculated using the replacement cost of inventory and the cost of sales calculated on the firstin first-out (FIFO) method after adjusting for any changes in provisions where the net realizable value of the inventory is lower than its cost. Under the FIFO method, which we use for IFRS reporting, the cost of inventory charged to the income statement is based on its historical cost of purchase or manufacture, rather than its replacement cost. In volatile energy markets, this can have a significant distorting effect on reported income. The amounts disclosed represent the difference between the charge to the income statement for inventory on a FIFO basis (after adjusting for any related movements in net realizable value provisions) and the charge that would have arisen based on the replacement cost of inventory. For this purpose, the replacement cost of inventory is calculated using data from each operation's production and manufacturing system, either on a monthly basis, or separately for each transaction where the system allows this approach. The amounts disclosed are not separately reflected in the financial statements as a gain or loss. No adjustment is made in respect of the cost of inventories held as part of a trading position and certain other temporary inventory positions. See Replacement cost (RC) profit or loss definition below.\n\n## Joint arrangement\n\nAn arrangement in which two or more parties have joint control.\n\n## Joint control\n\nContractually agreed sharing of control over an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.\n\n## Joint operation\n\nA joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement.\n\n## Joint venture\n\nA joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the arrangement.\n\n## Liquids\n\nComprises crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids. For the Upstream segment, it also includes bitumen.\n\n## LNG portfolio\n\nLNG portfolio refers to bp group's LNG equity production plus additional long-term merchant LNG volumes.\n\n## LNG train\n\nAn LNG train is a processing facility used to liquefy and purify natural gas in the formation of LNG.\n\n## Low carbon energy / low carbon technologies\n\nLow carbon (renewable) electricity; bio-energy; electrification; future mobility solutions; carbon capture, use and storage (CCUS); 'blue' or 'green' hydrogen; and trading in low carbon products. Note that, while there is some overlap, these terms do not mean the same as bp's strategic focus area of 'low carbon electricity and energy'.\n\n## Low carbon investment / investment in low carbon energy / investment in low carbon\n\nCapital expenditure on low carbon energy or technologies.\n\n## Low carbon and other energy transition activities\n\nLow carbon energy / technologies as described above, together with convenience; integrated gas and power; bp Ventures and Launchpad.\n\n## Major projects\n\nHave a bp net investment of at least $250 million, or are considered to be of strategic importance to bp or of a high degree of complexity.\n\n## Margin share for convenience and electrification\n\nNon-GAAP measure. See Convenience, retail fuels and electrification gross margin definition.\n\n## Non-operating items\n\nCharges and credits are included in the financial statements that bp discloses separately because it considers such disclosures to be meaningful and relevant to investors. They are items that management considers not to be part of underlying business operations and are disclosed in order to enable investors better to understand and evaluate the group's reported financial performance. Non-operating items within equity-accounted earnings are reported net of incremental income tax reported by the equity-accounted entity. An analysis of non-operating items by segment and type is shown on page 304.\n\n## Operating cash flow\n\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities as stated in the group cash flow statement. When used in the context of a segment rather than the group, the terms refer to the segment's share thereof.\n\n## Operating cash flow excluding Gulf of Mexico oil spill payments\n\nNon-GAAP measure. It is calculated by excluding post-tax operating cash flows relating to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill from net cash provided by operating activities as reported in the group cash flow statement. bp believes net cash provided by operating activities excluding amounts related to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill is a useful measure as it allows for more meaningful comparisons between reporting periods. The nearest equivalent measure on an IFRS basis is net cash provided by operating activities.\n\n## Operating management system (OMS)\n\nbp's OMS helps us manage risks in our operating activities by setting out bp's principles for good operating practice. It brings together bp requirements on health, safety, security, the environment, social responsibility and operational reliability, as well as related issues, such as maintenance, contractor relations and organizational learning, into a common management system.\n\n## Organic capital expenditure\n\nA subset of capital expenditure on a cash basis and is a non-GAAP measure. Organic capital expenditure comprises capital expenditure less inorganic capital expenditure. bp believes that this measure provides useful information as it allows investors to understand how bp's management invests funds in developing and maintaining the group's assets. An analysis of organic capital expenditure by segment and region, and a reconciliation to GAAP information is provided on page 303.\n\nWe are unable to present reconciliations of forward-looking information for organic capital expenditure to total cash capital expenditure, because without unreasonable efforts, we are unable to forecast accurately the",

        "page_content": "adjusting item, inorganic capital expenditure, that is difficult to predict in advance in order to derive the nearest GAAP estimate.\n\n## Production-sharing agreement / contract (PSA / PSC)\n\nAn arrangement through which an oil and gas company bears the risks and costs of exploration, development and production. In return, if exploration is successful, the oil company receives entitlement to variable physical volumes of hydrocarbons, representing recovery of the costs incurred and a stipulated share of the production remaining after such cost recovery.\n\n## Readily marketable inventory (RMI)\n\nRMI is inventory held and price risk-managed by our integrated supply and trading function (IST) which could be sold to generate funds if required. It comprises oil and oil products for which liquid markets are available and excludes inventory which is required to meet operational requirements and other inventory which is not price risk-managed. RMI is reported at fair value. Inventory held by the Downstream fuels business for the purpose of sales and marketing, and all inventories relating to the lubricants and petrochemicals businesses, are not included in RMI. bp believes that disclosing the amounts of RMI and paid-up RMI is useful to investors as it enables them to better understand and evaluate the group's inventories and liquidity position by enabling them to see the level of discretionary inventory held by IST and to see builds or releases of liquid trading inventory.\n\nPaid-up RMI excludes RMI which has not yet been paid for. For inventory that is held in storage, a first-in first-out (FIFO) approach is used to determine whether inventory has been paid for or not. Unpaid RMI is RMI which has not yet been paid for by bp. RMI at fair value, Paid-up RMI and Unpaid RMI are non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of total inventory as reported on the group balance sheet to paid-up RMI is provided on page 349.\n\n## Realizations\n\nRealizations are the result of dividing revenue generated from hydrocarbon sales, excluding revenue generated from purchases made for resale and royalty volumes, by revenue generating hydrocarbon production volumes. Revenue generating hydrocarbon production reflects the bp share of production as adjusted for any production which does not generate revenue. Adjustments may include losses due to shrinkage, amounts consumed during processing, and contractual or regulatory host committed volumes such as royalties. For the Upstream segment, realizations include transfers between businesses.\n\n## Refining availability\n\nRepresents Solomon Associates' operational availability for bp-operated refineries, which is defined as the percentage of the year that a unit is available for processing after subtracting the annualized time lost due to turnaround activity and all planned mechanical, process and regulatory downtime.\n\n## Refining marker margin (RMM)\n\nThe average of regional indicator margins weighted for bp's crude refining capacity in each region. Each regional marker margin is based on product yields and a marker crude oil deemed appropriate for the region. The regional indicator margins may not be representative of the margins achieved by bp in any period because of bp's particular refinery configurations and crude and product slate.\n\n## Replacement cost (RC) profit or loss\n\nReflects the replacement cost of inventories sold in the period and is arrived at by excluding inventory holding gains and losses from profit or loss. RC profit or loss is the measure of profit or loss that is required to be disclosed for each operating segment under IFRS. RC profit or loss for the group is a non-GAAP measure. Management believes this measure is useful to illustrate to investors the fact that crude oil and product prices can vary significantly from period to period and that the impact on our reported result under IFRS can be significant. Inventory holding gains and losses vary from period to period due to changes in prices as well as changes in underlying inventory levels. In order for investors to understand the operating performance of the group excluding the impact of price changes on the replacement of inventories, and to make comparisons of operating performance between reporting periods, bp's management believes it is helpful to disclose this measure. The nearest equivalent measure on an IFRS basis is profit or loss attributable to bp\n\nshareholders. See Financial statements - Note 5. A reconciliation to GAAP information is provided on page 302.\n\n## RC profit or loss per share\n\nNon-GAAP measure. Earnings per share is defined in Financial statements - Note 11. RC profit or loss per share is calculated using the same denominator. The numerator used is RC profit or loss attributable to bp shareholders rather than profit or loss attributable to bp shareholders. bp believes it is helpful to disclose the RC profit or loss per share because this measure excludes the impact of price changes on the replacement of inventories and allows for more meaningful comparisons between reporting periods. The nearest equivalent measure on an IFRS basis is basic earnings per share based on profit or loss for the period attributable to bp shareholders. A reconciliation to GAAP information is provided on page 348.\n\n## Renewables pipeline\n\nRenewable projects satisfying criteria below to the point they can be considered developed to FID :\n\nSite based projects have obtained land exclusivity rights, or for PPA based projects an offer has been made to the counterparty, or for auction projects pre-qualification criteria has been met, or for acquisition projects post a binding offer being accepted.\n\n## Reserves replacement ratio\n\nThe extent to which the year's production has been replaced by proved reserves added to our reserve base. The ratio is expressed in oilequivalent terms and includes changes resulting from discoveries, improved recovery and extensions and revisions to previous estimates, but excludes changes resulting from acquisitions and disposals.\n\n## Retail sites\n\nRetail sites include sites operated by dealers, jobbers, franchisees or brand licensees or joint venture (JV) partners, under the bp brand. These may move to and from the bp brand as their fuel supply agreement or brand licence agreement expires and are renegotiated in the normal course of business. Retail sites are primarily branded bp , ARCO , Amoco , Aral and Thorntons , and also includes sites in India through our Jio-bp JV.\n\n## Retail sites in growth markets\n\nThese are retail sites that are either bp branded or co-branded with our partners in China, Mexico and Indonesia and also include sites in India through our Jio-bp JV.\n\n## Return on average capital employed\n\nNon-GAAP measure. Return on average capital employed (ROACE) is underlying replacement cost profit, after adding back non-controlling interest and interest expense net of tax (for 2016 and 2017 interest expense was net of notional tax at an assumed 35%), divided by average capital employed (total equity plus finance debt), excluding cash and cash equivalents and goodwill. Interest expense is finance costs excluding lease interest and the unwinding of the discount on provisions and other payables before tax. bp believes it is helpful to disclose the ROACE because this measure gives an indication of the company's capital efficiency. The nearest GAAP measures of the numerator and denominator are profit or loss for the period attributable to bp shareholders and total equity respectively. The reconciliation of the numerator and denominator is provided on page 349.\n\nWe are unable to present forward-looking information of the nearest GAAP measures of the numerator and denominator for ROACE, because without unreasonable efforts, we are unable to forecast accurately certain adjusting items required to calculate a meaningful comparable GAAP forward-looking financial measure. These items include inventory holding gains or losses and interest net of tax, that are difficult to predict in advance in order to include in a GAAP estimate.\n\n## Strategic convenience sites\n\nStrategic convenience sites are retail sites, within the bp portfolio, which both sell bp branded fuel and carry one of the strategic convenience brands (e.g. M&S, Rewe to Go). To be considered a strategic convenience brand the convenience offer should be a strategic differentiator in the market in which it operates. Strategic convenience site count includes sites under a pilot phase.",

Control of an investee exists when an investor is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.\n\n## Surplus cash\n\nSurplus cash refers to surplus of sources of cash including operating cash flow, joint venture loan repayments and divestment proceeds, over uses, including leases, Gulf of Mexico oil spill payments, hybrid servicing costs, dividend payments and cash capital expenditure.\n\n## Tier 1 and tier 2 process safety events\n\nTier 1 events are losses of primary containment from a process of greatest consequence - causing harm to a member of the workforce, damage to equipment from a fire or explosion, a community impact or exceeding defined quantities. Tier 2 events are those of lesser consequence. These represent reported incidents occurring within bp's operational HSSE reporting boundary. That boundary includes bp's own operated facilities and certain other locations or situations.\n\n## Tight oil and gas\n\nNatural oil and gas reservoirs locked in hard sandstone rocks with low permeability, making the underground formation extremely tight.\n\n## Traded electricity\n\nTraded electricity refers to sales data for physically delivered electricity.\n\n## Transition and low carbon investments\n\nCapital expenditure on low carbon or other energy transition activities.\n\n## UK National Balancing Point\n\nA virtual trading location for sale, purchase and exchange of UK natural gas. It is the pricing and delivery point for the Intercontinental Exchange natural gas futures contract.\n\n## Unconventionals\n\nResources found in geographic accumulations over a large area, that usually present additional challenges to development such as low permeability or high viscosity. Examples include shale gas and oil, coalbed methane, gas hydrates and natural bitumen deposits. These typically require specialized extraction technology such as hydraulic fracturing or steam injection.\n\n## Underlying effective tax rate (ETR)\n\nNon-GAAP measure. The underlying ETR is calculated by dividing taxation on an underlying replacement cost (RC) basis by underlying RC profit or loss before tax. Taxation on an underlying RC basis is taxation on a RC basis for the period adjusted for taxation on non-operating items and fair value accounting effects, and certain foreign exchange impacts on the group's tax charge for the period. Information on underlying RC profit or loss is provided below. bp believes it is helpful to disclose the underlying ETR because this measure may help investors to understand and evaluate, in the same manner as management, the underlying trends in bp's operational performance on a comparable basis, period on period. The nearest equivalent measure on an IFRS basis is the ETR on profit or loss for the period. A reconciliation to GAAP information is provided on page 348.\n\nWe are unable to present reconciliations of forward-looking information for underlying ETR to ETR on profit or loss for the period, because without unreasonable efforts, we are unable to forecast accurately certain adjusting items required to present a meaningful comparable GAAP forward-looking financial measure. These items include the taxation on inventory holding gains and losses, non-operating items and fair value accounting effects, that are difficult to predict in advance in order to include in a GAAP estimate.\n\n## Underlying production\n\nProduction after adjusting for acquisitions and divestments and entitlement impacts in our production-sharing agreements (PSAs). 2021 underlying production, when compared with 2020, is production after adjusting for acquisitions and divestments, curtailments, and entitlement impacts in our production-sharing agreements/contracts and technical service contract.\n\n## Underlying replacement cost (RC) profit or loss\n\nNon-GAAP measure. RC profit or loss after adjusting for non-operating items and fair value accounting effects. Fair value accounting effects are non-GAAP adjustments. See pages 304 and 305 for additional information on the non-operating items and fair value accounting effects that are used to arrive at underlying RC profit or loss in order to enable a full understanding of the events and their financial impact. bp believes that underlying RC profit or loss is a useful measure for investors because it is a measure closely tracked by management to evaluate bp's operating performance and to make financial, strategic and operating decisions and because it may help investors to understand and evaluate, in the same manner as management, the underlying trends in bp's operational performance on a comparable basis, year on year, by adjusting for the effects of these non-operating items and fair value accounting effects.\n\nThe nearest equivalent measure on an IFRS basis for the group is profit or loss for the year attributable to bp shareholders. The nearest equivalent measure on an IFRS basis for segments is RC profit or loss before interest and taxation. A reconciliation to GAAP information is provided on page 302.\n\n## Underlying replacement cost (RC) profit or loss per share\n\nNon-GAAP measure. Earnings per share is defined Financial statements Note 11. Underlying RC profit or loss per share is calculated using the same denominator. The numerator used is underlying RC profit or loss attributable to bp shareholders rather than profit or loss attributable to bp shareholders. bp believes it is helpful to disclose the underlying RC profit or loss per share because this measure may help investors to understand and evaluate, in the same manner as management, the underlying trends in bp's operational performance on a comparable basis, period on period. The nearest equivalent measure on an IFRS basis is basic earnings per share based on profit or loss for the period attributable to bp shareholders. A reconciliation to GAAP information is provided on page 348.\n\n## Upstream plant reliability\n\nbp-operated Upstream plant reliability is calculated taking 100% less the ratio of total unplanned plant deferrals divided by installed production capacity. Unplanned plant deferrals are associated with the topside plant and where applicable the subsea equipment (excluding wells and reservoir). Unplanned plant deferrals include breakdowns, which does not include Gulf of Mexico weather related downtime.\n\n## Upstream unit production costs\n\nUpstream unit production costs are calculated as production costs divided by units of production. Production costs do not include ad valorem and severance taxes. Units of production are barrels for liquids and thousands of cubic feet for gas. Amounts disclosed are for bp subsidiaries only and do not include bp's share of equity-accounted entities.\n\n## West Texas Intermediate (WTI)\n\nA light sweet crude oil, priced at Cushing, Oklahoma, which serves as a benchmark price for purchases of oil in the US.\n\n## Working capital\n\nMovements in inventories and other current and non-current assets and liabilities as stated in the group cash flow statement.\n\n## Trade marks\n\nTrade marks of the bp group appear throughout this report.

A cross reference to Form 20-F requirements is included on page 351.\n\nThis document contains the Strategic report on the inside front cover and pages 1-70 and the Directors' report on pages 71-102, 105 (in part only), 127-128, 231-258 and 301-349. The Strategic report and the Directors' report together include the management report required by DTR 4.1 of the UK Financial Conduct Authority's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules. The Directors' remuneration report is on pages 103-126. The consolidated financial statements of the group are on pages 129-230 and the corresponding reports of the auditor are on pages 130-154. The parent company financial statements of BP p.l.c. are on pages 259-300.\n\nThe Directors' statements (comprising the Statement of directors' responsibilities; Risk management and internal control; Longer-term viability; Going concern; and Fair, balanced and understandable), the independent auditor's report on the annual report and accounts to the members of BP p.l.c., the parent company financial statements of BP p.l.c. and corresponding auditor's report and a non-GAAP measure of operating cash flow excluding Gulf of Mexico oil spill payments \u00ab in the tables on pages 41, 43 and 46 do not form part of bp's Annual Report on Form 20-F as filed with the SEC.\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2020 may be downloaded from bp.com/ annualreport . No material on the bp website, other than the items identified as bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2020 , forms any part of this document. References in this document to other documents on the bp website, such as bp Energy Outlook , bp Sustainability Report , bp Statistical Review of World Energy and bp Technology Outlook are included as an aid to their location and are not incorporated by reference into this document.\n\nBP p.l.c. is the parent company of the bp group of companies. The company was incorporated in 1909 in England and Wales and changed its name to BP p.l.c. in 2001. Where we refer to the company, we mean BP p.l.c. The company and each of its subsidiaries \u00ab are separate legal entities. Unless otherwise stated or the context otherwise requires, the term 'BP' or \"bp\" and terms such as 'we', 'us' and 'our' are used in this report for convenience to refer to one or more of the members of the bp group instead of identifying a particular entity or entities. Information in this document reflects 100% of the assets and operations of the company and its subsidiaries that were consolidated at the date or for the periods indicated, including non-controlling interests.\n\nThe company's primary share listing is the London Stock Exchange. In the US, the company's securities are traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in the form of ADSs (see page 332 for more details) and in Germany in the form of a global depositary certificate representing bp ordinary shares traded on the Frankfurt, Hamburg and Dusseldorf Stock Exchanges.\n\nThe term 'shareholder' in this report means, unless the context otherwise requires, investors in the equity capital of BP p.l.c., both direct and indirect. As the company's shares, in the form of ADSs, are listed on the NYSE, an Annual Report on Form 20-F is filed with the SEC. Ordinary shares are ordinary fully paid shares in BP p.l.c. of 25 cents each. Preference shares are cumulative first preference shares and cumulative second preference shares in BP p.l.c. of \u00a31 each.\n\n| Registered office and                                                          | Our agent in the US:                                                           |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| our worldwide headquarters: BP p.l.c.                                          | BP America Inc.                                                                |\n| 1 St James's Square                                                            | 501 Westlake Park Boulevard                                                    |\n| London SW1Y 4PD                                                                | Houston, Texas 77079                                                           |\n| UK                                                                             | US                                                                             |\n| Tel +44 (0)20 7496 4000                                                        | Tel +1 281 366 2000                                                            |\n| Registered in England and Wales No. 102498.
